''[[Melody Maker]]'' said, \"''Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret''... confronts clubland with its patchy past, rubs perspective in its pretty painted face and acts like it means nothing... Aggressively embarrassing, ''Cabaret'' is the brashest, most brilliant and least-caring indictment of pop music's bankruptcy I've ever heard. No compassion, no sorrow, no joy, it just faces facts and moves to the motions... Like traditional cabaret, the whole thing parodies true emotion and like the best subversive cabaret its shallowness makes those devalued emotions even more painful \u2013 the very real decadence of this album springs from its callous realisation of pop's impotency, and yet its bored resignation to the ritual.\"<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Sutherland |title=Review: Soft Cell \u2013 ''Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret'' |newspaper=Melody Maker |location=London |date=28 November 1981 |page=16 |issn=0025-9012}}</ref> However, ''[[NME]]'' found the album's premise was hollow, complaining that \"the Soft Cell sex strategy should offer something spicy, rude and even a little wonderful... but Soft Cell are conceptualists who rely on too many preconceptions and play around with too many ideas to convince you of any personal energy or commitment...

''[[Melody Maker]]'' said, \"''Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret''... confronts clubland with its patchy past, rubs perspective in its pretty painted face and acts like it means nothing... Aggressively embarrassing, ''Cabaret'' is the brashest, most brilliant and least-caring indictment of pop music's bankruptcy I've ever heard. No compassion, no sorrow, no joy, it just faces facts and moves to the motions... Like traditional cabaret, the whole thing parodies true emotion and like the best subversive cabaret its shallowness makes those devalued emotions even more painful \u2013 the very real decadence of this album springs from its callous realisation of pop's impotency, and yet its bored resignation to the ritual.\"<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Sutherland |title=Review: Soft Cell \u2013 ''Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret'' |newspaper=Melody Maker |location=London |date=28 November 1981 |page=16 |issn=0025-9012}}</ref> However, ''[[NME]]'' found the album's premise was hollow, complaining that \"the Soft Cell sex strategy should offer something spicy, rude and even a little wonderful... but Soft Cell are conceptualists who rely on too many preconceptions and play around with too many ideas to convince you of any personal energy or commitment...

The absence of accurately defined terms or the uses (i.e., actually misuses) of ill-defined terms lead to confusion and proliferation of wrong statements.\"\n</ref> An [[operational definition]] of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted.\n\nThe operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is. It does not address why events can happen forward and backwards in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the [[spacetime]] continuum. [[General Relativity]] is the primary framework for understanding how [[spacetime]] works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted, particularly at the edges of [[black hole]]s.\n\nTemporal measurement has occupied scientists and [[Engineering technologist|technologists]], and was a prime motivation in [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]]. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the [[electronic transition]] [[frequency]] of [[caesium]] atoms (see [[#History of time measurement devices|below]]). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (\"[[Time value of money|time is money]]\") as well as personal value, due to an [[awareness]] of the limited time in each day and in [[life expectancy|human life spans]].\n\n== Temporal measurement ==\nGenerally speaking, methods of temporal measurement, or [[chronometry]], take two distinct forms: the [[calendar]], a mathematical tool for organising intervals of time,<ref name=\"Richards\">{{cite book |title=Mapping Time: The Calendar and its History |last=Richards |first=E. G. |date=1998 |pages=3\u20135 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}\n</ref>\nand the [[clock]], a physical mechanism that counts the passage of time. In day-to-day life, the clock is consulted for periods less than a day whereas the calendar is consulted for periods longer than a day. Increasingly, personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously. The number (as on a clock dial or calendar) that marks the occurrence of a specified event as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch&nbsp;\u2013 a central reference point.\n\n=== History of the calendar ===\n{{Main|Calendar}}\n\nArtifacts from the [[Paleolithic]] suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago.<ref name=\"Rudgley\">{{cite book |title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age |last=Rudgley |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Rudgley |date=1999 |pages=86\u2013105 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York}}\n</ref>\n[[Lunar calendar]]s were among the first to appear, with years of either 12 or 13 [[lunar month]]s (either 354 or 384 days). Without [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] to add days or months to some years, seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months. [[Lunisolar calendar]]s have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year (now known to be about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar months. The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least partly due to this relationship of months to years. Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica, particularly in ancient Mayan civilization. These calendars were religiously and astronomically based, with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month, plus five [[epagomenal]] days at the end of the year.<ref>Van Stone, Mark. \"The Maya Long Count Calendar: An Introduction.\" Archaeoastronomy 24.(2011): 8\u201311. Academic Search Complete. Web. 20 February 2016.</ref>\n\nThe reforms of [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BC put the [[Roman Empire|Roman world]] on a [[solar calendar]]. This [[Julian calendar]] was faulty in that its intercalation still allowed the astronomical [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es to advance against it by about 11 minutes per year. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] introduced a correction in 1582; the [[Gregorian calendar]] was only slowly adopted by different nations over a period of centuries, but it is now by far the most commonly used calendar around the world.\n\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], a new clock and calendar were invented in an attempt to de-Christianize time and create a more rational system in order to replace the Gregorian calendar. The [[French Republican Calendar]]'s days consisted of ten hours of a hundred minutes of a hundred seconds, which marked a deviation from the base 12 ([[duodecimal]]) system used in many other devices by many cultures. The system was abolished in 1806.<ref>\"French Republican Calendar | Chronology.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, n.d.

The T was oriented eastward in the mornings. At noon, the device was turned around so that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.<ref>Barnett, Jo Ellen ''Time's Pendulum: The Quest to Capture Time&nbsp;\u2013 from Sundials to Atomic Clocks'' Plenum, 1998 {{isbn|0-306-45787-3}} p. 28\n</ref>\n\nA [[sundial]] uses a [[gnomon]] to cast a shadow on a set of markings calibrated to the hour. The position of the shadow marks the hour in [[Time zone|local time]]. The idea to separate the day into smaller parts is credited to Egyptians because of their sundials, which operated on a duodecimal system. The importance of the number 12 is due to the number of lunar cycles in a year and the number of stars used to count the passage of night.<ref>Lombardi, Michael A. \"Why Is a Minute Divided into 60 Seconds, an Hour into 60 Minutes, Yet There Are Only 24 Hours in a Day?\" Scientific American.

They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and the people from [[Chaldea]] (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages.<ref>Barnett, ''ibid'', p. 37.</ref> In the 11th century, [[List of Chinese inventions|Chinese inventors]] and [[History of science and technology in China|engineers]] invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an [[escapement]] mechanism.\n\n[[File:Swatch Irony angle below.jpg|thumb|left|A contemporary [[quartz watch]], 2007 ]]\nThe [[hourglass]] uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time.

The passage of the hours at sea were marked by bells, and denoted the time (see [[ship's bell]]). The hours were marked by bells in abbeys as well as at sea.\n\n[[File:ChipScaleClock2 HR.jpg|thumb|Chip-scale [[atomic clock]]s, such as this one unveiled in 2004, are expected to greatly improve [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/miniclock.cfm |title=NIST Unveils Chip-Scale Atomic Clock |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522125607/http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/miniclock.cfm |archivedate=22 May 2011  }}</ref>]]\n\nClocks can range from watches, to more exotic varieties such as the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of means such as a [[pendulum]].\n\nAlarm clocks first appeared in ancient Greece around 250 BC with a water clock that would set off a whistle. This idea was later mechanized by Levi Hutchins and Seth E. Thomas.<ref name=\"Clocks 2016\"/>\n\nA [[chronometer watch|chronometer]] is a portable timekeeper that meets certain precision standards. Initially, the term was used to refer to the [[marine chronometer]], a timepiece used to determine [[longitude]] by means of [[celestial navigation]], a precision firstly achieved by [[John Harrison]]. More recently, the term has also been applied to the [[chronometer watch]], a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency [[COSC]].\n\nThe most accurate timekeeping devices are [[atomic clock]]s, which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=e24ccfa7-44eb-40b7-8b67-daf8263569ff |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211190407/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=e24ccfa7-44eb-40b7-8b67-daf8263569ff |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 February 2012 |title=New atomic clock can keep time for 200 million years: Super-precise instruments vital to deep space navigation |date=16 February 2008 |work=Vancouver Sun |accessdate=9 April 2011}}</ref> and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments.\n\nAtomic clocks use the frequency of [[electronic transition]]s in certain atoms to measure the second. One of the atoms used is [[caesium]], most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n99-22.cf |title=NIST-F1 Cesium Fountain Clock |accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of [[caesium]] atoms.

The earliest known occurrence in English is in [[Byrhtferth]]'s ''Enchiridion'' (a science text) of 1010\u20131012,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Byrhtferth of Ramsey |year=2008 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=15 September 2008 |url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9438957}}</ref> where it was defined as 1/564 of a ''momentum'' (1\u00bd minutes),<ref>\"atom\", [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision September 2008 (contains relevant citations from Byrhtferth's ''Enchiridion'')</ref> and thus equal to 15/94 of a second.

A [[minute]] (min) is 60 seconds in length, and an [[hour]] is 60 minutes or 3600 seconds in length. A day is usually 24 hours or 86,400 seconds in length; however, the duration of a calendar day can vary due to [[Daylight saving time]] and [[Leap second]]s.\n\n== Definitions and standards ==\nThe Mean [[Solar Time]] system defines the second as 1/86,400 of the mean [[solar day]], which is the year-average of the solar day. The solar day is the time interval between two successive solar noons, i.e., the time interval between two successive passages of the Sun across the local meridian. The local meridian is an imaginary line that runs from celestial north pole to celestial south pole passing directly over the head of the observer. At the local meridian the Sun reaches its highest point on its daily arc across the sky.\n\nIn 1874 the British Association for the Advancement of Science introduced the CGS (centimetre/gramme/second system) combining fundamental units of length, mass and time. The second is \"elastic\", because tidal friction is slowing the earth's rotation rate. For use in calculating ephemerides of celestial motion, therefore, in 1952 astronomers introduced the \"ephemeris second\", currently defined as\n\n{{quote|the fraction 1/31,556,925.9747 of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours [[ephemeris time]].<ref>''Whitaker's Almanac 2013'' (ed.

The [[SI base unit]] for time is the [[SI]] second. The [[International System of Quantities]], which incorporates the SI, also defines larger units of time equal to fixed integer multiples of one second (1 s), such as the minute, hour and day. These are not part of the SI, but may be used alongside the SI. Other units of time such as the month and the year are not equal to fixed multiples of 1 s, and instead exhibit significant variations in duration.<ref name=\"si_units\">{{cite book |title=The International System of Units (SI), 7th Edition |url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040427205458/http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 April 2004 |date=1998 |author=Organisation Intergouvernementale de la Convention du M\u00e9tre |accessdate=9 April 2011 }}\n</ref>\n\nThe official SI definition of the second is as follows:<ref name=\"si_units\"/><ref name=\"second\">{{cite web |title=Base unit definitions: Second |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html |publisher=[[NIST]] |accessdate=9 April 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417135428/http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html |archivedate=17 April 2011  }}\n</ref>\n{{quote|The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the [[caesium]] 133 atom.}}\n{{clear left}}\n\nAt its 1997 meeting, the CIPM affirmed that this definition refers to a caesium atom in its ground state at a temperature of 0 K.<ref name=\"si_units\"/>\n\nThe current definition of the second, coupled with the current definition of the meter, is based on the [[special theory of relativity]], which affirms our spacetime to be a [[Minkowski space]]. The definition of the second in mean solar time, however, is unchanged.\n\n=== World time ===\nWhile in theory, the concept of a single worldwide universal time-scale may have been conceived of many centuries ago, in practicality the technical ability to create and maintain such a time-scale did not become possible until the mid-19th century. The timescale adopted was Greenwich Mean Time, created in 1847. A few countries have replaced it with Coordinated Universal Time, [[UTC]].\n\n==== History of the development of UTC ====\nWith the advent of the [[industrial revolution]], a greater understanding and agreement on the nature of time itself became increasingly necessary and helpful. In 1847 in Britain, [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) was first created for use by the British railways, the British navy, and the British shipping industry. Using telescopes, GMT was calibrated to the [[mean solar time]] at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] in the UK.\n\nAs international commerce continued to increase throughout Europe, in order to achieve a more efficiently functioning modern society, an agreed upon, and highly accurate '''''international standard''''' of time measurement became necessary. In order to find or determine such a time-standard, three steps had to be followed:\n# An internationally agreed upon time-standard had to be defined.\n# This new time-standard then had to be consistently and accurately measured.\n# The new time-standard then had to be freely shared and distributed around the world.\n\nThe development of what is now known as [[UTC|UTC time]] began as a collaboration between 41 nations, officially agreed and signed at the [[International Meridian Conference]], in Washington D.C. in 1884. At this conference, the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define the \"universal day\", counted from 0 hours at Greenwich mean midnight. This agreed with the civil Greenwich Mean Time used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast astronomical GMT began at mean noon, i.e. astronomical day ''X'' began at noon of civil day ''X''. The purpose of this was to keep one night's observations under one date. The civil system was adopted as of 0 hours (civil) 1 January 1925. Nautical GMT began 24 hours before astronomical GMT, at least until 1805 in the [[Royal Navy]], but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich meridian was used for two-thirds of all charts and maps as their [[Prime Meridian]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Howse|first1=Derek|title=Greenwich Time and the Longitude|year=1997|publisher=Philip Wilson|location=London|isbn=978-0-85667-468-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/greenwichtimelon0000hows/page/133 133\u2013137]|url=https://archive.org/details/greenwichtimelon0000hows/page/133}}</ref>\n\nAmong the 41 nations represented at the conference, the advanced time-technologies that had already come into use in Britain were fundamental components of the agreed method of arriving at a universal and agreed international time. In 1928 Greenwich Mean Time was rebranded for scientific purposes by the [[International Astronomical Union]] as [[Universal Time]] (UT). This was to avoid confusion with the previous system in which the day had begun at noon. As the general public had always begun the day at midnight, the timescale continued to be presented to them as Greenwich Mean Time. By 1956, universal time had been split into various versions: UT2, which smoothed for polar motion and seasonal effects, was presented to the public as Greenwich Mean Time. Later, UT1 (which smooths only for polar motion) became the default form of UT used by astronomers and hence the form used in navigation, sunrise and sunset and moonrise and moonset tables where the name Greenwich Mean Time continues to be employed. Greenwich Mean Time is also the preferred method of describing the timescale used by legislators. Even to the present day, UT is still based on an international telescopic system. Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system. Because the rotational period of Earth is not perfectly constant, the duration of a second would vary if calibrated to a telescope-based standard like GMT, where the second is defined as 1/86 400 of the mean solar day.\n\nUntil 1960, the methods and definitions of time-keeping that had been laid out at the International Meridian Conference proved to be adequate to meet time tracking needs of science. Still, with the advent of the \"electronic revolution\" in the latter half of the 20th century, the technologies that had been available at the time of the Convention of the Metre proved to be in need of further refinement in order to meet the needs of the ever-increasing precision that the \"electronic revolution\" had begun to require.\n\n==== The ephemeris second ====\nAn invariable second (the \"ephemeris second\") had been defined, use of which removed the errors in ephemerides resulting from the use of the variable mean solar second as the time argument. In 1960 this ephemeris second was made the basis of the \"coordinated universal time\" which was being derived from atomic clocks. It is a specified fraction of the mean tropical year as at 1900 and, being based on historical telescope observations, corresponds roughly to the mean solar second of the early nineteenth century.<ref name=\"USNO\">\n{{cite web |title=Leap Seconds |publisher=Time Service Department, [[United States Naval Observatory]] |url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |accessdate=22 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228195938/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |archivedate=28 February 2012 }}\n</ref>\n\n==== The SI second ====\nIn 1967 a further step was taken with the introduction of the SI second, essentially the ephemeris second as measured by atomic clocks and formally defined in atomic terms.<ref name=mark58>\n{{cite journal |author=W Markowitz, RG Hall, L Essen, JVL Parry |year=1958 |url=http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf |title=Frequency of cesium in terms of ephemeris time |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=105\u2013107 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.1.105 |bibcode=1958PhRvL...1..105M |last2=Hall |last3=Essen |last4=Parry |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019014530/http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2008  }}</ref>\nThe SI second (Standard Internationale second) is based directly on the measurement of the atomic-clock observation of the frequency oscillation of caesium atoms. It is the basis of all atomic timescales, e.g. coordinated universal time, GPS time, International Atomic Time, etc. Atomic clocks do not measure nuclear decay rates, which is a common misconception, but rather measure a certain natural vibrational frequency of caesium-133.<ref>[http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html Cesium Atoms at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223231150/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html |date=23 February 2015 }} USNO, downloaded 28 June 2016.</ref> Coordinated universal time is subject to one constraint which does not affect the other atomic timescales. As it has been adopted as the civil timescale by some countries (most countries have opted to retain mean solar time) it is not permitted to deviate from GMT by more than 0.9 second. This is achieved by the occasional insertion of a leap second.\n\n==== Current application of UTC ====\n\nMost countries use mean solar time. Australia, Canada (Quebec only), Colombia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea (Bougainville only), Paraguay, Portugal, Switzerland, the United States and Venezuela use UTC. However, UTC is widely used by the scientific community in countries where mean solar time is official. [[UTC|UTC time]] is based on the SI second, which was first defined in 1967, and is based on the use of atomic clocks. Some other less used but closely related time-standards include [[International Atomic Time|International Atomic Time (TAI)]], [[Terrestrial Time]], and [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]].\n\nBetween 1967 and 1971, UTC was periodically adjusted by fractional amounts of a second in order to adjust and refine for variations in mean solar time, with which it is aligned. After 1 January 1972, UTC time has been defined as being offset from atomic time by a whole number of seconds, changing only when a [[leap second]] is added to keep radio-controlled clocks synchronized with the rotation of the Earth.\n\nThe [[Global Positioning System]] also broadcasts a very precise time signal worldwide, along with instructions for converting GPS time to UTC. GPS-time is based on, and regularly synchronized with or from, UTC-time.\n\nThe surface of the Earth is split up into a number of [[time zone]]s. Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from GMT. For example, time zones at sea are based on GMT. In many locations (but not at sea) these offsets vary twice yearly due to [[daylight saving time]] transitions.\n\n=== Time conversions ===\nThese conversions are accurate at the millisecond level for time systems based on the rotation of the Earth (UT1 and TT). Conversions between atomic time systems (TAI, GPS, and UTC) are accurate at the microsecond level.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! System\n! Description\n! UT1\n! UTC\n! TT\n! TAI\n!

In [[astronomy]], sidereal time is used to predict when a [[star]] will reach its [[culmination|highest point]] in the sky. Due to [[Earth's orbit]]al motion around the Sun, a mean solar day is about 3 minutes 56 seconds longer than a mean sidereal day, or {{fract|1|366}} more than a mean sidereal day.\n\n=== Chronology ===\n{{Main|Chronology}}\n\nAnother form of time measurement consists of studying the [[past]]. Events in the past can be ordered in a sequence (creating a [[chronology]]), and can be put into chronological groups ([[periodization]]). One of the most important systems of periodization is the [[geologic time scale]], which is a system of periodizing the events that shaped the [[Earth]] and its life. Chronology, periodization, and interpretation of the past are together known as the study of history.\n\n=== Time-like concepts: terminology ===\nThe term \"time\" is generally used for many close but different concepts, including:\n* [[instant]]<ref>IEC 60050-113:2011, item 113-01-08</ref> as an object&nbsp;\u2013 one point on the time axes.

He could not return to cyclic time and re-enter sacred space though its myths. [...] Just here, as Eliade sees it, a new religious structure became available. In the Judaeo-Christian religions \u2013 Judaism, Christianity, Islam \u2013 history is taken seriously, and linear time is accepted. The cyclic time of the primordial mythical consciousness has been transformed into the time of profane man, but the mythical consciousness remains. It has been historicized. The Christian mythos and its accompanying ritual are bound up, for example, with history and center in authentic history, especially the Christ-event. Sacred space, the Transcendent Presence, is thus opened up to secular man because it meets him where he is, in the linear flow of secular time.

In short, an empty space would be a substance with no properties; it will be a substance that even God cannot modify or destroy.... That is, space and time are internal or intrinsic features of the complete concepts of things, not extrinsic.... Leibniz's view has two major implications. First, there is no absolute location in either space or time; location is always the situation of an object or event relative to other objects and events. Second, space and time are not in themselves real (that is, not substances). Space and time are, rather, ideal. Space and time are just metaphysically illegitimate ways of perceiving certain virtual relations between substances. They are phenomena or, strictly speaking, illusions (although they are illusions that are well-founded upon the internal properties of substances).... It is sometimes convenient to think of space and time as something \"out there,\" over and above the entities and their relations to each other, but this convenience must not be confused with reality. Space is nothing but the order of co-existent objects; time nothing but the order of successive events. This is usually called a relational theory of space and time. |accessdate=9 April 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000548/http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H7 |archivedate=14 May 2011  }}\n</ref> and [[Immanuel Kant]],<ref name=Mattey>\n{{cite web |url=http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/TIMELEC.HTM  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314201600/http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/TIMELEC.HTM  |url-status=dead  |archive-date=14 March 2005 |title=Critique of Pure Reason, Lecture notes: Philosophy 175 UC Davis |date=22 January 1997 |last=Mattey |first=G.J. |quote=What is correct in the Leibnizian view was its anti-metaphysical stance.

Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an [[Abstract structure|abstract]] conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence events, [[quantity|quantify]] their duration, and compare the motions of objects. In this view, ''time'' does not refer to any kind of entity that \"flows,\" that objects \"move through,\" or that is a \"container\" for events. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] the extent of and distances between [[object (philosophy)|objects]], and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between [[Phenomenon|events]].

Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of ''having been'', which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes \"being ahead of oneself\" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative.

He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer.\n\nThe theory of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in [[Minkowski space]]time, a mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of space with a single dimension of time. In this formalism, distances in space can be measured by how long light takes to travel that distance, e.g., a [[light-year]] is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Two [[Event (relativity)|events]] in Minkowski spacetime are separated by an ''[[Spacetime interval|invariant interval]]'', which can be either [[space-like]], [[light-like]], or [[time-like]]. Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in any [[frame of reference]], there must be a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation. Events that have a space-like separation will be simultaneous in some frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference in which they do not have a spatial separation. Different observers may calculate different distances and different time intervals between two events, but the ''invariant interval'' between the events is independent of the observer (and his or her velocity).\n\n=== Classical mechanics ===\nIn non-relativistic [[classical mechanics]], Newton's concept of \"relative, apparent, and common time\" can be used in the formulation of a prescription for the synchronization of clocks. Events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works sufficiently well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people's experience. In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism. Einstein resolved these problems by invoking a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity. This led directly to the result that observers in motion relative to one another measure different elapsed times for the same event.\n\n[[File:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|Two-dimensional space depicted in three-dimensional spacetime. The past and future [[light cone]]s are absolute, the \"present\" is a relative concept different for observers in relative motion.]]\n\n=== Spacetime ===\n{{Main|Spacetime}}\nTime has historically been closely related with space, the two together merging into spacetime in [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the [[inertial frame of reference|spatial reference frame of the observer]], and the human perception as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks are different for observers in relative motion. For example, if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through space at (very nearly) the speed of light, its crew does not notice a change in the speed of time on board their vessel because everything traveling at the same speed slows down at the same rate (including the clock, the crew's thought processes, and the functions of their bodies). However, to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly.\n\nOn the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel, because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other. Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the stationary observer) are many light years apart. This is reconciled by the fact that the crew's perception of time is different from the stationary observer's; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer. In either case, however, causality remains unchanged: the [[past]] is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the [[future]] is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9zrt__lec |title=Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity |publisher=YouTube |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182611/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9zrt__lec |archivedate=17 October 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vpw4AH8QQ |title=Time Travel: Einstein's big idea (Theory of Relativity) |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182714/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vpw4AH8QQ |archivedate=17 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\n=== Time dilation ===\n[[File:Relativity of Simultaneity.svg|thumb|[[Relativity of simultaneity]]: Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurred before in the blue frame, and occurs later in the red frame.]]\n{{Main|Time dilation}}\n\n[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on [[Causality (physics)|cause and effect]], measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. [[Subatomic particle]]s exist for a well known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest. According to the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], in the high-speed particle's [[Inertial frame of reference|frame of reference]], it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its [[mean lifetime]], and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \"slow down\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or \"warped\") by high-speed motion.\n\nEinstein (''The Meaning of Relativity''): \"Two [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|events]] taking place at the points A and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relative to K, which register the same simultaneously.\"\n\nEinstein wrote in his book, ''Relativity'', that [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity is also relative]], i.e., two events that appear simultaneous to an observer in a particular inertial reference frame need not be judged as simultaneous by a second observer in a different inertial frame of reference.\n\n=== Relativistic time versus Newtonian time ===\n[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed|Views of spacetime along the [[world line]] of a rapidly accelerating observer in a relativistic universe.

Note how in both pictures the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates.\n\nIn the Newtonian description these changes are such that ''time'' is absolute:<ref>{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 Extract of p. 30]</ref> the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event occurs in the 'now' (i.e., whether an event passes the horizontal line through the observer).\n\nHowever, in the relativistic description the ''observability of events'' is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event passes the \"[[light cone]]\" of the observer. Notice that with the change from a Newtonian to a relativistic description, the concept of ''absolute time'' is no longer applicable: events move up-and-down in the figure depending on the acceleration of the observer.\n\n=== Arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Arrow of time}}\n\nTime appears to have a direction&nbsp;\u2013 the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an [[arrow of time]], and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modelled by a parameter in the system being analysed, where there is no \"proper time\": the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] arrow of time, which points away from the [[Big Bang]], [[CPT symmetry]], and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only travelling forwards in time (see [[light cone]]). In [[particle physics]], the [[CP violation|violation of CP symmetry]] implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve [[CPT symmetry]] as stated above. The standard description of [[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]] is also time asymmetric (see [[Measurement in quantum mechanics]]). The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that [[entropy]] must increase over time (see [[Entropy (arrow of time)|Entropy]]). This can be in either direction \u2013 Brian Greene theorizes that, according to the equations, the change in entropy occurs symmetrically whether going forward or backward in time. So entropy tends to increase in either direction, and our current low-entropy universe is a statistical aberration, in the similar manner as tossing a coin often enough that eventually heads will result ten times in a row. However, this theory is not supported empirically in local experiment.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZujlUD1oAAC |last=Greene |first=Brian |title=The Fabric of the Cosmos|chapter= Chapter 6: Chance and the Arrow |date=2005 |location=London|isbn=978-0-14-195995-5 }}</ref>\n\n=== Quantized time ===\n{{See also|Chronon}}\n\nTime quantization is a hypothetical concept. In the modern established physical theories (the [[Standard Model]] of Particles and Interactions and [[General Relativity]]) time is not quantized.\n\n[[Planck time]] (~ 5.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221244</sup> seconds) is the unit of time in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]]. Current established physical theories are believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in principle. Tentative physical theories that describe this time scale exist; see for instance [[loop quantum gravity]].\n\n== Time travel ==\n{{Main|Time travel}}\n{{See also|Time travel in fiction|Wormhole|Twin paradox}}\n\nTime travel is the concept of moving backwards or forwards to different points in time, in a manner analogous to moving through space, and different from the normal \"flow\" of time to an earthbound observer. In this view, all points in time (including future times) \"persist\" in some way. Time travel has been a [[plot device]] in fiction since the 19th century. Travelling backwards in time has never been verified, presents many theoretical problems, and may be an impossibility.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/10 |title=Informational Time and Space |journal=Prespacetime Journal |first=Gunn |last=Quznetsov |date=30 March 2010 |volume=1 |issue=2 |accessdate=30 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102085729/http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/10 |archivedate=2 January 2017  }}</ref> Any technological device, whether fictional or hypothetical, that is used to achieve time travel is known as a [[Time travel|time machine]].\n\nA central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of [[causality]]; should an effect precede its cause, it would give rise to the possibility of a [[temporal paradox]]. Some interpretations of time travel resolve this by accepting the possibility of travel between [[Many-worlds interpretation|branch points]], [[Multiverse|parallel realities]], or [[universe]]s.\n\nAnother solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, [[free will]] either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. As such, it would not be possible to enact the [[grandfather paradox]] because it is a historical fact that one's grandfather was not killed before his child (one's parent) was conceived. This view does not simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but that any change made by a hypothetical future time traveller would already have happened in his or her past, resulting in the reality that the traveller moves from. More elaboration on this view can be found in the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]].\n\n== Time perception ==\n[[File:William James b1842c.jpg|thumb|upright|Philosopher and psychologist [[William James]]]]\n{{Main|Time perception}}\n\nThe [[specious present]] refers to the time duration wherein one's [[perception]]s are considered to be in the present. The experienced present is said to be 'specious' in that, unlike the objective present, it is an interval and not a durationless instant. The term ''specious present'' was first introduced by the psychologist [[E.R.

[[Time-use research]] is a developing field of study. The question concerns how time is allocated across a number of activities (such as time spent at home, at work, shopping, etc.). Time use changes with technology, as the television or the Internet created new opportunities to use time in different ways. However, some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in transport, has been observed to be about 20\u201330 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period.\n\n[[Time management]] is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how much time a task requires and when it must be completed, and adjusting events that would interfere with its completion so it is done in the appropriate amount of time. Calendars and day planners are common examples of time management tools.\n\n== Sequence of events ==\nA sequence of events, or series of events, is a [[sequence]] of items, facts, events, actions, changes, or procedural steps, arranged in time order (chronological order), often with [[causality]] relationships among the items.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sequence \u2013 Order of Important Events |url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/la/resources/documents/instResources/LA_res_Seq_ORS_Module.pdf |publisher=[[Austin Independent School District]] |date=2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927172713/http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/la/resources/documents/instResources/LA_res_Seq_ORS_Module.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011  }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |title=Sequence of Events Worksheets |url=http://www.reference.com/motif/Science/sequence-of-events-worksheets |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013032311/http://www.reference.com/motif/Science/sequence-of-events-worksheets |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 October 2010 |publisher=[[Reference.com]] }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |author1=Compiled by David Luckham |author2=Roy Schulte |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Event Processing Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 Version 2.0 |url=http://www.complexevents.com/2011/08/23/event-processing-glossary-version-2-0/ |publisher=Complex Event Processing |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015182053/http://www.complexevents.com/2011/08/23/event-processing-glossary-version-2-0/ |archivedate=15 October 2011  |date=23 August 2011 }}\n</ref>\nBecause of [[causality]], cause precedes [[result|effect]], or cause and effect may appear together in a single item, but effect never precedes cause.

Time is one of the seven fundamental [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] in both the [[International System of Units]] and [[International System of Quantities]]. Time is used to define other quantities&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[velocity]]&nbsp;\u2013 so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition.<ref name=\"TrialogueP3\">Duff, Okun, Veneziano, ''ibid''. p. 3. \"There is no well established terminology for the fundamental constants of Nature.&nbsp;... The absence of accurately defined terms or the uses (i.e., actually misuses) of ill-defined terms lead to confusion and proliferation of wrong statements.\"\n</ref> An [[operational definition]] of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted.\n\nThe operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is. It does not address why events can happen forward and backwards in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the [[spacetime]] continuum. [[General Relativity]] is the primary framework for understanding how [[spacetime]] works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted, particularly at the edges of [[black hole]]s.\n\nTemporal measurement has occupied scientists and [[Engineering technologist|technologists]], and was a prime motivation in [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]]. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the [[electronic transition]] [[frequency]] of [[caesium]] atoms (see [[#History of time measurement devices|below]]). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (\"[[Time value of money|time is money]]\") as well as personal value, due to an [[awareness]] of the limited time in each day and in [[life expectancy|human life spans]].\n\n== Temporal measurement ==\nGenerally speaking, methods of temporal measurement, or [[chronometry]], take two distinct forms: the [[calendar]], a mathematical tool for organising intervals of time,<ref name=\"Richards\">{{cite book |title=Mapping Time: The Calendar and its History |last=Richards |first=E. G. |date=1998 |pages=3\u20135 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}\n</ref>\nand the [[clock]], a physical mechanism that counts the passage of time. In day-to-day life, the clock is consulted for periods less than a day whereas the calendar is consulted for periods longer than a day. Increasingly, personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously. The number (as on a clock dial or calendar) that marks the occurrence of a specified event as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch&nbsp;\u2013 a central reference point.\n\n=== History of the calendar ===\n{{Main|Calendar}}\n\nArtifacts from the [[Paleolithic]] suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago.<ref name=\"Rudgley\">{{cite book |title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age |last=Rudgley |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Rudgley |date=1999 |pages=86\u2013105 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York}}\n</ref>\n[[Lunar calendar]]s were among the first to appear, with years of either 12 or 13 [[lunar month]]s (either 354 or 384 days). Without [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] to add days or months to some years, seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months. [[Lunisolar calendar]]s have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year (now known to be about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar months. The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least partly due to this relationship of months to years. Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica, particularly in ancient Mayan civilization. These calendars were religiously and astronomically based, with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month, plus five [[epagomenal]] days at the end of the year.<ref>Van Stone, Mark. \"The Maya Long Count Calendar: An Introduction.\" Archaeoastronomy 24.(2011): 8\u201311. Academic Search Complete. Web. 20 February 2016.</ref>\n\nThe reforms of [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BC put the [[Roman Empire|Roman world]] on a [[solar calendar]]. This [[Julian calendar]] was faulty in that its intercalation still allowed the astronomical [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es to advance against it by about 11 minutes per year. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] introduced a correction in 1582; the [[Gregorian calendar]] was only slowly adopted by different nations over a period of centuries, but it is now by far the most commonly used calendar around the world.\n\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], a new clock and calendar were invented in an attempt to de-Christianize time and create a more rational system in order to replace the Gregorian calendar. The [[French Republican Calendar]]'s days consisted of ten hours of a hundred minutes of a hundred seconds, which marked a deviation from the base 12 ([[duodecimal]]) system used in many other devices by many cultures. The system was abolished in 1806.<ref>\"French Republican Calendar | Chronology.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, n.d.

The T was oriented eastward in the mornings. At noon, the device was turned around so that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.<ref>Barnett, Jo Ellen ''Time's Pendulum: The Quest to Capture Time&nbsp;\u2013 from Sundials to Atomic Clocks'' Plenum, 1998 {{isbn|0-306-45787-3}} p. 28\n</ref>\n\nA [[sundial]] uses a [[gnomon]] to cast a shadow on a set of markings calibrated to the hour. The position of the shadow marks the hour in [[Time zone|local time]]. The idea to separate the day into smaller parts is credited to Egyptians because of their sundials, which operated on a duodecimal system. The importance of the number 12 is due to the number of lunar cycles in a year and the number of stars used to count the passage of night.<ref>Lombardi, Michael A. \"Why Is a Minute Divided into 60 Seconds, an Hour into 60 Minutes, Yet There Are Only 24 Hours in a Day?\" Scientific American. Springer Nature, 5 March 2007. Web. 21 February 2016.</ref>\n\nThe most precise timekeeping device of the [[ancient world]] was the [[water clock]], or ''clepsydra'', one of which was found in the tomb of Egyptian pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]]. They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and the people from [[Chaldea]] (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages.<ref>Barnett, ''ibid'', p. 37.</ref> In the 11th century, [[List of Chinese inventions|Chinese inventors]] and [[History of science and technology in China|engineers]] invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an [[escapement]] mechanism.\n\n[[File:Swatch Irony angle below.jpg|thumb|left|A contemporary [[quartz watch]], 2007 ]]\nThe [[hourglass]] uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time.

Waterclocks, and later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages. [[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292\u20131336), abbot of St. Alban's abbey, famously built a mechanical clock as an astronomical [[orrery]] about 1330.<ref>North, J.

The passage of the hours at sea were marked by bells, and denoted the time (see [[ship's bell]]). The hours were marked by bells in abbeys as well as at sea.\n\n[[File:ChipScaleClock2 HR.jpg|thumb|Chip-scale [[atomic clock]]s, such as this one unveiled in 2004, are expected to greatly improve [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/miniclock.cfm |title=NIST Unveils Chip-Scale Atomic Clock |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522125607/http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/miniclock.cfm |archivedate=22 May 2011  }}</ref>]]\n\nClocks can range from watches, to more exotic varieties such as the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of means such as a [[pendulum]].\n\nAlarm clocks first appeared in ancient Greece around 250 BC with a water clock that would set off a whistle.

A [[minute]] (min) is 60 seconds in length, and an [[hour]] is 60 minutes or 3600 seconds in length. A day is usually 24 hours or 86,400 seconds in length; however, the duration of a calendar day can vary due to [[Daylight saving time]] and [[Leap second]]s.\n\n== Definitions and standards ==\nThe Mean [[Solar Time]] system defines the second as 1/86,400 of the mean [[solar day]], which is the year-average of the solar day. The solar day is the time interval between two successive solar noons, i.e., the time interval between two successive passages of the Sun across the local meridian. The local meridian is an imaginary line that runs from celestial north pole to celestial south pole passing directly over the head of the observer. At the local meridian the Sun reaches its highest point on its daily arc across the sky.\n\nIn 1874 the British Association for the Advancement of Science introduced the CGS (centimetre/gramme/second system) combining fundamental units of length, mass and time. The second is \"elastic\", because tidal friction is slowing the earth's rotation rate. For use in calculating ephemerides of celestial motion, therefore, in 1952 astronomers introduced the \"ephemeris second\", currently defined as\n\n{{quote|the fraction 1/31,556,925.9747 of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours [[ephemeris time]].<ref>''Whitaker's Almanac 2013'' (ed.

The [[SI base unit]] for time is the [[SI]] second. The [[International System of Quantities]], which incorporates the SI, also defines larger units of time equal to fixed integer multiples of one second (1 s), such as the minute, hour and day. These are not part of the SI, but may be used alongside the SI. Other units of time such as the month and the year are not equal to fixed multiples of 1 s, and instead exhibit significant variations in duration.<ref name=\"si_units\">{{cite book |title=The International System of Units (SI), 7th Edition |url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040427205458/http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 April 2004 |date=1998 |author=Organisation Intergouvernementale de la Convention du M\u00e9tre |accessdate=9 April 2011 }}\n</ref>\n\nThe official SI definition of the second is as follows:<ref name=\"si_units\"/><ref name=\"second\">{{cite web |title=Base unit definitions: Second |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html |publisher=[[NIST]] |accessdate=9 April 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417135428/http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html |archivedate=17 April 2011  }}\n</ref>\n{{quote|The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the [[caesium]] 133 atom.}}\n{{clear left}}\n\nAt its 1997 meeting, the CIPM affirmed that this definition refers to a caesium atom in its ground state at a temperature of 0 K.<ref name=\"si_units\"/>\n\nThe current definition of the second, coupled with the current definition of the meter, is based on the [[special theory of relativity]], which affirms our spacetime to be a [[Minkowski space]]. The definition of the second in mean solar time, however, is unchanged.\n\n=== World time ===\nWhile in theory, the concept of a single worldwide universal time-scale may have been conceived of many centuries ago, in practicality the technical ability to create and maintain such a time-scale did not become possible until the mid-19th century. The timescale adopted was Greenwich Mean Time, created in 1847. A few countries have replaced it with Coordinated Universal Time, [[UTC]].\n\n==== History of the development of UTC ====\nWith the advent of the [[industrial revolution]], a greater understanding and agreement on the nature of time itself became increasingly necessary and helpful. In 1847 in Britain, [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) was first created for use by the British railways, the British navy, and the British shipping industry. Using telescopes, GMT was calibrated to the [[mean solar time]] at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] in the UK.\n\nAs international commerce continued to increase throughout Europe, in order to achieve a more efficiently functioning modern society, an agreed upon, and highly accurate '''''international standard''''' of time measurement became necessary. In order to find or determine such a time-standard, three steps had to be followed:\n# An internationally agreed upon time-standard had to be defined.\n# This new time-standard then had to be consistently and accurately measured.\n# The new time-standard then had to be freely shared and distributed around the world.\n\nThe development of what is now known as [[UTC|UTC time]] began as a collaboration between 41 nations, officially agreed and signed at the [[International Meridian Conference]], in Washington D.C. in 1884. At this conference, the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define the \"universal day\", counted from 0 hours at Greenwich mean midnight. This agreed with the civil Greenwich Mean Time used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast astronomical GMT began at mean noon, i.e. astronomical day ''X'' began at noon of civil day ''X''. The purpose of this was to keep one night's observations under one date. The civil system was adopted as of 0 hours (civil) 1 January 1925. Nautical GMT began 24 hours before astronomical GMT, at least until 1805 in the [[Royal Navy]], but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich meridian was used for two-thirds of all charts and maps as their [[Prime Meridian]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Howse|first1=Derek|title=Greenwich Time and the Longitude|year=1997|publisher=Philip Wilson|location=London|isbn=978-0-85667-468-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/greenwichtimelon0000hows/page/133 133\u2013137]|url=https://archive.org/details/greenwichtimelon0000hows/page/133}}</ref>\n\nAmong the 41 nations represented at the conference, the advanced time-technologies that had already come into use in Britain were fundamental components of the agreed method of arriving at a universal and agreed international time. In 1928 Greenwich Mean Time was rebranded for scientific purposes by the [[International Astronomical Union]] as [[Universal Time]] (UT). This was to avoid confusion with the previous system in which the day had begun at noon. As the general public had always begun the day at midnight, the timescale continued to be presented to them as Greenwich Mean Time. By 1956, universal time had been split into various versions: UT2, which smoothed for polar motion and seasonal effects, was presented to the public as Greenwich Mean Time. Later, UT1 (which smooths only for polar motion) became the default form of UT used by astronomers and hence the form used in navigation, sunrise and sunset and moonrise and moonset tables where the name Greenwich Mean Time continues to be employed. Greenwich Mean Time is also the preferred method of describing the timescale used by legislators. Even to the present day, UT is still based on an international telescopic system. Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system. Because the rotational period of Earth is not perfectly constant, the duration of a second would vary if calibrated to a telescope-based standard like GMT, where the second is defined as 1/86 400 of the mean solar day.\n\nUntil 1960, the methods and definitions of time-keeping that had been laid out at the International Meridian Conference proved to be adequate to meet time tracking needs of science. Still, with the advent of the \"electronic revolution\" in the latter half of the 20th century, the technologies that had been available at the time of the Convention of the Metre proved to be in need of further refinement in order to meet the needs of the ever-increasing precision that the \"electronic revolution\" had begun to require.\n\n==== The ephemeris second ====\nAn invariable second (the \"ephemeris second\") had been defined, use of which removed the errors in ephemerides resulting from the use of the variable mean solar second as the time argument. In 1960 this ephemeris second was made the basis of the \"coordinated universal time\" which was being derived from atomic clocks. It is a specified fraction of the mean tropical year as at 1900 and, being based on historical telescope observations, corresponds roughly to the mean solar second of the early nineteenth century.<ref name=\"USNO\">\n{{cite web |title=Leap Seconds |publisher=Time Service Department, [[United States Naval Observatory]] |url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |accessdate=22 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228195938/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |archivedate=28 February 2012 }}\n</ref>\n\n==== The SI second ====\nIn 1967 a further step was taken with the introduction of the SI second, essentially the ephemeris second as measured by atomic clocks and formally defined in atomic terms.<ref name=mark58>\n{{cite journal |author=W Markowitz, RG Hall, L Essen, JVL Parry |year=1958 |url=http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf |title=Frequency of cesium in terms of ephemeris time |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=105\u2013107 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.1.105 |bibcode=1958PhRvL...1..105M |last2=Hall |last3=Essen |last4=Parry |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019014530/http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2008  }}</ref>\nThe SI second (Standard Internationale second) is based directly on the measurement of the atomic-clock observation of the frequency oscillation of caesium atoms.

As it has been adopted as the civil timescale by some countries (most countries have opted to retain mean solar time) it is not permitted to deviate from GMT by more than 0.9 second. This is achieved by the occasional insertion of a leap second.\n\n==== Current application of UTC ====\n\nMost countries use mean solar time. Australia, Canada (Quebec only), Colombia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea (Bougainville only), Paraguay, Portugal, Switzerland, the United States and Venezuela use UTC. However, UTC is widely used by the scientific community in countries where mean solar time is official. [[UTC|UTC time]] is based on the SI second, which was first defined in 1967, and is based on the use of atomic clocks. Some other less used but closely related time-standards include [[International Atomic Time|International Atomic Time (TAI)]], [[Terrestrial Time]], and [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]].\n\nBetween 1967 and 1971, UTC was periodically adjusted by fractional amounts of a second in order to adjust and refine for variations in mean solar time, with which it is aligned. After 1 January 1972, UTC time has been defined as being offset from atomic time by a whole number of seconds, changing only when a [[leap second]] is added to keep radio-controlled clocks synchronized with the rotation of the Earth.\n\nThe [[Global Positioning System]] also broadcasts a very precise time signal worldwide, along with instructions for converting GPS time to UTC. GPS-time is based on, and regularly synchronized with or from, UTC-time.\n\nThe surface of the Earth is split up into a number of [[time zone]]s. Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from GMT. For example, time zones at sea are based on GMT. In many locations (but not at sea) these offsets vary twice yearly due to [[daylight saving time]] transitions.\n\n=== Time conversions ===\nThese conversions are accurate at the millisecond level for time systems based on the rotation of the Earth (UT1 and TT). Conversions between atomic time systems (TAI, GPS, and UTC) are accurate at the microsecond level.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! System\n! Description\n! UT1\n! UTC\n! TT\n! TAI\n!

In [[astronomy]], sidereal time is used to predict when a [[star]] will reach its [[culmination|highest point]] in the sky. Due to [[Earth's orbit]]al motion around the Sun, a mean solar day is about 3 minutes 56 seconds longer than a mean sidereal day, or {{fract|1|366}} more than a mean sidereal day.\n\n=== Chronology ===\n{{Main|Chronology}}\n\nAnother form of time measurement consists of studying the [[past]]. Events in the past can be ordered in a sequence (creating a [[chronology]]), and can be put into chronological groups ([[periodization]]). One of the most important systems of periodization is the [[geologic time scale]], which is a system of periodizing the events that shaped the [[Earth]] and its life.

In short, an empty space would be a substance with no properties; it will be a substance that even God cannot modify or destroy.... That is, space and time are internal or intrinsic features of the complete concepts of things, not extrinsic.... Leibniz's view has two major implications. First, there is no absolute location in either space or time; location is always the situation of an object or event relative to other objects and events. Second, space and time are not in themselves real (that is, not substances). Space and time are, rather, ideal. Space and time are just metaphysically illegitimate ways of perceiving certain virtual relations between substances. They are phenomena or, strictly speaking, illusions (although they are illusions that are well-founded upon the internal properties of substances).... It is sometimes convenient to think of space and time as something \"out there,\" over and above the entities and their relations to each other, but this convenience must not be confused with reality. Space is nothing but the order of co-existent objects; time nothing but the order of successive events. This is usually called a relational theory of space and time. |accessdate=9 April 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000548/http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H7 |archivedate=14 May 2011  }}\n</ref> and [[Immanuel Kant]],<ref name=Mattey>\n{{cite web |url=http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/TIMELEC.HTM  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314201600/http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/TIMELEC.HTM  |url-status=dead  |archive-date=14 March 2005 |title=Critique of Pure Reason, Lecture notes: Philosophy 175 UC Davis |date=22 January 1997 |last=Mattey |first=G.J. |quote=What is correct in the Leibnizian view was its anti-metaphysical stance.

In this view, ''time'' does not refer to any kind of entity that \"flows,\" that objects \"move through,\" or that is a \"container\" for events.

Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of ''having been'', which allows the past to exist in the present.

It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes \"being ahead of oneself\" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative.

This theory rejects the existence of all direct interaction with the past or the future, holding only the present as tangible. This is one of the philosophical arguments against time travel. This contrasts with [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] (all time: present, past and future, is real) and the [[Growing block universe|growing block theory]] (the present and the past are real, but the future is not).\n\n== Physical definition ==\n{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}\n{{Main|Time in physics}}\n\nUntil [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] reinterpretation of the physical concepts associated with time and space, time was considered to be the same everywhere in the universe, with all observers measuring the same time interval for any event.<ref>Herman M. Schwartz, ''Introduction to Special Relativity'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1968, hardcover 442 pages, see {{isbn|0-88275-478-5}} (1977 edition), pp. 10\u201313\n</ref>\nNon-relativistic [[classical mechanics]] is based on this Newtonian idea of time.\n\nEinstein, in his [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]],<ref>A.

He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer.\n\nThe theory of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in [[Minkowski space]]time, a mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of space with a single dimension of time. In this formalism, distances in space can be measured by how long light takes to travel that distance, e.g., a [[light-year]] is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Two [[Event (relativity)|events]] in Minkowski spacetime are separated by an ''[[Spacetime interval|invariant interval]]'', which can be either [[space-like]], [[light-like]], or [[time-like]]. Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in any [[frame of reference]], there must be a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation. Events that have a space-like separation will be simultaneous in some frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference in which they do not have a spatial separation. Different observers may calculate different distances and different time intervals between two events, but the ''invariant interval'' between the events is independent of the observer (and his or her velocity).\n\n=== Classical mechanics ===\nIn non-relativistic [[classical mechanics]], Newton's concept of \"relative, apparent, and common time\" can be used in the formulation of a prescription for the synchronization of clocks. Events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works sufficiently well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people's experience. In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism. Einstein resolved these problems by invoking a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity. This led directly to the result that observers in motion relative to one another measure different elapsed times for the same event.\n\n[[File:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|Two-dimensional space depicted in three-dimensional spacetime. The past and future [[light cone]]s are absolute, the \"present\" is a relative concept different for observers in relative motion.]]\n\n=== Spacetime ===\n{{Main|Spacetime}}\nTime has historically been closely related with space, the two together merging into spacetime in [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the [[inertial frame of reference|spatial reference frame of the observer]], and the human perception as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks are different for observers in relative motion. For example, if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through space at (very nearly) the speed of light, its crew does not notice a change in the speed of time on board their vessel because everything traveling at the same speed slows down at the same rate (including the clock, the crew's thought processes, and the functions of their bodies). However, to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly.\n\nOn the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel, because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other. Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the stationary observer) are many light years apart. This is reconciled by the fact that the crew's perception of time is different from the stationary observer's; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer. In either case, however, causality remains unchanged: the [[past]] is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the [[future]] is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9zrt__lec |title=Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity |publisher=YouTube |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182611/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9zrt__lec |archivedate=17 October 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vpw4AH8QQ |title=Time Travel: Einstein's big idea (Theory of Relativity) |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182714/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vpw4AH8QQ |archivedate=17 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\n=== Time dilation ===\n[[File:Relativity of Simultaneity.svg|thumb|[[Relativity of simultaneity]]: Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurred before in the blue frame, and occurs later in the red frame.]]\n{{Main|Time dilation}}\n\n[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on [[Causality (physics)|cause and effect]], measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. [[Subatomic particle]]s exist for a well known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest. According to the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], in the high-speed particle's [[Inertial frame of reference|frame of reference]], it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its [[mean lifetime]], and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \"slow down\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or \"warped\") by high-speed motion.\n\nEinstein (''The Meaning of Relativity''): \"Two [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|events]] taking place at the points A and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relative to K, which register the same simultaneously.\"\n\nEinstein wrote in his book, ''Relativity'', that [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity is also relative]], i.e., two events that appear simultaneous to an observer in a particular inertial reference frame need not be judged as simultaneous by a second observer in a different inertial frame of reference.\n\n=== Relativistic time versus Newtonian time ===\n[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed|Views of spacetime along the [[world line]] of a rapidly accelerating observer in a relativistic universe. The events (\"dots\") that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past [[light cone]] of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer.]]\n\nThe animations visualise the different treatments of time in the Newtonian and the relativistic descriptions. At the heart of these differences are the [[Galilean transformation|Galilean]] and [[Lorentz transformation]]s applicable in the Newtonian and relativistic theories, respectively.\n\nIn the figures, the vertical direction indicates time. The horizontal direction indicates distance (only one spatial dimension is taken into account), and the thick dashed curve is the spacetime trajectory (\"[[world line]]\") of the observer. The small dots indicate specific (past and future) events in spacetime.\n\nThe slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how in both pictures the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates.\n\nIn the Newtonian description these changes are such that ''time'' is absolute:<ref>{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 Extract of p. 30]</ref> the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event occurs in the 'now' (i.e., whether an event passes the horizontal line through the observer).\n\nHowever, in the relativistic description the ''observability of events'' is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event passes the \"[[light cone]]\" of the observer. Notice that with the change from a Newtonian to a relativistic description, the concept of ''absolute time'' is no longer applicable: events move up-and-down in the figure depending on the acceleration of the observer.\n\n=== Arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Arrow of time}}\n\nTime appears to have a direction&nbsp;\u2013 the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an [[arrow of time]], and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modelled by a parameter in the system being analysed, where there is no \"proper time\": the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] arrow of time, which points away from the [[Big Bang]], [[CPT symmetry]], and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only travelling forwards in time (see [[light cone]]). In [[particle physics]], the [[CP violation|violation of CP symmetry]] implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve [[CPT symmetry]] as stated above. The standard description of [[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]] is also time asymmetric (see [[Measurement in quantum mechanics]]). The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that [[entropy]] must increase over time (see [[Entropy (arrow of time)|Entropy]]). This can be in either direction \u2013 Brian Greene theorizes that, according to the equations, the change in entropy occurs symmetrically whether going forward or backward in time. So entropy tends to increase in either direction, and our current low-entropy universe is a statistical aberration, in the similar manner as tossing a coin often enough that eventually heads will result ten times in a row. However, this theory is not supported empirically in local experiment.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZujlUD1oAAC |last=Greene |first=Brian |title=The Fabric of the Cosmos|chapter= Chapter 6: Chance and the Arrow |date=2005 |location=London|isbn=978-0-14-195995-5 }}</ref>\n\n=== Quantized time ===\n{{See also|Chronon}}\n\nTime quantization is a hypothetical concept. In the modern established physical theories (the [[Standard Model]] of Particles and Interactions and [[General Relativity]]) time is not quantized.\n\n[[Planck time]] (~ 5.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221244</sup> seconds) is the unit of time in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]]. Current established physical theories are believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in principle. Tentative physical theories that describe this time scale exist; see for instance [[loop quantum gravity]].\n\n== Time travel ==\n{{Main|Time travel}}\n{{See also|Time travel in fiction|Wormhole|Twin paradox}}\n\nTime travel is the concept of moving backwards or forwards to different points in time, in a manner analogous to moving through space, and different from the normal \"flow\" of time to an earthbound observer. In this view, all points in time (including future times) \"persist\" in some way. Time travel has been a [[plot device]] in fiction since the 19th century. Travelling backwards in time has never been verified, presents many theoretical problems, and may be an impossibility.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/10 |title=Informational Time and Space |journal=Prespacetime Journal |first=Gunn |last=Quznetsov |date=30 March 2010 |volume=1 |issue=2 |accessdate=30 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102085729/http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/10 |archivedate=2 January 2017  }}</ref> Any technological device, whether fictional or hypothetical, that is used to achieve time travel is known as a [[Time travel|time machine]].\n\nA central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of [[causality]]; should an effect precede its cause, it would give rise to the possibility of a [[temporal paradox]]. Some interpretations of time travel resolve this by accepting the possibility of travel between [[Many-worlds interpretation|branch points]], [[Multiverse|parallel realities]], or [[universe]]s.\n\nAnother solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, [[free will]] either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. As such, it would not be possible to enact the [[grandfather paradox]] because it is a historical fact that one's grandfather was not killed before his child (one's parent) was conceived. This view does not simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but that any change made by a hypothetical future time traveller would already have happened in his or her past, resulting in the reality that the traveller moves from. More elaboration on this view can be found in the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]].\n\n== Time perception ==\n[[File:William James b1842c.jpg|thumb|upright|Philosopher and psychologist [[William James]]]]\n{{Main|Time perception}}\n\nThe [[specious present]] refers to the time duration wherein one's [[perception]]s are considered to be in the present.

[[Time-use research]] is a developing field of study. The question concerns how time is allocated across a number of activities (such as time spent at home, at work, shopping, etc.). Time use changes with technology, as the television or the Internet created new opportunities to use time in different ways. However, some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in transport, has been observed to be about 20\u201330 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period.\n\n[[Time management]] is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how much time a task requires and when it must be completed, and adjusting events that would interfere with its completion so it is done in the appropriate amount of time. Calendars and day planners are common examples of time management tools.\n\n== Sequence of events ==\nA sequence of events, or series of events, is a [[sequence]] of items, facts, events, actions, changes, or procedural steps, arranged in time order (chronological order), often with [[causality]] relationships among the items.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sequence \u2013 Order of Important Events |url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/la/resources/documents/instResources/LA_res_Seq_ORS_Module.pdf |publisher=[[Austin Independent School District]] |date=2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927172713/http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/la/resources/documents/instResources/LA_res_Seq_ORS_Module.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011  }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |title=Sequence of Events Worksheets |url=http://www.reference.com/motif/Science/sequence-of-events-worksheets |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013032311/http://www.reference.com/motif/Science/sequence-of-events-worksheets |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 October 2010 |publisher=[[Reference.com]] }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |author1=Compiled by David Luckham |author2=Roy Schulte |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Event Processing Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 Version 2.0 |url=http://www.complexevents.com/2011/08/23/event-processing-glossary-version-2-0/ |publisher=Complex Event Processing |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015182053/http://www.complexevents.com/2011/08/23/event-processing-glossary-version-2-0/ |archivedate=15 October 2011  |date=23 August 2011 }}\n</ref>\nBecause of [[causality]], cause precedes [[result|effect]], or cause and effect may appear together in a single item, but effect never precedes cause.

A sequence of events may also be used to help describe [[Process (engineering)|processes]] in science, technology, and medicine. A sequence of events may be focused on past events (e.g., stories, history, chronology), on future events that must be in a predetermined order (e.g., [[plan]]s, [[schedule (project management)|schedules]], procedures, timetables), or focused on the observation of past events with the expectation that the events will occur in the future (e.g., processes, projections). The use of a sequence of events occurs in fields as diverse as machines ([[cam timer]]), documentaries (''[[Seconds From Disaster]]''), law ([[Choice of law#Sequence of events in conflict cases|choice of law]]), [[computer simulation]] ([[discrete event simulation]]), and [[electric power transmission]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Utility Communications Architecture (UCA) glossary |url=http://www.nettedautomation.com/glossary_menue/glossary_uca.html |publisher=NettedAutomation |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210131225/http://nettedautomation.com/glossary_menue/glossary_uca.html |archivedate=10 December 2011  }}\n</ref>\n([[sequence of events recorder]]). A specific example of a sequence of events is the [[timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].\n\n== Spatial conceptualization of time ==\nAlthough time is regarded as an abstract concept, there is increasing evidence that time is [[Conceptual metaphor|conceptualized]] in the mind in terms of space.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=N\u00fa\u00f1ez |first=Rafael |last2=Cooperrider |first2=Kensy |last3=Doan |first3=D |last4=Wassmann |first4=J\u00fcrg |date=1 July 2012 |title=Contours of time: Topographic construals of past, present, and future in the Yupno valley of Papua New Guinea  |journal=Cognition |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=25\u201335 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.03.007|pmid=22542697 }}</ref> That is, instead of thinking about time in a general, abstract way, humans think about time in a spatial way and mentally organize it as such.

These origins are shaped by many environmental factors<ref name=\":0\" />\u2013\u2013for example, [[literacy]] appears to play a large role in the different types of MTLs, as reading/[[Writing system|writing direction]] provides an everyday temporal orientation that differs from culture to culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In western cultures, the MTL may unfold rightward (with the past on the left and the future on the right) since people read and write from left to right.<ref name=\":1\" /> Western calendars also continue this trend by placing the past on the left with the future progressing toward the right. Conversely, Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and [[Israeli Hebrew language|Israeli-Hebrew]] speakers read from right to left, and their MTLs unfold leftward (past on the right with future on the left), and evidence suggests these speakers organize time events in their minds like this as well.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThis linguistic evidence that abstract concepts are based in spatial concepts also reveals that the way humans mentally organize time events varies across cultures\u2013\u2013that is, a certain specific mental organization system is not universal. So, although Western cultures typically associate past events with the left and future events with the right according to a certain MTL, this kind of horizontal, egocentric MTL is not the spatial organization of all cultures. Although most developed nations use an egocentric spatial system, there is recent evidence that some cultures use an allocentric spatialization, often based on environmental features.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA recent study of the indigenous Yupno people of [[Papua New Guinea]] focused on the directional gestures used when individuals used time-related words.<ref name=\":0\" /> When speaking of the past (such as \"last year\" or \"past times\"), individuals gestured downhill, where the river of the valley flowed into the ocean. When speaking of the future, they gestured uphill, toward the source of the river. This was common regardless of which direction the person faced, revealing that the Yupno people may use an allocentric MTL, in which time flows uphill.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA similar study of the Pormpuraawans, an [[Aboriginal groupings of Western Australia|aboriginal group]] in Australia, revealed a similar distinction in which when asked to organize photos of a man aging \"in order,\" individuals consistently placed the youngest photos to the east and the oldest photos to the west, regardless of which direction they faced.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal |title=Remembrances of Times East |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1635\u20139 |journal=Psychological Science |pmid=20959511|year=2010 |last1=Boroditsky |first1=L. |last2=Gaby |first2=A. |doi=10.1177/0956797610386621 }}</ref> This directly clashed with an American group which consistently organized the photos from left to right. Therefore, this group also appears to have an allocentric MTL, but based on the cardinal directions instead of geographical features.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe wide array of distinctions in the way different groups think about time leads to the broader question that different groups may also think about other abstract concepts in different ways as well, such as causality and number.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[Era]]\n* [[International System of Quantities]]\n* [[Kairos]]\n* [[List of UTC timing centers]]\n* [[Term (time)]]\n\n=== Books ===\n* ''[[About Time (book)|About Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution]]'' by [[Paul Davies]]\n* ''[[Being and Time]]'' by [[Martin Heidegger]]\n* ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' by [[Stephen Hawking]]\n* ''[[From Eternity to Here|From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time]]'' by [[Sean M.

Students carry out projects proposed by the pedagogic team, and are free to organise their own time.\n\nThe schools are open 24/7. Students help each other and use the Internet for their projects.\n\nStudents have no time limits in which to complete their projects.  They validate the projects by correcting each other's work. Validation of a project increases the level of the students, allowing them to unlock new and more difficult challenges.\n\nDuring their time at the school, students have to undertake internships. To qualify for an internship a student must have validated a certain number of projects and passed five exams.\n\nMany entrepreneurs hold conferences at the school.  42 school has also forged partnerships with other schools (business schools, design schools etc.) and the [[hackathon]] organisation. Students are able to participate in partnership activities if they wish to.\n\n== Academics ==\n\nAfter the \"''Piscine\"'', training lasts at least three years, and covers the different I.T. jobs linked to development.\n\nThe beginning of the program is mainly focused on the [[Unix]] development environment with the [[C (programming language)|C-language]]. These software developments are planned through 40 projects such as the implementation of a basic [[First-person shooter]] engine, an engine for an online game and a 3D rendering engine ([[rasterizer]]) by ray tracing.\n\nAfter that there are a lot of other languages students will see like [[PHP]], [[C++]], [[OCaml|OCAML]] and many others. Some projects can also have free language choice.\n\nAccording to a promotional document about the school program, learning software development is planned through the realization of an arcade game, artificial intelligence or a computer virus.\n\n42 students and people from everywhere in the world can create a new project if they want.\n\n== Endorsement ==\n[[File:Bolden42.jpg|thumb|400x400px|[[Charles Bolden|Charles F.

Students carry out projects proposed by the pedagogic team, and are free to organise their own time.\n\nThe schools are open 24/7. Students help each other and use the Internet for their projects.\n\nStudents have no time limits in which to complete their projects.  They validate the projects by correcting each other's work. Validation of a project increases the level of the students, allowing them to unlock new and more difficult challenges.\n\nDuring their time at the school, students have to undertake internships. To qualify for an internship a student must have validated a certain number of projects and passed five exams.\n\nMany entrepreneurs hold conferences at the school.  42 school has also forged partnerships with other schools (business schools, design schools etc.) and the [[hackathon]] organisation. Students are able to participate in partnership activities if they wish to.\n\n== Academics ==\n\nAfter the \"''Piscine\"'', training lasts at least three years, and covers the different I.T. jobs linked to development.\n\nThe beginning of the program is mainly focused on the [[Unix]] development environment with the [[C (programming language)|C-language]]. These software developments are planned through 40 projects such as the implementation of a basic [[First-person shooter]] engine, an engine for an online game and a 3D rendering engine ([[rasterizer]]) by ray tracing.\n\nAfter that there are a lot of other languages students will see like [[PHP]], [[C++]], [[OCaml|OCAML]] and many others. Some projects can also have free language choice.\n\nAccording to a promotional document about the school program, learning software development is planned through the realization of an arcade game, artificial intelligence or a computer virus.\n\n42 students and people from everywhere in the world can create a new project if they want.\n\n== Endorsement ==\n[[File:Bolden42.jpg|thumb|400x400px|[[Charles Bolden|Charles F.

It is WG21 that is responsible for developing, improving and ensuring market needs are met when developing these standards.\n\n==What is the purpose of ISO 19770?==\n\nThe ISO 19770 standard is a concept of ITAM standardization within an organization incorporating ISO/IEC standards.\n\nThe objective of the standard is to give organizations of all sizes information and assistance to assist at the risk and cost minimization of ITAM assets. Through implementation, these same organizations will acquire a competitive advantage through:\n\n* Management of the risk of interrupted IT service delivery, breach of legal agreements and audit;\n* Reducing overall software costs through the implementation of various processes; and\n* Better information availability leading to improved decision-making based on accurate data.\n\nThe major parts of this ITAM standard are detailed below.\n\n# ISO/IEC 19770-1 is a process framework to enable an organization to prove that it is performing ITAM to a standard sufficient to satisfy [[Corporate governance of information technology|corporate governance]] requirements and ensure effective support for [[IT service management]] overall.\n# ISO/IEC 19770-2 provides an ITAM data standard for software identification tags (\"SWID\").\n# ISO/IEC 19770-3 provides an ITAM data standard for software entitlements, including usage rights, limitations and metrics (\"ENT\").\n# ISO/IEC 19770-4 provides an ITAM data standard for Resource Utilization Measurement (\"RUM\")\n# ISO/IEC 19770-5 provides the overview and vocabulary.\n\n[[File:19770 Family Block Diagram.jpg|thumb|none|19770 Family Block Diagram]]\n\n==ISO/IEC 19770-1: Processes==\nISO/IEC 19770-1 is a framework of ITAM processes to enable an organization to prove that it is performing software asset management to a standard sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT service management overall. ISO/IEC 19770-1:2017 specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and improvement of a management system for IT asset management (ITAM), referred to as an \u201cIT asset management system\u201d (ITAMS).\n\nWhile ISO 55001:2014 specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and improvement of a management system for asset management, referred to as an \u201casset management system\u201d, it is primarily focused on physical assets with little provision for the management of software assets. There are a number of characteristics of IT assets which create additional or more detailed requirements. As a result of these characteristics of IT assets, the 19770-1 management system for IT assets has explicit additional requirements dealing with:\n\n* controls over software modification, duplication and distribution, with particular emphasis on access and integrity controls;\n* audit trails of authorizations and of changes made to IT assets;\n* controls over licensing, underlicensing, overlicensing, and compliance with licensing terms and conditions;\n* controls over situations involving mixed ownership and responsibilities, such as in cloud computing and with \u2018Bring-Your-Own-Device\u2019 (BYOD) practices; and\n* reconciliation of IT asset management data with data in other information systems when justified by business value, in particular with financial information systems recording assets and expenses.\n\n=== Updates to 19770-1===\n\nThe first generation was published in 2006.\n\nThe second generation was published in 2012. It retained the original content (with only minor changes) but splits the standard up into four tiers which can be attained sequentially. These tiers are:\n\n* Tier 1: Trustworthy Data\n* Tier 2: Practical Management\n* Tier 3: Operational Integration\n* Tier 4: Full ISO/IEC ITAM Conformance\n\n'''ISO 19770-1 Edition 3 (current version)'''\n\nThe most recent version, known as ISO 19770-1:2017 and published in December 2017, specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of a management system for IT asset management (ITAM), referred to as an IT asset management system. ISO 19770-1:2017 was a major update and was rewrote the standard to conform to the ISO Management System Standards (MSS)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/management-system-standards.html|title=ISO MSS Standards|author=|date=|website=ISO.org|accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> format. The tiered structure from 197701:2012 was moved to an appendix within the updated standard.\n\n'''Intended Users'''\n\nThis document can be used by any organization and can be applied to all types of IT assets. The organization determines to which of its IT assets this document applies.\nThis document is primarily intended for use by:\n* those involved in the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of an IT asset management system;\n* those involved in delivering IT asset management activities, including service providers;\n* internal and external parties to assess the organization\u2019s ability to meet legal, regulatory and contractual requirements and the organization\u2019s own requirements.\n\n=== Preview of 19770-1===\nAn [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-1:ed-3:v1:en overview] of the standard is available from ISO and is available in English<ref>[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-1:ed-3:v1:en]</ref>\n\n==ISO/IEC 19770-2: software identification tag==\nISO/IEC 19770-2 provides an ITAM data standard for software identification (SWID) tags. Software ID tags provide authoritative identifying information for installed software or other licensable item (such as [[Computer font|fonts]] or copyrighted papers).\n\n=== Overview of SWID tags in use ===\n\nThere are three primary methods that may be used to ensure SWID tags are available on devices with installed software:\n* SWID tags created by a software creator or publisher which are installed with the software are the most authoritative for identification purposes.\n* Organizations can create their own SWID tags for any software title that does not include a tag, allowing the organization to more accurately track software installations in their network environment\n* Third party discovery tools may optionally add tags to a device as software titles are discovered\n\nProviding accurate software identification data improves organizational security, and lowers the cost and increases the capability of many IT processes such as  [[Patch (computing)|patch]] management, desktop management, help desk management, software policy compliance, etc.\n\nDiscovery tools, or processes that utilize SWID tag data to determine the [[Database normalization|normalized]] names and values that are associated with a software application and ensure that all tools and processes used by an organization refer to software products with the same exact names and values.\n\n=== Standards development information ===\n\nThis standard was first published in November 2009.<ref>[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-2:ed-1:v1:en ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009(en)]</ref>  A revision of this standard was published in October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=65666|title=ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 - Information technology -- Software asset management -- Part 2: Software identification tag|author=|date=|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nSteve Klos<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/steve-klos|title=Steve Klos|author=|date=|website=linkedin.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> is the editor of 19770-2 and works for 1E, Inc as a SAM Subject Matter Expert.\n\n=== Non-profit organizational support ===\n\nIn 2009, a non-profit organization called TagVault.org<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagvault.org|title=Home - TagVault.org |website=www.tagvault.org |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> was formed under [[IEEE-ISTO]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee-isto.org|title=IEEE-ISTO|author=|date=|website=IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> to press for using SWID tags. TagVault.org acts as a registration and certification authority for ISO/IEC 19770-2 software identification tags (SWID tags) and will provide tools and services allowing all SAM ecosystem members to take advantage of SWID tags faster, with a lower cost and with more industry compatibility than would otherwise be possible. SWID tags can be created by anyone, so individuals and organizations are not required to be part of TagVault.org to create or distribute tags.\n\n=== Commercial organizational support===\n\nNumerous [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] installation packaging tools utilize SWID tags including:\n* Caphyon's Advanced Installer\n* [[Flexera Software]]'s [[InstallShield]]\n* Flexera Software's [[InstallAnywhere]]\n* [[Open-source license|Open Source]] - [[WiX|Windows Installer XML Toolset (WiX)]]\n\nMany software discovery tools already utilize SWID tags, including [[Altiris]], Aspera SmartCollect, DeskCenter Management Suite, [[Belarc]]'s BelManage, Sassafras Software's K2-KeyServer, Snow Inventory, [[CA, Inc.|CA Technologies]] discovery tools, Eracent's EnterpriseAM, Flexera Software's FlexNet Manager Platform, [[Hewlett-Packard|HP's]] Universal Discovery, [[IBM]] [[Tivoli Endpoint Manager|Endpoint Manager]], [[Microsoft Servers|Microsoft's System Center]] 2012 R2 Configuration Manager, and [[Loginventory]].\n\n[[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] has released multiple versions of their [[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suites]] and  [[Adobe Creative Cloud|Creative Cloud]] products with SWID tags.\n\n[[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]] has also released multiple products that include SWID tags and is committed to helping move the software community to a more consistent and normalized approach to software identification and eventually to a more automated approach to compliance.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160628120327/http://digimindcenter.com/symantec/ see]</ref>\n\n[[Microsoft]] Corporation has been adding SWID tags to all new releases of software products since [[Windows 8]] was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/sam/en/us/softwareid.aspx|title=Control.

This equates to approximately 300 product releases a month that include SWID tags.\n\n=== Governmental support ===\n\nThe [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] has identified 19770-2 SWID tags as an important aspect of the efforts necessary to manage compliance, logistics and security software processes. The 19770-2 standard is included on the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] Information Standards Registry (DISR) as an emerging standard as of September 2012. The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and the [[National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence]] (NCCoE) in 2015 [https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/library/project-descriptions/sam-project-description-final.pdf discussed] the need for SWIDs in the marketplace.<ref>A copy of that presentation is available  [http://www.fbcinc.com/e/cif/presentations/Klos_Waltermire_Unlocking_Organizational_Software_Inventory_Data.pdf here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120330/http://www.fbcinc.com/e/cif/presentations/Klos_Waltermire_Unlocking_Organizational_Software_Inventory_Data.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}</ref>\n\n=== Standards development organization support ===\n\nThe [[Trusted Computing Group]] (TCG) is developing a standard TNC SWID Messages and Attributes for IF-M Specification<ref>[http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_swid_messages_and_attributes_for_ifm_specification TNC SWID Messages and Attributes for IF-M Specification]</ref> that utilizes tag data for security purposes.\n\n[[National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence|The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)]] has documented the Software Asset Management Continuous Monitoring building block<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/SAM.pdf|title=NCCoE|author=|date=|website=nccoe.nist.gov|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> that specifies how SWID tags are used for the near real-time identification of software.\n\n[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] is in the process of creating documentation that specifies how SWID tags will be used by governmental organizations including the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]].

While the specifications provide many opportunities for improvement in entitlement processes and practices, they must be able to handle existing licensing transactions without imposing requirements which would prevent such transactions being codified into Ent records.\n\n====Maximum possible alignment with the software identification tag specification (ISO/IEC 19770-2)====\n\nThis part of ISO/IEC 19770 (entitlement schema) is intended to align closely with part 2 of the standard (software identification tags). This should facilitate both understanding and their joint use. Furthermore, any of the elements, attributes, or other specifications of part 2 which the ENT creator may wish to utilize may be used in this part as well.\n\n===Stakeholder benefits===\n\nIt is intended that this standardized schema will be of benefit to all stakeholders involved in the creation, licensing, distribution, release, installation, and ongoing management of software and software entitlements.\n\n*Benefits to software licensors who provide  ENTs include, but are not limited to:\n** Immediate software customer recognition of details of the usage rights derived from their software entitlement.\n** Ability to specify details to customers that allow software assets to be measured and reported for license compliance purposes.\n** Increased awareness of software license compliance issues on the part of end-customers.\n** Improved software customer relationships through quicker and more effective license compliance audits.\n*Benefits to SAM tool providers, deployment tool providers, re-sellers, value-added re-sellers, packagers and release managers include, but are not limited to:\n** Receipt of consistent and uniform data from software licensors and  ENT creators.\n** More consistent and structured entitlement information, supporting the use of automated techniques to determine the need for remediation of software licensing.\n** Improved reporting from additional categorization made possible by the use of  ENTs.\n** Improved SAM tool entitlement reconciliation capabilities resulting from standardization in location and format of software entitlement data.\n** Ability to deliver value-added functionality for compliance management through the consumption of entitlement data.\n*The benefits for software customers, SAM practitioners, IT support professionals and end users of a given software configuration item include, but are not limited to:\n** Receipt of consistent and uniform data from software licensors, resellers and SAM tools providers.\n** More consistent and structured entitlement information supporting the use of automated techniques to determine the need for remediation of software licensing.\n** Improved reporting from additional categorization made possible by the use of  ENTs.\n** Improved SAM and software license compliance capabilities stemming from standardized, software licensor-supplied, ISO/IEC 19770-2 software identification tags to reconcile with these  ENTs.\n** Improved ability to avoid software license under-procurement or over-procurement with subsequent cost optimization.\n** Standardized usage across multiple platforms, rendering heterogeneous computing environments more manageable.\n\nThe [https://www.itassetmanagement.net ITAM Review] developed a podcast with the 19770-3 project editor how end-user organizations can leverage this standard to their benefit.

A RUM is a standardized structure containing usage information about the resources that are related to the use of an IT asset. A RUM will often be provided in an XML data file, but the same information may be accessible through other means depending on the platform and the IT asset/product.\n\nThis document contains information structures that are designed to align with the identification information defined in ISO/IEC 19770-2, and with the entitlement information defined in ISO/IEC 19770-3. When used together, these three types of information have the capability to significantly enhance and automate the processes of IT asset management.\n\nThis document supports the IT asset management processes defined in ISO/IEC 19770-1. This document also supports the other parts of the ISO/IEC 19770 series of standards that define information structures.\n\nThe RUM is specifically designed to be general-purpose and usable in a wide variety of situations. Like other information structures defined in the ISO/IEC 19770 series of standards, the consumer of a RUM may be an organization and/or a tool or other consumers. In contrast to the other information structures in the ISO/IEC 19770 series, the entity creating a RUM data on a periodic basis will likely be an IT asset or an automation tool monitoring an IT asset.\n\nThe definition of a RUM will benefit all stakeholders involved in the creation, licensing, distribution, releasing, installation, and on-going management of IT assets. Key benefits associated with a RUM for three specific groups of stakeholders include:\n\n'''IT asset users'''\n\u2014 RUM data will typically be generated and processed by IT assets and automation tools, within the consumers enterprise boundary, for purpose of IT asset compliance and optimization;\n\u2014 RUM data is human readable and can provide improved visibility into resource utilization within IT assets independent of vendor or third-party supplied tools;\n\u2014 the ability to combine identification, entitlement, and resource utilization information together to perform quantitative and authoritative IT asset management, for example, to meet compliance requirements;\n\u2014 a much-improved ability to perform IT asset management in support of green data center strategies such as optimization of the use of power and air conditioning;\n\n'''IT asset manufacturers'''\n\u2014 the ability to consistently and authoritatively generate resource utilization information for consumption by a central facility that is maintained by the creator, or one or more third-party tools, or by the IT asset users;\n\u2014 the ability to support multiple instances and types of third-party tools with a single set of functionality within the IT asset;\n\u2014 the ability to offer a service to track real-time IT asset usage in the field and, when combined with identification and entitlement information, the ability to give advance warning as resource limits are approached;\n\u2014 the ability to offer an alternative approach to asset utilization measurement to traditional techniques that employ key-based, or platform-restricted licenses;\n\n'''Tool vendors'''\n\u2014 the ability to support multiple IT assets, and types of IT asset, without having to create and maintain unique instrumentation that is associated with each asset;\n\u2014 the ability to more easily aggregate usage information across multiple instances of an asset;\n\u2014 a much-improved ability to track resource utilization and IT assets in near real-time.\n\n=== Preview ISO/IEC 19770-4: Resource Utilization Measurement ===\n\nAn overview of the standard is available from ISO and is available in English [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-4:ed-1:v1:en here.]\n\n== ISO/IEC 19770-5: overview and vocabulary ==\nISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 provides an overview of ITAM, which is the subject of the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards, and defines related terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c055999_ISOIEC_19770-5_2013.zip|title=ISO - International Organization for Standardization|first=ISO - International Organization for|last=Standardization|date=29 September 2006|website=standards.iso.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>  ISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 is applicable to all types of organization (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, non-profit organizations).\n\nISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 contains:\n\n# an overview of the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards;\n# an introduction to SAM;\n# a brief description of the foundation principles and approaches on which SAM is based; and\n# consistent terms and definitions for use throughout the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards.\n\n=== Free copy of ISO/IEC 19770-5 ===\nA free copy of the overview and vocabulary is available [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c068291_ISOIEC_19770-5_2015.zip here].\n\n== ISO/IEC 19770-8: Guidelines for mapping of industry practices to/from the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards ==\n\nISO/IEC 19770-8 defines requirements, guidelines, formats and approaches for use when producing a mapping document that defines how industry practices map to/from the ISO/IEC 19770 series.

It is WG21 that is responsible for developing, improving and ensuring market needs are met when developing these standards.\n\n==What is the purpose of ISO 19770?==\n\nThe ISO 19770 standard is a concept of ITAM standardization within an organization incorporating ISO/IEC standards.\n\nThe objective of the standard is to give organizations of all sizes information and assistance to assist at the risk and cost minimization of ITAM assets. Through implementation, these same organizations will acquire a competitive advantage through:\n\n* Management of the risk of interrupted IT service delivery, breach of legal agreements and audit;\n* Reducing overall software costs through the implementation of various processes; and\n* Better information availability leading to improved decision-making based on accurate data.\n\nThe major parts of this ITAM standard are detailed below.\n\n# ISO/IEC 19770-1 is a process framework to enable an organization to prove that it is performing ITAM to a standard sufficient to satisfy [[Corporate governance of information technology|corporate governance]] requirements and ensure effective support for [[IT service management]] overall.\n# ISO/IEC 19770-2 provides an ITAM data standard for software identification tags (\"SWID\").\n# ISO/IEC 19770-3 provides an ITAM data standard for software entitlements, including usage rights, limitations and metrics (\"ENT\").\n# ISO/IEC 19770-4 provides an ITAM data standard for Resource Utilization Measurement (\"RUM\")\n# ISO/IEC 19770-5 provides the overview and vocabulary.\n\n[[File:19770 Family Block Diagram.jpg|thumb|none|19770 Family Block Diagram]]\n\n==ISO/IEC 19770-1: Processes==\nISO/IEC 19770-1 is a framework of ITAM processes to enable an organization to prove that it is performing software asset management to a standard sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT service management overall. ISO/IEC 19770-1:2017 specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and improvement of a management system for IT asset management (ITAM), referred to as an \u201cIT asset management system\u201d (ITAMS).\n\nWhile ISO 55001:2014 specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and improvement of a management system for asset management, referred to as an \u201casset management system\u201d, it is primarily focused on physical assets with little provision for the management of software assets. There are a number of characteristics of IT assets which create additional or more detailed requirements. As a result of these characteristics of IT assets, the 19770-1 management system for IT assets has explicit additional requirements dealing with:\n\n* controls over software modification, duplication and distribution, with particular emphasis on access and integrity controls;\n* audit trails of authorizations and of changes made to IT assets;\n* controls over licensing, underlicensing, overlicensing, and compliance with licensing terms and conditions;\n* controls over situations involving mixed ownership and responsibilities, such as in cloud computing and with \u2018Bring-Your-Own-Device\u2019 (BYOD) practices; and\n* reconciliation of IT asset management data with data in other information systems when justified by business value, in particular with financial information systems recording assets and expenses.\n\n=== Updates to 19770-1===\n\nThe first generation was published in 2006.\n\nThe second generation was published in 2012. It retained the original content (with only minor changes) but splits the standard up into four tiers which can be attained sequentially. These tiers are:\n\n* Tier 1: Trustworthy Data\n* Tier 2: Practical Management\n* Tier 3: Operational Integration\n* Tier 4: Full ISO/IEC ITAM Conformance\n\n'''ISO 19770-1 Edition 3 (current version)'''\n\nThe most recent version, known as ISO 19770-1:2017 and published in December 2017, specifies the requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of a management system for IT asset management (ITAM), referred to as an IT asset management system. ISO 19770-1:2017 was a major update and was rewrote the standard to conform to the ISO Management System Standards (MSS)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/management-system-standards.html|title=ISO MSS Standards|author=|date=|website=ISO.org|accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> format.

The organization determines to which of its IT assets this document applies.\nThis document is primarily intended for use by:\n* those involved in the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of an IT asset management system;\n* those involved in delivering IT asset management activities, including service providers;\n* internal and external parties to assess the organization\u2019s ability to meet legal, regulatory and contractual requirements and the organization\u2019s own requirements.\n\n=== Preview of 19770-1===\nAn [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-1:ed-3:v1:en overview] of the standard is available from ISO and is available in English<ref>[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-1:ed-3:v1:en]</ref>\n\n==ISO/IEC 19770-2: software identification tag==\nISO/IEC 19770-2 provides an ITAM data standard for software identification (SWID) tags. Software ID tags provide authoritative identifying information for installed software or other licensable item (such as [[Computer font|fonts]] or copyrighted papers).\n\n=== Overview of SWID tags in use ===\n\nThere are three primary methods that may be used to ensure SWID tags are available on devices with installed software:\n* SWID tags created by a software creator or publisher which are installed with the software are the most authoritative for identification purposes.\n* Organizations can create their own SWID tags for any software title that does not include a tag, allowing the organization to more accurately track software installations in their network environment\n* Third party discovery tools may optionally add tags to a device as software titles are discovered\n\nProviding accurate software identification data improves organizational security, and lowers the cost and increases the capability of many IT processes such as  [[Patch (computing)|patch]] management, desktop management, help desk management, software policy compliance, etc.\n\nDiscovery tools, or processes that utilize SWID tag data to determine the [[Database normalization|normalized]] names and values that are associated with a software application and ensure that all tools and processes used by an organization refer to software products with the same exact names and values.\n\n=== Standards development information ===\n\nThis standard was first published in November 2009.<ref>[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-2:ed-1:v1:en ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009(en)]</ref>  A revision of this standard was published in October 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=65666|title=ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 - Information technology -- Software asset management -- Part 2: Software identification tag|author=|date=|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nSteve Klos<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/steve-klos|title=Steve Klos|author=|date=|website=linkedin.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> is the editor of 19770-2 and works for 1E, Inc as a SAM Subject Matter Expert.\n\n=== Non-profit organizational support ===\n\nIn 2009, a non-profit organization called TagVault.org<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagvault.org|title=Home - TagVault.org |website=www.tagvault.org |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> was formed under [[IEEE-ISTO]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee-isto.org|title=IEEE-ISTO|author=|date=|website=IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> to press for using SWID tags. TagVault.org acts as a registration and certification authority for ISO/IEC 19770-2 software identification tags (SWID tags) and will provide tools and services allowing all SAM ecosystem members to take advantage of SWID tags faster, with a lower cost and with more industry compatibility than would otherwise be possible. SWID tags can be created by anyone, so individuals and organizations are not required to be part of TagVault.org to create or distribute tags.\n\n=== Commercial organizational support===\n\nNumerous [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] installation packaging tools utilize SWID tags including:\n* Caphyon's Advanced Installer\n* [[Flexera Software]]'s [[InstallShield]]\n* Flexera Software's [[InstallAnywhere]]\n* [[Open-source license|Open Source]] - [[WiX|Windows Installer XML Toolset (WiX)]]\n\nMany software discovery tools already utilize SWID tags, including [[Altiris]], Aspera SmartCollect, DeskCenter Management Suite, [[Belarc]]'s BelManage, Sassafras Software's K2-KeyServer, Snow Inventory, [[CA, Inc.|CA Technologies]] discovery tools, Eracent's EnterpriseAM, Flexera Software's FlexNet Manager Platform, [[Hewlett-Packard|HP's]] Universal Discovery, [[IBM]] [[Tivoli Endpoint Manager|Endpoint Manager]], [[Microsoft Servers|Microsoft's System Center]] 2012 R2 Configuration Manager, and [[Loginventory]].\n\n[[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] has released multiple versions of their [[Adobe Creative Suite|Creative Suites]] and  [[Adobe Creative Cloud|Creative Cloud]] products with SWID tags.\n\n[[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]] has also released multiple products that include SWID tags and is committed to helping move the software community to a more consistent and normalized approach to software identification and eventually to a more automated approach to compliance.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160628120327/http://digimindcenter.com/symantec/ see]</ref>\n\n[[Microsoft]] Corporation has been adding SWID tags to all new releases of software products since [[Windows 8]] was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/sam/en/us/softwareid.aspx|title=Control.

Grow.|author=|date=|website=www.microsoft.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIBM started shipping tags with some software products in early 2014, but as of November, all releases of IBM software include SWID tags. This equates to approximately 300 product releases a month that include SWID tags.\n\n=== Governmental support ===\n\nThe [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] has identified 19770-2 SWID tags as an important aspect of the efforts necessary to manage compliance, logistics and security software processes. The 19770-2 standard is included on the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] Information Standards Registry (DISR) as an emerging standard as of September 2012. The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and the [[National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence]] (NCCoE) in 2015 [https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/library/project-descriptions/sam-project-description-final.pdf discussed] the need for SWIDs in the marketplace.<ref>A copy of that presentation is available  [http://www.fbcinc.com/e/cif/presentations/Klos_Waltermire_Unlocking_Organizational_Software_Inventory_Data.pdf here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120330/http://www.fbcinc.com/e/cif/presentations/Klos_Waltermire_Unlocking_Organizational_Software_Inventory_Data.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}</ref>\n\n=== Standards development organization support ===\n\nThe [[Trusted Computing Group]] (TCG) is developing a standard TNC SWID Messages and Attributes for IF-M Specification<ref>[http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tnc_swid_messages_and_attributes_for_ifm_specification TNC SWID Messages and Attributes for IF-M Specification]</ref> that utilizes tag data for security purposes.\n\n[[National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence|The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)]] has documented the Software Asset Management Continuous Monitoring building block<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/SAM.pdf|title=NCCoE|author=|date=|website=nccoe.nist.gov|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> that specifies how SWID tags are used for the near real-time identification of software.\n\n[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] is in the process of creating documentation that specifies how SWID tags will be used by governmental organizations including the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]].

While the specifications provide many opportunities for improvement in entitlement processes and practices, they must be able to handle existing licensing transactions without imposing requirements which would prevent such transactions being codified into Ent records.\n\n====Maximum possible alignment with the software identification tag specification (ISO/IEC 19770-2)====\n\nThis part of ISO/IEC 19770 (entitlement schema) is intended to align closely with part 2 of the standard (software identification tags). This should facilitate both understanding and their joint use. Furthermore, any of the elements, attributes, or other specifications of part 2 which the ENT creator may wish to utilize may be used in this part as well.\n\n===Stakeholder benefits===\n\nIt is intended that this standardized schema will be of benefit to all stakeholders involved in the creation, licensing, distribution, release, installation, and ongoing management of software and software entitlements.\n\n*Benefits to software licensors who provide  ENTs include, but are not limited to:\n** Immediate software customer recognition of details of the usage rights derived from their software entitlement.\n** Ability to specify details to customers that allow software assets to be measured and reported for license compliance purposes.\n** Increased awareness of software license compliance issues on the part of end-customers.\n** Improved software customer relationships through quicker and more effective license compliance audits.\n*Benefits to SAM tool providers, deployment tool providers, re-sellers, value-added re-sellers, packagers and release managers include, but are not limited to:\n** Receipt of consistent and uniform data from software licensors and  ENT creators.\n** More consistent and structured entitlement information, supporting the use of automated techniques to determine the need for remediation of software licensing.\n** Improved reporting from additional categorization made possible by the use of  ENTs.\n** Improved SAM tool entitlement reconciliation capabilities resulting from standardization in location and format of software entitlement data.\n** Ability to deliver value-added functionality for compliance management through the consumption of entitlement data.\n*The benefits for software customers, SAM practitioners, IT support professionals and end users of a given software configuration item include, but are not limited to:\n** Receipt of consistent and uniform data from software licensors, resellers and SAM tools providers.\n** More consistent and structured entitlement information supporting the use of automated techniques to determine the need for remediation of software licensing.\n** Improved reporting from additional categorization made possible by the use of  ENTs.\n** Improved SAM and software license compliance capabilities stemming from standardized, software licensor-supplied, ISO/IEC 19770-2 software identification tags to reconcile with these  ENTs.\n** Improved ability to avoid software license under-procurement or over-procurement with subsequent cost optimization.\n** Standardized usage across multiple platforms, rendering heterogeneous computing environments more manageable.\n\nThe [https://www.itassetmanagement.net ITAM Review] developed a podcast with the 19770-3 project editor how end-user organizations can leverage this standard to their benefit.

A RUM is a standardized structure containing usage information about the resources that are related to the use of an IT asset. A RUM will often be provided in an XML data file, but the same information may be accessible through other means depending on the platform and the IT asset/product.\n\nThis document contains information structures that are designed to align with the identification information defined in ISO/IEC 19770-2, and with the entitlement information defined in ISO/IEC 19770-3. When used together, these three types of information have the capability to significantly enhance and automate the processes of IT asset management.\n\nThis document supports the IT asset management processes defined in ISO/IEC 19770-1. This document also supports the other parts of the ISO/IEC 19770 series of standards that define information structures.\n\nThe RUM is specifically designed to be general-purpose and usable in a wide variety of situations. Like other information structures defined in the ISO/IEC 19770 series of standards, the consumer of a RUM may be an organization and/or a tool or other consumers. In contrast to the other information structures in the ISO/IEC 19770 series, the entity creating a RUM data on a periodic basis will likely be an IT asset or an automation tool monitoring an IT asset.\n\nThe definition of a RUM will benefit all stakeholders involved in the creation, licensing, distribution, releasing, installation, and on-going management of IT assets. Key benefits associated with a RUM for three specific groups of stakeholders include:\n\n'''IT asset users'''\n\u2014 RUM data will typically be generated and processed by IT assets and automation tools, within the consumers enterprise boundary, for purpose of IT asset compliance and optimization;\n\u2014 RUM data is human readable and can provide improved visibility into resource utilization within IT assets independent of vendor or third-party supplied tools;\n\u2014 the ability to combine identification, entitlement, and resource utilization information together to perform quantitative and authoritative IT asset management, for example, to meet compliance requirements;\n\u2014 a much-improved ability to perform IT asset management in support of green data center strategies such as optimization of the use of power and air conditioning;\n\n'''IT asset manufacturers'''\n\u2014 the ability to consistently and authoritatively generate resource utilization information for consumption by a central facility that is maintained by the creator, or one or more third-party tools, or by the IT asset users;\n\u2014 the ability to support multiple instances and types of third-party tools with a single set of functionality within the IT asset;\n\u2014 the ability to offer a service to track real-time IT asset usage in the field and, when combined with identification and entitlement information, the ability to give advance warning as resource limits are approached;\n\u2014 the ability to offer an alternative approach to asset utilization measurement to traditional techniques that employ key-based, or platform-restricted licenses;\n\n'''Tool vendors'''\n\u2014 the ability to support multiple IT assets, and types of IT asset, without having to create and maintain unique instrumentation that is associated with each asset;\n\u2014 the ability to more easily aggregate usage information across multiple instances of an asset;\n\u2014 a much-improved ability to track resource utilization and IT assets in near real-time.\n\n=== Preview ISO/IEC 19770-4: Resource Utilization Measurement ===\n\nAn overview of the standard is available from ISO and is available in English [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:19770:-4:ed-1:v1:en here.]\n\n== ISO/IEC 19770-5: overview and vocabulary ==\nISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 provides an overview of ITAM, which is the subject of the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards, and defines related terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c055999_ISOIEC_19770-5_2013.zip|title=ISO - International Organization for Standardization|first=ISO - International Organization for|last=Standardization|date=29 September 2006|website=standards.iso.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>  ISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 is applicable to all types of organization (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, non-profit organizations).\n\nISO/IEC 19770-5:2015 contains:\n\n# an overview of the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards;\n# an introduction to SAM;\n# a brief description of the foundation principles and approaches on which SAM is based; and\n# consistent terms and definitions for use throughout the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards.\n\n=== Free copy of ISO/IEC 19770-5 ===\nA free copy of the overview and vocabulary is available [http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c068291_ISOIEC_19770-5_2015.zip here].\n\n== ISO/IEC 19770-8: Guidelines for mapping of industry practices to/from the ISO/IEC 19770 family of standards ==\n\nISO/IEC 19770-8 defines requirements, guidelines, formats and approaches for use when producing a mapping document that defines how industry practices map to/from the ISO/IEC 19770 series.
