It lies among the northern ranges of the [[Karancs Hills]] in its valley. Karancsalja is bordered by [[Karancsber\u00e9ny]] in the north, [[Karancslapujt\u0151]] in the west, [[Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n]] in the east and [[Etes]] in the south. It lies near the border between Hungary and Slovakia. \n\nKarancsalja must have been inhabited since the time of the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian conquest]], since its area - the northern side of the valley - is slightly raised from its surroundings, thus providing a suitable place for settlement.\n\nLike the settlements of the Karancs region, Karancsalja was a typical village on a highway at the beginning of its history, and it was established along the road connecting the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Great Plain]] and the [[North Hungarian Mountains|Highlands]]. Until the middle of the 19th century, this was an important route for the county and even for the country. The traffic here had considerable economic power.\n\nDespite its favorable geographical conditions, Karancsalja did not become a large settlement, although in the second half of the 19th century, with the emergence and rapid development of mining, the village began to grow. More than 1500 people live in Karancsalja today.\n\n<br />\n\n== Location ==\nThe village is located in the northeastern part of [[N\u00f3gr\u00e1d County|N\u00f3gr\u00e1d]] county, in the valley of the Dobroda stream, in the valley of the Karancs Hills, five kilometers northwest of Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n.\n\nThe easiest way to reach Karancsalja is by road 2206 between [[Litke, Hungary|Litke]] and Salg\u00f3tarj\u00e1n, it is the first settlement from the county capital.\n\nIt is also accessible from the main road 22, from where one has to turn east-northeast in [[S\u00e1g\u00fajfalu]], to the 7 km-long side road 22109 through Etes.\n\nFootpaths and forest tracks are available from the village to the [[Karancs Hills]].\n\n\u00a0\n\n== History ==\nKarancsalja is a settlement of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian age]] in the valley of the Dobroda stream.\n\nIt was named after the 727 meters high [[Karancs]] peak, which is situated a few kilometers northeast of the village, on the border of Slovakia and Hungary, is also called \"[[Pal\u00f3c]] Olympus\".\n\nThe village already existed in the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1dian period]]. According to legend, in 1241 King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|Bela IV]] found refuge there one night when he had to flee after bloody [[battle of Mohi]] against the Tatars. Tradition holds that the King's daughter, [[Margaret of Hungary (saint)|St. Margaret]], built the Margaret Chapel on the summit of Karancs to commemorate this famous event.\n\nThe history of the village during the [[Ottoman Hungary|Turkish occupation]] and in the late medieval period is rather unexamined.\n\nIn 1548 it was owned by Ferenc Bebek.\n\nIn 1715, the census recorded 8, and in 1720, 14 Hungarian households.\n\nIn 1770 L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Jankovich, at the beginning of the 19th century Antal Jankovics, and in the early 1900s G\u00e9za Balla were the most important landowners of the village.\n\nThe mansion in the village was built by Mikl\u00f3s Jankovich at the beginning of the 19th century, but was rebuilt by it\u2019s new owner in 1909.\n\nIn 1873 a large cholera epidemic devastated the settlement.\n\nThe coal mines on the outskirts of Karancsalja were of great importance to the life of the population, providing a livelihood for many people in the 19th and 20th centuries. At the end of 1944, the Karancslejt\u0151s mine at Etes, a few kilometers from the village, was a scene of a \u00a0tragic event when seven of the miners who refused to work, in order to get better conditions, were shot dead.\n\n\u00a0\n\n== Population ==\nIn 2001, 99% of the population of the settlement declared themselves to be Hungarian and 1% Romani.\n\nAt the 2011 census, 88.5% of the population said they were Hungarian, 2.9% Romani, 0.3% German, 0.3% Slovak (11.5% did not answer; due to dual identities, the total may be more than 100%).\n\nThe distribution of religion was as follows: Roman Catholic 47.4%, Reformed 1.9%, Lutheran 0.8%, non-denominational 22.3% (25.6% did not answer). \n<br />\n\n== The village today ==\nThe infrastructure (water, gas, drainage, telephone, cable TV) is fully developed, the roads have been renovated. A pavement was built on an 800 m long section in the center of the village.\n\nThe flag and coat of arms of the village were consecrated in 2000, and a memorial erected in honor of the victims of World War I & II was completed that year, and an ornamental park was established soon after. In 2003, the sports field was renovated.\n\nA popular excursion destination is the \"Tavas\" recreation park, where cultural and sports programs are organized on public holidays. The most visited events in the village are the Village Day on the last Saturday of July, as well as the harvest parade and ball in early October.\n\nIn 2015, the Village Library opened in a new location.

Hetrick]] hired famed architectural firm [[McKim, Mead and White]] to design a convention center for the block just north of the city's Atlantic Square, between 6th and Sunset avenues. The firm submitted a plan that called for a 5,000-seat venue costing $75,000 to construct. However, city founder [[James A. Bradley]] owned the block in question, then home to the aging [[Asbury Park Auditorium]], and refused to sell the plot to the city. After Bradley's death in 1921, department store scion [[Steinbach (store)|Arthur Steinbach]] purchased the Auditorium property from Bradley's estate, demolished the auditorium, and constructed the Berkeley-Carteret Hotel on the plot.\n\nThe completion of the third [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]], and the approval of [[Atlantic City]]'s new [[Boardwalk Hall|Convention Hall]], put Hetrick under considerable pressure to construct a similar venue for Asbury Park. \"While we have hesitated, Atlantic City has added $100 million in valuations,\" he told the ''[[Asbury Park Press]]''. \"While the Traymores and Breakers and other imposing structures have been built over a period of 25 years, we can show only the Monterey, the Berkeley-Carteret, the Asbury-Carlton and the Palace\", referring to four then-new seasonal hotels in the resort city.\n\nIn 1927, after a mysterious fire destroyed the 5th Avenue Arcade just east of Atlantic Square on the Boardwalk, voters passed a bond referendum to construct a new convention center on the plot. Hetrick commissioned architects [[Warren and Wetmore]], who also designed New York City's [[Grand Central Terminal]]. The firm's eventual design called for a 1,600-seat theatre to occupy the old 5th Avenue Arcade plot. The theatre was connected to an enclosed arcade that covered the boardwalk. This arcade was connected on the east to a 3,200-seat convention center, offering {{convert|60000|sqft|m2}} of exhibition space. This portion, which would be christened \"Convention Hall\", extended {{convert|215|ft|m}} over the beach and the waterline, and was supported by steel encased concrete pilings. From the time of its construction until a seawall construction project in the 1970s, visitors to the hall could look directly over the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from the hall's easternmost outer walkway.<ref>[http://www.sharrisltd.com/About/Prof.Act.%20Pages/Crack%20Gauge.html \"S. Harris Ltd. Crack Gauge Monitoring\"] \"In the early 1970s, a seawall was constructed to the east of the building and a jetty to the north, to prevent the water from breaking on the piers.\"</ref> Heat was provided in colder months by a system of underground pipes connected to a city-owned steam plant, located at the southernmost end of the Boardwalk. The entire complex was designed in a combination Italian-French style, with an emphasis on nautical themes in recognition of its oceanfront location.\n\n===WCAP===\nIn 1927, AM radio station WDWM moved from its studios in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] to downtown Asbury Park, changing its call letters to WCAP for \"Wonder City of Asbury Park\". The Chamber of Commerce, which owned the station, moved it again into a studio on the northern second-floor promenade of Convention Hall in the fall of 1931. Warren & Wetmore had wired the hall for radio capability, and the on-hand studio allowed the station to broadcast live performances from the venue by the Arthur Pryor Band and the Berkeley-Carteret Orchestra, among other acts. The station broadcast from Convention Hall until 1944, when [[Walter Reade|Walter Reade Theatres]] and the [[Tootsie Roll Industries|Charms Candy Company]] bought the station and moved its studios back to the downtown area. The station switched to FM in 1947. Three years later, the ''[[Asbury Park Press]]'' purchased the station and changed its call letters to [[WJLK]]. It continues to broadcast today from studios in the former [[Seaview Square Mall]] in nearby [[Ocean Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey|Ocean Township]].<ref name=airwaves>Jaker, Bill; et al.

McFarland, pp 49 {{ISBN|0-7864-0343-8}}</ref>\n\n===Convention Hall's Role in the ''Morro Castle'' Disaster===\n{{main article|SS Morro Castle (1930)}}\nOn September 8, 1934, the cruise ship [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] caught fire off [[Long Beach Island]] as she was returning to [[New York City|New York]] from [[Havana]]. After the ''Morro Castle'' could no longer sail under her own power, the [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|Coast Guard cutter]] ''Tampa'' attempted to tow the damaged ship from eight miles (13&nbsp;km) off the coast of [[Sea Girt, New Jersey|Sea Girt]] to New York. However, rough seas from a [[nor'easter]] snapped the tow lines, and the ''Morro Castle'' drifted toward shore. WCAP radio announcer Tom Burley was broadcasting from the station's Convention Hall studios on the second floor promenade at about 7:30&nbsp;p.m. when he first spotted the burning hulk of the ship approaching the beach. As the wire services already knew about the disaster, which had started early that morning, Burley led off his newscast with a straight update about the ''Morro Castle''. A few minutes later, he saw the burning hulk of the ship slowly drifting toward Convention Hall and exclaimed on air, \"She's here! The ''Morro Castle'' is coming right toward our studio!\"<ref name=airwaves/>\n\nThe ship eventually came to rest on a sandbar several yards in front of Convention Hall, with her stern perpendicular to the hall's oceanfront promenade. The following morning, with the hull still smoldering, city engineer James Kontajones and Coast Guard inspector R.W. Hodge paddled out to the stern from a lifeguard boat and climbed up to the deck via one of the ropes hanging down from the ship's D Deck railing. The Coast Guard then used a [[Lyle gun]] to fire several ropes to the ''Morro Castle'' stern from Convention Hall. Kontajones and Hodge used the ropes to rig together a [[breeches buoy]], facilitating passage for firemen, inspectors, local officials, and other authorities who needed to board the ship to search it for victims or anything of value. No living people were found on the ship and most of the decks and cabins were gutted by the massive fire. All told, 137 crew and passengers lost their lives in the disaster. Most of the victims either burned to death or died from smoke inhalation. Some victims' remains were found on the open decks and in the cabins below.\n\nThe ''Morro Castle'' remained on the sandbar throughout the fall and winter, spurring an economic boomlet for Asbury Park, which had been suffering from the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. Thousands of curious spectators and reporters lined both the boardwalk and Convention Hall's promenade to see the ship's charred remains, and both city officials and unlicensed individuals charged upwards of $5 to ride the breeches buoy onto the deck. On March 14, 1935, what remained of the ''Morro Castle'' was finally towed to New York's [[Gravesend Bay]] to be scrapped.<ref>Hicks, Brian. (2006).

Warren and Wetmore strategically placed massive grille work into the walls on either side of the hall's main stage.<ref name=GSTOS>[Garden State Theatre Organ Society \"Program for the 1992 Summer Pops Concert Series\"]</ref> These grilles would cover the organ's pipes while taking advantage of the interior acoustics, making the entire hall part of the instrument.<ref>DeMasters, Karen. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/23/nyregion/jersey-footlights-new-life-for-asbury-park-organ.html? \"JERSEY FOOTLIGHTS: New Life For Asbury Park Organ\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' January 23, 2000. Accessed on April 19, 2009</ref> The [[Great Depression]] forced the city to abandon the original idea of buying a Wurlitzer. After the closing of the [[Earl Carroll Theatre]] in New York City in 1931, however, Asbury Park purchased that theatre's 3 manual/7 rank pipe organ and installed it in Convention Hall. It had been built three years earlier by [[Kilgen|George Kilgen & Sons]] of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Though measurably smaller than the Wurlitzer for which Convention Hall had been built, the Kilgen managed to sound much larger with the help of the hall's acoustics.\n\nIn the 1930s, Asbury Park created the position of municipal organist. The first, G. Howard Scott, would play free concerts to entertain visitors to the resort's boardwalk. WCAP would broadcast some of these concerts to its listeners from its studio at the hall. Jim Ryan took over in 1958, performing until the mid-1970s. The final municipal organist was Al Devivo, who performed from then until 1984, when the municipal concerts ceased.\n\nThe organ continued to be played intermittently from 1984 through 2000, most famously by composer and [[Radio City Music Hall]] organist Ashley Miller. During this time, volunteers from the Garden State Theatre Organ Society began refurbishing the instrument by cleaning or replacing pipes and adding five more ranks, resulting in an even fuller sound. In 1991, the console - traditionally in a stationary position underneath the southernmost grille - was made mobile so as to allow performers to play the instrument closer to the audience.<ref name=GSTOS/> With the fate of the hall left in limbo by Asbury Park's long-delayed redevelopment plans, however, access to the instrument was eventually denied and it has lain dormant for most of the 2000s. It remains one of only two Kilgen organs left in New Jersey.\n\n==Meetings and events==\nThe first official convention held at Convention Hall was the annual meeting of the [[New York Friars' Club]] on July 5, 1930.<ref name=Pike>Pike, Helen-Chantal (2005). ''Asbury Park's Glory Days: The Story of an American Resort.'' Rutgers University Press, pp 54,75 {{ISBN|0-8135-3547-6}}</ref> Since that time, the hall has hosted countless conventions, community meetings, sporting events, trade shows and antique automobile shows. Since 1951, the Monmouth County Cotillion Society has held its annual Debutante Ball at Convention Hall.<ref>[http://www.monmouthcountycotillion.org/informationletter.html \"Monmouth County Cotillion Society newsletter\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813012918/http://www.monmouthcountycotillion.org/informationletter.html |date=August 13, 2009 }}</ref> The hall is also the alternate venue for Asbury Park's Easter Parade in the event of inclement weather.\n\nSince February 2008, Convention Hall has been the home venue for the [[Jersey Shore Roller Girls]] roller derby league.<ref>[http://www.jerseyshorerollergirls.net/about.html \"Jersey Shore Roller Girls Home Page\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429035630/http://www.jerseyshorerollergirls.net/about.html |date=April 29, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Concerts==\n[[File:ConventionHallSideRear.jpg|thumb|right|252px|South rear side of Convention Hall, as fans on beach listen to a closed [[Bruce Springsteen]] rehearsal. Late September 2004.]]\n[[Rock and roll]] has been a mainstay at Convention Hall since the 1950s. On June 30, 1956, a concert by [[The Teenagers|Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers]] at the Hall ended, prematurely, when a fistfight in the audience erupted into a full-scale riot. Three people were stabbed and then-Mayor Roland J. Hines threatened a citywide ban on rock and roll performances. The ban never came to pass.<ref name=Pike/> In the mid-1960s, promoter Moe Septee started booking rock acts at Convention Hall, including some bands who would go on to achieve legendary status.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1975, Septee booked [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[James Brown]], [[The Byrds]], [[Ray Charles]], [[The Dave Clark Five]], [[The Doors]], [[The J. Geils Band]], [[Herman\u2019s Hermits]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Temptations]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[The Who]], among many others.<ref>Golden, Peter [http://njmonthly.com/articles/lifestyle/people/shore-lore-music-man.html \"Shore Lore: Music Man\"] ''[[New Jersey Monthly]]'' February 2008.

From the late 1970s to the 1990s, acts including [[The Allman Brothers Band]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Korn]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Earth Crisis]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Ted Nugent]], [[King Crimson]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Clash]], [[Van Halen]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[The Kinks]], [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]], [[No Doubt]] and The [[Goo Goo Dolls]] played the hall.<ref>Wien, Gary; Rothenberg, Debra L.

Trafford Publishing, pp 15 {{ISBN|1-4120-0314-8}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s Convention Hall gained a strong association with [[Bruce Springsteen]].<ref name=\"moon\"/>  He held rehearsals for upcoming tours there (with fans standing outside to get early ideas of what the shows would bring),<ref name=\"moon\"/> some ticketed public rehearsal shows, and several December holiday shows in conjunction with [[The Max Weinberg 7]].  The large lighted sign on the top of Convention Hall now reads \"Greetings from Asbury Park\", in reference to Springsteen's 1973 debut album ''[[Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.]]''\n\nDuring the 2000s, acts have included [[311 (band)|311]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Deftones]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Killswitch Engage]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Pantera]], [[Mudvayne]], [[Hatebreed]], [[Taproot (band)|Taproot]], [[Seether]], [[Papa Roach]], [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], [[Kittie]], [[Fear Factory]], [[Slaves On Dope]], [[Boy Hits Car]], [[Staind]], [[50 Cent]], [[Tiesto]], [[The Gaslight Anthem]], [[Bouncing Souls]], [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]], [[Thrice]], [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[The Starting Line]], and [[Dream Theater]].

The firm submitted a plan that called for a 5,000-seat venue costing $75,000 to construct. However, city founder [[James A. Bradley]] owned the block in question, then home to the aging [[Asbury Park Auditorium]], and refused to sell the plot to the city. After Bradley's death in 1921, department store scion [[Steinbach (store)|Arthur Steinbach]] purchased the Auditorium property from Bradley's estate, demolished the auditorium, and constructed the Berkeley-Carteret Hotel on the plot.\n\nThe completion of the third [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]], and the approval of [[Atlantic City]]'s new [[Boardwalk Hall|Convention Hall]], put Hetrick under considerable pressure to construct a similar venue for Asbury Park. \"While we have hesitated, Atlantic City has added $100 million in valuations,\" he told the ''[[Asbury Park Press]]''. \"While the Traymores and Breakers and other imposing structures have been built over a period of 25 years, we can show only the Monterey, the Berkeley-Carteret, the Asbury-Carlton and the Palace\", referring to four then-new seasonal hotels in the resort city.\n\nIn 1927, after a mysterious fire destroyed the 5th Avenue Arcade just east of Atlantic Square on the Boardwalk, voters passed a bond referendum to construct a new convention center on the plot. Hetrick commissioned architects [[Warren and Wetmore]], who also designed New York City's [[Grand Central Terminal]]. The firm's eventual design called for a 1,600-seat theatre to occupy the old 5th Avenue Arcade plot. The theatre was connected to an enclosed arcade that covered the boardwalk. This arcade was connected on the east to a 3,200-seat convention center, offering {{convert|60000|sqft|m2}} of exhibition space. This portion, which would be christened \"Convention Hall\", extended {{convert|215|ft|m}} over the beach and the waterline, and was supported by steel encased concrete pilings. From the time of its construction until a seawall construction project in the 1970s, visitors to the hall could look directly over the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from the hall's easternmost outer walkway.<ref>[http://www.sharrisltd.com/About/Prof.Act.%20Pages/Crack%20Gauge.html \"S. Harris Ltd. Crack Gauge Monitoring\"] \"In the early 1970s, a seawall was constructed to the east of the building and a jetty to the north, to prevent the water from breaking on the piers.\"</ref> Heat was provided in colder months by a system of underground pipes connected to a city-owned steam plant, located at the southernmost end of the Boardwalk. The entire complex was designed in a combination Italian-French style, with an emphasis on nautical themes in recognition of its oceanfront location.\n\n===WCAP===\nIn 1927, AM radio station WDWM moved from its studios in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] to downtown Asbury Park, changing its call letters to WCAP for \"Wonder City of Asbury Park\". The Chamber of Commerce, which owned the station, moved it again into a studio on the northern second-floor promenade of Convention Hall in the fall of 1931. Warren & Wetmore had wired the hall for radio capability, and the on-hand studio allowed the station to broadcast live performances from the venue by the Arthur Pryor Band and the Berkeley-Carteret Orchestra, among other acts. The station broadcast from Convention Hall until 1944, when [[Walter Reade|Walter Reade Theatres]] and the [[Tootsie Roll Industries|Charms Candy Company]] bought the station and moved its studios back to the downtown area. The station switched to FM in 1947. Three years later, the ''[[Asbury Park Press]]'' purchased the station and changed its call letters to [[WJLK]]. It continues to broadcast today from studios in the former [[Seaview Square Mall]] in nearby [[Ocean Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey|Ocean Township]].<ref name=airwaves>Jaker, Bill; et al.

After the ''Morro Castle'' could no longer sail under her own power, the [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|Coast Guard cutter]] ''Tampa'' attempted to tow the damaged ship from eight miles (13&nbsp;km) off the coast of [[Sea Girt, New Jersey|Sea Girt]] to New York. However, rough seas from a [[nor'easter]] snapped the tow lines, and the ''Morro Castle'' drifted toward shore. WCAP radio announcer Tom Burley was broadcasting from the station's Convention Hall studios on the second floor promenade at about 7:30&nbsp;p.m. when he first spotted the burning hulk of the ship approaching the beach. As the wire services already knew about the disaster, which had started early that morning, Burley led off his newscast with a straight update about the ''Morro Castle''. A few minutes later, he saw the burning hulk of the ship slowly drifting toward Convention Hall and exclaimed on air, \"She's here! The ''Morro Castle'' is coming right toward our studio!\"<ref name=airwaves/>\n\nThe ship eventually came to rest on a sandbar several yards in front of Convention Hall, with her stern perpendicular to the hall's oceanfront promenade. The following morning, with the hull still smoldering, city engineer James Kontajones and Coast Guard inspector R.W. Hodge paddled out to the stern from a lifeguard boat and climbed up to the deck via one of the ropes hanging down from the ship's D Deck railing. The Coast Guard then used a [[Lyle gun]] to fire several ropes to the ''Morro Castle'' stern from Convention Hall. Kontajones and Hodge used the ropes to rig together a [[breeches buoy]], facilitating passage for firemen, inspectors, local officials, and other authorities who needed to board the ship to search it for victims or anything of value. No living people were found on the ship and most of the decks and cabins were gutted by the massive fire. All told, 137 crew and passengers lost their lives in the disaster. Most of the victims either burned to death or died from smoke inhalation. Some victims' remains were found on the open decks and in the cabins below.\n\nThe ''Morro Castle'' remained on the sandbar throughout the fall and winter, spurring an economic boomlet for Asbury Park, which had been suffering from the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. Thousands of curious spectators and reporters lined both the boardwalk and Convention Hall's promenade to see the ship's charred remains, and both city officials and unlicensed individuals charged upwards of $5 to ride the breeches buoy onto the deck. On March 14, 1935, what remained of the ''Morro Castle'' was finally towed to New York's [[Gravesend Bay]] to be scrapped.<ref>Hicks, Brian. (2006).

Warren and Wetmore strategically placed massive grille work into the walls on either side of the hall's main stage.<ref name=GSTOS>[Garden State Theatre Organ Society \"Program for the 1992 Summer Pops Concert Series\"]</ref> These grilles would cover the organ's pipes while taking advantage of the interior acoustics, making the entire hall part of the instrument.<ref>DeMasters, Karen. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/23/nyregion/jersey-footlights-new-life-for-asbury-park-organ.html? \"JERSEY FOOTLIGHTS: New Life For Asbury Park Organ\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' January 23, 2000. Accessed on April 19, 2009</ref> The [[Great Depression]] forced the city to abandon the original idea of buying a Wurlitzer. After the closing of the [[Earl Carroll Theatre]] in New York City in 1931, however, Asbury Park purchased that theatre's 3 manual/7 rank pipe organ and installed it in Convention Hall. It had been built three years earlier by [[Kilgen|George Kilgen & Sons]] of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Though measurably smaller than the Wurlitzer for which Convention Hall had been built, the Kilgen managed to sound much larger with the help of the hall's acoustics.\n\nIn the 1930s, Asbury Park created the position of municipal organist. The first, G. Howard Scott, would play free concerts to entertain visitors to the resort's boardwalk. WCAP would broadcast some of these concerts to its listeners from its studio at the hall. Jim Ryan took over in 1958, performing until the mid-1970s. The final municipal organist was Al Devivo, who performed from then until 1984, when the municipal concerts ceased.\n\nThe organ continued to be played intermittently from 1984 through 2000, most famously by composer and [[Radio City Music Hall]] organist Ashley Miller. During this time, volunteers from the Garden State Theatre Organ Society began refurbishing the instrument by cleaning or replacing pipes and adding five more ranks, resulting in an even fuller sound. In 1991, the console - traditionally in a stationary position underneath the southernmost grille - was made mobile so as to allow performers to play the instrument closer to the audience.<ref name=GSTOS/> With the fate of the hall left in limbo by Asbury Park's long-delayed redevelopment plans, however, access to the instrument was eventually denied and it has lain dormant for most of the 2000s. It remains one of only two Kilgen organs left in New Jersey.\n\n==Meetings and events==\nThe first official convention held at Convention Hall was the annual meeting of the [[New York Friars' Club]] on July 5, 1930.<ref name=Pike>Pike, Helen-Chantal (2005). ''Asbury Park's Glory Days: The Story of an American Resort.'' Rutgers University Press, pp 54,75 {{ISBN|0-8135-3547-6}}</ref> Since that time, the hall has hosted countless conventions, community meetings, sporting events, trade shows and antique automobile shows. Since 1951, the Monmouth County Cotillion Society has held its annual Debutante Ball at Convention Hall.<ref>[http://www.monmouthcountycotillion.org/informationletter.html \"Monmouth County Cotillion Society newsletter\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813012918/http://www.monmouthcountycotillion.org/informationletter.html |date=August 13, 2009 }}</ref> The hall is also the alternate venue for Asbury Park's Easter Parade in the event of inclement weather.\n\nSince February 2008, Convention Hall has been the home venue for the [[Jersey Shore Roller Girls]] roller derby league.<ref>[http://www.jerseyshorerollergirls.net/about.html \"Jersey Shore Roller Girls Home Page\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429035630/http://www.jerseyshorerollergirls.net/about.html |date=April 29, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Concerts==\n[[File:ConventionHallSideRear.jpg|thumb|right|252px|South rear side of Convention Hall, as fans on beach listen to a closed [[Bruce Springsteen]] rehearsal. Late September 2004.]]\n[[Rock and roll]] has been a mainstay at Convention Hall since the 1950s. On June 30, 1956, a concert by [[The Teenagers|Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers]] at the Hall ended, prematurely, when a fistfight in the audience erupted into a full-scale riot. Three people were stabbed and then-Mayor Roland J. Hines threatened a citywide ban on rock and roll performances. The ban never came to pass.<ref name=Pike/> In the mid-1960s, promoter Moe Septee started booking rock acts at Convention Hall, including some bands who would go on to achieve legendary status.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1975, Septee booked [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[James Brown]], [[The Byrds]], [[Ray Charles]], [[The Dave Clark Five]], [[The Doors]], [[The J. Geils Band]], [[Herman\u2019s Hermits]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Temptations]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[The Who]], among many others.<ref>Golden, Peter [http://njmonthly.com/articles/lifestyle/people/shore-lore-music-man.html \"Shore Lore: Music Man\"] ''[[New Jersey Monthly]]'' February 2008.
