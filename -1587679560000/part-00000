The expression already existed for a long time in continental Europe, before it gained currency in the English-speaking world through the English translation of [[Ernest Mandel]]'s book ''Late Capitalism'', published in 1975.\n\nThe German original edition of Mandel's work was subtitled \"an attempt at an explanation\", meaning that Mandel tried to provide an orthodox [[Marxist]] explanation of the post-war epoch in terms of Marx's theory of [[capitalism]].   Mandel suggested   that important qualitative changes occurred within the capitalist system during and after World War II and that there are limits to capitalist development.\n\n==History of the term==\nThe term \"late capitalism\" was first used by [[Werner Sombart]] in his magnum opus ''Der Moderne Kapitalismus'', which was published from 1902 through 1927, and subsequent writings; Sombart divided capitalism into different stages: (1) proto-capitalist society from the early middle ages up to 1500 AD, (2) early capitalism in 1500\u20131800, (3) the heyday of capitalism (''Hochkapitalismus'') from 1800 to the first World War, and (4) late capitalism since then. Sombart's work was never translated into English, but historians sometimes do refer to ''late [[bourgeois society]]'' in contrast to ''early bourgeois society'' in the 17th and 18th century, or ''classical bourgeois society'' in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] famously declared that there are no \"absolutely hopeless situations\" for capitalism.<ref name=\"marxists_Lenin_1920\">{{citation |first=Vladimir Ilyich |last=Lenin |title=Report On The International Situation And The Fundamental Tasks Of The Communist International |date=July 19, 1920 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x03.htm |access-date=November 29, 2019}}</ref> The [[Communist International]] stated that with the first World War, a new world epoch of wars and revolutions had opened, and it defined [[state monopoly capitalism]] as the highest and final stage of capitalism.<ref name=\"marxists_Lenin_191606\">{{citation |first=Vladimir Ilyich |last=Lenin |title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism |date=June 1916 |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ |access-date=November 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''late capitalism'' began to be used by socialists in continental Europe towards the end of the 1930s and in the 1940s, when many economists believed capitalism was doomed.<ref>See, for example, [[Natalie Moszkowska]]'s ''[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6479733M/Zur_Dynamik_des_Spa%CC%88tkapitalismus Zur Dynamik des Sp\u00e4tkapitalismus]''.

The monastic disciplines of the [[island]] explicitly contained [[homosexual sex]] alongside a variety of prohibitions against [[heterosexual sex]], and it explicitly stated that these rules were only to be applied to [[monks]], and not the common people. It is notable that [[masturbation]] is not considered a serious offense by the order.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.globalgayz.com/asia/sri-lanka/buddhism-and-homosexuality-2/|title=Buddhism and Homosexuality|website=archive.globalgayz.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-30}}</ref>\n\nA sexual non-conformist is stated as being ''Pandaka''. These people were discriminated against in the sense that they were not allowed to be ordained as a monk.

In the 5th century of the Christian calendar, the monk{{Which|date=March 2019}} attempted to explain ''Pandakas'' in his scriptures, to the Buddhist lay people. Other records simply stay silent on the subject. For example, the ''Up\u0101sakajanalankara'', a guide for common people written in the 14th century of the Christian calendar discusses sexual misconduct in depth but makes no mention of homosexual sex.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA number of same-sex relationships were discussed in a variety of poems and literature, such as the literature of ''[[Culavamsa]];'' however, these do not venture into deep eroticism and can also be viewed as a very intense \"[[bromance]]\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[Buddhism]] followed in [[Sri Lanka]] does not hold the view that [[sexual minorities]] would have been discriminated through the philosophies forwarded by the [[Buddha]]. [[Homosexuality]] is not specifically targeted in the [[Buddhist]] scriptures that are followed on the [[island]] and it is thought that this is because [[Buddhism]] did not view [[homosexuality]] as a topic of concern.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://groundviews.org/2007/08/28/homosexuality-buddhism-and-sri-lankan-society/|title=Homosexuality in Buddhism and Sri Lankan Society}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka|Tripitaka]]'' does, however, contain passing references to [[homosexuality]] and [[transsexuality]]. For example, [[homosexuality]] is found in a case of a monk, called Wakkali, who became a [[monk]] due to his intense attraction towards Buddha, or '''transsexuality''' in a case of a man who converted to a woman and married another man. We also find a case where a novice monk masturbated to a high ordained monk.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[Buddhism]] in [[Sri Lanka]] mostly focuses on [[sex]] on a non-discriminatory basis. It holds the view that [[sex]] is 'dirty' or '[[immoral]]' and this is reflected in modern-day discussion about [[sex]], including discussion on same-sex relations. The monastic rules state that monks should be celibate, but note that these rules do not extend to the lay people.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nGround views shares the opinion that [[Sri Lanka]] without colonial influences would have probably held a similar culture to that of Thailand.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Ceylon (Colonialism) ==\n\n=== Christianity ===\nWith the colonial expansion of European empires to the island, also came missionaries from the European church.<ref name=\":1\" /> Dutch traveler Johan Stavorinus reported that male homosexuality \"is not only universal in practice among them, but extends to a [[Zoophilia|bestial communication with brutes, and in particular with sheep]]\".<ref name=\":4\">[Johan Stavorinus, Voyages to the East Indies, G G.

Constitutional Affairs Minister [[G. L.

The monastic disciplines of the [[island]] explicitly contained [[homosexual sex]] alongside a variety of prohibitions against [[heterosexual sex]], and it explicitly stated that these rules were only to be applied to [[monks]], and not the common people. It is notable that [[masturbation]] is not considered a serious offense by the order.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.globalgayz.com/asia/sri-lanka/buddhism-and-homosexuality-2/|title=Buddhism and Homosexuality|website=archive.globalgayz.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-30}}</ref>\n\nA sexual non-conformist is stated as being ''Pandaka''.

In the 5th century of the Christian calendar, the monk{{Which|date=March 2019}} attempted to explain ''Pandakas'' in his scriptures, to the Buddhist lay people. Other records simply stay silent on the subject. For example, the ''Up\u0101sakajanalankara'', a guide for common people written in the 14th century of the Christian calendar discusses sexual misconduct in depth but makes no mention of homosexual sex.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA number of same-sex relationships were discussed in a variety of poems and literature, such as the literature of ''[[Culavamsa]];'' however, these do not venture into deep eroticism and can also be viewed as a very intense \"[[bromance]]\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[Buddhism]] followed in [[Sri Lanka]] does not hold the view that [[sexual minorities]] would have been discriminated through the philosophies forwarded by the [[Buddha]]. [[Homosexuality]] is not specifically targeted in the [[Buddhist]] scriptures that are followed on the [[island]] and it is thought that this is because [[Buddhism]] did not view [[homosexuality]] as a topic of concern.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://groundviews.org/2007/08/28/homosexuality-buddhism-and-sri-lankan-society/|title=Homosexuality in Buddhism and Sri Lankan Society}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka|Tripitaka]]'' does, however, contain passing references to [[homosexuality]] and [[transsexuality]]. For example, [[homosexuality]] is found in a case of a monk, called Wakkali, who became a [[monk]] due to his intense attraction towards Buddha, or '''transsexuality''' in a case of a man who converted to a woman and married another man. We also find a case where a novice monk masturbated to a high ordained monk.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[Buddhism]] in [[Sri Lanka]] mostly focuses on [[sex]] on a non-discriminatory basis. It holds the view that [[sex]] is 'dirty' or '[[immoral]]' and this is reflected in modern-day discussion about [[sex]], including discussion on same-sex relations. The monastic rules state that monks should be celibate, but note that these rules do not extend to the lay people.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nGround views shares the opinion that [[Sri Lanka]] without colonial influences would have probably held a similar culture to that of Thailand.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Ceylon (Colonialism) ==\n\n=== Christianity ===\nWith the colonial expansion of European empires to the island, also came missionaries from the European church.<ref name=\":1\" /> Dutch traveler Johan Stavorinus reported that male homosexuality \"is not only universal in practice among them, but extends to a [[Zoophilia|bestial communication with brutes, and in particular with sheep]]\".<ref name=\":4\">[Johan Stavorinus, Voyages to the East Indies, G G.

Constitutional Affairs Minister [[G. L.
