His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance   [[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]] background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|thumb|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible, that the Northern Italians were more adapt to exploit economically the modern means of communication that the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed even poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854, a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]\nA unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve, and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only element, of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>\n\n=== Education ===\nLiberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and Religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: He created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children, whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, Pius IX created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission in.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>\n\n=== Social life ===\nTheir one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L\u2019Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]\nPius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factors for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>\n\nGreat efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discovers of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>\n[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]\n\n=== Protestants and Jews ===\n{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}\nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>\n\nIn 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\"<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls from [[The Times]], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.\n\n==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==\n\n===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.\n\n===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===\nIn the years that followed, Italian nationalists \u2014 both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution \u2014 saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.\n\n===Second Italian War of Independence===\n[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]\nAfter the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].\n\n===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Merge from|1859 Perugia uprising|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.\n\nA view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th \ncentury is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book \n|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About\n|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,\nwritten by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at \nthe time.

He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>\n\n=== Social life ===\nTheir one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L\u2019Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]\nPius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factors for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>\n\nGreat efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discovers of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>\n[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]\n\n=== Protestants and Jews ===\n{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}\nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>\n\nIn 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\"<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls from [[The Times]], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.\n\n==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==\n\n===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.\n\n===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===\nIn the years that followed, Italian nationalists \u2014 both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution \u2014 saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.\n\n===Second Italian War of Independence===\n[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]\nAfter the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].\n\n===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFinance:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States_under_Pope_Pius_IX"}

This interaction disrupts the formation of ice. The minimum freezing point temperature is about {{convert|\u221236|F|C}} corresponding to 70% glycerol in water.\n\nGlycerol was historically used as an anti-freeze for automotive applications before being replaced by [[ethylene glycol]], which has a lower freezing point. While the minimum freezing point of a glycerol-water mixture is higher than an ethylene glycol-water mixture, glycerol is not toxic and is being re-examined for use in automotive applications.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Hudgens |first1= R.

It is also used as a [[cryoprotectant]] where the glycerol is dissolved in water to reduce damage by ice crystals to laboratory organisms that are stored in frozen solutions, such as [[bacteria]], [[nematode]]s, and mammalian embryos.\n\n===Chemical intermediate===\nGlycerol is used to produce [[nitroglycerin]], which is an essential ingredient of various explosives such as [[dynamite]], [[gelignite]], and propellants like [[cordite]]. Reliance on soap-making to supply co-product glycerol made it difficult to increase production to meet wartime demand. Hence, synthetic glycerol processes were national defense priorities in the days leading up to World War II. Nitroglycerin, also known as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is commonly used to relieve ''[[angina pectoris]]'', taken in the form of [[sub-lingual]] tablets, or as an [[aerosol]] spray.\n\nAn oxidation of glycerol affords [[mesoxalic acid]].<ref name=\"ciri2\">\n  Rosaria Ciriminna and Mario Pagliaro (2003), ''One-Pot Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Oxidation of Glycerol to Ketomalonic Acid Mediated by TEMPO''.

External vibrations, from compressors, engines, pumps, etc., produce [[harmonic oscillation|harmonic]] vibrations within [[Bourdon gauge]]s that can cause the needle to move excessively, giving inaccurate readings. The excessive swinging of the needle can also damage internal gears or other components, causing premature wear. Glycerol, when poured into a gauge to replace the air space, reduces the harmonic vibrations that are transmitted to the needle, increasing the lifetime and reliability of the gauge.<ref>''Pneumatic Systems: Principles and Maintenance'' by S.

When the body uses stored fat as a source of energy, glycerol and [[fatty acid]]s are released into the bloodstream.\n\nGlycerol is mainly metabolized in the liver. Glycerol injections can be used as a simple test for liver damage, as its rate of absorption by the liver is considered an accurate measure of liver health.

The school is situated next to [[Astor College]], a non-selective school.\n\n==School History==\nFounded in 1904 as '''County School for Boys and Girls''', the school was originally mixed-sex but moved into the present building in 1934 from Frith Road, now the home of [[Dover Grammar School for Girls]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dover in the Great War|last=Wynn|first=Stephen|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|year=2017|isbn=9781473827936|location=|pages=168}}</ref>\n\nDespite the severe economic circumstances of the depression, the founder and first headmaster of the school, Frederick Whitehouse persuaded the authorities to provide the funds for a new building in Astor Avenue.\n\nWhitehouse believed in the maxim often attributed to [[Winston Churchill]] that \"we shape our buildings and our buildings shape us\" and, architecturally, the school mixes both gothic and classical influences.\n\nOpened by the Duke of York, the future King [[George VI of the United Kingdom]], DGSB is one of few state school in Britain to have a working organ, which is housed in the Great Hall and leaves for [[Hamburg]] every 25 years for expert care and maintenance.\n\nDuring World War II, the school building was requisitioned and used by the [[Royal Navy]] as a station for [[Women's Royal Naval Service|WRNS]] with pupils and staff evacuated to [[Ebbw Vale]] in south Wales.\n\nA notable feature of the school building is a large stained glass window showing [[St. George]] and bearing the names of past students of the school who fell in World War Two with a separate memorial to students in World War One.\n\n===Post-War Developments===\nFollowing funding cost pressures, in 1991, the school established a joint 6th form with [[Dover Grammar School for Girls]] (DGSG) which continues to this day.\n\nIn 1994, the school became [[Grant Maintained]] after warding off a series of reorganisation proposals from [[Kent County Council]] including a relocation to the ex-Castlemount School Site in 1990<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tutthill|first=Graham|date=3 March 1990|title=Anger over Merger Bid|url=|journal=East Kent Mercury|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> as well as the amalgamation of the 2 grammar schools to a new modern construct in Whitfield in 1993.\n\nIn 2000, a second tower was erected that differed from the design of the existing tower (known as the Old Tower to pupils) to provide additional access to IT rooms built over the school workshops.\n\nIn 2006, as a result of its specialist status as a [[Business and Enterprise College]], the school received additional funding from the government, part of which was invested into a new Business & Enterprise suite.\n\nIn 2008 there were new proposals to move the school to Whitfield to be housed in a new building under the Labour government's [[Building Schools for the Future]] programme<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zendera|first=Yamurai|date=30 October 2008|title=Plans to relocate grammar schools|url=|journal=Dover Express|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> but this was cancelled after the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]] by Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]].\n\nStudents also witnessed the opening of the Brian Haines Suite, formally known as L7 (and previously room 17). This was to commemorate the exceptional amount of time that Brian Haines had served the school, from 1971 to 2009.

The school is situated next to [[Astor College]], a non-selective school.\n\n==School History==\nFounded in 1904 as '''County School for Boys and Girls''', the school was originally mixed-sex but moved into the present building in 1934 from Frith Road, now the home of [[Dover Grammar School for Girls]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dover in the Great War|last=Wynn|first=Stephen|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|year=2017|isbn=9781473827936|location=|pages=168}}</ref>\n\nDespite the severe economic circumstances of the depression, the founder and first headmaster of the school, Frederick Whitehouse persuaded the authorities to provide the funds for a new building in Astor Avenue.\n\nWhitehouse believed in the maxim often attributed to [[Winston Churchill]] that \"we shape our buildings and our buildings shape us\" and, architecturally, the school mixes both gothic and classical influences.\n\nOpened by the Duke of York, the future King [[George VI of the United Kingdom]], DGSB is one of few state school in Britain to have a working organ, which is housed in the Great Hall and leaves for [[Hamburg]] every 25 years for expert care and maintenance.\n\nDuring World War II, the school building was requisitioned and used by the [[Royal Navy]] as a station for [[Women's Royal Naval Service|WRNS]] with pupils and staff evacuated to [[Ebbw Vale]] in south Wales.\n\nA notable feature of the school building is a large stained glass window showing [[St. George]] and bearing the names of past students of the school who fell in World War Two with a separate memorial to students in World War One.\n\n===Post-War Developments===\nFollowing funding cost pressures, in 1991, the school established a joint 6th form with [[Dover Grammar School for Girls]] (DGSG) which continues to this day.\n\nIn 1994, the school became [[Grant Maintained]] after warding off a series of reorganisation proposals from [[Kent County Council]] including a relocation to the ex-Castlemount School Site in 1990<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tutthill|first=Graham|date=3 March 1990|title=Anger over Merger Bid|url=|journal=East Kent Mercury|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> as well as the amalgamation of the 2 grammar schools to a new modern construct in Whitfield in 1993.\n\nIn 2000, a second tower was erected that differed from the design of the existing tower (known as the Old Tower to pupils) to provide additional access to IT rooms built over the school workshops.\n\nIn 2006, as a result of its specialist status as a [[Business and Enterprise College]], the school received additional funding from the government, part of which was invested into a new Business & Enterprise suite.\n\nIn 2008 there were new proposals to move the school to Whitfield to be housed in a new building under the Labour government's [[Building Schools for the Future]] programme<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zendera|first=Yamurai|date=30 October 2008|title=Plans to relocate grammar schools|url=|journal=Dover Express|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> but this was cancelled after the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]] by Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]].\n\nStudents also witnessed the opening of the Brian Haines Suite, formally known as L7 (and previously room 17). This was to commemorate the exceptional amount of time that Brian Haines had served the school, from 1971 to 2009. It was decided that Brian Haines' dedication to the school earned this honour.\n\nIn 2019, plans have been drawn to demolish the existing buildings and erect a new modern school on the adjacent playing fields with completion set for 2022.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Plans to demolish and replace 1930s Dover Grammar School for Boys building, involving Department for Education|last=Lennon|first=Sam|date=27 February 2019|work=Kent Online|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Athletics ==\nThe school has a strong sporting rivalry with Astor College and [[Sir Roger Manwood's School]], a selective Grammar school in [[Sandwich, Kent]].
