It is located in the valley of [[Maurienne]] and crossed by the [[Arc (Savoie)|Arc]] river. Nestled in the center of a former glacial through,  it is renowned for its large [[Nordic skiing]] domain in the winter and for its [[trekking]] and [[mountain climbing]] opportunities in the Summer. Surrounded by lush fauna and flora, the village is characterised by its rich heritage, where wall paintings, Baroque chapels, engraved stones and artisan sculptors are inextricably linked. The legend of the Devil of Bessans admirably describes the originality of this traditional culture that is still very much alive today.\n\n==Geography==\nLocated on the [[Maurienne|Haute-Maurienne]] [[plateau]], at an altitude of 1750 meters, the area is known for its sporting activities.  Bessans is located in a valley, ideal for [[Nordic skiing]]. Following the collapse of the mountain downstream from Bessans (between 10000 and 3000 years BC), an ice-dammed lake formed.  The successive sedimentary deposits have created the plateau on which Bessans is situated.  The physical characteristics of the site are reinforced by an early and high-quality snow from November to April, and by sunny weather.  These allow the team French Nordic skiing and [[Biathlon]] teams, as well as those of other nations to train in Bessans\n\nThere are numerous glaciers in the area (Albaron, Deep sea, Large Pareis, Baounet...), and nearby is the highest peak of the [[Maurienne]] ([[Charbonnel]], 3752 m),\n\n==History==\n{{Prose|date=April 2011}}\n\n===Neolithic era===\n\nThe first traces of the human occupation are found in [[Haute-Maurienne]].  Close to Bessans, on the walls of the [[Rock of the Castle]], one can see cave paintings representing a herd of stags, accompanied by other signs.  [[Flint arrowheads]] and other evidence of early settlement were found at the foot of the rock at the time of recent excavations. It is also known that locally mined  [[serpentinite]] was used to manufacture axes whose specimens were found with more than {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the site.\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe Celts occupied the area.\n\n=== Middle ages ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\n\n574: the [[Merovingian]] [[King]] [[Gontran]] annexes Maurienne\n10th century: Maurienne is subject to invasion.\n11th century: [[Humbert I]] found the \"[[House of Savoy]]\".\n1376: the church existed already has its current site.\n\n=== Early modern ===\n\n1532: the bishop of Maurienne sets up the parish of Bonneval, forming part of the commune of Bessans.\n1576: restoration of the church of Bessans.\n1578: [[Shroud of Turin]] is found in Bessans.\n1600: the hamlet of [[Av\u00e9role]] is carried by an avalanche and is rebuilt with the current site.\n1725: the priest of Bessans creates a public school.\n1762: Bonneval separates from Bessans and becomes a commune with whole share.\n1852: creation of the fair to the cattle which takes place in September.\n1860: The annexation of Savoy by France is voted by plebiscite, as Savoy leaves the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]:  \"Our hearts goes where our rivers go.\"\n\n1869: building of a road between Lanslevillard and Bessans passing by the country cottages of the Madeleine and Chalp.\nEnd of the 19th century: 1110 inhabitants in Bessans, including 52 in Vincendi\u00e8res, 69 in Av\u00e9role, 30 in Goulaz and 73 in Villaron.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n\n1920: construction of the refuge of Av\u00e9role by the CIF.\n1926: restoration of the church.\n1937: inauguration of the road of the col de l'Iseran by the President of the Republic Albert Lebrun.\n1940: On June 14, part of the population is evacuated.

Stones engraved on houses.  This includes the famous external murals from the seventeenth century on the \"dead house\" (after the novel of [[Henri Bordeaux]] carrying this title, and which describes in fictionalized form the life of Bessans in the nineteenth century).  There is also a notable bridge on the Arc River.\n\n=== The Saint-Anthony Vault ===\nThe [[Saint-Anthony vault]] forms part of a network of vaults, oratories and cross on the parochial territory of Bessans. It is a rectangular building built on the sandy spur which overhangs the village, parallel to the church. It dates from the beginning of fifteenth century. It was set up and decorated between 1503 and 1522. The principal frontage is protected by a hood which shelters external decoration, of the [[fresco]]s representing the seven theological virtues followed from the dance from the defects connected by a chain drawn by two demons in direction from the hell. The bell-tower of the vault is assembled on the Western pinion and dominates a roof with double slope in roofing stones. This vault possessed a typical [[Coffer|coffered ceiling]] of the Rebirth with polychrome paintings (1526). On the walls of the vault are forty panels representing the life of [[Jesus Christ]], from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] to [[Pentecost]], in the same style as paintings of the [[Vault Saint-S\u00e9bastien de Lanslevillard]].  Painting is all done as [[fresco]]s, painting with water on fresh mortar.\n\n=== The Saint-Jean-Baptist church ===\nThe [[John the Baptist|Saint-Jean-Baptist]] Church is located near the vault Saint-Anthony, these two buildings being integrated in the \"Ways of the Baroque\".  It is impossible to determine the date of its construction, but it is certain that it existed already in 1376; it underwent many changes over the centuries.  Like all the churches High-Maurienne, it possessed a closed hall. The vault of this hall is decorated in plaster existing already in 1827 and representing the miracle with the Holy Host in [[Turin]]. At the interior of the church, eight arched windows introduce enough light to make it possible to contemplate the vault with medallions. The sight is first of all attracted by the high altar, whose marble is of a beautiful [[Carrara marble]] white, decorated of a Jean-Baptist Saint on the front, of fine facets and drawings. The steps are with notched edges and, on the gate vault, a slim dome is profiled on four elegant posts. This furnace bridge was carried out in 1858. Four other small furnace bridges are on both sides nave of the church. They are dedicated to [[Saint Antoine]], Notre-Dame du Mont-Carmel, Notre-Dame du Rosaire, and [[Saint Joseph]]. Inside the church are murals and religious statues carved by local artists. The bell-tower is of an ancient date. Its structure is the same one as that of the towers known as \"Sarrasines\" that one still finds throughout the valley. It is decorated of four bells\n\n== Art ==\nIn a country of sculptors, Bessans is rich in popular art as in religious art: wheels and stopper rods, hens with salt, wooden toys, statues, and crosses. The best known sculptor was [[Jean-Baptist Clappier]], of the hamlet of [[Vincendi\u00e8res]], one of the first local artists of the [[Baroque art|Baroque period]].  Most famous of the sculptures are those of the [[devil]], the emblem of Bessans, whose origin goes back only to 1857.  This \"devil\" was created by [[Etienne Vincendet]], known by the and of the 18th century as \"of the Saints\" because of his talent as an artist.\n\n=== The Devil of Bessans ===\nIn 1857, the cantors of Bessans were refused by the local priest their annual meals. By small revenge, Etienne Vincendet, cantor, carved in wood a statuette of a  devil carrying a priest, and left it one evening in front of the door of the [[presbytery (residence)|presbytery]].  The priest suspected the Etienne, and brings object back to place it in front of the house of Vincendet.  The sculpture continued to be moved back and forth for a whole month, until the sculptor relents.  A tourist sees work and bought it.\n\nEtienne Vincendet also carved hundreds of statuettes of Saints and the Holy ones, from which came his nickname of \"Etienne of the Saints\". His son Pierre Fran\u00e7ois continued the tradition.  Today, the \"devil\" of Bessans is reproduced on the postal flame of the village and throne on the place of the town hall beside the fountain.\n\nThe work \"ETIENNE OF the SAINTS, INVENTOR OF the\" DEVILS OF BESSANS \", memory of Etienne Vincendet, wood-carver and cantor with the Church of Bessans\", of Francis Tracq, \u00e9d. the Fountain of Silo\u00e9 2006, evokes this sculptor and his works.<ref>History of the devil by George Personnaz (article + podcast) (Guide Latitude Gallimard Maurienne)</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\n{{Prose|date=April 2011}}\n\n*Tourism\n*Sheep\n*Cooperative dairy\n*manufacture of Tomme and Beaufort\n\n==Events==\n*Artisanal fair: third Sunday of September.\n*Employers' festival: June 24; communal: August 15.\n*Pilgrimages: with the vault of Third (3 000 m): July 16; at Notre-Dame-de-Rochemelon(the highest vault of Europe, 3 538 m) August:5.\n*The Marathon of Bessans in January, competition of mass of ski touring, registered in Euroloppet since 2008\n*Biathlon, in March\n*The 2008 Biathlon Summer World Championship\n*The living [[Nativity scene|creche]] of Bessans, December 24, with the baby Jesus, the [[Three Wise Men]], performed by more than 50 Bessanais accompanied by the ass, ox, and a goat, performing the oldest texts and songs of No\u00ebls Bessanais (written around 1650).

It is also known that locally mined  [[serpentinite]] was used to manufacture axes whose specimens were found with more than {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the site.\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe Celts occupied the area.\n\n=== Middle ages ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\n\n574: the [[Merovingian]] [[King]] [[Gontran]] annexes Maurienne\n10th century: Maurienne is subject to invasion.\n11th century: [[Humbert I]] found the \"[[House of Savoy]]\".\n1376: the church existed already has its current site.\n\n=== Early modern ===\n\n1532: the bishop of Maurienne sets up the parish of Bonneval, forming part of the commune of Bessans.\n1576: restoration of the church of Bessans.\n1578: [[Shroud of Turin]] is found in Bessans.\n1600: the hamlet of [[Av\u00e9role]] is carried by an avalanche and is rebuilt with the current site.\n1725: the priest of Bessans creates a public school.\n1762: Bonneval separates from Bessans and becomes a commune with whole share.\n1852: creation of the fair to the cattle which takes place in September.\n1860: The annexation of Savoy by France is voted by plebiscite, as Savoy leaves the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]:  \"Our hearts goes where our rivers go.\"\n\n1869: building of a road between Lanslevillard and Bessans passing by the country cottages of the Madeleine and Chalp.\nEnd of the 19th century: 1110 inhabitants in Bessans, including 52 in Vincendi\u00e8res, 69 in Av\u00e9role, 30 in Goulaz and 73 in Villaron.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n\n1920: construction of the refuge of Av\u00e9role by the CIF.\n1926: restoration of the church.\n1937: inauguration of the road of the col de l'Iseran by the President of the Republic Albert Lebrun.\n1940: On June 14, part of the population is evacuated.

Stones engraved on houses.  This includes the famous external murals from the seventeenth century on the \"dead house\" (after the novel of [[Henri Bordeaux]] carrying this title, and which describes in fictionalized form the life of Bessans in the nineteenth century).  There is also a notable bridge on the Arc River.\n\n=== The Saint-Anthony Vault ===\nThe [[Saint-Anthony vault]] forms part of a network of vaults, oratories and cross on the parochial territory of Bessans. It is a rectangular building built on the sandy spur which overhangs the village, parallel to the church. It dates from the beginning of fifteenth century. It was set up and decorated between 1503 and 1522. The principal frontage is protected by a hood which shelters external decoration, of the [[fresco]]s representing the seven theological virtues followed from the dance from the defects connected by a chain drawn by two demons in direction from the hell. The bell-tower of the vault is assembled on the Western pinion and dominates a roof with double slope in roofing stones. This vault possessed a typical [[Coffer|coffered ceiling]] of the Rebirth with polychrome paintings (1526). On the walls of the vault are forty panels representing the life of [[Jesus Christ]], from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] to [[Pentecost]], in the same style as paintings of the [[Vault Saint-S\u00e9bastien de Lanslevillard]].  Painting is all done as [[fresco]]s, painting with water on fresh mortar.\n\n=== The Saint-Jean-Baptist church ===\nThe [[John the Baptist|Saint-Jean-Baptist]] Church is located near the vault Saint-Anthony, these two buildings being integrated in the \"Ways of the Baroque\".  It is impossible to determine the date of its construction, but it is certain that it existed already in 1376; it underwent many changes over the centuries.  Like all the churches High-Maurienne, it possessed a closed hall. The vault of this hall is decorated in plaster existing already in 1827 and representing the miracle with the Holy Host in [[Turin]]. At the interior of the church, eight arched windows introduce enough light to make it possible to contemplate the vault with medallions. The sight is first of all attracted by the high altar, whose marble is of a beautiful [[Carrara marble]] white, decorated of a Jean-Baptist Saint on the front, of fine facets and drawings. The steps are with notched edges and, on the gate vault, a slim dome is profiled on four elegant posts. This furnace bridge was carried out in 1858. Four other small furnace bridges are on both sides nave of the church. They are dedicated to [[Saint Antoine]], Notre-Dame du Mont-Carmel, Notre-Dame du Rosaire, and [[Saint Joseph]]. Inside the church are murals and religious statues carved by local artists. The bell-tower is of an ancient date. Its structure is the same one as that of the towers known as \"Sarrasines\" that one still finds throughout the valley. It is decorated of four bells\n\n== Art ==\nIn a country of sculptors, Bessans is rich in popular art as in religious art: wheels and stopper rods, hens with salt, wooden toys, statues, and crosses. The best known sculptor was [[Jean-Baptist Clappier]], of the hamlet of [[Vincendi\u00e8res]], one of the first local artists of the [[Baroque art|Baroque period]].  Most famous of the sculptures are those of the [[devil]], the emblem of Bessans, whose origin goes back only to 1857.  This \"devil\" was created by [[Etienne Vincendet]], known by the and of the 18th century as \"of the Saints\" because of his talent as an artist.\n\n=== The Devil of Bessans ===\nIn 1857, the cantors of Bessans were refused by the local priest their annual meals. By small revenge, Etienne Vincendet, cantor, carved in wood a statuette of a  devil carrying a priest, and left it one evening in front of the door of the [[presbytery (residence)|presbytery]].  The priest suspected the Etienne, and brings object back to place it in front of the house of Vincendet.  The sculpture continued to be moved back and forth for a whole month, until the sculptor relents.  A tourist sees work and bought it.\n\nEtienne Vincendet also carved hundreds of statuettes of Saints and the Holy ones, from which came his nickname of \"Etienne of the Saints\". His son Pierre Fran\u00e7ois continued the tradition.  Today, the \"devil\" of Bessans is reproduced on the postal flame of the village and throne on the place of the town hall beside the fountain.\n\nThe work \"ETIENNE OF the SAINTS, INVENTOR OF the\" DEVILS OF BESSANS \", memory of Etienne Vincendet, wood-carver and cantor with the Church of Bessans\", of Francis Tracq, \u00e9d. the Fountain of Silo\u00e9 2006, evokes this sculptor and his works.<ref>History of the devil by George Personnaz (article + podcast) (Guide Latitude Gallimard Maurienne)</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\n{{Prose|date=April 2011}}\n\n*Tourism\n*Sheep\n*Cooperative dairy\n*manufacture of Tomme and Beaufort\n\n==Events==\n*Artisanal fair: third Sunday of September.\n*Employers' festival: June 24; communal: August 15.\n*Pilgrimages: with the vault of Third (3 000 m): July 16; at Notre-Dame-de-Rochemelon(the highest vault of Europe, 3 538 m) August:5.\n*The Marathon of Bessans in January, competition of mass of ski touring, registered in Euroloppet since 2008\n*Biathlon, in March\n*The 2008 Biathlon Summer World Championship\n*The living [[Nativity scene|creche]] of Bessans, December 24, with the baby Jesus, the [[Three Wise Men]], performed by more than 50 Bessanais accompanied by the ass, ox, and a goat, performing the oldest texts and songs of No\u00ebls Bessanais (written around 1650).

Races for all levels are organized.\n\nThe ascent of glaciers (Albaron, Grand Fond, Big Pareis, the Baounet ...), opportunities for loops, the discovery of the highest peak in the Maurienne (the Charbonnel, 3752 m), the Glacier Evettes or Ribon Valley offer multiple opportunities for sporting scenery.\n\n*[[Rock climbing]]: rock of Barmette; rock school of Drailles White; Black cliff of Balme.\n\n===Ski resort===\n2 200 m at the top of the tracks; {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} of alpine ski pistes; {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} of ski touring.\n\n===Other activities===\n*Guided tours of the chapels and church .\n*Fishing, hunting .\n*Botany and fauna marked trail .\n*Nature walks\n*Camping\n\n==See also==\n*[[Communes of the Savoie department]]\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.insee.fr/en/home/home_page.asp INSEE]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{commons category|Bessans}}\n\n{{Savoie communes}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Communes of Savoie]]\n[[Category:Ski resorts in France]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessans"}

Her name is derived from Sanskrit root words for knowing the goal and understanding the objective.<ref name=carol/> Her four arms are symbolic of the four goals of humanity that are considered good in Hinduism \u2013 dharma (pursuit of ethical, moral life), artha (pursuit of wealth, means of life), kama (pursuit of love, emotional fulfillment) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge, liberation).<ref name=ttgov/><ref name=apara>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 57\u201359</ref>\n\nIn Lakshmi's iconography, she is either sitting or standing on a lotus and typically carrying a lotus in one or two hands. The lotus carries symbolic meanings in Hinduism and other Indian traditions. It symbolises knowledge, self-realisation, and liberation in Vedic context, and represents reality, consciousness and karma (work, deed) in the Tantra ([[Sahasrara]]) context.<ref name=parasarthy>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 91\u201392, 160\u2013162</ref> The lotus, a flower that blossoms in clean or dirty water, also symbolises purity regardless of the good or bad circumstances in which it grows.

[[Amrita]], the divine nectar that grants immortality, could only be obtained by churning Kshirasagar ([[Ocean of Milk]]). The devas and asuras both sought immortality and decided to churn the Kshirasagar with Mount Mandhara. The [[samudra manthan]] commenced with the devas on one side and the asuras on the other. [[Vishnu]] incarnated as Kurma, the tortoise and a mountain was placed on the tortoise as a churning pole. [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], the great venom-spewing serpent-god, was wrapped around the mountain and used to churn the ocean. A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning. Along with them emerged the goddess Lakshmi. In some versions, she is said to be daughter of the sea god since she emerged from the sea.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn [[Garuda Purana]], [[Linga Purana]] and [[Padma Purana]], Lakshmi is said to have been born as daughter of the divine sage [[Bhrigu]] and his wife Khyati and was named ''Bhargavi''. According to Vishnu Purana, the universe was created when the ''Devas''(god) and ''Asuras''(evil) churn the cosmic ocean of milk([[Ksheera Sagara]]). Lakshmi came out of the ocean bearing lotus, along with divine cow [[Kamadhenu]], [[Varuni]], [[Parijat]] tree, [[Apsaras]], [[Chandra]](the moon) and [[Dhanvantari]] with [[Amrita]](nectar of immortality). When she appeared, she had a choice to go to Devas or Asuras. She chose Devas' side and among thirty deities, she chose to be with Vishnu. Thereafter, in all three worlds, the lotus-bearing goddess was celebrated.<ref name=buitenen>J. A.

She represents the [[Rajas]] Guna, and the [[Iccha-shakti]].\n\nThe image, icons, and sculptures of Lakshmi are represented with symbolism. Her name is derived from Sanskrit root words for knowing the goal and understanding the objective.<ref name=carol/> Her four arms are symbolic of the four goals of humanity that are considered good in Hinduism \u2013 dharma (pursuit of ethical, moral life), artha (pursuit of wealth, means of life), kama (pursuit of love, emotional fulfillment) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge, liberation).<ref name=ttgov/><ref name=apara>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 57\u201359</ref>\n\nIn Lakshmi's iconography, she is either sitting or standing on a lotus and typically carrying a lotus in one or two hands. The lotus carries symbolic meanings in Hinduism and other Indian traditions. It symbolises knowledge, self-realisation, and liberation in Vedic context, and represents reality, consciousness and karma (work, deed) in the Tantra ([[Sahasrara]]) context.<ref name=parasarthy>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 91\u201392, 160\u2013162</ref> The lotus, a flower that blossoms in clean or dirty water, also symbolises purity regardless of the good or bad circumstances in which it grows.

As a bird reputedly blinded by daylight, the owl also serves as a symbolic reminder to refrain from blindness and greed after knowledge and wealth has been acquired.<ref>Ajnatanama (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, page 317-318</ref>\n[[File:Gaja Lakshmi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Manuscript painting of Gaja-Lakshmi, ca 1780 AD.]]\n\nIn some representations, wealth either symbolically pours out from one of her hands or she simply holds a jar of money. This symbolism has a dual meaning: wealth manifested through Lakshmi means both materials as well as spiritual wealth.<ref name=parasarthy/> Her face and open hands are in a mudra that signifies compassion, giving or ''daana''(charity).<ref name=apara/>\n\nLakshmi typically wears a red dress embroidered with golden threads, symbolizes fortune and wealth.

Certain publishers and journalists consider G2A a [[grey market]]place for redemption keys, often allowing the reselling of keys purchased in one regional market at a much lower price into another region where the same game is priced much higher, a legal route but one that denies publishers some profit in the latter region. However, G2A only acts as an intermediary for individuals selling their keys, sometimes bought with stolen credit cards are sold, ensuring cheap prices for these keys.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://kotaku.com/how-the-controversial-steam-key-marketplace-g2a-got-so-1784669708\n| title=How The Controversial Steam Key Marketplace G2A Got So Big\n| date=2016-01-08\n| publisher=[[Kotaku]]\n| quote=It's cheaper because individuals are selling the keys, not Blizzard.
