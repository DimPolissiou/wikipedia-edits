Her most enduring impact was as one of network radio's more versatile actresses. Often appearing in 15 shows per week,<ref name=nyt/> comedies, dramas, thrillers, soap operas, and crime dramas, she became known as the \"First Lady of Radio\".\n\n==Early years==\nTuttle was born August 29, 1907, at Pleasant Lake, Indiana into a family with strong ties to entertainment. Her father, Clair Vivien Tuttle (1883\u20131950), had been a performer in [[minstrel show]]s before becoming a station agent for a railroad. Her grandfather, Frank Tuttle, managed an opera house and taught drama. Her mother was Verna Sylvia (Long) Tuttle. She discovered her own knack for acting after moving with her family to Glendale, Arizona. She later credited a drama coach there for \"making me aware of life as it really is\u2014by making me study life in real situations.\"<ref name=lat>{{cite news|last1=Thackrey|first1=Ted Jr.|title=Character Actress Lurene Tuttle, 78, Dies|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-30/local/me-8342_1_lurene-tuttle|accessdate=31 August 2015|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=May 30, 1986}}</ref>\n\nAfter her family moved to Southern California, Tuttle appeared in productions at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]], then joined the [[vaudeville]] troupe Murphy's Comedians. By the time of the [[Great Depression]], Tuttle had put her vocal versatility to work in radio, and within a decade, she became an in-demand actress in the medium.\n\n==Radio roles==\nTuttle's radio debut came in 1936 when she appeared on ''[[Hollywood Hotel (radio program)|Hollywood Hotel]]'' with [[Dick Powell]].<ref name=lat/> Despite having never performed before a microphone, Tuttle's audition won her a three-year contract with the program.<ref name=rtm847>{{cite journal|last1=Tuttle|first1=Lurene|title=Luck Is Hard Work|journal=Radio Mirror|date=August 1947|volume=28|issue=3|pages=20\u201321, 81\u201382|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Mirror/47/Mirror-1947-Aug.pdf|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThirteen years later, one newspaper columnist called her \"quite possibly the most-heard woman in America.\"<ref name=hn>{{cite news|last1=Handsaker|first1=Gene|title=Lurene Tuttle Probably Most-Heard Woman in U.

Tuttle recalled:\n\n<blockquote>The real writers on the show had to fix them quite often a lot, because they were really quite amateurish. But they had nice thoughts, they had nice plots. They just needed fixing; the dialogue didn't work too well.</blockquote>\n\nTuttle guest starred on the radio police series ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'', starring [[Jack Webb]], ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' and ''[[Suspense]]'', in the episode \"The Sisters\", with [[Rosalind Russell]]. In ''[[The Whistler]]'', she played good and evil twins and used separate microphones to stay in character for each twin.\n\nIt was during her time on ''Hollywood Hotel'' that Tuttle became involved in the founding of the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists|American Federation of Radio Artists]]. According to Maltin, Tuttle's male counterpart on the show, veteran actor [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]] (a frequent guest performer on [[Jack Benny]]'s program), tried to get both a raise to $35 per show\u2014at a time when the show paid $5,000 per appearance to headlining guest stars. Nelson eventually got the raises, but the negotiations prompted him to become an AFRA co-founder and one of its active members.\n\nTuttle later became the first female president of the federation's Hollywood local.<ref name=lat/>\n\nTuttle also remembered the day the ''Hollywood Hotel'' sound effects man was upstaged by a Hollywood legend:\n\n<blockquote>The soundman was supposed to do a little yipping, yappy dog, like a terrier. He sounded like a Newfoundland dog or something, and the director kept saying \"That won't do.\" So [[Olivia de Havilland]] was sitting next to me, and she says \"I can do a very good dog.\" And I said \"Well, I don't think they'll let you do a dog. This is an audience show; you're a star, you can't do a dog.\" And Olivia says \"I'm going to do it.\" So she went over to the director, went into the booth and said \"I'd like to try doing this dog for you.\" So they put her behind the screen, and she went on the show and she did that yipping dog.\"</blockquote>\n\n== Films and television ==\nTuttle became a familiar face to millions of television viewers with more than 100 appearances from 1950 to 1986, often in the role of an inquisitive busybody. On television and in films, Tuttle streamlined herself into a pattern of roles between wise, loving wives/mothers or bristling matrons. She was familiar to the early television audience as wife/mother Lavinia (Vinnie) Day in ''[[Life with Father#Television series|Life with Father]]'' (1953\u20131955). Columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] called the selection of [[Leon Ames]] as Father and Tuttle as Mother \"what I consider 22 carat casting with two all-Americans.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hopper|first1=Hedda|title=Producer Crosses Sea to Sign Cary Grant|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1953/10/07/page/38/article/looking-at-hollywood|accessdate=1 September 2015|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=October 7, 1953|page=Part 3, Page 6}}</ref>\n\n''[[Heaven Only Knows (1947 film)|Heaven Only Knows]]'' (1947) was her first film.<ref name=lat/> She went on to roles in other films such as [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Macbeth (1948 film)|Macbeth]]'' (1948), ''[[Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House]]'' (1948) and [[Alfred Hitchcock|Alfred Hitchcock's]] ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), as the wife of Sheriff Chambers.

Tuttle recalled:\n\n<blockquote>The real writers on the show had to fix them quite often a lot, because they were really quite amateurish. But they had nice thoughts, they had nice plots. They just needed fixing; the dialogue didn't work too well.</blockquote>\n\nTuttle guest starred on the radio police series ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'', starring [[Jack Webb]], ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]'' and ''[[Suspense]]'', in the episode \"The Sisters\", with [[Rosalind Russell]]. In ''[[The Whistler]]'', she played good and evil twins and used separate microphones to stay in character for each twin.\n\nIt was during her time on ''Hollywood Hotel'' that Tuttle became involved in the founding of the [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists|American Federation of Radio Artists]]. According to Maltin, Tuttle's male counterpart on the show, veteran actor [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]] (a frequent guest performer on [[Jack Benny]]'s program), tried to get both a raise to $35 per show\u2014at a time when the show paid $5,000 per appearance to headlining guest stars. Nelson eventually got the raises, but the negotiations prompted him to become an AFRA co-founder and one of its active members.\n\nTuttle later became the first female president of the federation's Hollywood local.<ref name=lat/>\n\nTuttle also remembered the day the ''Hollywood Hotel'' sound effects man was upstaged by a Hollywood legend:\n\n<blockquote>The soundman was supposed to do a little yipping, yappy dog, like a terrier. He sounded like a Newfoundland dog or something, and the director kept saying \"That won't do.\" So [[Olivia de Havilland]] was sitting next to me, and she says \"I can do a very good dog.\" And I said \"Well, I don't think they'll let you do a dog. This is an audience show; you're a star, you can't do a dog.\" And Olivia says \"I'm going to do it.\" So she went over to the director, went into the booth and said \"I'd like to try doing this dog for you.\" So they put her behind the screen, and she went on the show and she did that yipping dog.\"</blockquote>\n\n== Films and television ==\nTuttle became a familiar face to millions of television viewers with more than 100 appearances from 1950 to 1986, often in the role of an inquisitive busybody. On television and in films, Tuttle streamlined herself into a pattern of roles between wise, loving wives/mothers or bristling matrons. She was familiar to the early television audience as wife/mother Lavinia (Vinnie) Day in ''[[Life with Father#Television series|Life with Father]]'' (1953\u20131955).

British records about the Zou tribe became available towards the end of the 19th century.\n\n== Zou language ==\n{{main|Zou language}}\nZou/Jou is similar to Paite.<ref name=\"bareh\"/> It is classified as a northern Tibeto-Burman tribe.

The [[Maharajah]] of Manipur too did not permit Christian missionaries to work in the Imphal valley. However, a missionary called [[Watkin Roberts]] arrived at Senvawn village in the southern hills of Manipur in 1910. The Zou community did not come directly in contact with any Western [[missionary]]. While their neighbouring communities converted to Christianity, the Zous clung on to their [[traditional religion]] called ''Sakhua''. (In the Chin hills of Burma, the ''Sakhua'' was also called ''Lawki'' religion). This [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] form of worship is broadly and not so accurately labelled as \"[[animism]]\" in the [[ethnographic]] literature. The old ''Sakhua'' used to provide a satisfying explanation of the pre-colonial world; but the Zou colonial encounter exposed cracks in the old system. The experience of many young Zomis as a labour corps in World War I made them more open to Western education. The NEIG [[Mission Compound (Old Churachandpur)|Mission Compound at Old Churachand]] became the centre of literate culture in southern Manipur since 1930. By the time of India's independence, many neo-literates among the Zous were convinced about the power of [[western education]] and medicine, perceiving these things as synonymous with Christianity itself.\n\n===Local church movement under the Jou Christian Association (JCA)===\n[[File:JCA stone.JPG|thumb|left|JCA jubilee monument at [[Daizang]] village]]\n\n====20th-century developments====\nThe pagan ''Sakhua'' religion was under direct assault in Southern Manipur with the establishment of NEIG Mission at Old Churachand (Mission Compound) in 1930. The [[Vaiphei people|Vaiphei]], [[Hmar people|Hmar]], Paite and [[Thadou people|Thadou]] tribes were among the earliest advocates of Christian conversion. Along with the Simte, the Zou tribe was slow in responding to new ideas ushered in by the Christian mission. Perhaps due to their [[anti-colonial]] legacy, the Zous became the last bastion of pagan \"Sakhua\" in the area. Though cultural rootedness has its own merits, it was a setback for [[modernization]]. By the 1950s, there were a handful of Christian converts among the Zous too. But the Zou converts were disorganised and scattered. The new Zou Christian converts joined different [[dialectal]] groups, especially the Paite and Thado Christian groups. Among the intelligent sections of the Zou, there was a strong desire to stem the tide of this social crisis. Their solution was to embrace the local [[Church Movement]] by preserving the unity of the Zou community ironically through mass conversion.\n\n===Social impact of Christian conversion===\nZous today preserve the best part of their traditional culture through their indigenous local church. Their customary laws related to marriage practices have been institutionalized by the church. Their tribal musical instrument (''khuang'' made of wood and animal skin) is an integral part of [[church music]]. The Bible translations and hymnals preserved the best part of their traditional vocabulary harnessed to a different purpose. According to K.S. Singh, \"The introduction of a new religion [Christianity] has not made any impact on their folk songs, the institution of indongta, and customs related to marriage, bride price and the dissolution of marriage. However, ancestor worship is being abandoned.\"<ref>Singh, K.S. Singh (1994) People of India, National Series Volume III, The Scheduled Tribes, New Delhi: Oxford University Press,  pp. 1204 - 1207</ref>\n\nRecent scholarship, however, pointed out that Bible translations among the tribes of [[North-East India]] have become a victim of dialectal [[chauvinism]]<ref>Go, Khup Za (1996) ''A Critical Historical Study of Bible Translations among the Zou people in Northeast India'', Churachandpur: Chin Baptist Literature Board</ref> Multiplying Bible translations in closely related but slightly different dialects have canonized and hardened ethnic divisions within the tribal groups of Manipur. For instance, the Zou language itself constitutes dialectal variants like Haidawi, Khuangnung, Thangkhal, Khodai and Tungkua.<ref>Zou, David Vumlallian (2009) \"The Pasts of a fringe Community: Ethno-history and fluid identity of the Zou in Manipur\" ''Indian Historical Review'', 36 (2) 209 - 235 http://ihr.sagepub.com/content/36/2/209.abstract</ref> All these dialects contribute to Zou language in a process of give and take. Nevertheless, Haidawi is usually promoted as the standard literary language in the vernacular Bible and hymnals.<ref name=\"autogenerated223\">Zou, David Vumlallian (2009) \"The Pasts of a fringe Community\" ibid., p. 223</ref> Meanwhile, Khuangnung is popular among urban Zou speakers and Thangkhal heavily influences traditional Zou folk songs. Tungkua and Khodai still remain confined to remote villages. The inclusion of Zou as a Major Indian Language (till Standard XII) by the government of Manipur also contributed to the evolution of Zou as a standard literary language.<ref name=\"autogenerated223\"/>\n\nThe Zous in Burma constitute a distinct Zou dialect influenced primarily by [[Tedim language|Tedim Chin]]. Though the Zous in India and Burma had been using a common Bible for decades, the Zous in Burma recently came up with their own [[Bible translation]]. At present, it is difficult to assess the social impact of such translation projects.\n\n===Patriarchy and tribal Christianity===\nIn early 1925, Pu Hang Za Kham of Lungtak Village, Tonzang Township, Chin State, Burma (Myanmar) was converted to Christianity by Evangelist Vial Nang, and became the first Christian convert among Zo people. Access to modern education since the 1950s and 60s empowered some Zou women in the \"secular\" sphere and the[job market. But ironically women are still discriminated in the \"sacred\" sphere of the church on gender basis. The Zou society, despite Christian conversion, still staunchly maintains its old patriarchal structure. The first generation of educated Zomi women, like Khan Niang and Geneve Vung Za Mawi, championed the cause of female education as late as the 1970s.<ref>Lalnunmawi, E (1996) ''Impact of Christianity on the Zou women'' (Unpublised Dissertation) Banglalore: South Asia Institute of Advanced Christian Studies (SAIACS)</ref> A handful of Zou women (such as Dim Kho Chin, Ning Hoih Kim, and Ngai Vung) graduated in [[theology]] in the 1980s. There is limited space for women theologians within the formal church structure which is jealously guarded as a privileged male enclave. The church hierarchy still excludes women from any position of authority and \"ordained\" offices like that of [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] or [[elder (Christianity)|elder]]. Despite the advances made by women in the secular world, a recent study suggests that the status of women has been degraded (not upgraded) within the patriarchal world of the tribal church (cf. Downs 1996: 80-81).<ref>Downs, Frederick S. (1996) ''The Christian Impact on the Status of Women in North East Inda'', Shillong: NEHU Publications</ref>\n\nHowever, women are encouraged in [[fundraising]] projects where they have made excellent contributions through strategies like ''antang pham'' (handful of rice collection), ''thabituh'' (annual labour targets), and ''veipung'' (profitable micro-investment). ''Antang pham'' remains the main source of fund raising by ladies. The idea was originally imported from [[Mizoram]] where women like Chhingtei of Durtlang and Siniboni (a Khasi lady) were instrumental in introducing the practice, sometime in 1913.<ref>Ralte, Lalrinawmi (2004) ''Bible Women-te Nghilhlohnan'' (In Memory of Bible Women), Bangalore: Shalom Publications</ref> The money collected by ladies is seldom invested in projects that benefit women as a specific group. Given the inequality of opportunities for men and women, this way of resource allocation is questionable. Recent statistics by the census of India (2001) show a significant [[gender differences|gender gap]] between male and female literacy with 53.0% for female Zou and 70.2% for male Zou. Likewise, the sex ratio of the Zous in Manipur at 944 is lower than the state average of 978 (according to 2001 census). This compares poorly, for instance, with the [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] for [[Simte people|Simte]] at 1030 and for [[Vaiphei people|Vaiphei]] at 1001 during the same period.\n\n===Economic and ecological survival skills===\nLike their [[Chin-Kuki]] cousins, the Zous had taken to [[shifting cultivation]] (jhum) ever since the beginning of their recorded history in the 19th century. They traversed several hill tracts between North-East India and[Upper Burma in search of suitable [[jhum]] land. They used iron tools (e.g. [axe, hoe and [[dao (sword)|dao]]) to cultivate sturdy Asian rice through rather primitive method&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes described as \"slash and burn\". They obtained their iron tools through barter trade from Manipur and Burma. In the absence of a [[cash economy]], mithun or [[gayal]] (''bos frontalis'') and rice served as the chief forms of wealth.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe jhum method was ecologically sustainable as long as population increase was minimal and cultivable land was plentiful. But even a favourable population-land ratio did not guarantee against periodic famines called ''[[mautam]]''. Such famines are associated with the flowering of [[bamboo]] whose seeds lead to the multiplication of rats and other pests. In this sense, bamboo was both a curse and a blessing. In the traditional Zou economy, bamboo was a source of food ([[bamboo shoot]]s), building material, household utensils, fencing and [[handicrafts]]. In fact, bamboo was the backbone of their subsistence economy.\n\nThe Zou community in Manipur was exposed to independent India's [[developmental state]]. Since the 1950s, they began to participate in the democratic process, especially [[electoral politics]]. Political pioneers, like T. Gougin and M. Thangkhanlal, emerged from this new political climate in the early decades of postcolonial India. Such developments affected the outlook and livelihood of many Zous who enjoyed [[upward mobility]]. The expansion of the so-called [[Licence Raj]] helped the growth of an administrative town, [[Churachandpur]], in southern Manipur. More enterprising Zous saw new opportunities in this [[urban centre]] and set up their own \"[[colonies]]\" (e.g. Soduh, Sugnu Zouveng, Zomi Colony, Zoveng, Kamdou Veng, [[Hiangzou]], and New Zoveng) to settle in and around Churachandpur town. Better access to education enabled these urban settlers to enter the government civil service sector that grew in the 1970s and 1980s. Within the Zou community, the Church  and other NGOs are significant employers of theological graduates.\n\nIn remote Zou villages, the habit of jhuming continues despite poor productivity. According to the 2001 census of India, around 60% of the Zou population were engaged in agricultural labour. Wet rice cultivation came into vogue around the time of India's independence. Shifting cultivators typically dwell within interior ridgetop hamlets. But permanent plow peasants among the Zous prefer settlement sites near river banks like the Tuitha and the [[Tuivai River|Tuivai]]. Availability of cultivable land for paddy is severely limited in Manipur hill areas. Increased food production through paddy fields supported a growing population in many Zou villages. Yet food production lags behind population increase. The challenge is to escape this [[Malthusian trap]] where population prevents prosperity. As an absolute figure the Zou population is not big, but its rapid rate of growth resulted in [[deforestation]] and [[desertification]] during the post-Independence era which intensifies the rural crisis. Unlike the fertile [[Imphal]] valley, the \"[[carrying capacity]]\" of land in the hills is very limited. The social spill-over effect of this ecological degradation was demonstrated by the [[ethnic conflict]] of 1997-98. The conflict reduced many educated and semi-skilled Zous into [[economic migrants]] to other parts of urban India. Today, socially-mobile pockets of Zou communities live across Indian cities like [[Imphal]], [[Aizawl]], [[Shillong]], [[Guwahati]], [[Calcutta]], [[Delhi]] and [[Bangalore]]. The [[Indian army]] and [[paramilitary]] services also employ a good number of Zous, generally with a low level of skills. But the new economy could not absorb [[unskilled]] and [[illiterate]] Zou villagers.\n\nThe benefits of India's economic reform are yet to reach rural Manipur. At present, militants pose a challenging law and order problem. But the spread of modern technologies like [[satellite TV]] and [[mobile phones]] to the villages gradually expose them to changes in other parts of India since the [[economic reforms]] of 1991. Such exposure might not alter their immediate circumstances, but it provides new aspirational values needed to create an [[enabling environment]] in a democratic setup.\n\n==Political consciousness==\nPu T. Gougin was the best known political leader who hailed form the Zou community. But this political entrepreneur soon transcended the narrow interests of his own 'tribe' to launch a pan-Zo or pan-Zomi solidarity movement to mobilise his co-ethnic members in Manipur, Mizoram and Myanmar.<ref>Zou, David Vumlallian (2010) 'A Historical Study of the Zo Struggle' ''Economic and Political Weekly'' (EPW), Vol. 45, No. 14, 3\u20139 April 2010, pp. 56- 63</ref> A recent piece published from Mumbai by the ''[[Economic and Political Weekly]]'' (EPW) made the following observation about Pu T. Gougin:\n\n\"At a time when tribal leaders were vying for state recognition of their dialectal communities as \u201cScheduled Tribes,\u201d Gougin began to conceive the idea of Zomi, i.e., \u201cZo people\u201d in 1955 while serving as a clerk of the Tribal Development Office, Imphal. This prompted him to resign from his clerical job in 1958, and then pursued BA (honours) at St. Edmund's College, Shillong. As a final year student, he founded the [[United Zo Organization|United Zomi Organisation (UZO)]] at Singtom village (Manipur) in 1961 to unite \u201call ethnic Zomi groups\u201d (Gougin 1988: 3). When UZO was reduced to mere vote bank politics to the complete neglect of wider Zo solidarity, T. Gougin launched on 28 January 1972 a new organisation, [[Zomi National Congress]] (ZNC) at Daizang village (Manipur). He owned a printing press which helped him to propagate his nationalist vision through pamphlets, booklets and ephemeral literature. The Discovery of Zoland (1980) is perhaps Gougin's most enduring political writing\" (p.&nbsp;61).<ref>Zou 2010, A Historical Study, op. cit</ref>\n\n==Journals in Zou language==\n* ''Zogam Thusuo'' - Estd. 1954 - Daily newspaper in Zou vernacular published from Churachandpur, Manipur (India)\n* ''Zopatong'' - A monthly news magazine published at Zomi Colony, Churachandpur, Manipur (India)\n* ''Gospel Tangkou'' - A Christian journal published by the Manipur Evangelical Lutheran Church, Churachandpur, Manipur.\n* ''Khristian Tangkou'' - A Christian journal published by the Zou Presbyterian Synod, Churachandpur, Manipur.\n* [http://melcindia.org ''Gospel Tangkou''] - A Christian journal published by the Manipur Evangelical Lutheran Church\n* [http://zspdelhi.wordpress.com ZOKUOMTHAWN (A monthly news bulletin and online news journal of the Zou Sangnaupang Pawlpi, Delhi Branch)]\n* ''Zoheisa'' - A monthly news bulletin and journal published by the Zou Sangnaupang Pawlpi, Shillong Branch.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140108095846/http://zogamtoday.com/ Zogam Today - A multi-lingual monthly magazine, published by Mr. Nengkhanlun Zou from Churachandpur, Manipur.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130413022316/http://puzonet.com/]\n\n==Select Zou settlements in Manipur==\n'''I.

British records about the Zou tribe became available towards the end of the 19th century.\n\n== Zou language ==\n{{main|Zou language}}\nZou/Jou is similar to Paite.<ref name=\"bareh\"/> It is classified as a northern Tibeto-Burman tribe.

The [[Maharajah]] of Manipur too did not permit Christian missionaries to work in the Imphal valley. However, a missionary called [[Watkin Roberts]] arrived at Senvawn village in the southern hills of Manipur in 1910. The Zou community did not come directly in contact with any Western [[missionary]]. While their neighbouring communities converted to Christianity, the Zous clung on to their [[traditional religion]] called ''Sakhua''. (In the Chin hills of Burma, the ''Sakhua'' was also called ''Lawki'' religion). This [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] form of worship is broadly and not so accurately labelled as \"[[animism]]\" in the [[ethnographic]] literature. The old ''Sakhua'' used to provide a satisfying explanation of the pre-colonial world; but the Zou colonial encounter exposed cracks in the old system. The experience of many young Zomis as a labour corps in World War I made them more open to Western education. The NEIG [[Mission Compound (Old Churachandpur)|Mission Compound at Old Churachand]] became the centre of literate culture in southern Manipur since 1930. By the time of India's independence, many neo-literates among the Zous were convinced about the power of [[western education]] and medicine, perceiving these things as synonymous with Christianity itself.\n\n===Local church movement under the Jou Christian Association (JCA)===\n[[File:JCA stone.JPG|thumb|left|JCA jubilee monument at [[Daizang]] village]]\n\n====20th-century developments====\nThe pagan ''Sakhua'' religion was under direct assault in Southern Manipur with the establishment of NEIG Mission at Old Churachand (Mission Compound) in 1930. The [[Vaiphei people|Vaiphei]], [[Hmar people|Hmar]], Paite and [[Thadou people|Thadou]] tribes were among the earliest advocates of Christian conversion. Along with the Simte, the Zou tribe was slow in responding to new ideas ushered in by the Christian mission. Perhaps due to their [[anti-colonial]] legacy, the Zous became the last bastion of pagan \"Sakhua\" in the area. Though cultural rootedness has its own merits, it was a setback for [[modernization]]. By the 1950s, there were a handful of Christian converts among the Zous too. But the Zou converts were disorganised and scattered. The new Zou Christian converts joined different [[dialectal]] groups, especially the Paite and Thado Christian groups. Among the intelligent sections of the Zou, there was a strong desire to stem the tide of this social crisis. Their solution was to embrace the local [[Church Movement]] by preserving the unity of the Zou community ironically through mass conversion.\n\n===Social impact of Christian conversion===\nZous today preserve the best part of their traditional culture through their indigenous local church. Their customary laws related to marriage practices have been institutionalized by the church. Their tribal musical instrument (''khuang'' made of wood and animal skin) is an integral part of [[church music]]. The Bible translations and hymnals preserved the best part of their traditional vocabulary harnessed to a different purpose. According to K.S. Singh, \"The introduction of a new religion [Christianity] has not made any impact on their folk songs, the institution of indongta, and customs related to marriage, bride price and the dissolution of marriage. However, ancestor worship is being abandoned.\"<ref>Singh, K.S. Singh (1994) People of India, National Series Volume III, The Scheduled Tribes, New Delhi: Oxford University Press,  pp. 1204 - 1207</ref>\n\nRecent scholarship, however, pointed out that Bible translations among the tribes of [[North-East India]] have become a victim of dialectal [[chauvinism]]<ref>Go, Khup Za (1996) ''A Critical Historical Study of Bible Translations among the Zou people in Northeast India'', Churachandpur: Chin Baptist Literature Board</ref> Multiplying Bible translations in closely related but slightly different dialects have canonized and hardened ethnic divisions within the tribal groups of Manipur. For instance, the Zou language itself constitutes dialectal variants like Haidawi, Khuangnung, Thangkhal, Khodai and Tungkua.<ref>Zou, David Vumlallian (2009) \"The Pasts of a fringe Community: Ethno-history and fluid identity of the Zou in Manipur\" ''Indian Historical Review'', 36 (2) 209 - 235 http://ihr.sagepub.com/content/36/2/209.abstract</ref> All these dialects contribute to Zou language in a process of give and take. Nevertheless, Haidawi is usually promoted as the standard literary language in the vernacular Bible and hymnals.<ref name=\"autogenerated223\">Zou, David Vumlallian (2009) \"The Pasts of a fringe Community\" ibid., p. 223</ref> Meanwhile, Khuangnung is popular among urban Zou speakers and Thangkhal heavily influences traditional Zou folk songs. Tungkua and Khodai still remain confined to remote villages. The inclusion of Zou as a Major Indian Language (till Standard XII) by the government of Manipur also contributed to the evolution of Zou as a standard literary language.<ref name=\"autogenerated223\"/>\n\nThe Zous in Burma constitute a distinct Zou dialect influenced primarily by [[Tedim language|Tedim Chin]]. Though the Zous in India and Burma had been using a common Bible for decades, the Zous in Burma recently came up with their own [[Bible translation]]. At present, it is difficult to assess the social impact of such translation projects.\n\n===Patriarchy and tribal Christianity===\nIn early 1925, Pu Hang Za Kham of Lungtak Village, Tonzang Township, Chin State, Burma (Myanmar) was converted to Christianity by Evangelist Vial Nang, and became the first Christian convert among Zo people. Access to modern education since the 1950s and 60s empowered some Zou women in the \"secular\" sphere and the[job market. But ironically women are still discriminated in the \"sacred\" sphere of the church on gender basis. The Zou society, despite Christian conversion, still staunchly maintains its old patriarchal structure. The first generation of educated Zomi women, like Khan Niang and Geneve Vung Za Mawi, championed the cause of female education as late as the 1970s.<ref>Lalnunmawi, E (1996) ''Impact of Christianity on the Zou women'' (Unpublised Dissertation) Banglalore: South Asia Institute of Advanced Christian Studies (SAIACS)</ref> A handful of Zou women (such as Dim Kho Chin, Ning Hoih Kim, and Ngai Vung) graduated in [[theology]] in the 1980s. There is limited space for women theologians within the formal church structure which is jealously guarded as a privileged male enclave. The church hierarchy still excludes women from any position of authority and \"ordained\" offices like that of [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] or [[elder (Christianity)|elder]]. Despite the advances made by women in the secular world, a recent study suggests that the status of women has been degraded (not upgraded) within the patriarchal world of the tribal church (cf. Downs 1996: 80-81).<ref>Downs, Frederick S. (1996) ''The Christian Impact on the Status of Women in North East Inda'', Shillong: NEHU Publications</ref>\n\nHowever, women are encouraged in [[fundraising]] projects where they have made excellent contributions through strategies like ''antang pham'' (handful of rice collection), ''thabituh'' (annual labour targets), and ''veipung'' (profitable micro-investment). ''Antang pham'' remains the main source of fund raising by ladies. The idea was originally imported from [[Mizoram]] where women like Chhingtei of Durtlang and Siniboni (a Khasi lady) were instrumental in introducing the practice, sometime in 1913.<ref>Ralte, Lalrinawmi (2004) ''Bible Women-te Nghilhlohnan'' (In Memory of Bible Women), Bangalore: Shalom Publications</ref> The money collected by ladies is seldom invested in projects that benefit women as a specific group. Given the inequality of opportunities for men and women, this way of resource allocation is questionable. Recent statistics by the census of India (2001) show a significant [[gender differences|gender gap]] between male and female literacy with 53.0% for female Zou and 70.2% for male Zou. Likewise, the sex ratio of the Zous in Manipur at 944 is lower than the state average of 978 (according to 2001 census). This compares poorly, for instance, with the [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] for [[Simte people|Simte]] at 1030 and for [[Vaiphei people|Vaiphei]] at 1001 during the same period.\n\n===Economic and ecological survival skills===\nLike their [[Chin-Kuki]] cousins, the Zous had taken to [[shifting cultivation]] (jhum) ever since the beginning of their recorded history in the 19th century. They traversed several hill tracts between North-East India and[Upper Burma in search of suitable [[jhum]] land. They used iron tools (e.g. [axe, hoe and [[dao (sword)|dao]]) to cultivate sturdy Asian rice through rather primitive method&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes described as \"slash and burn\". They obtained their iron tools through barter trade from Manipur and Burma. In the absence of a [[cash economy]], mithun or [[gayal]] (''bos frontalis'') and rice served as the chief forms of wealth.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe jhum method was ecologically sustainable as long as population increase was minimal and cultivable land was plentiful. But even a favourable population-land ratio did not guarantee against periodic famines called ''[[mautam]]''. Such famines are associated with the flowering of [[bamboo]] whose seeds lead to the multiplication of rats and other pests. In this sense, bamboo was both a curse and a blessing. In the traditional Zou economy, bamboo was a source of food ([[bamboo shoot]]s), building material, household utensils, fencing and [[handicrafts]]. In fact, bamboo was the backbone of their subsistence economy.\n\nThe Zou community in Manipur was exposed to independent India's [[developmental state]]. Since the 1950s, they began to participate in the democratic process, especially [[electoral politics]]. Political pioneers, like T. Gougin and M. Thangkhanlal, emerged from this new political climate in the early decades of postcolonial India. Such developments affected the outlook and livelihood of many Zous who enjoyed [[upward mobility]]. The expansion of the so-called [[Licence Raj]] helped the growth of an administrative town, [[Churachandpur]], in southern Manipur. More enterprising Zous saw new opportunities in this [[urban centre]] and set up their own \"[[colonies]]\" (e.g. Soduh, Sugnu Zouveng, Zomi Colony, Zoveng, Kamdou Veng, [[Hiangzou]], and New Zoveng) to settle in and around Churachandpur town. Better access to education enabled these urban settlers to enter the government civil service sector that grew in the 1970s and 1980s. Within the Zou community, the Church  and other NGOs are significant employers of theological graduates.\n\nIn remote Zou villages, the habit of jhuming continues despite poor productivity. According to the 2001 census of India, around 60% of the Zou population were engaged in agricultural labour. Wet rice cultivation came into vogue around the time of India's independence. Shifting cultivators typically dwell within interior ridgetop hamlets. But permanent plow peasants among the Zous prefer settlement sites near river banks like the Tuitha and the [[Tuivai River|Tuivai]]. Availability of cultivable land for paddy is severely limited in Manipur hill areas. Increased food production through paddy fields supported a growing population in many Zou villages. Yet food production lags behind population increase. The challenge is to escape this [[Malthusian trap]] where population prevents prosperity. As an absolute figure the Zou population is not big, but its rapid rate of growth resulted in [[deforestation]] and [[desertification]] during the post-Independence era which intensifies the rural crisis. Unlike the fertile [[Imphal]] valley, the \"[[carrying capacity]]\" of land in the hills is very limited. The social spill-over effect of this ecological degradation was demonstrated by the [[ethnic conflict]] of 1997-98. The conflict reduced many educated and semi-skilled Zous into [[economic migrants]] to other parts of urban India. Today, socially-mobile pockets of Zou communities live across Indian cities like [[Imphal]], [[Aizawl]], [[Shillong]], [[Guwahati]], [[Calcutta]], [[Delhi]] and [[Bangalore]]. The [[Indian army]] and [[paramilitary]] services also employ a good number of Zous, generally with a low level of skills. But the new economy could not absorb [[unskilled]] and [[illiterate]] Zou villagers.\n\nThe benefits of India's economic reform are yet to reach rural Manipur. At present, militants pose a challenging law and order problem. But the spread of modern technologies like [[satellite TV]] and [[mobile phones]] to the villages gradually expose them to changes in other parts of India since the [[economic reforms]] of 1991. Such exposure might not alter their immediate circumstances, but it provides new aspirational values needed to create an [[enabling environment]] in a democratic setup.\n\n==Political consciousness==\nPu T. Gougin was the best known political leader who hailed form the Zou community. But this political entrepreneur soon transcended the narrow interests of his own 'tribe' to launch a pan-Zo or pan-Zomi solidarity movement to mobilise his co-ethnic members in Manipur, Mizoram and Myanmar.<ref>Zou, David Vumlallian (2010) 'A Historical Study of the Zo Struggle' ''Economic and Political Weekly'' (EPW), Vol. 45, No. 14, 3\u20139 April 2010, pp. 56- 63</ref> A recent piece published from Mumbai by the ''[[Economic and Political Weekly]]'' (EPW) made the following observation about Pu T. Gougin:\n\n\"At a time when tribal leaders were vying for state recognition of their dialectal communities as \u201cScheduled Tribes,\u201d Gougin began to conceive the idea of Zomi, i.e., \u201cZo people\u201d in 1955 while serving as a clerk of the Tribal Development Office, Imphal. This prompted him to resign from his clerical job in 1958, and then pursued BA (honours) at St. Edmund's College, Shillong. As a final year student, he founded the [[United Zo Organization|United Zomi Organisation (UZO)]] at Singtom village (Manipur) in 1961 to unite \u201call ethnic Zomi groups\u201d (Gougin 1988: 3). When UZO was reduced to mere vote bank politics to the complete neglect of wider Zo solidarity, T. Gougin launched on 28 January 1972 a new organisation, [[Zomi National Congress]] (ZNC) at Daizang village (Manipur). He owned a printing press which helped him to propagate his nationalist vision through pamphlets, booklets and ephemeral literature. The Discovery of Zoland (1980) is perhaps Gougin's most enduring political writing\" (p.&nbsp;61).<ref>Zou 2010, A Historical Study, op. cit</ref>\n\n==Journals in Zou language==\n* ''Zogam Thusuo'' - Estd. 1954 - Daily newspaper in Zou vernacular published from Churachandpur, Manipur (India)\n* ''Zopatong'' - A monthly news magazine published at Zomi Colony, Churachandpur, Manipur (India)\n* ''Gospel Tangkou'' - A Christian journal published by the Manipur Evangelical Lutheran Church, Churachandpur, Manipur.\n* ''Khristian Tangkou'' - A Christian journal published by the Zou Presbyterian Synod, Churachandpur, Manipur.\n* [http://melcindia.org ''Gospel Tangkou''] - A Christian journal published by the Manipur Evangelical Lutheran Church\n* [http://zspdelhi.wordpress.com ZOKUOMTHAWN (A monthly news bulletin and online news journal of the Zou Sangnaupang Pawlpi, Delhi Branch)]\n* ''Zoheisa'' - A monthly news bulletin and journal published by the Zou Sangnaupang Pawlpi, Shillong Branch.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140108095846/http://zogamtoday.com/ Zogam Today - A multi-lingual monthly magazine, published by Mr. Nengkhanlun Zou from Churachandpur, Manipur.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130413022316/http://puzonet.com/]\n\n==Select Zou settlements in Manipur==\n'''I.

In conjunction with suitable [[telephony]] hardware interfaces and network applications, Asterisk is used to establish and control [[telephone call]]s between [[telecommunication]] endpoints, such as customary [[telephone]] sets, destinations on the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN), and devices or services on [[voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) networks. Its name comes from the [[asterisk]] (*) symbol for a signal used in [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF) dialing.\n\nAsterisk was created in 1999 by [[Mark Spencer (computer engineer)|Mark Spencer]] of [[Digium]], today a division of [[Sangoma Technologies Corporation]].<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Stephen P. | last1 = Olejniczak | first2 = Brady | last2 = Kirby | title = Asterisk For Dummies | isbn = 9780470098547 | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | year = 2007 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/asteriskfordummi0000olej }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first1 = Jim | last1 = Van Meggelen | first2 = Jared | last2 = Smith | first3 = Leif | last3 = Madsen | title = Asterisk: The Future of Telephony | isbn = 9780596510480 | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media, Inc.]] | year = 2007 }}</ref> Originally designed for [[Linux]],<ref>The README for version 0.1.0 states: \"Currently, the Asterisk Open Source PBX is only known to run on the Linux OS, although it may be portable to other UNIX-like operating systems as well.\" See [http://git.asterisk.org/gitweb/?p=asterisk/asterisk.git;a=blob;f=README;h=c50c462a7bd587dc39c9b16b862d7cf824c1fe80;hb=da258e1541aff8da8512849c302748fde369c8ab here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212090901/http://git.asterisk.org/gitweb/?p=asterisk%2Fasterisk.git%3Ba%3Dblob%3Bf%3DREADME%3Bh%3Dc50c462a7bd587dc39c9b16b862d7cf824c1fe80%3Bhb%3Dda258e1541aff8da8512849c302748fde369c8ab |date=2017-02-12 }}</ref> Asterisk runs on a variety of [[operating system]]s, including [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], [[FreeBSD]], [[macOS]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and can be installed in embedded systems based on [[OpenWrt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/voip/asterisk |title=Asterisk on OpenWrt |accessdate=2018-06-10}}</ref><ref>[http://doc.astlinux.org/userdoc:boot-usb-storage AstLinux: Boot via USB Flash Storage]</ref>\n\n==Features==\nThe Asterisk software includes many features available in commercial and proprietary PBX systems: [[voice mail]], [[conference call]]ing, [[interactive voice response]] (phone menus), and [[automatic call distribution]]. Users can create new functionality by writing dial plan scripts in several of Asterisk's own ''extensions'' languages, by adding custom loadable modules written in PHP or [[C (programming language)|C]], or by implementing ''[[Asterisk Gateway Interface]]'' (AGI) programs using any programming language capable of communicating via the standard streams system ([[stdin]] and [[stdout]]) or by network TCP sockets.\n\nAsterisk supports several standard [[voice over IP]] protocols, including the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), the [[Media Gateway Control Protocol]] (MGCP), and [[H.323]]. Asterisk supports most SIP telephones, acting both as registrar and back-to-back user agent. It can serve as a gateway between IP phones and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) via T- or E-carrier interfaces or analog FXO cards. The [[Inter-Asterisk eXchange]]<nowiki> (IAX) protocol, RFC 5456, native to Asterisk, provides efficient </nowiki>[[trunking]] of calls between Asterisk PBX systems, in addition to distributing some configuration logic. Many VoIP service providers support it for call completion into the PSTN, often because they themselves have deployed Asterisk or offer it as a hosted application. Some telephones also support the IAX protocol.\n\nBy supporting a variety of traditional and VoIP telephony services, Asterisk allows deployers to build telephone systems, or migrate existing systems to new technologies. Some sites are using Asterisk to replace proprietary PBXes, others provide additional features, such as voice mail or voice response menus, or virtual [[call shop]]s, or to reduce cost by carrying long-distance calls over the Internet (toll bypass).\n\nIn addition to VoIP protocols, Asterisk supports traditional circuit-switching protocols such as [[Integrated_Services_Digital_Network|ISDN]] and [[Signalling_System_No._7|SS7]]. This requires appropriate hardware interface cards, marketed by third-party vendors. Each protocol requires the installation of software modules. In Asterisk release 14 the [[Opus (audio format)|Opus audio codec]] is supported.\n\n==Internationalization==\nWhile initially developed in the [[United States]], Asterisk has become a popular [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] PBX worldwide. It allows having multiple sets of voice prompts identified by language (and even multiple sets of prompts for each language) as well as support for time formats  in different languages. Several sets of prompts for the interactive voice response and voice mail features are included with Asterisk: American, British, and Australian English, Canadian French, Japanese, Russian, Mexican Spanish and Swedish.<ref>[http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/sounds/ download page of sound files for Asterisk]</ref> A few novelty prompts are offered, such as jokes<ref>\u05e5 [http://www.speechtechblog.com/2011/02/16/you-are-not-the-next-caller-in-line \"You are not the next caller in line\"], parody on-hold message where a pre-recorded Allison Smith sheepishly confesses (at 0:00:45) that the caller is actually *not* next in queue and would be lucky to get a response at 11:30pm from the cleaning lady after other workers had left for the day.</ref> and a themed \"zombie apocalypse\" message for [[Halloween]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go.digium.com/zombie-proof-your-phone-system |title=Zombie-Proof Your Phone System |publisher=Go.digium.com |accessdate=2016-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004354/http://go.digium.com/zombie-proof-your-phone-system |archivedate=2016-03-05 }}</ref> Additionally, voice sets are offered for commercial sale in various languages, dialects, and genders.\n\nThe default set of English-language Asterisk prompts are recorded by professional telephone voice Allison Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theivrvoice.com/asterisk-voice-recording/|title=Asterisk Voice Recordings|work=The IVR Voice}}</ref>\n\n==Derived products==\nAsterisk is a core component in many commercial products and open-source projects.

This interface (which is at the heart of many of the most popular Asterisk distributions, such as AsteriskNOW, Elastix, the FreePBX Distro, and PBX in a Flash), is unarguably a very large part of why Asterisk has been as successful as it has. With the FreePBX interface, you can configure and manage many aspects of an Asterisk system without touching a single configuration file. While we purists may like everyone to work only with the config files, we recognize that for many, learning Linux and editing these files by hand is simply not going to happen.

In conjunction with suitable [[telephony]] hardware interfaces and network applications, Asterisk is used to establish and control [[telephone call]]s between [[telecommunication]] endpoints, such as customary [[telephone]] sets, destinations on the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN), and devices or services on [[voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) networks. Its name comes from the [[asterisk]] (*) symbol for a signal used in [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF) dialing.\n\nAsterisk was created in 1999 by [[Mark Spencer (computer engineer)|Mark Spencer]] of [[Digium]], today a division of [[Sangoma Technologies Corporation]].<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Stephen P. | last1 = Olejniczak | first2 = Brady | last2 = Kirby | title = Asterisk For Dummies | isbn = 9780470098547 | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | year = 2007 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/asteriskfordummi0000olej }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first1 = Jim | last1 = Van Meggelen | first2 = Jared | last2 = Smith | first3 = Leif | last3 = Madsen | title = Asterisk: The Future of Telephony | isbn = 9780596510480 | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media, Inc.]] | year = 2007 }}</ref> Originally designed for [[Linux]],<ref>The README for version 0.1.0 states: \"Currently, the Asterisk Open Source PBX is only known to run on the Linux OS, although it may be portable to other UNIX-like operating systems as well.\" See [http://git.asterisk.org/gitweb/?p=asterisk/asterisk.git;a=blob;f=README;h=c50c462a7bd587dc39c9b16b862d7cf824c1fe80;hb=da258e1541aff8da8512849c302748fde369c8ab here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212090901/http://git.asterisk.org/gitweb/?p=asterisk%2Fasterisk.git%3Ba%3Dblob%3Bf%3DREADME%3Bh%3Dc50c462a7bd587dc39c9b16b862d7cf824c1fe80%3Bhb%3Dda258e1541aff8da8512849c302748fde369c8ab |date=2017-02-12 }}</ref> Asterisk runs on a variety of [[operating system]]s, including [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], [[FreeBSD]], [[macOS]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and can be installed in embedded systems based on [[OpenWrt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/voip/asterisk |title=Asterisk on OpenWrt |accessdate=2018-06-10}}</ref><ref>[http://doc.astlinux.org/userdoc:boot-usb-storage AstLinux: Boot via USB Flash Storage]</ref>\n\n==Features==\nThe Asterisk software includes many features available in commercial and proprietary PBX systems: [[voice mail]], [[conference call]]ing, [[interactive voice response]] (phone menus), and [[automatic call distribution]]. Users can create new functionality by writing dial plan scripts in several of Asterisk's own ''extensions'' languages, by adding custom loadable modules written in PHP or [[C (programming language)|C]], or by implementing ''[[Asterisk Gateway Interface]]'' (AGI) programs using any programming language capable of communicating via the standard streams system ([[stdin]] and [[stdout]]) or by network TCP sockets.\n\nAsterisk supports several standard [[voice over IP]] protocols, including the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), the [[Media Gateway Control Protocol]] (MGCP), and [[H.323]]. Asterisk supports most SIP telephones, acting both as registrar and back-to-back user agent. It can serve as a gateway between IP phones and the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) via T- or E-carrier interfaces or analog FXO cards. The [[Inter-Asterisk eXchange]]<nowiki> (IAX) protocol, RFC 5456, native to Asterisk, provides efficient </nowiki>[[trunking]] of calls between Asterisk PBX systems, in addition to distributing some configuration logic. Many VoIP service providers support it for call completion into the PSTN, often because they themselves have deployed Asterisk or offer it as a hosted application. Some telephones also support the IAX protocol.\n\nBy supporting a variety of traditional and VoIP telephony services, Asterisk allows deployers to build telephone systems, or migrate existing systems to new technologies. Some sites are using Asterisk to replace proprietary PBXes, others provide additional features, such as voice mail or voice response menus, or virtual [[call shop]]s, or to reduce cost by carrying long-distance calls over the Internet (toll bypass).\n\nIn addition to VoIP protocols, Asterisk supports traditional circuit-switching protocols such as [[Integrated_Services_Digital_Network|ISDN]] and [[Signalling_System_No._7|SS7]]. This requires appropriate hardware interface cards, marketed by third-party vendors. Each protocol requires the installation of software modules. In Asterisk release 14 the [[Opus (audio format)|Opus audio codec]] is supported.\n\n==Internationalization==\nWhile initially developed in the [[United States]], Asterisk has become a popular [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] PBX worldwide. It allows having multiple sets of voice prompts identified by language (and even multiple sets of prompts for each language) as well as support for time formats  in different languages. Several sets of prompts for the [[interactive voice response]] and [[voice mail]] features are included with Asterisk: American, British, and Australian English, Canadian French, Japanese, Russian, Mexican Spanish and Swedish.<ref>[http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/sounds/ download page of sound files for Asterisk]</ref> A few novelty prompts are offered, such as jokes<ref>\u05e5 [http://www.speechtechblog.com/2011/02/16/you-are-not-the-next-caller-in-line \"You are not the next caller in line\"], parody on-hold message where a pre-recorded Allison Smith sheepishly confesses (at 0:00:45) that the caller is actually *not* next in queue and would be lucky to get a response at 11:30pm from the cleaning lady after other workers had left for the day.</ref> and a themed \"zombie apocalypse\" message for [[Halloween]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go.digium.com/zombie-proof-your-phone-system |title=Zombie-Proof Your Phone System |publisher=Go.digium.com |accessdate=2016-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004354/http://go.digium.com/zombie-proof-your-phone-system |archivedate=2016-03-05 }}</ref> Additionally, voice sets are offered for commercial sale in various languages, dialects, and genders.\n\nThe default set of English-language Asterisk prompts are recorded by professional telephone voice Allison Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theivrvoice.com/asterisk-voice-recording/|title=Asterisk Voice Recordings|work=The IVR Voice}}</ref>\n\n==Derived products==\nAsterisk is a core component in many commercial products and open-source projects.

With the FreePBX interface, you can configure and manage many aspects of an Asterisk system without touching a single configuration file. While we purists may like everyone to work only with the config files, we recognize that for many, learning Linux and editing these files by hand is simply not going to happen.
