They are overall [[centre-left]], advocating [[social democracy]], [[nuclear disarmament]] and closer ties to the [[European Union]]. They were founded in 1934 and formed a permanent grouping in [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1967. Their best election result in the 20th century was at the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election of October 1974]] in which they won 11 of Scotland's 72 Westminster seats as well as around 30% of the popular vote, however they lost all but two of these seats in [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]]. Support for the party was bolstered under the leadership of [[Alex Salmond]], who in [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011]] led the SNP to their best electoral performance to date, in which they became the first party in the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] to win a majority of seats. They form the Scottish government, and are now led by [[First Minister of Scotland|Scotland's First Minister]], [[Nicola Sturgeon]]. They have 62 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and 47 Members of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (MPs).\n\nThe [[Scottish Conservative Party]] was founded in 1965 out of the merger of the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Scottish Unionist Party]] with the , which had been a dominant political force in Scotland for much of the early 20th century, winning the majority of votes and seats in the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]]. However the party went into decline, being reduced from 21 Scottish seats in 1983, to 10 in 1987. The [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] was a catastrophe for the Scottish Conservatives, who were left with no Scottish seats whatsoever. However the party won 18 seats in the Scottish Parliament in the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999 election]] due to [[proportional representation]]. Since 2001 the Conservatives have held 1 Scottish seat in the UK parliament. Like the wider [[UK Conservative Party]], the party is a centre-right party, which promotes conservatism and British [[British Unionism|unionism]]. They currently have 31 MSPs, led in the Scottish Parliament by [[Jackson Carlaw]] and 6 MPs.\n\nThe [[Scottish Labour Party]] was the most successful party in Scottish elections from 1959 to 2007. Like the wider [[UK Labour Party]], they are centre-left and they promote [[British unionism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} They first overtook the Conservatives as Scotland's largest party at the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]]. In 1997, the UK Labour Party under [[Tony Blair]] offered Scotland a [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|referendum on devolution]] which was passed with around 74% of the electorate in favour. From 1999 to 2007, they were in power in the Scottish Parliament through a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. From 2008-2011, the party was led by [[Iain Gray]] in the Scottish Parliament, who announced his resignation after the party's defeat at the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 Scottish election]]. [[Johann Lamont]] became leader in 2011 and resigned in 2014 after an internal dispute within the party. They currently have 1 MP and 24 MSPs. {{As of|2019}} they are led by [[Richard Leonard (Scottish politician)|Richard Leonard]] MSP.\n\nThe [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] are a centrist, [[social liberal]] and [[British unionist]] party. The British [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] they are part of were formed out of the old [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] in 1988.

They are overall [[centre-left]], advocating [[social democracy]], [[nuclear disarmament]] and closer ties to the [[European Union]]. They were founded in 1934 and formed a permanent grouping in [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1967. Their best election result in the 20th century was at the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election of October 1974]] in which they won 11 of Scotland's 72 Westminster seats as well as around 30% of the popular vote, however they lost all but two of these seats in [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]]. Support for the party was bolstered under the leadership of [[Alex Salmond]], who in [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011]] led the SNP to their best electoral performance to date, in which they became the first party in the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] to win a majority of seats. They form the Scottish government, and are now led by [[First Minister of Scotland|Scotland's First Minister]], [[Nicola Sturgeon]]. They have 62 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and 47 Members of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (MPs).\n\nThe [[Scottish Conservative Party]] was founded in 1965 out of the merger of the [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Scottish Unionist Party]] with the , which had been a dominant political force in Scotland for much of the early 20th century, winning the majority of votes and seats in the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]]. However the party went into decline, being reduced from 21 Scottish seats in 1983, to 10 in 1987. The [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] was a catastrophe for the Scottish Conservatives, who were left with no Scottish seats whatsoever. However the party won 18 seats in the Scottish Parliament in the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999 election]] due to [[proportional representation]]. Since 2001 the Conservatives have held 1 Scottish seat in the UK parliament. Like the wider [[UK Conservative Party]], the party is a centre-right party, which promotes conservatism and British [[British Unionism|unionism]]. They currently have 31 MSPs, led in the Scottish Parliament by [[Jackson Carlaw]] and 6 MPs.\n\nThe [[Scottish Labour Party]] was the most successful party in Scottish elections from 1959 to 2007. Like the wider [[UK Labour Party]], they are centre-left and they promote [[British unionism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} They first overtook the Conservatives as Scotland's largest party at the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]]. In 1997, the UK Labour Party under [[Tony Blair]] offered Scotland a [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|referendum on devolution]] which was passed with around 74% of the electorate in favour. From 1999 to 2007, they were in power in the Scottish Parliament through a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. From 2008-2011, the party was led by [[Iain Gray]] in the Scottish Parliament, who announced his resignation after the party's defeat at the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 Scottish election]]. [[Johann Lamont]] became leader in 2011 and resigned in 2014 after an internal dispute within the party. They currently have 1 MP and 24 MSPs. {{As of|2019}} they are led by [[Richard Leonard (Scottish politician)|Richard Leonard]] MSP.\n\nThe [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] are a centrist, [[social liberal]] and [[British unionist]] party. The British [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] they are part of were formed out of the old [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] in 1988. Their leader is [[Willie Rennie]]. Since the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition at Westminster, support for the Liberal Democrats has fallen sharply, and the party won five seats at the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 Scottish parliamentary election]]. They also lost their Scottish MEP at the [[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2014 European Elections]]. They also lost 10 of their 11 House of Commons seats at the 2015 general election, with Deputy Leader [[Alistair Carmichael]] the only MP managing to keep his seat. They currently have 5 MSPs and 4 MPs.\n\nThe [[Scottish Green Party]] sit between the centre-left and the left-wing. The party promotes [[green politics]], Scottish independence, [[Scottish republicanism]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]] and [[radical democracy]]. It retains close ties with the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] and the [[Green Party in Northern Ireland]], having all originated in the breakup of the UK [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]].

{"title_page": "Manufacturing execution system", "text_new": "{{Short description|computerized systems used to track and document the manufacturing process}}\n'''Manufacturing execution systems''' ('''MES''') are [[information technology|computerized]] systems used in [[manufacturing]] to track and document the transformation of raw materials to finished goods. MES provides information that helps manufacturing decision makers understand how current conditions on the plant floor can be optimized to improve production output.<ref>{{cite book | year =  1997 | title = Applying Manufacturing Execution Systems | last = McClellan | first = Michael | location = Boca Raton, Fl | publisher = St. Lucie/APICS | isbn = 1574441353}}</ref> MES works in real time to enable the control of multiple elements of the production process (e.g. inputs, personnel, machines and support services).\n\nMES may operate across multiple function areas, for example: management of product definitions across the [[Product life-cycle management|product life-cycle]], resource [[Scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]], order execution and dispatch, production analysis and downtime management for [[overall equipment effectiveness]] (OEE), product quality, or [[Track and trace|materials track and trace]].  MES creates the \"as-built\" record, capturing the data, processes and outcomes of the manufacturing process.  This can be especially important in regulated industries, such as food and beverage or pharmaceutical, where documentation and proof of processes, events and actions may be required.\n\nThe idea of MES might be seen as an intermediate step between, on the one hand, an [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) system, and a [[SCADA|supervisory control and data acquisition]] (SCADA) or [[process control]] system on the other; although historically, exact boundaries have fluctuated. Industry groups such as MESA International\u2014[[Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association]]  were created in the early 1990s in order to address the complexity, and advise on execution, of MES Systems.\n\n==Benefits==\n\"Manufacturing Execution Systems [help] create flawless manufacturing processes and provide real-time feedback of requirement changes\",<ref>{{cite book | year = 2009 | title = Manufacturing Execution Systems: Optimal Design, Planning, and Deployment | last1 = Meyer | first1 = Heiko | last2 = Fuchs | first2 = Franz | last3 = Thiel | first3 = Klaus | location = New York | publisher =  McGraw Hill | isbn = 9780071623834 }}</ref> and provide information at a single source.<ref>{{cite web | date = September 1998 | title = Manufacturing Execution Systems: The One-Stop Information Source | first = Joseph A. | last = Vinhais | work = Quality Digest | publisher = QCI International | url = http://www.qualitydigest.com/sept98/html/mes.html | accessdate = March 7, 2013}}</ref> Other benefits from successful MES implementation might include:\n# Reduced waste, re-work and scrap, including quicker setup times\n# More accurate capture of cost-information (e.g. labor, scrap, downtime, and tooling)\n# Increased uptime\n# Incorporate paperless workflow activities\n# Manufacturing operations traceability\n# Decreases downtime and easy fault finding \n# Reduced inventory, through the eradication of just-in-case inventory<ref>{{cite web | title = Five Benefits of an MES | date = March 12, 2009 | first = Dave | last = Blanchard | work = Industry Week | url = http://www.industryweek.com/companies-amp-executives/five-benefits-mes | accessdate = March 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==MES==\nA wide variety of systems arose using collected data for a dedicated  purpose. Further development of these systems during the 1990s introduced overlap in functionality. Then the [[MESA (association)|Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association (MESA)]] introduced some structure by defining 11 functions that set the scope of MES. In 2000, the [[ANSI/ISA-95]] standard merged this model with the [[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture|Purdue Reference Model]] (PRM).<ref>Johann Eder, Schahram Dustdar (2006) ''Business Process Management Workshops''. p. 239</ref>\n\nA functional hierarchy was defined in which MES were situated at Level 3 between ERP at Level 4 and process control at Levels 0, 1, 2. With the publication of the third part of the standard in 2005, activities in Level 3 were divided over four main operations: production, quality, logistics and maintenance.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2013, additional or revised parts of the ANSI/ISA-95 standard defined the architecture of an MES into more detail, covering how to internally distribute functionality and what information to exchange internally as well as externally.{{citation needed  |date=March 2013}}\n\n==Functional areas==\nOver the years, international standards and models have refined the scope of such systems in terms of activities{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}.  These typically include:.\n* Management of product definitions. This may include storage, version control and exchange with other systems of master data like product production rules, bill of material, bill of resources, process set points and recipe data all focused on defining how to make a product. Management of product definitions can be part of [[product lifecycle management]].\n* Management of resources. This may include registration, exchange and analysis of resource information, aiming to prepare and execute production orders with resources of the right capabilities and availability.\n* [[Scheduling (production processes)]]. These activities determine the production schedule as a collection of work orders to meet the production requirements, typically received from [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) or specialized [[advanced planning and scheduling]] systems, making optimal use of local resources.\n* Dispatching production orders. Depending on the type of production processes this may include further distribution of batches, runs and work orders, issuing these to work centers and adjustment to unanticipated conditions.\n* Execution of production orders. Although actual execution is done by [[process control]] systems, an MES may perform checks on resources and inform other systems about the progress of production processes.\n* Collection of production data. This includes collection, storage and exchange of process data, equipment status, material lot information and production logs in either a data historian or relational database.\n* Production performance analysis. Create useful information out of the raw collected data about the current status of production, like Work In Progress (WIP) overviews, and the production performance of the past period like the [[overall equipment effectiveness]] or any other [[performance indicator]].\n* Production [[track and trace]]. Registration and retrieval of related information in order to present a complete history of lots, orders or equipment (particularly important in health related productions, e.g. [[pharmaceuticals]]).\n\n== Relationship with other systems==\n\nMES integrates with ISA-95 (previous [[Enterprise control#ISA95 .E2.80.9Clevels.E2.80.9D for enterprise integration|Purdue Reference Model, \u201c95\u201d]]) with multiple relationships.\n\n===Relationship with other Level 3 systems===\nThe collection of systems acting on the ISA-95 Level 3 can be called manufacturing operations management systems (MOMS). Apart from an MES, there are typically [[laboratory information management system]] (LIMS), [[warehouse management system]] (WMS) and [[computerized maintenance management system]] (CMMS). From the MES point of view possible information flows are:\n* To LIMS: quality test requests, sample lots, statistical process data\n* From LIMS: quality test results, product certificates, testing progress\n* To WMS: material resource requests, material definitions, product deliveries\n* From WMS: material availability, staged material lots, product shipments\n* To CMMS: equipment running data, equipment assignments, maintenance requests\n* From CMMS: maintenance progress, equipment capabilities, maintenance schedule\n\n===Relationship with Level 4 systems===\nExamples of systems acting on ISA-95 Level 4 are [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM), [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), [[customer relationship management]] (CRM),  [[human resource management]] (HRM), [[process development execution system]] (PDES). From the MES point of view possible information flows are:\n* To PLM: production test results\n* From PLM: product definitions, bill of operations (routings), electronic work instructions, equipment settings\n* To ERP: production performance results, produced and consumed material\n* From ERP: [[production planning]], order requirements\n* To CRM: product tracking and tracing information\n* From CRM: product complaints\n* To HRM: personnel performance\n* From HRM: personnel skills, personnel availability\n* To PDES: production test and execution results\n* From  PDES: manufacturing flow definitions, [[design of experiments]] (DoE) definitions\n\nIn many cases, [[middleware]] [[enterprise application integration]] (EAI) systems are being used to exchange transaction messages between MES and Level 4 systems. A common data definition, [[B2MML]], has been defined within the [[ISA-95]] standard to link MES systems to these Level 4 systems.\n\n===Relationship with Level 0, 1, 2 systems===\nSystems acting on ISA-95 Level 2 are [[supervisory control and data acquisition]] (SCADA), [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLC), [[distributed control system]]s (DCS) and [[Batch production|batch automation system]]s (BAS).

MES creates the \"as-built\" record, capturing the data, processes and outcomes of the manufacturing process.  This can be especially important in regulated industries, such as food and beverage or pharmaceutical, where documentation and proof of processes, events and actions may be required.\n\nThe idea of MES might be seen as an intermediate step between, on the one hand, an [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) system, and a [[SCADA|supervisory control and data acquisition]] (SCADA) or [[process control]] system on the other; although historically, exact boundaries have fluctuated. Industry groups such as MESA International\u2014[[Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association]]  were created in the early 1990s in order to address the complexity, and advise on execution, of MES Systems.\n\n==Benefits==\n\"Manufacturing Execution Systems [help] create flawless manufacturing processes and provide real-time feedback of requirement changes\",<ref>{{cite book | year = 2009 | title = Manufacturing Execution Systems: Optimal Design, Planning, and Deployment | last1 = Meyer | first1 = Heiko | last2 = Fuchs | first2 = Franz | last3 = Thiel | first3 = Klaus | location = New York | publisher =  McGraw Hill | isbn = 9780071623834 }}</ref> and provide information at a single source.<ref>{{cite web | date = September 1998 | title = Manufacturing Execution Systems: The One-Stop Information Source | first = Joseph A. | last = Vinhais | work = Quality Digest | publisher = QCI International | url = http://www.qualitydigest.com/sept98/html/mes.html | accessdate = March 7, 2013}}</ref> Other benefits from successful MES implementation might include:\n# Reduced waste, re-work and scrap, including quicker setup times\n# More accurate capture of cost-information (e.g. labor, scrap, downtime, and tooling)\n# Increased uptime\n# Incorporate paperless workflow activities\n# Manufacturing operations traceability\n# Decreases downtime and easy fault finding \n# Reduced inventory, through the eradication of just-in-case inventory<ref>{{cite web | title = Five Benefits of an MES | date = March 12, 2009 | first = Dave | last = Blanchard | work = Industry Week | url = http://www.industryweek.com/companies-amp-executives/five-benefits-mes | accessdate = March 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==MES==\nA wide variety of systems arose using collected data for a dedicated  purpose. Further development of these systems during the 1990s introduced overlap in functionality. Then the [[MESA (association)|Manufacturing Enterprise Solutions Association (MESA)]] introduced some structure by defining 11 functions that set the scope of MES. In 2000, the [[ANSI/ISA-95]] standard merged this model with the [[Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture|Purdue Reference Model]] (PRM).<ref>Johann Eder, Schahram Dustdar (2006) ''Business Process Management Workshops''. p. 239</ref>\n\nA functional hierarchy was defined in which MES were situated at Level 3 between ERP at Level 4 and process control at Levels 0, 1, 2. With the publication of the third part of the standard in 2005, activities in Level 3 were divided over four main operations: production, quality, logistics and maintenance.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2013, additional or revised parts of the ANSI/ISA-95 standard defined the architecture of an MES into more detail, covering how to internally distribute functionality and what information to exchange internally as well as externally.{{citation needed  |date=March 2013}}\n\n==Functional areas==\nOver the years, international standards and models have refined the scope of such systems in terms of activities{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}.  These typically include:.\n* Management of product definitions. This may include storage, version control and exchange with other systems of master data like product production rules, bill of material, bill of resources, process set points and recipe data all focused on defining how to make a product. Management of product definitions can be part of [[product lifecycle management]].\n* Management of resources. This may include registration, exchange and analysis of resource information, aiming to prepare and execute production orders with resources of the right capabilities and availability.\n* [[Scheduling (production processes)]]. These activities determine the production schedule as a collection of work orders to meet the production requirements, typically received from [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) or specialized [[advanced planning and scheduling]] systems, making optimal use of local resources.\n* Dispatching production orders. Depending on the type of production processes this may include further distribution of batches, runs and work orders, issuing these to work centers and adjustment to unanticipated conditions.\n* Execution of production orders. Although actual execution is done by [[process control]] systems, an MES may perform checks on resources and inform other systems about the progress of production processes.\n* Collection of production data. This includes collection, storage and exchange of process data, equipment status, material lot information and production logs in either a data historian or relational database.\n* Production performance analysis. Create useful information out of the raw collected data about the current status of production, like Work In Progress (WIP) overviews, and the production performance of the past period like the [[overall equipment effectiveness]] or any other [[performance indicator]].\n* Production [[track and trace]]. Registration and retrieval of related information in order to present a complete history of lots, orders or equipment (particularly important in health related productions, e.g. [[pharmaceuticals]]).\n\n== Relationship with other systems==\n\nMES integrates with ISA-95 (previous [[Enterprise control#ISA95 .E2.80.9Clevels.E2.80.9D for enterprise integration|Purdue Reference Model, \u201c95\u201d]]) with multiple relationships.\n\n===Relationship with other Level 3 systems===\nThe collection of systems acting on the ISA-95 Level 3 can be called manufacturing operations management systems (MOMS). Apart from an MES, there are typically [[laboratory information management system]] (LIMS), [[warehouse management system]] (WMS) and [[computerized maintenance management system]] (CMMS). From the MES point of view possible information flows are:\n* To LIMS: quality test requests, sample lots, statistical process data\n* From LIMS: quality test results, product certificates, testing progress\n* To WMS: material resource requests, material definitions, product deliveries\n* From WMS: material availability, staged material lots, product shipments\n* To CMMS: equipment running data, equipment assignments, maintenance requests\n* From CMMS: maintenance progress, equipment capabilities, maintenance schedule\n\n===Relationship with Level 4 systems===\nExamples of systems acting on ISA-95 Level 4 are [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM), [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), [[customer relationship management]] (CRM),  [[human resource management]] (HRM), [[process development execution system]] (PDES). From the MES point of view possible information flows are:\n* To PLM: production test results\n* From PLM: product definitions, bill of operations (routings), electronic work instructions, equipment settings\n* To ERP: production performance results, produced and consumed material\n* From ERP: [[production planning]], order requirements\n* To CRM: product tracking and tracing information\n* From CRM: product complaints\n* To HRM: personnel performance\n* From HRM: personnel skills, personnel availability\n* To PDES: production test and execution results\n* From  PDES: manufacturing flow definitions, [[design of experiments]] (DoE) definitions\n\nIn many cases, [[middleware]] [[enterprise application integration]] (EAI) systems are being used to exchange transaction messages between MES and Level 4 systems. A common data definition, [[B2MML]], has been defined within the [[ISA-95]] standard to link MES systems to these Level 4 systems.\n\n===Relationship with Level 0, 1, 2 systems===\nSystems acting on ISA-95 Level 2 are [[supervisory control and data acquisition]] (SCADA), [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLC), [[distributed control system]]s (DCS) and [[Batch production|batch automation system]]s (BAS). Information flows between MES and these process control systems are roughly similar:\n* To PLCs: work instructions, recipes, set points\n* From PLCs: process values, alarms, adjusted set points, production results\n\nMost MES systems include connectivity as part of their product offering.

The road carries [[motor vehicle]]s and a [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] pedestrian footpath.\n\nIt was built due to the diversion of Cooks River required by the expansion of [[Kingsford-Smith Airport]]. The bridges were constructed before the water flow was diverted beneath them.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18500714 |title=FACE-LIFT FOR SYDNEY'S AIRPORT. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Herald (Sydney)|The Sunday Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=10 June 1951 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963 the two bridges were widened by extending their decks into the area between them, resulting in one six-lane bridge.
