[[Track (rail transport)|Tracks]] ascend from underground to ground level at the southern end of the station, along [[Public_housing estates in Tseung Kwan O#King Lam Estate|King Lam Estate]]. A park is located on top of the tracks to cover them.\n\n=== Platforms ===\nThere is only one [[side platform]] (Platform 1) from which trains depart, in the same direction as they arrive. Trains, as a result, halt on their way from [[Hang Hau station]] for another train to depart at the station. Trains also stay here for a shorter period before departing than at other MTR [[Train station#Terminus|terminals]]. The single-track design (and the consequent longer train turnback time) limits the maximum train service frequency of the Tseung Kwan O Line.<ref name=layout/><ref>{{cite web|title=Supplementary Information on Tseung Kwan O Extension (Phase II) Service|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr08-09/english/panels/tp/papers/tp0424cb1-2364-1-e.pdf|publisher=[[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council Panel on Transport]]|format=PDF|date=July 2009|accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAcross from the platform and north of the point where the tracks merge to one, there is a [[siding (rail)|siding]] that splits from the running line for parking trains.

He hoped that the Fellows would contribute to the nation as future leaders.\n\nWhite House Fellows typically spend a year working as full-time, paid special assistants to senior [[White House Staff]], the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet Secretaries]] and other top-ranking government officials. Fellows also participate in an education program consisting of roundtable discussions with renowned leaders from the private and public sectors, and trips to study U.S. policy in action both domestically and internationally. Fellowships are awarded on a strictly non-partisan basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/participate/fellows|title=White House Fellows|last=|first=|date=2016-12-16|website=The White House|publisher=|accessdate=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThe selection process is very competitive<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/participate/fellows/faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=2016-12-16|website=The White House|accessdate=2017-03-08}}</ref> and there can be as many as 1,000 applicants for the eleven to nineteen fellowships. The White House Fellows Program office processes the applications and former Fellows screen the applications to identify the most promising candidates. Approximately 100 of the most qualified applicants are selected to be interviewed by eight to ten regional panels, which are composed of prominent local citizens. Based on the results of the interviews, the regional panels and the Director select approximately thirty candidates to proceed as National finalists. The President's Commission on White House Fellowships then interviews the thirty candidates and recommends 11\u201319 outstanding candidates to the President for a one-year appointment as Fellows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/fellows/2008-2009|title=2008-2009 Class of White House Fellows|date=2010-09-02|website=The White House|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902111355/http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/fellows/2008-2009|archive-date=2010-09-02|url-status=|access-date=2017-03-09}}</ref>\n\nThe prestige of the Fellowship is such that it has been valued more highly than distinguished scholarships such as the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and [[Fulbright Scholarship]].

Of the 816 Americans who have been selected as White House Fellows, 763 are currently living (as of November 2019). Over the 55 year history of the program, the largest proportion of minority groups selected as Fellows have been: African-Americans, followed by Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Native Americans. A total of 220 women have been selected as White House Fellows, with the proportion of women varying from a low of 7% (during the Johnson administration) to a high of 43% during the Obama administration. The White House Fellows Class of 1996-97 is the only Class so far that has been mostly women (the class included 10 women and 8 men). In 1975, Patricia A. Davis of Staunton, VA was appointed as a White House Fellow from a pool of 2307 applicants and was the only Black Fellow and one of only two females selected.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Proud Mother|last=|first=|date=July 24, 1975|work=Charlottesville-Ablemarle Tribune|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe 10 universities most frequently attended by White House Fellows are, in order: Harvard, Stanford, West Point, Oxford, MIT, Columbia, the Air Force Academy, the Naval Academy, Berkeley, and Yale. The average age of a Fellow is typically 32 to 34 years old. Though fellows come from all regions of the United States, the majority of Fellows have come from the north east region of the country.<ref name=\"whitehousefellowsproject.org\">http://www.whitehousefellowsproject.org/Default.aspx?id=48</ref>\n\nThe 2019-2020 class has 15 Fellows and includes four physicians, six military officers (including a Navy SEAL), a police officer, a technology executive, a lawyer, a professor of electrical engineering, and a charter school leader. Three Fellows of the 2019-2020 class are women and five are people of color or Hispanic heritage.

He hoped that the Fellows would contribute to the nation as future leaders.\n\nWhite House Fellows typically spend a year working as full-time, paid special assistants to senior [[White House Staff]], the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet Secretaries]] and other top-ranking government officials. Fellows also participate in an education program consisting of roundtable discussions with renowned leaders from the private and public sectors, and trips to study U.S. policy in action both domestically and internationally. Fellowships are awarded on a strictly non-partisan basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/participate/fellows|title=White House Fellows|last=|first=|date=2016-12-16|website=The White House|publisher=|accessdate=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThe selection process is very competitive<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/participate/fellows/faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=2016-12-16|website=The White House|accessdate=2017-03-08}}</ref> and there can be as many as 1,000 applicants for the eleven to nineteen fellowships. The White House Fellows Program office processes the applications and former Fellows screen the applications to identify the most promising candidates. Approximately 100 of the most qualified applicants are selected to be interviewed by eight to ten regional panels, which are composed of prominent local citizens. Based on the results of the interviews, the regional panels and the Director select approximately thirty candidates to proceed as National finalists. The President's Commission on White House Fellowships then interviews the thirty candidates and recommends 11\u201319 outstanding candidates to the President for a one-year appointment as Fellows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/fellows/2008-2009|title=2008-2009 Class of White House Fellows|date=2010-09-02|website=The White House|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902111355/http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/fellows/2008-2009|archive-date=2010-09-02|url-status=|access-date=2017-03-09}}</ref> \n\nThe prestige of the Fellowship is such that it has been valued more highly than distinguished scholarships such as the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and [[Fulbright Scholarship]].

Of the 816 Americans who have been selected as White House Fellows, 763 are currently living (as of November 2019). Over the 55 year history of the program, the largest proportion of minority groups selected as Fellows have been: African-Americans, followed by Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Native Americans. A total of 220 women have been selected as White House Fellows, with the proportion of women varying from a low of 7% (during the Johnson administration) to a high of 43% during the Obama administration. The White House Fellows Class of 1996-97 is the only Class so far that has been mostly women (the class included 10 women and 8 men). In 1975, Patricia A. Davis of Staunton, VA was appointed as a White House Fellow from a pool of 2307 applicants and was the only Black Fellow and one of only two females selected. <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Proud Mother|last=|first=|date=July 24, 1975|work=Charlottesville-Ablemarle Tribune|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe 10 universities most frequently attended by White House Fellows are, in order: Harvard, Stanford, West Point, Oxford, MIT, Columbia, the Air Force Academy, the Naval Academy, Berkeley, and Yale.

The climate is influenced by the city's proximity to the Apuseni Mountains, as well as by urbanisation. Some West-Atlantic influences are present during winter and autumn. Winter temperatures are often below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F), even though they rarely drop below \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C (14&nbsp;\u00b0F). On average, snow covers the ground for 65 days each winter. In summer, the average temperature is approximately 18&nbsp;\u00b0C (64&nbsp;\u00b0F) (the average for July and August), despite the fact that temperatures sometimes reach 35&nbsp;\u00b0C (95&nbsp;\u00b0F) to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C (104&nbsp;\u00b0F) in mid-summer in the city centre. Although average precipitation and humidity during summer is low, there are infrequent yet heavy and often violent storms. During spring and autumn, temperatures vary between 13&nbsp;\u00b0C (55&nbsp;\u00b0F) to 18&nbsp;\u00b0C (64&nbsp;\u00b0F), and precipitation during this time tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |13455\n|1930 |20023\n|1948 |25905\n|1956 |33614\n|1966 |42307\n|1977 |55294\n|1992 |61200\n|2002 |55770\n|2011 |47744\n}}\n\nAccording to the last [[Demographics of Romania|Romanian census]] from 2011 there were 47,744 people living within the city.\n\nOf this population, 84.7% are ethnic [[Romanians]], while 8.98% are ethnic [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], 6.03% ethnic [[Romani people|Roma]] and 0.4% others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=2140&judet_id=2295&localitate_id=2300|title=Structura Etno-demografic\u0103 a Rom\u00e2niei|website=Edrc.ro|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Andreea Cacovean]] \n* [[Moise Drago\u0219]]\n* [[\u00c9tienne Hajd\u00fa]]\n* [[Baruch Kimmerling]]\n* [[Ecaterina Orb-Laz\u0103r]]\n* [[Alad\u00e1r L\u00e1szl\u00f3ffy]]\n* [[Csaba L\u00e1szl\u00f3ffy]]\n* [[Camil Mure\u0219anu]]\n* [[Mona Musc\u0103]]\n* [[Ion Ra\u021biu]]\n* [[Septimiu Sever]]\n\n==Tourism==\n* [[Salina Turda]]\n* [[Cheile Turzii]]\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Poetry}}\n* [[Decree of Turda]]\n* [[Universitas Valachorum]]\n* [[List of Transylvanian Saxon localities]]\n* [[Ancient history of Transylvania]], [[History of Transylvania]]\n* [[Franziska Tesaurus]]\n* [[Edict of Torda]]\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Romania}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 sister cities===\nTurda is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Angoul\u00eame]]<ref name=\"Angoul\u00eame twinnings\">{{cite web | url = http://www.cncd.fr/frontoffice/bdd-region.asp?action=getRegion&id=21#tabs3 | title = National Commission for Decentralised cooperation | accessdate = 2013-12-26 | work = D\u00e9l\u00e9gation pour l\u2019Action Ext\u00e9rieure des Collectivit\u00e9s Territoriales (Minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res) | language = French }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]]\n*{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Santa Susanna, Catalonia|Santa Susanna]]\n*{{flagicon|SRB}} [[Torda (\u017diti\u0161te)|Torda]]\n\n==Picture gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:PrimariaTurda02 2009.jpg|City Hall\nFile:VilaMendelTurda01.jpg|Mendel Villa\nFile:2010 -

Many EU countries do not permit LIFO.</ref>\n*Methods for attributing common costs, such as factory burden, to particular goods.<ref>Among the methods commonly used are:  i) factory burden rate, in which overhead costs are assigned  to goods produced based on labor hours or labor dollars;  ii) standard costs, in which a cost including overheads is periodically determined for each type of goods and inventory and cost of goods sold are adjusted periodically for variances of actual costs from such standards; and  iii) activity based costing, in which costs are assigned based on factors which drive the incurrence of such costs.  Numerous variations on these are available in many systems.</ref>\n*Methods for determining when costs are recognized in computing cost of goods sold or to be sold.<ref>Generally, determinations depend upon the overall method of accounting or overarching principles of local GAAP.  These include the cash receipts and disbursements method, accrual methods, and deferred cost methods.  Under these principles there may be a need to determine when amounts are properly treated as incurred.</ref>\n*Methods for recognizing costs of goods that will not be sold or have declined in value.<ref>GAAP often requires that the decline in value of unsold goods be charged to income when the decline occurs.  This is often accomplished through a lower of cost or market value inventory accounting method,  or inventory reserves.  Some systems provide for differences in these determinations for financial reporting and tax purposes.</ref>\n\n===Trading or ordinary and necessary business expenses===\nMany systems, including the [[United Kingdom]], levy tax on all chargeable \u201cprofits of a trade\u201d computed under local [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP).<ref>[ UK Income and Corporation Taxes Act of 1988 (ICTA) section {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}]. The HMRC Business Income Manual at [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim31001.htm BIM 31001] states that \"the starting point is accounts prepared in accordance with ordinary principles of commercial accountancy, and the commercial profits are then adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Taxes Acts.\"</ref> Under this approach, determination of whether an item is deductible depends upon accounting rules and judgments. By contrast, the U.S. allows as a deduction \"all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business...\"<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(a)].</ref> subject to qualifications, enhancements, and limitations.<ref>Johnston, Kevin. \"A List of Deductible Business Expenses for Schedule C.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/list-deductible-business-expenses-schedule-c-21156.html. 29 June 2018.</ref> A similar approach is followed by Canada, but generally with fewer special rules. Such an approach poses significant definitional issues. Among the definitional issues often addressed are:\n*What constitutes a trade or business?  Generally, the business must be regular, continuous, substantial, and entered into with an expectation of profit.<ref>In this regard, the [[United States Tax Court]] has issued well in excess of one thousand rulings.  Among the factors considered are:  a) whether the transactions are regular and continuous (discussed, e.g., prior to the income tax in Lewellyn v. Pittsburgh, B. & L. E. R. Co., 222 Fed. 177 (CA3, 1915), a case cited by the Tax Court), (b) whether  the purported business is substantial (see, e.g., {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}), (c) whether the transactions were profit motivated (see, e.g., Doggett v. Burnet, (1933) , 65 F2d 191; also see hobby loss rules at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/183- 26 USC 183]).</ref><ref>[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim20200.htm UK Business Income Manual 20200] describes various badges of trade.</ref>\n*What expenses are ordinary and necessary?  The phrase deals with what expenses are appropriate to the nature of the business, whether the expenses are of the sort expected to help produce income and promote the business, and whether the expenses are not lavish and extravagant.\n\nNote that under this concept, the same sorts of expenses are generally deductible by business entities and individuals carrying on a trade or business.  To the extent such expenses relate to the employment of an individual and are not reimbursed by the employer, the amount may be deductible by the individual.<ref>See [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2106.pdf IRS Form 2106].</ref>\n\nBusiness deductions of flow-through entities may flow through as a component of the entity's net income in some jurisdictions.  Deductions of flow-through entities may pass through to members of such entities separately from the net income of the entity in some jurisdictions or some cases.  For example, charitable contributions by trusts, and all deductions of partnerships (and [[S corporations]] in the U.S.) are deductible by member beneficiaries or partners (or [[S corporation]] shareholders) in a manner appropriate to the deduction and the member, such as itemized deductions for charitable contributions or a component of net business profits for business expenses.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/704- 26 USC 704(b)] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/170- 26 USC 170].</ref>\n\n===Accounting methods===\n{{main|Tax accounting}}\nOne important aspect of determining tax deductions for business expenses is the timing of such deduction.  The method used for this is commonly referred to as an accounting method.  Accounting methods for tax purposes may differ from applicable [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]].  Examples include timing of recognition of cost recovery deductions (e.g., depreciation), current expensing of otherwise capitalizable costs of intangibles,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/174- 26 USC 174].</ref> and rules related to costs that should be treated  as part of cost of goods not yet sold.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/263A- 26 USC 263A].</ref>  Further, taxpayers often have choices among multiple accounting methods permissible under GAAP and/or tax rules.  Examples include conventions for determining which goods have been sold (such as first-in-first-out, average cost, etc.), whether or not to defer minor expenses producing benefit in the immediately succeeding period, etc.\n\nAccounting methods may be defined with some precision by tax law, as in the U.S. system, or may be based on GAAP, as in the UK system.\n\n===Limits on deductions===\nMany systems limit particular deductions, even where the expenses directly relate to the business.  Such limitations may, by way of example, include:\n*Maximum deductions for use of automobiles<ref>UK:  [ ICTA __], [ ].  U.S.:  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280F- 26 USC 280F].</ref>\n*Limits on deducting compensation of certain key employees<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(m)].</ref>\n*Limits on lobbying or similar expenditures<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(e)].</ref>\n*Nondeductibility of payments considered in violation of public policy, such as criminal fines<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(f)].</ref>\n*Limits on deductions for business-related entertainment.<ref>U.S.:  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/274- 26 USC 274(n)].</ref>\n\nIn addition, deductions in excess of income in one endeavor may not be allowed to offset income from other endeavors.  For example, the United States limits deductions related to passive activities to income from passive activities.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/469- 26 USC 469].  Income from passive activities includes not only operating income but also gains from disposition of the activity or assets used in the activity.  See IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p925.pdf Publication 925].</ref>\n\nIn particular, expenses that are included in COGS cannot be deducted again as a business expense. COGS expenses include:  \n*     The cost of products or raw materials, including freight or shipping charges;\n*     The cost of storing products the business sells;\n*     Direct labor costs for workers who produce the products; and\n*     Factory overhead expenses.\n\nIn 2005, the Australian government amended its taxation legislation to remove deductions for expenses incurred in conducting criminal business activities. This came after the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] ruled in ''[[Commissioner of Taxation v La Rosa]]'' that a heroin dealer was entitled to a tax deduction for money stolen from him in a drug deal.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Taxation of illegal activities in Australia and New Zealand|first=Ranjana|last=Gupta|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JlATaxTA/2008/12.pdf|journal=Journal of the Australasian Tax Teachers Association|year=2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=106\u2013128}}</ref>\n\n==Capitalized items and cost recovery (depreciation)==\nMany systems require that the cost of items likely to produce future benefits be capitalized.<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/263- 26 USC 263]; International Financial Reporting Standards ([IFRS]), particularly IAS 16, applicable in most EU jurisdictions for determining business profits as the starting point for taxable income.</ref>  Examples include plant and equipment, fees related to acquisition o of developing [[intangible asset]]s (e.g., patentable inventions).  Such systems often allow a tax deduction for cost recovery in a future period.\n\nA common approach to such cost recovery is to allow a deduction for a portion of the cost ratably over some period of years.  The U.S. system refers to such a cost recovery deduction as [[depreciation]] for costs of tangible assets<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/168- 26 USC 168], which prescribes depreciable lives by broad class;</ref> and as [[amortization]] for costs of intangible assets.  Depreciation in these systems is allowed over an estimated useful life, which may be assigned by the government for numerous classes of assets, based on the nature and use of the asset and the nature of the business.<ref>For lives by class of assets, see: U.S. see Rev. Proc. 87-56, as updated, reproduced in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf IRS Publication 946]; Canada Income Tax Regulations section 1100 et seq.</ref>  The annual depreciation deduction may be computed on a straight line, declining balance, or other basis, as permitted in each country's rules.<ref>The U.S. permits declining balance switching to straight line in a particular year, by life of asset class.  See Rev. Proc. 87-57, reproduced in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf IRS Publication 946] for percentages that may be used at the option of the taxpayer.</ref>  Many systems allow amortization of the cost of intangible assets only on a straight-line basis, generally computed monthly over the actual expected life or a government specified life.<ref>For international government specified lives by class of intangible asset, see the table in [http://www.taxamortisation.com/tax-amortisation-benefit.html Tax amortization lives of intangible assets]</ref>\n\nAlternative approaches are used by some systems.  Some systems allow a fixed percentage or dollar amount of cost recovery in particular years, often called \u201ccapital allowances.\u201d<ref>UK:  ICTA , ___; Canada: [ Income Tax Act section 20.(1(a))], which provides for deduction as provided in regulations; see [ Income Tax Regulations Part XI, sections 1100 et seq], Capital Allowances.</ref>  This may be determined by reference to the type of asset or business.<ref>Canadian rules cited above specify more than 30 classes for which specific percentages are allowed.</ref>  Some systems allow specific charges for cost recovery for some assets upon certain identifiable events.<ref>For example, Germany allows a deduction for \u201cdepreciation\u201d for assets that have come to be worth significantly less than their unrecovered cost due to identifiable events.  English language {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.</ref>\n\nCapitalization may be required for some items without the potential for cost recovery until disposition or abandonment of the asset to which the capitalized costs relate.  This is often the case for costs related to the formation or reorganization of a corporation, or certain expenses in corporate acquisitions.<ref>See [[INDOPCO]] v. Commissioner.</ref>  However, some systems provide for amortization of certain such costs, at the election of the taxpayer.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/248- 26 USC 248] for corporations, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/709- 26 USC 709] for partnerships.</ref>\n\n==Non-business expenses==\nSome systems distinguish between an active trade or business and the holding of assets to produce income.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/212- 26 USC 212]; UK [ ICTA ].</ref>  In such systems, there may be additional limitations on the timing and nature of amounts that may be claimed as tax deductions.  Many of the rules, including accounting methods and limits on deductions, that apply to business expenses also apply to income producing expenses.\n\n===Losses===\n{{See also|Loss on sale of residential property}}\nMany systems allow a deduction for loss on sale, exchange, or abandonment of both business and non-business income producing assets.  This deduction may be limited to gains from the same class of assets.  In the U.S., a loss on non-business assets is considered a capital loss, and deduction of the loss is limited to capital gains.  Also, in the U.S. a loss on the sale of the taxpayer's principal residence or other personal assets is not allowed as a deduction except to the extent due to casualty or theft.\n\n===Personal deductions===\nMany jurisdictions allow certain classes of taxpayers to reduce taxable income for certain inherently personal items.  A common such deduction is a fixed allowance for the taxpayer and certain family members or other persons supported by the taxpayer.  The U.S. allows such a deduction for \u201cpersonal exemptions\u201d for the taxpayer and certain members of the taxpayer's household.<ref>26 USC 151, 152.  The amount is adjusted annually for inflation, and was [https://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=177992,00.html $3,650] for 2009.</ref>  The UK grants a \u201c[[personal allowance]].\u201d<ref>For 2009, the amount was [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/it.htm \u00a36,475], with additional allowances for married couples over age 75.</ref>  Both U.S. and UK allowances are phased out for individuals or married couples with income in excess of specified levels.\n\nIn addition, many jurisdictions allow reduction of taxable income for certain categories of expenses not incurred in connection with a business or investments.  In the U.S. system, these (as well as certain business or investment expenses) are referred to as \u201c[[itemized deductions]]\u201d for individuals.  The UK allows a few of these as personal reliefs.  These include, for example, the following for U.S. residents (and UK residents as noted):\n*Medical expenses (in excess of 7.5% of adjusted gross income)<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/213- 26 USC 213].</ref>\n*State and local income and property taxes<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/164- 26 USC 164(a)(2)].  Individuals may elect for a tax year after 2003 to claim a deduction for state and local sales taxes in lieu of the deduction for state and local income taxes.</ref>\n*Interest expense on certain home loans<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/163- 26 USC 163] subsection (h) of which limits the deduction of personal interest.</ref>\n*Gifts of money or property to qualifying charitable organizations, subject to certain maximum limitations,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/170- 26 USC 170]  Qualifying organizations generally include organizations that are [[tax exempt]] under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/503- 26 USC 503(c)]([[charitable organizations]]) or (d) ([[religious orders]]), as well as certain other organizations.  Generally, the deduction is limited to 50% of gross income.  This limitation is reduced in certain circumstances.  Amounts in excess of the limitation may be deducted in future years, also subject to limitations.</ref>\n*Losses on non-income-producing property due to casualty or theft,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/165- 26 USC 165].</ref>\n*Contribution to certain retirement or health savings plans (U.S. and UK),<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/219- 26 USC 219], which provides deductions for contributions to \u201c401(k)\u201d and \u201cIRA\u201d plans, among others, and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/223- 26 USC 223], which provides deductions for contributions to \u201chealth savings accounts\u201d that are used to pay for medical expenses.</ref>\n*Certain educational expenses.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/221- 26 USC 221] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/222- 222].</ref>\n\nMany systems provide that an individual may claim a tax deduction for personal payments that, upon payment, become taxable to another person, such as alimony.<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/215- 26 USC 215].</ref>  Such systems generally require, at a minimum, reporting of such amounts,<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf Form IRS Form 1040], line 31b.</ref> and may require that [[withholding tax]] be applied to the payment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p504/ar02.html#en_US_2011_publink1000175944|title=Publication 504 (2017), Divorced or Separated Individuals - Internal Revenue Service|author=|date=|website=www.irs.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Groups of taxpayers==\nSome systems allow a deduction to a company or other entity for expenses or losses of another company or entity if the two companies or entities are commonly controlled.  Such deduction may be referred to as \u201cgroup relief.\u201d<ref>UK [S380 ICTA et seq ]</ref>  Generally, such deductions function in lieu of consolidated or combined computation of tax ([[tax consolidation]]) for such groups.

Co., 222 Fed. 177 (CA3, 1915), a case cited by the Tax Court), (b) whether  the purported business is substantial (see, e.g., {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}), (c) whether the transactions were profit motivated (see, e.g., Doggett v. Burnet, (1933) , 65 F2d 191; also see hobby loss rules at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/183- 26 USC 183]).</ref><ref>[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/bimmanual/bim20200.htm UK Business Income Manual 20200] describes various badges of trade.</ref>\n*What expenses are ordinary and necessary?  The phrase deals with what expenses are appropriate to the nature of the business, whether the expenses are of the sort expected to help produce income and promote the business, and whether the expenses are not lavish and extravagant.\n\nNote that under this concept, the same sorts of expenses are generally deductible by business entities and individuals carrying on a trade or business.  To the extent such expenses relate to the employment of an individual and are not reimbursed by the employer, the amount may be deductible by the individual.<ref>See [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2106.pdf IRS Form 2106].</ref>\n\nBusiness deductions of flow-through entities may flow through as a component of the entity's net income in some jurisdictions.  Deductions of flow-through entities may pass through to members of such entities separately from the net income of the entity in some jurisdictions or some cases.  For example, charitable contributions by trusts, and all deductions of partnerships (and [[S corporations]] in the U.S.) are deductible by member beneficiaries or partners (or [[S corporation]] shareholders) in a manner appropriate to the deduction and the member, such as itemized deductions for charitable contributions or a component of net business profits for business expenses.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/704- 26 USC 704(b)] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/170- 26 USC 170].</ref>\n\n===Accounting methods===\n{{main|Tax accounting}}\nOne important aspect of determining tax deductions for business expenses is the timing of such deduction.  The method used for this is commonly referred to as an accounting method.  Accounting methods for tax purposes may differ from applicable [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]].  Examples include timing of recognition of cost recovery deductions (e.g., depreciation), current expensing of otherwise capitalizable costs of intangibles,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/174- 26 USC 174].</ref> and rules related to costs that should be treated  as part of cost of goods not yet sold.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/263A- 26 USC 263A].</ref>  Further, taxpayers often have choices among multiple accounting methods permissible under GAAP and/or tax rules.  Examples include conventions for determining which goods have been sold (such as first-in-first-out, average cost, etc.), whether or not to defer minor expenses producing benefit in the immediately succeeding period, etc.\n\nAccounting methods may be defined with some precision by tax law, as in the U.S. system, or may be based on GAAP, as in the UK system.\n\n===Limits on deductions===\nMany systems limit particular deductions, even where the expenses directly relate to the business.  Such limitations may, by way of example, include:\n*Maximum deductions for use of automobiles<ref>UK:  [ ICTA __], [ ].  U.S.:  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280F- 26 USC 280F].</ref>\n*Limits on deducting compensation of certain key employees<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(m)].</ref>\n*Limits on lobbying or similar expenditures<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(e)].</ref>\n*Nondeductibility of payments considered in violation of public policy, such as criminal fines<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162- 26 USC 162(f)].</ref>\n*Limits on deductions for business-related entertainment.<ref>U.S.:  [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/274- 26 USC 274(n)].</ref>\n\nIn addition, deductions in excess of income in one endeavor may not be allowed to offset income from other endeavors.  For example, the United States limits deductions related to passive activities to income from passive activities.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/469- 26 USC 469].  Income from passive activities includes not only operating income but also gains from disposition of the activity or assets used in the activity.  See IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p925.pdf Publication 925].</ref>\n\nIn particular, expenses that are included in COGS cannot be deducted again as a business expense. COGS expenses include:  \n*     The cost of products or raw materials, including freight or shipping charges;\n*     The cost of storing products the business sells;\n*     Direct labor costs for workers who produce the products; and\n*     Factory overhead expenses.\n\nIn 2005, the Australian government amended its taxation legislation to remove deductions for expenses incurred in conducting criminal business activities. This came after the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] ruled in ''[[Commissioner of Taxation v La Rosa]]'' that a heroin dealer was entitled to a tax deduction for money stolen from him in a drug deal.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Taxation of illegal activities in Australia and New Zealand|first=Ranjana|last=Gupta|url=http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JlATaxTA/2008/12.pdf|journal=Journal of the Australasian Tax Teachers Association|year=2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=106\u2013128}}</ref>\n\n==Capitalized items and cost recovery (depreciation)==\nMany systems require that the cost of items likely to produce future benefits be capitalized.<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/263- 26 USC 263]; International Financial Reporting Standards ([IFRS]), particularly IAS 16, applicable in most EU jurisdictions for determining business profits as the starting point for taxable income.</ref>  Examples include plant and equipment, fees related to acquisition o of developing [[intangible asset]]s (e.g., patentable inventions).  Such systems often allow a tax deduction for cost recovery in a future period.\n\nA common approach to such cost recovery is to allow a deduction for a portion of the cost ratably over some period of years.  The U.S. system refers to such a cost recovery deduction as [[depreciation]] for costs of tangible assets<ref>U.S.: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/168- 26 USC 168], which prescribes depreciable lives by broad class;</ref> and as [[amortization]] for costs of intangible assets.  Depreciation in these systems is allowed over an estimated useful life, which may be assigned by the government for numerous classes of assets, based on the nature and use of the asset and the nature of the business.<ref>For lives by class of assets, see: U.S. see Rev. Proc. 87-56, as updated, reproduced in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf IRS Publication 946]; Canada Income Tax Regulations section 1100 et seq.</ref>  The annual depreciation deduction may be computed on a straight line, declining balance, or other basis, as permitted in each country's rules.<ref>The U.S. permits declining balance switching to straight line in a particular year, by life of asset class.  See Rev. Proc. 87-57, reproduced in [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p946.pdf IRS Publication 946] for percentages that may be used at the option of the taxpayer.</ref>  Many systems allow amortization of the cost of intangible assets only on a straight-line basis, generally computed monthly over the actual expected life or a government specified life.<ref>For international government specified lives by class of intangible asset, see the table in [http://www.taxamortisation.com/tax-amortisation-benefit.html Tax amortization lives of intangible assets]</ref>\n\nAlternative approaches are used by some systems.  Some systems allow a fixed percentage or dollar amount of cost recovery in particular years, often called \u201ccapital allowances.\u201d<ref>UK:  ICTA , ___; Canada: [ Income Tax Act section 20.(1(a))], which provides for deduction as provided in regulations; see [ Income Tax Regulations Part XI, sections 1100 et seq], Capital Allowances.</ref>  This may be determined by reference to the type of asset or business.<ref>Canadian rules cited above specify more than 30 classes for which specific percentages are allowed.</ref>  Some systems allow specific charges for cost recovery for some assets upon certain identifiable events.<ref>For example, Germany allows a deduction for \u201cdepreciation\u201d for assets that have come to be worth significantly less than their unrecovered cost due to identifiable events.  English language {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.</ref>\n\nCapitalization may be required for some items without the potential for cost recovery until disposition or abandonment of the asset to which the capitalized costs relate.  This is often the case for costs related to the formation or reorganization of a corporation, or certain expenses in corporate acquisitions.<ref>See [[INDOPCO]] v. Commissioner.</ref>  However, some systems provide for amortization of certain such costs, at the election of the taxpayer.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/248- 26 USC 248] for corporations, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/709- 26 USC 709] for partnerships.</ref>\n\n==Non-business expenses==\nSome systems distinguish between an active trade or business and the holding of assets to produce income.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/212- 26 USC 212]; UK [ ICTA ].</ref>  In such systems, there may be additional limitations on the timing and nature of amounts that may be claimed as tax deductions.  Many of the rules, including accounting methods and limits on deductions, that apply to business expenses also apply to income producing expenses.\n\n===Losses===\n{{See also|Loss on sale of residential property}}\nMany systems allow a deduction for loss on sale, exchange, or abandonment of both business and non-business income producing assets.  This deduction may be limited to gains from the same class of assets.  In the U.S., a loss on non-business assets is considered a capital loss, and deduction of the loss is limited to capital gains.  Also, in the U.S. a loss on the sale of the taxpayer's principal residence or other personal assets is not allowed as a deduction except to the extent due to casualty or theft.\n\n===Personal deductions===\nMany jurisdictions allow certain classes of taxpayers to reduce taxable income for certain inherently personal items.  A common such deduction is a fixed allowance for the taxpayer and certain family members or other persons supported by the taxpayer.  The U.S. allows such a deduction for \u201cpersonal exemptions\u201d for the taxpayer and certain members of the taxpayer's household.<ref>26 USC 151, 152.  The amount is adjusted annually for inflation, and was [https://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=177992,00.html $3,650] for 2009.</ref>  The UK grants a \u201c[[personal allowance]].\u201d<ref>For 2009, the amount was [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/it.htm \u00a36,475], with additional allowances for married couples over age 75.</ref>  Both U.S. and UK allowances are phased out for individuals or married couples with income in excess of specified levels.\n\nIn addition, many jurisdictions allow reduction of taxable income for certain categories of expenses not incurred in connection with a business or investments.  In the U.S. system, these (as well as certain business or investment expenses) are referred to as \u201c[[itemized deductions]]\u201d for individuals.  The UK allows a few of these as personal reliefs.  These include, for example, the following for U.S. residents (and UK residents as noted):\n*Medical expenses (in excess of 7.5% of adjusted gross income)<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/213- 26 USC 213].</ref>\n*State and local income and property taxes<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/164- 26 USC 164(a)(2)].  Individuals may elect for a tax year after 2003 to claim a deduction for state and local sales taxes in lieu of the deduction for state and local income taxes.</ref>\n*Interest expense on certain home loans<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/163- 26 USC 163] subsection (h) of which limits the deduction of personal interest.</ref>\n*Gifts of money or property to qualifying charitable organizations, subject to certain maximum limitations,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/170- 26 USC 170]  Qualifying organizations generally include organizations that are [[tax exempt]] under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/503- 26 USC 503(c)]([[charitable organizations]]) or (d) ([[religious orders]]), as well as certain other organizations.  Generally, the deduction is limited to 50% of gross income.  This limitation is reduced in certain circumstances.  Amounts in excess of the limitation may be deducted in future years, also subject to limitations.</ref>\n*Losses on non-income-producing property due to casualty or theft,<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/165- 26 USC 165].</ref>\n*Contribution to certain retirement or health savings plans (U.S. and UK),<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/219- 26 USC 219], which provides deductions for contributions to \u201c401(k)\u201d and \u201cIRA\u201d plans, among others, and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/223- 26 USC 223], which provides deductions for contributions to \u201chealth savings accounts\u201d that are used to pay for medical expenses.</ref>\n*Certain educational expenses.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/221- 26 USC 221] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/222- 222].</ref>\n\nMany systems provide that an individual may claim a tax deduction for personal payments that, upon payment, become taxable to another person, such as alimony.<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/215- 26 USC 215].</ref>  Such systems generally require, at a minimum, reporting of such amounts,<ref>See, e.g., [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf Form IRS Form 1040], line 31b.</ref> and may require that [[withholding tax]] be applied to the payment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p504/ar02.html#en_US_2011_publink1000175944|title=Publication 504 (2017), Divorced or Separated Individuals - Internal Revenue Service|author=|date=|website=www.irs.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Groups of taxpayers==\nSome systems allow a deduction to a company or other entity for expenses or losses of another company or entity if the two companies or entities are commonly controlled.  Such deduction may be referred to as \u201cgroup relief.\u201d<ref>UK [S380 ICTA et seq ]</ref>  Generally, such deductions function in lieu of consolidated or combined computation of tax ([[tax consolidation]]) for such groups.  Group relief may be available for companies in [[Member state of the European Union|EU member countries]] with respect to losses of group companies in other countries.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ctsa/ext_group_relief.pdf UK draft guidance] following the [[Marks & Spencer]] case.</ref>\n\n==International aspects==\nMany systems impose limitations on tax deductions paid to foreign parties, especially related parties.

The frequency at which the competition is held has varied, as has the number of matches played, but it currently consists of an annual three-match series, reduced to a two-match series in [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] years, with two of the matches also counting towards [[The Rugby Championship]]. New Zealand have had the most success, winning the trophy in 2019 for the 47th time (excluding the disputed inaugural competition in 1931), while Australia have won the trophy only 12 times.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bledisloe Cup with fans on display in Sydney 2014.jpg|250 px|thumb|left|Bledisloe Cup Festival Day 2014 in Sydney]]\nThere is some dispute as to when the first Bledisloe Cup match was played. The [[Australian Rugby Union]] (ARU) contend that the one-off 1931 match played at [[Eden Park]] was first. However, no firm evidence has been produced to support this claim, and it is recorded in the minutes of a New Zealand union management meeting several days later that [[Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe|Lord Bledisloe]] wished to present a cup for the All Blacks and Wallabies to play for. The [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] (NZRU) believe that the first match was when New Zealand toured Australia in 1932.\n\nBetween 1931 and 1981, the Bledisloe Cup was contested irregularly in the course of rugby tours between the two countries, with New Zealand winning it 19 times and Australia four times; in 1949, Australia won the competition for the first time on New Zealand soil. The trophy itself was apparently 'lost' during this period and reportedly rediscovered in a Melbourne store room. It was contested annually from 1982 to 1995, sometimes as a series of three matches (two in 1995) and other times in a single match. During these years, New Zealand won the trophy 11 times and Australia three times.\n\nSince 1996, the cup has been contested as part of the annual [[Tri Nations (rugby union)|Tri Nations]] tournament. Until 1998, the cup was contested in a three-match series consisting of the two Tri Nations matches between the two sides and a third match. New Zealand won the series in 1996 and 1997, and Australia won it in 1998.\n\nIn 1996, and from 1999 through 2005, the third match was not played; during these years, Australia and New Zealand played each other twice as part of the Tri Nations for the cup. If the two teams won one game each, or if both games were drawn, the cup was retained by its current holder. The non-holder needed to win the two games 2\u20130 or 1\u20130 (with a draw) to regain the cup. A criticism of this system was that, with the two sides being very well matched in ability level, it was very common for the teams to win one game each and many rugby fans were dissatisfied with one team keeping the cup in the years when the series was tied at 1\u20131 (1999, 2000, 2002, 2004).\n\nIn 2006, the Tri Nations series was extended so that each team played each other three times, meaning a return of the three-game contest for the Bledisloe Cup. However, the cup reverted to the two-game contest in 2007 because the [[2007 Tri Nations Series|Tri Nations]] was abbreviated that year to minimise interference with the teams' preparations for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|World Cup]].\n\nThe three-match format for the Bledisloe Cup continued in 2012, with the first two matches taking place as part of the [[2012 Rugby Championship]].\n\n==Neutral venues==\n===Hong Kong===\nIn 2008 it was announced that the Bledisloe Cup would be contested over an unprecedented four matches, with three games played in Australia and New Zealand and a fourth and potentially deciding game in [[Hong Kong]] in an effort to promote the game in [[Asia]] (the first time Australia and New Zealand played in a third country outside the [[Rugby World Cup]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/7274401.stm |title=Hong Kong to host NZ v Australia |work=BBC Sport |date=3 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> The Hong Kong match, which drew a crowd of 39,000 to see the All Blacks (who had already clinched the Bledisloe Cup) defeat the Wallabies 19\u201314,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/7694689.stm |title=Australia 14\u201319 New Zealand |work=BBC Sport |date=1 November 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref> proved to be a financial success for the two unions, generating a reported [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]5.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"US-Japan\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/7701536.stm |title=US & Japan may host Bledisloe Cup |work=BBC Sport |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref> A 2010 fourth match was again set in [[Hong Kong Stadium]] but failed to attract sufficient ticket sales.<ref name=\"ODT_126226\">{{cite web |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/sport/rugby/126226/rugby-bledisloe-test-locked-hong-kong |title=Rugby: Bledisloe test locked in for Hong Kong |date=13 September 2010 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |accessdate=20 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nThe capital [[Tokyo]] hosted a fourth Bledisloe Test match on 31 October 2009.

The gate receipts from Bledisloe Cup match ups are critical to both [[Rugby Australia]] and [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] and both nations are firm in their belief that one home match is mandatory. The third Bledisloe, which has long been a cash cow for both nations, could cease to exist. Any cash lost from forfeiting that match would be compensated by [[Australian dollar|A$]]18 million per year in League of Nations broadcast revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/rugby-championship-change-likely-as-world-league-talks-gain-steam-20190205-p50vui.html|title=Rugby Championship change likely as World League talks gain steam|last=Phillips|first=Sam|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=5 February 2019|accessdate=6 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The frequency at which the competition is held has varied, as has the number of matches played, but it currently consists of an annual three-match series, reduced to a two-match series in [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] years, with two of the matches also counting towards [[The Rugby Championship]]. New Zealand have had the most success, winning the trophy in 2019 for the 47th time (excluding the disputed inaugural competition in 1931), while Australia have won the trophy 12 times.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bledisloe Cup with fans on display in Sydney 2014.jpg|250 px|thumb|left|Bledisloe Cup Festival Day 2014 in Sydney]]\nThere is some dispute as to when the first Bledisloe Cup match was played. The [[Australian Rugby Union]] (ARU) contend that the one-off 1931 match played at [[Eden Park]] was first. However, no firm evidence has been produced to support this claim, and it is recorded in the minutes of a New Zealand union management meeting several days later that [[Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe|Lord Bledisloe]] wished to present a cup for the All Blacks and Wallabies to play for. The [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] (NZRU) believe that the first match was when New Zealand toured Australia in 1932.\n\nBetween 1931 and 1981, the Bledisloe Cup was contested irregularly in the course of rugby tours between the two countries, with New Zealand winning it 19 times and Australia four times; in 1949, Australia won the competition for the first time on New Zealand soil. The trophy itself was apparently 'lost' during this period and reportedly rediscovered in a Melbourne store room. It was contested annually from 1982 to 1995, sometimes as a series of three matches (two in 1995) and other times in a single match. During these years, New Zealand won the trophy 11 times and Australia three times.\n\nSince 1996, the cup has been contested as part of the annual [[Tri Nations (rugby union)|Tri Nations]] tournament. Until 1998, the cup was contested in a three-match series consisting of the two Tri Nations matches between the two sides and a third match. New Zealand won the series in 1996 and 1997, and Australia won it in 1998.\n\nIn 1996, and from 1999 through 2005, the third match was not played; during these years, Australia and New Zealand played each other twice as part of the Tri Nations for the cup. If the two teams won one game each, or if both games were drawn, the cup was retained by its current holder. The non-holder needed to win the two games 2\u20130 or 1\u20130 (with a draw) to regain the cup. A criticism of this system was that, with the two sides being very well matched in ability level, it was very common for the teams to win one game each and many rugby fans were dissatisfied with one team keeping the cup in the years when the series was tied at 1\u20131 (1999, 2000, 2002, 2004).\n\nIn 2006, the Tri Nations series was extended so that each team played each other three times, meaning a return of the three-game contest for the Bledisloe Cup. However, the cup reverted to the two-game contest in 2007 because the [[2007 Tri Nations Series|Tri Nations]] was abbreviated that year to minimise interference with the teams' preparations for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|World Cup]].\n\nThe three-match format for the Bledisloe Cup continued in 2012, with the first two matches taking place as part of the [[2012 Rugby Championship]].\n\n==Neutral venues==\n===Hong Kong===\nIn 2008 it was announced that the Bledisloe Cup would be contested over an unprecedented four matches, with three games played in Australia and New Zealand and a fourth and potentially deciding game in [[Hong Kong]] in an effort to promote the game in [[Asia]] (the first time Australia and New Zealand played in a third country outside the [[Rugby World Cup]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/7274401.stm |title=Hong Kong to host NZ v Australia |work=BBC Sport |date=3 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref> The Hong Kong match, which drew a crowd of 39,000 to see the All Blacks (who had already clinched the Bledisloe Cup) defeat the Wallabies 19\u201314,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/7694689.stm |title=Australia 14\u201319 New Zealand |work=BBC Sport |date=1 November 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref> proved to be a financial success for the two unions, generating a reported [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]5.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"US-Japan\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/7701536.stm |title=US & Japan may host Bledisloe Cup |work=BBC Sport |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref> A 2010 fourth match was again set in [[Hong Kong Stadium]] but failed to attract sufficient ticket sales.<ref name=\"ODT_126226\">{{cite web |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/sport/rugby/126226/rugby-bledisloe-test-locked-hong-kong |title=Rugby: Bledisloe test locked in for Hong Kong |date=13 September 2010 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |accessdate=20 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nThe capital [[Tokyo]] hosted a fourth Bledisloe Test match on 31 October 2009.

The gate receipts from Bledisloe Cup match ups are critical to both [[Rugby Australia]] and [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] and both nations are firm in their belief that one home match is mandatory. The third Bledisloe, which has long been a cash cow for both nations, could cease to exist.

To facilitate census-taking in the vast unorganized area, the [[United States Census Bureau]], in cooperation with the state, divided the unorganized borough into 11 [[census area]]s, beginning with the 1970 [[U.S. Census|Census]]. The [[Petersburg Borough, Alaska|Petersburg Census Area]] was made a borough in 2013, leaving 10 census areas in the Unorganized Borough:\n*[[Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska|Aleutians West Census Area]]\n*[[Bethel Census Area, Alaska|Bethel Census Area]]\n*[[Dillingham Census Area, Alaska|Dillingham Census Area]]\n*[[Hoonah\u2013Angoon Census Area, Alaska|Hoonah\u2013Angoon Census Area]]\n*[[Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska|Kusilvak Census Area]]\n*[[Nome Census Area, Alaska|Nome Census Area]]\n*[[Prince of Wales \u2013 Hyder Census Area, Alaska|Prince of Wales \u2013 Hyder Census Area]]\n*[[Southeast Fairbanks Census Area, Alaska|Southeast Fairbanks Census Area]]\n*[[Valdez\u2013Cordova Census Area, Alaska|Valdez\u2013Cordova Census Area]]\n**Split to form Chugach Census Area and Copper River Census Area, effective January 02, 2019.\n*[[Yukon\u2013Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska|Yukon\u2013Koyukuk Census Area]]\n\nThis vast area has no local government other than that of [[school districts]] and [[Municipal corporation|municipalities]] within its limits. Many of the villages do have [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States#Tribal governments today|tribal governments]], however. Except within some incorporated cities, all government services in the Unorganized Borough, including law enforcement, are provided by the state or by a tribal government. School districts in the Unorganized Borough are operated either by cities, in those limited instances when the city has chosen to undertake those powers, or through the general guidance of the [[Alaska Department of Education|state Department of Education]] under the auspices of Rural Education Attendance Areas.\n\n==History==\nDuring the 1950s, when the push for the [[territory of Alaska]] to become a state was at its height, any municipal government was extremely limited and scattered. Territory-wide, there were no more than a few dozen [[Municipal corporation|incorporated cities]], and a small handful of service districts, broken into [[public utility district]]s and [[independent school district]]s. The service districts were authorized by the territorial legislature in 1935 to allow unincorporated areas limited powers to provide services and to raise taxes for them.\n\nThe [[United States Congress]] had forbidden the territory from establishing counties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governing Alaska: The Territory of Alaska|url=http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=135|work=Alaska History and Cultural Studies|accessdate=22 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927002516/http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=135|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The delegates of the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|convention]] which wrote the [[Alaska Constitution]] had, in fact, debated the merits of establishing [[County (United States)|counties]], and had rejected the idea in favor of creating a system of boroughs, both organized and unorganized.\n\nThe intent of the framers of the constitution was to provide for maximum local [[self-government]] with a minimum of [[local government]] units and tax-levying jurisdictions. The minutes of the constitutional convention indicate that counties were not used as a form of local government for various reasons. The failure of some local economies to generate enough revenue to support separate counties was an important issue, as was the desire to use a model that would reflect the unique character of Alaska, provide for maximum local input, and avoid a body of county [[case law]] already in existence.\n\nInstead, Alaska adopted boroughs as a form of regional government. This regionalization tried to avoid having a number of independent, limited-purpose governments with confusing boundaries and inefficient governmental operations. The territorial service districts had amounted to this much{{clarify|date=April 2017}}, but were seen by many as an important foundation for the government to provide services without becoming all-powerful and unnecessarily intrusive, an argument which surfaced time and again during various attempts by the legislature to create organized boroughs out of portions of the unorganized borough.\n\nAlaska adopted the borough structure by statute in 1961, and envisioned boroughs to serve as an \"all-purpose\" form of local government, to avoid the perceived{{by whom|date=June 2013}} problems of county government in the [[Continental United States|lower 48 states]] as well as [[Hawaii]]. According to Article X of the Alaska Constitution, areas of the state unable to support borough government were to be served by several unorganized boroughs, which were to be mechanisms for the state to regionalize services; however, separate unorganized boroughs were never created. The entire state was defined as one vast unorganized borough by the Borough Act of 1961, and over the ensuing years, Alaska's organized boroughs were carved out of it.\n\nAlaska's first organized borough, and the only one incorporated immediately after passage of the 1961 legislation, was the [[Bristol Bay Borough]]. The pressure from residents of other areas of the state to form boroughs led to the Mandatory Borough Act of 1963, which called for all election districts in the state over a certain minimum population to incorporate as boroughs by January 1, 1964.\n\nA resolution of the State of Alaska's Local Boundary Commission introduced in January 2009 spells this out in greater detail:\n\n*''WHEREAS, the 1963 Alaska State Legislature passed, and [[William Allen Egan|Governor Egan]] signed into law, the \"Mandatory Borough Act\" (Chapter 52, SLA 1963), dictating that certain regions of Alaska - those encompassing [[Ketchikan]], [[Juneau]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], [[Kodiak Island]], [[Kenai Peninsula]], [[Anchorage]], the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley|Matanuska-Susitna valleys]], and [[Fairbanks]] - form organized boroughs by January 1, 1964.<ref>[http://www.ci.valdez.ak.us/clerk/documents/Rep2021709.pdf The document on Valdez municipal website]</ref>\n\nFurthermore, 21 Rural Education Attendance Areas were established by the Legislature in 1975. This created regional divisions of the unorganized borough for the purpose of establishing rural [[school districts]]. Many REAAs were later absorbed into organized boroughs.\n\n==Regional Educational Attendance Areas==\nThere are 19 Regional Educational Attendance Areas in the unorganized borough.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alaska School Map|url=https://education.alaska.gov/pdf/schoolmap.pdf|work=Alaska education|accessdate=2019-08-09|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Regional name\n!Headquarters\n\n!

primary examples being [[North Slope Borough, Alaska|North Slope]], [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic]], and [[Denali Borough, Alaska|Denali]]) were incorporated to exploit a significant potential source of taxation, such as natural resource extraction and tourism.\n\nMany residents of the Unorganized Borough, particularly those in the larger communities which may be most susceptible to organized borough incorporation, have been vociferously opposed to such incorporation, and say the status quo suits them just fine. Many point out that they would already live in an organized borough if they desired that lifestyle and the level of government which comes with it.\n\nOn the other hand, many Alaskans residing in organized boroughs feel that they unfairly subsidize residents of the Unorganized Borough, especially for education. In 2003, the Alaska Division of Community Advocacy identified eight areas within the Unorganized Borough meeting standards for incorporation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm|title=Legislative Direct for Unorganized Borough Review|publisher=Alaska Department of Commerce|access-date=December 1, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201233151/http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm|archive-date=December 1, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Bills have been introduced in the [[Alaska Legislature]] to compel these areas to incorporate, though {{As of|2009|lc=on}}, none have been signed into law.\n\n==Major communities==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]] (the largest city in the Unorganized Borough)\n*[[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]\n*[[Craig, Alaska|Craig]]\n*[[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]]\n*[[Deltana, Alaska|Deltana]]\n*[[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]]\n*[[Edna Bay, Alaska|Edna Bay]]\n*[[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]]\n*[[Hooper Bay, Alaska|Hooper Bay]]\n*[[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]]\n*[[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]]\n*[[Nome, Alaska|Nome]]\n*[[Tok, Alaska|Tok]]\n*[[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]]\n*[[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Alaska}}\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Unorganized Borough, Alaska}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051201233151/http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm Legislative Directive for Unorganized Borough Review]\n*[https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/4/pub/Model_Boro_RPT.pdf Map of proposed model borough boundaries] Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development (1997)\n\n{{Alaska}}\n{{Unorganized Borough, Alaska}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Unorganized Borough, Alaska| ]]\n[[Category:Alaska boroughs]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date = December 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox U.S. County\n|county  = Unorganized Borough\n|state = Alaska\n| ex image           = NENANA DEPOT.jpg\n| ex image size      = 300px\n| ex image cap       = [[Nenana Depot]]\n|seal =\n|founded year = \n|founded date = \n|founded title = \n|seat = ''None''\n|largest city wl = Bethel\n|city type = community\n|area_total_sq_mi =323,440\n|area_land_sq_mi  =\n|area_water_sq_mi =\n|area percentage = \n|census yr = 2000\n|pop = 81,803\n|density_sq_mi =\n|web = \n|district = \n|time zone = Alaska\n|named for = \n}}\n\nThe '''Unorganized Borough''' is made up of the portions of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]] which are not contained in any of its 19 organized [[List_of_boroughs_and_census_areas_in_Alaska|boroughs]].

The service districts were authorized by the territorial legislature in 1935 to allow unincorporated areas limited powers to provide services and to raise taxes for them.\n\nThe [[United States Congress]] had forbidden the territory from establishing counties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governing Alaska: The Territory of Alaska|url=http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=135|work=Alaska History and Cultural Studies|accessdate=22 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927002516/http://www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=135|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The delegates of the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|convention]] which wrote the [[Alaska Constitution]] had, in fact, debated the merits of establishing [[County (United States)|counties]], and had rejected the idea in favor of creating a system of boroughs, both organized and unorganized.\n\nThe intent of the framers of the constitution was to provide for maximum local [[self-government]] with a minimum of [[local government]] units and tax-levying jurisdictions. The minutes of the constitutional convention indicate that counties were not used as a form of local government for various reasons. The failure of some local economies to generate enough revenue to support separate counties was an important issue, as was the desire to use a model that would reflect the unique character of Alaska, provide for maximum local input, and avoid a body of county [[case law]] already in existence.\n\nInstead, Alaska adopted boroughs as a form of regional government. This regionalization tried to avoid having a number of independent, limited-purpose governments with confusing boundaries and inefficient governmental operations. The territorial service districts had amounted to this much{{clarify|date=April 2017}}, but were seen by many as an important foundation for the government to provide services without becoming all-powerful and unnecessarily intrusive, an argument which surfaced time and again during various attempts by the legislature to create organized boroughs out of portions of the unorganized borough.\n\nAlaska adopted the borough structure by statute in 1961, and envisioned boroughs to serve as an \"all-purpose\" form of local government, to avoid the perceived{{by whom|date=June 2013}} problems of county government in the [[Continental United States|lower 48 states]] as well as [[Hawaii]]. According to Article X of the Alaska Constitution, areas of the state unable to support borough government were to be served by several unorganized boroughs, which were to be mechanisms for the state to regionalize services; however, separate unorganized boroughs were never created. The entire state was defined as one vast unorganized borough by the Borough Act of 1961, and over the ensuing years, Alaska's organized boroughs were carved out of it.\n\nAlaska's first organized borough, and the only one incorporated immediately after passage of the 1961 legislation, was the [[Bristol Bay Borough]]. The pressure from residents of other areas of the state to form boroughs led to the Mandatory Borough Act of 1963, which called for all election districts in the state over a certain minimum population to incorporate as boroughs by January 1, 1964.\n\nA resolution of the State of Alaska's Local Boundary Commission introduced in January 2009 spells this out in greater detail:\n\n*''WHEREAS, the 1963 Alaska State Legislature passed, and [[William Allen Egan|Governor Egan]] signed into law, the \"Mandatory Borough Act\" (Chapter 52, SLA 1963), dictating that certain regions of Alaska - those encompassing [[Ketchikan]], [[Juneau]], [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], [[Kodiak Island]], [[Kenai Peninsula]], [[Anchorage]], the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley|Matanuska-Susitna valleys]], and [[Fairbanks]] - form organized boroughs by January 1, 1964.<ref>[http://www.ci.valdez.ak.us/clerk/documents/Rep2021709.pdf The document on Valdez municipal website]</ref>\n\nFurthermore, 21 Rural Education Attendance Areas were established by the Legislature in 1975. This created regional divisions of the unorganized borough for the purpose of establishing rural [[school districts]]. Many REAAs were later absorbed into organized boroughs.\n\n==Regional Educational Attendance Areas==\nThere are 19 Regional Educational Attendance Areas in the unorganized borough.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alaska School Map|url=https://education.alaska.gov/pdf/schoolmap.pdf|work=Alaska education|accessdate=2019-08-09|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Regional name\n!Headquarters\n\n!

primary examples being [[North Slope Borough, Alaska|North Slope]], [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic]], and [[Denali Borough, Alaska|Denali]]) were incorporated to exploit a significant potential source of taxation, such as natural resource extraction and tourism.\n\nMany residents of the Unorganized Borough, particularly those in the larger communities which may be most susceptible to organized borough incorporation, have been vociferously opposed to such incorporation, and say the status quo suits them just fine. Many point out that they would already live in an organized borough if they desired that lifestyle and the level of government which comes with it.\n\nOn the other hand, many Alaskans residing in organized boroughs feel that they unfairly subsidize residents of the Unorganized Borough, especially for education. In 2003, the Alaska Division of Community Advocacy identified eight areas within the Unorganized Borough meeting standards for incorporation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm|title=Legislative Direct for Unorganized Borough Review|publisher=Alaska Department of Commerce|access-date=December 1, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201233151/http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm|archive-date=December 1, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Bills have been introduced in the [[Alaska Legislature]] to compel these areas to incorporate, though {{As of|2009|lc=on}}, none have been signed into law.\n\n==Major communities==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]] (the largest city in the Unorganized Borough)\n*[[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]\n*[[Craig, Alaska|Craig]]\n*[[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]]\n*[[Deltana, Alaska|Deltana]]\n*[[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]]\n*[[Edna Bay, Alaska|Edna Bay]]\n*[[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]]\n*[[Hooper Bay, Alaska|Hooper Bay]]\n*[[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]]\n*[[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]]\n*[[Nome, Alaska|Nome]]\n*[[Tok, Alaska|Tok]]\n*[[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]]\n*[[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Alaska}}\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Unorganized Borough, Alaska}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051201233151/http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/lbc/boroughstudy/study_materials.htm Legislative Directive for Unorganized Borough Review]\n*[https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/portals/4/pub/Model_Boro_RPT.pdf Map of proposed model borough boundaries] Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development (1997)\n\n{{Alaska}}\n{{Unorganized Borough, Alaska}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Unorganized Borough, Alaska| ]]\n[[Category:Alaska boroughs]]\n", "name_user": "Namangwari", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOverview:Split to form Chugach Census Area (02-063) and Copper River Census Area (02-066) effective January 02, 2019.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unorganized_Borough,_Alaska"}
{"title_page": "Game controller", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=May 2019}}\n{{short description|Device used with games or entertainment systems}}\nA '''game controller''', or simply '''controller''', is an [[input device]] used with [[Video game|video games]] or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game, typically to control an object or character in the game. Before the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]], plugging in a controller into one of a console's controller ports were the primary means of using a game controller, although since then they have been replaced by wireless controllers, which do not require controller ports on the console but are [[Electric battery|battery]]-powered. [[USB]] game controllers could also be connected to a [[computer]] with a USB port. [[Input devices]] that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as [[steering wheels]] for [[Racing video game|driving games]] and light guns for [[Shooter games|shooting games]], are also game controllers.\n\nGame controllers have been designed and improved over the years to be as user friendly as possible. The [[Xbox (console)|Microsoft Xbox]] controller, with its ''shoulder triggers'' that mimic actual triggers such as those found on guns, has become popular for [[Shooter game|shooting games]].<ref name = \"stanford\">{{cite web|title = Evolution of Video Game Controllers| url = http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/sites/default/files2/wlu_2003_1.pdf| first = William| last = Lu|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Some controllers are designed to be best for one type of game, such as steering wheels for [[Racing video game|driving games]], or [[dance pad]]s for dancing games.\n\nOne of the first video game controllers was a simple dial and single button, used to control the game ''[[Tennis for Two]]''. Controllers have since evolved to include [[D-pad|directional pads]], multiple buttons, [[analog stick]]s, [[joystick]]s, [[motion detection]], [[touch screen]]s and a plethora of other features.\n\n== Variants ==\n{{Cleanup|section|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Gamepad ===\n[[File:Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-FL.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A [[ Nintendo Switch Pro Controller]]]]\n{{Main article|Gamepad}}\n:A [[gamepad]], also known as a joypad, is held in both hands with thumbs and fingers used to provide input. Gamepads can have a number of [[Gamepad|action button]]s combined with one or more omnidirectional control sticks or buttons. Action buttons are generally handled with the digits on the right hand, and the directional input handled with the left. Gamepads are the primary means of input on most modern [[video game console]]s. Due to the ease of use and user-friendly nature of gamepads, they have spread from their origin on traditional consoles to [[computer]]s, where a variety of games and emulators support their input as a replacement for [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] input.<ref name=\"PCGamepad\">{{cite web| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/187658/how_to_use_your_console_gamepad_with_your_PC.html| title = How to use your console gamepad with your PC| accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Most modern game controllers are a variation of a standard gamepad. Common additions include shoulder buttons placed along the edges of the pad, centrally placed buttons labeled ''start'', ''select'', and ''mode'', and an internal motor to provide [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]]. \n:As modern game controllers advance, so too do their user ability qualities. Typically, the controllers become smaller and more compact to more easily, and comfortably, fit within the user's hand. Modern examples can be drawn from systems such as Xbox, whose controller has transformed subtly, yet dramatically, from the original [[Xbox 360 controller]] to the Xbox One controller introduced in 2013.\n:\n\n=== Paddle ===\n[[File:Atari-2600-Paddle-Controller-FR.jpg|thumb|Paddle controllers were popular early in the 2nd console generation for Pong games.]]\n{{Main article|Paddle (game controller)}}\n: A [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] is a controller that features a round wheel and one or more fire buttons. The wheel is typically used to control movement of the player or of an object along one axis of the video screen. As the user turns the wheel further from the default position, the speed of control in the game become more intensive. Paddle controllers were the first analog controllers and they lost popularity when \"paddle and ball\" type games fell out of favor. A variation, the Atari driving controller, appeared on the [[Atari 2600]]. Designed specifically for the game ''[[Indy 500 (1977 video game)|Indy 500]]'', it functioned almost identically in operation and design to the regular paddle controller. The exceptions were that its wheel could be continuously rotated in either direction, and that it was missing the extra paddle included on the previous model. Unlike a spinner, friction prevented the wheel from gaining momentum.\n\n=== Joystick ===\n[[File:PlayStation-Analog-Joystick.jpg|thumb|A dual-joystick controller for the original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]]][[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Arcade-Stick.jpg|thumb|An [[Arcade controller|arcade style controller]] for the Sega [[Dreamcast]].]]\n{{Main article|Joystick}}\n:A [[joystick]] is a [[peripheral]] that consists of a handheld stick that can be tilted around either of two axes and (sometimes) twisted around a third. The joystick is often used for [[flight simulator]]s. [[HOTAS]] (hands on throttle and stick) controllers, composed of a joystick and throttle quadrant (see below) are a popular combination for flight simulation among its most fanatic devotees. Most joysticks are designed to be operated with the user's primary hand (e.g. with the right hand of a right-handed person), with the base either held in the opposite hand or mounted on a desk. [[Arcade controller]]s are typically joysticks featuring a shaft that has a ball or drop-shaped handle, and one or more buttons for in game actions. Generally the layout has the joystick on the left, and the buttons on the right, although there are instances when this is reversed.\n\n=== Trackball ===\n{{Main article|Trackball}}\n: A [[trackball]] is a smooth sphere that is manipulated with the palm of one's hand. The user can roll the ball in any direction to control the cursor. It has the advantage that it can be faster than a mouse depending on the speed of rotation of the physical ball. Another advantage is that it requires less space than a [[Computer mouse|mouse]], which the trackball was a precursor of. Notable uses of a Trackball as a gaming controller would be games such as ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Marble Madness]]'', ''[[Golden Tee Golf]]'' and ''[[SegaSonic the Hedgehog]]''.\n\n=== Throttle quadrant ===\n: A throttle quadrant is a set of one or more levers that are most often used to simulate throttles or other similar controls in a real vehicle, particularly an aircraft. Throttle quadrants are most popular in conjunction with joysticks or yokes used in flight simulation.\n\n=== Steering wheel ===\n[[File:Logitech-Driving-Force-PS3.jpg|thumb|A [[Logitech]] steering wheel for the [[PlayStation 3]]]]\n{{Main article|Racing wheel}}\n:A [[Racing wheel]], essentially a larger version of a paddle, is used in most [[racing video game|racing]] [[arcade game]]s as well as more recent [[Sim racing|racing simulators]] such as ''[[Live for Speed]]'', ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'', ''[[GTR 2 \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR2]]'', and ''[[Richard Burns Rally]]''. While most [[Arcade racer|arcade racing]] games have been using steering wheels since ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'' in 1974,<ref name=\"Kohler-16\">{{citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-up: how Japanese video games gave the world an extra life|page=16|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> the first steering wheels for home systems appeared on [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth-generation consoles]] such as the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Nintendo 64]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Many are [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] (see [[Haptic technology|Force Feedback Wheel]]), designed to give the same feedback as would be experienced when driving a real car, but the realism of this depends on the game. They usually come with pedals to control the gas and brake. Shifting is taken care of in various ways including paddle shifting systems, simple stick shifters which are moved forward or back to change gears or more complex shifters which mimic those of real vehicles, which may also use a clutch. Most wheels turn only 200 to 270 degrees lock-to-lock but some models, such as the [[Logitech]] [[Driving Force Pro]], [[Logitech G25]] and [[Logitech G27]] can turn 900 degrees, or 2.5 turns, lock-to-lock. The [[Namco]] [[Jogcon]] paddle was available for the PlayStation game ''[[R4: Ridge Racer Type 4]]''. Unlike \"real\" video game steering wheels, the Jogcon was designed to fit in the player's hand. Its much smaller wheel (diameter roughly similar to a [[aluminum can|soda can]]'s) resembles the jog-and-shuttle control wheel used on some [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s. The [[Nintendo Wii]] game ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' is bundled with the [[Wii Wheel]]: a steering wheel-shaped shell that the [[Wii Remote]] is placed inside thus using the Wii Remote's motion sensing capabilities to control the [[Go-kart|kart]] during the game. Hori also has a steering wheel that is made for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''. When the steering wheel is placed on the back of the console, then it will have the same ability as in ''Mario Kart Wii'' by using the [[gyroscope]] in [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] mode.\n\n=== Yoke ===\n: A yoke is very similar to a steering wheel except that it resembles the control yoke found on many aircraft and has two axes of movement: not only rotational movement about the shaft of the yoke, but also a forward-and-backward axis equivalent to that of pitch control on the yoke of an aircraft. Some yokes have additional controls attached directly to the yoke for simulation of aircraft functions such as radio push-to-talk buttons. Some flight simulator sets that include yokes also come with various other aircraft controls such as throttle quadrants and pedals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.logitechg.com/en-roeu/products/flight/flight-simulator-yoke-system.html|title=Logitech G Flight Simulator Yoke System with Throttle Quadrant|website=www.logitechg.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref> These sets, including the yoke, are intended to be used in a [[flight simulator]].\n\n=== Pedals ===\n:[[File:LDFGT.JPG|thumb|Logitech Driving Force GT]]Pedals may be used for driving simulations or flight simulations and often ships with a steering-wheel-type input device.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals|last=Shelly|first=Gary|last2=Vermaat|first2=Misty|publisher=Course Technology Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=9781423927020|location=Boston, MA|pages=172}}</ref> In the former case, an asymmetric set of pedals can simulate accelerator, brake, and clutch pedals in a real automobile. In the latter case, a symmetric set of pedals simulates rudder controls and toe brakes in an aircraft. As mentioned, most steering wheel controllers come with a set of pedals. There are also variations of the pedal controller such as the proposed rotating pedal device for a cycling game, which relies on an ergometer to generate user inputs such as pedal rpm and pedal resistance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals|last=Chorianopoulos|first=Konstantinos|last2=Divitini|first2=Monica|last3=Hauge|first3=Jannicke|last4=Jaccheri|first4=Letizia|last5=Malaka|first5=Rainer|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783319245881|location=Heidelberg|pages=158}}</ref> A variation of this concept surfaced in 2016 when a startup called VirZoom debuted a set of sensors that can be installed in the pedal and handlebars, turning a physical bike into one controller for games on the [[HTC Vive]] and [[Oculus Rift]] [[Virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]] platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/virzoom-vr-game-controller,news-22601.html|title=This Bike Lets You Pedal Through Virtual Reality|last=Michaels|first=Philip|date=2016-04-28|work=Tom's Guide|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}</ref> The same concept is behind a product called Cyber ExerCycle,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyberbiking.com/|title=Cyber ExerCycle: Interactive Exercise Bike Kit|last=Ltd.|first=Universal Timer|website=www.cyberbiking.com|access-date=2018-08-21}}</ref> which is a set of sensors attached to the pedal and connected to the PC via [[USB]] for bicycle simulation games such as NetAthlon and [[Fuel (video game)|Fuel]].\n\n[[File:W-A-S-D.jpg|thumb|The [[Arrow keys#WASD keys|WASD]] KEYBOARD setup is used widely, but by no means universally.]]\n\n=== Mouse and keyboard ===\n: A [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] and [[computer keyboard]] are typical [[input device]]s for a [[personal computer]] and are currently the main game controllers for [[Video game|computer game]]s. The mouse is often used with a [[mousepad]] to achieve greater speed, comfort, accuracy and smoother movement for the gamer. Some video game consoles also have the ability to function with a keyboard and a mouse. The computer keyboard is modelled after the [[typewriter keyboard]] and was designed for the input of written text. A mouse is a handheld [[pointing device]] used in addition to the keyboard. For games, the keyboard typically controls movement of the character while the mouse is used to control the game camera or used for aiming. While originally designed for general computer input, there are several keyboard and mouse peripherals available which are designed specifically for gaming, often with gaming-specific functions built-in. Examples include peripherals by [[Razer USA|Razer]], such as the [https://gamehub.blog/razer-huntsman-elite-review/ Razer Huntsman Elite]. The numeric [[Keyboard technology|keypad]] found on the keyboard is also used as a game controller and can be found on a number of separate devices, most notably early consoles, usually attached to a joystick or a paddle. The keypad is a small grid of keys with at least the digits 0-9. A [[Gaming keypad]] is a specialized controller used for [[first-person shooter|FPSs]], [[Real-time strategy|RTSs]] and some arcade type games. These controllers can be programmed to allow the emulation of keys, and macros in some cases. These generally resemble a small part of a keyboard but may also feature other inputs such as [[analog stick]]s. They were developed because some of these games require a keyboard to play, and some players find this to be awkward for such a task.\n\n=== Touchscreen ===\n:[[File:Nintendo-DS-Lite-w-stylus.png|thumb|240px|Nintendo DS touchscreen (bottom) with [[stylus]].]]A [[touchscreen]] is an input device that allows the user to interact with the computer by touching the display screen. The first attempt at a [[handheld game console]] with touchscreen controls was Sega's intended successor to the [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]], though the device was ultimately shelved and never released due to the high cost of touchscreen technology in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p7.html|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA|page=7|website=IGN|first=Travis|last=Fahs|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref> The first released console to use a touchscreen was the [[Tiger Electronics|Tiger]] [[game.com]] in 1997. Nintendo popularized it for use in video games with the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]]; other systems including the [[Tapwave Zodiac]] as well as [[Smartphone]]s and the vast majority of [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] have also included this feature. The primary controller for Nintendo's [[Wii U]] console, the [[Wii U GamePad]], features an embedded touchscreen. Modern touch screens use a thin, durable, transparent plastic sheet overlaid onto a glass screen. The location of a touch is calculated from the [[capacitance]] for the X and Y [[Coordinate system|axes]], which varies based upon where the sheet is touched. One console that is touchscreen, but is not manufactured by Nintendo is Sony's PlayStation Vita which has a 5 inch OLED touchscreen. The [[Nintendo Switch]] features a 6.2 inch touchscreen.\n\n=== Breathing controllers ===\n: Breathing controllers help their users improve breathing through video games. All controllers have sensors that sense users breath, with which user controls video game on computer, tablet or on smartphone. Alvio is a breathing trainer, symptom tracker and mobile game controller.<ref name=\"Crain's\">{{cite web |title=Gadget gurus proliferate in NY's tech scene |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20141021/SMALLBIZ/310199994/gadget-gurus-proliferate-in-nys-tech-scene# |work=Crain's New York Business |accessdate=2015-05-21 |last=Field |first=Anne |date=2014-04-21}}</ref> Zenytime promotes deep, rhythmic breathing to trigger short-term rewards of controlled breathing (relaxation, improved oxygenation...).<ref name=\"Gizmag\">{{cite web |title=Zenytime games are controlled by your breathing to improve wellbeing |url=http://www.gizmag.com/zenytime/33802/ |work=Gizmag |accessdate=2015-05-21 |last=Roberts |first=Stu |date=2014-09-15}}</ref> Breathing games by Breathing Labs are based on [[Pursed lip breathing]] and are used on [[iPhone]] / [[iPad]], [[Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"MEi\">{{cite web |title=Breathing through pursed lips aids in reducing stress anxiety |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/meicogsci/php/ocs/index.php/meicog/meicog2012/paper/view/366 |work= MEi |accessdate=2015-05-21 |last=Miku\u0161 |first=Nace |last2=Leskov\u0161ek |first2=Matev\u017e |date=2012-06-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Motion sensing ===\n[[File:Wii Remote Image.jpg|thumb|Wii Remote.]]\n: [[Motion controller]]s include the [[Sega Activator]], released in 1993 for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] (Genesis). Based on the Light Harp invented by Assaf Gurner,<ref>{{cite video |title=Light Harp at CES 1993  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoxsnCiX05k |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2010-07-06}}</ref> it could read the player's physical movements and was the first controller to allow full-body motion sensing.

The [[Sixaxis]], [[DualShock 3]], and [[PlayStation Move]] controllers for Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] system have similar motion sensing capabilities. In 2010, Microsoft released the [[Kinect]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. This motion sensing controller uses cameras to track a players movement. Microsoft released a revised version of the Kinect with the launch of the [[Xbox One]]. This controller was bundled with the console on launch, and was removed from the default bundle in June 2014. Sony's [[EyeToy]] similarly uses cameras to detect the player's motions and translate them into inputs for the game.\n\n=== Light gun ===\n[[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Lightgun-FL.jpg|thumb|The Dreamcast light gun]]\n{{Main article|Light gun}}\n: A [[light gun]] is a peripheral used to \"shoot\" targets on a screen. They usually roughly resemble firearms or ray guns. Their use is normally limited to [[rail shooter]]s, or [[Shooter game#Shooting gallery|shooting gallery]] games like [[Duck Hunt]] and those which came with the ''[[Shooting Gallery (game accessory)|Shooting Gallery]]'' light gun. A rare example of a non-rail first person shooter game is [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s 1992 [[video game]] ''Gun Buster'', a [[first-person shooter]] that used a [[joystick]] to move and a light gun to [[Free look|aim]].<ref>{{KLOV game|8036|Gun Buster}}</ref> Though light guns have been used in earlier [[arcade game]]s such as [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sega Periscope|Periscope]]'' in 1966<ref>Ashcraft, Brian (2008), ''Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers'', p. 133, Kodansha International</ref> and ''Missile'' in 1969,<ref>{{KLOV game|10600|Missile}}</ref> the first home console light gun was released for the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] in 1972; later on, [[Nintendo]] would include one standard on their Famicom and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], called the [[NES Zapper]]. Nintendo has also released a \"shell\" in the style of a light gun for the more recent [[Wii Remote]] called the [[Wii Zapper]] which comes bundled with the game ''[[Link's Crossbow Training]]''.\n\n=== Rhythm game controllers ===\n\n[[File:Guitar Hero series controllers.jpg|thumb|Guitar controllers.]]\n: A [[Rhythm game accessories]] used for [[rhythm games]] can resemble musical instruments, such as [[guitar]]s (from 5-button guitars in ''[[Guitar Freaks]]'', the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' series, the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series to real guitars in ''[[Rock Band 3]]'' and ''[[Rocksmith]]''), [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s (''Rock Band 3''), [[drum]]s (''[[Donkey Konga]]'', ''[[Drum Mania]]'', the ''Rock Band'' series and the ''Guitar Hero'' series), or [[maraca]]s (''[[Samba de Amigo]]'') have also seen some success in arcades and home consoles. Other rhythm games are based around the art of Djing or [[turntablism]] (''[[DJ Hero]]''), or playing a [[synthesizer]] (''[[IIDX]]'')  using a [[Turntablism|turntable]] shaped peripheral with buttons.\n\n=== Wireless ===\n: [[Wireless]] versions of many popular controller types (joypads, mice, keyboards) exist, and wireless motion controls are an emerging class for virtual reality.\n\n=== Others ===\n* Pinball controllers and multi-button consoles for strategy games were released in the past, but their popularity was limited to hardcore fans of the genre.\n* [[Dance pad]]s, essentially a grid of flat pressure-sensitive gamepad buttons set on a mat meant to be stepped on, have seen niche success with the popularity of rhythm games like ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' and ''[[Pump It Up (video game)|Pump It Up]]''. The dance pad was first introduced by Bandai on the Famicom in 1986 as a part of their \"Family Fun Fitness\" set, then Exus released the \"Foot Craz\" pad for the Atari 2600 in 1987. Nintendo purchased the technology from Bandai in 1988 and used it on their \"Power Pad\", for the Famicom and NES.\n* [[Balance board]]: The [[Wii Balance Board]] comes with the game ''[[Wii Fit]]''. Several other game are in development which will be compatible with the balance board. This was preceded by decades by the ''[[Joyboard]]'', made to plug into an Atari 2600, to play skiing and surfing games.\n* Buzzers: A recent example of specialized, while very simple, game controllers, is the four large \"buzzers\" (round buttons) supplied with the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 [[Game show|quiz show]] game series ''[[Buzz!]]'' (2005\u2013present); both game and controllers clearly being inspired by the television show genre.\n* [[NeGcon]]: is a unique controller for racing games on the PlayStation. Physically it resembles a gamepad, but its left and right halves twist relative to each other, making it a variation of the paddle controller.\n* [[Microphone]]: A few games have made successes in using a headset or microphone as a secondary controller, such as ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'', the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series, the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]], the ''[[SingStar]]'' series, ''[[Tom Clancy's Endwar]]'', the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, and the ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' series. The use of these microphones allowed players to issue commands to the game, controlling teammates (as in ''SOCOM'') and other AI characters (e.g., Pikachu). The [[Nintendo DS]] features a microphone that is built into the system. It has been used for a variety of purposes, including [[speech recognition]] (''[[Nintendogs]]'', ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!]]''), chatting online between and during gameplay sessions ([[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]), and minigames that require the player to blow or shout into the microphone (''[[Feel the Magic: XY/XX]]'', ''[[WarioWare: Touched!]]'', ''[[Mario Party DS]]'').\n* ''[[Steel Battalion]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] was bundled with a full dashboard, with 2 joysticks and over 30 buttons, in an attempt to make it feel like an actual mecha simulator.\n* [[Fishing rod]]: the first fishing rod controller appeared as an accessory for the [[Dreamcast]] video console for playing ''[[Sega Marine Fishing]]''. Later other games for PlayStation console use also a similar controllers.\n* [[Fog display|Floating Interactive Display]]: at least two commercial systems ([[Heliodisplay]] and [http://fogscreen.com/ FogScreen]) offer interactive \"floating interfaces\" which display an image projected in mid-air but can be interacted with by finger similar to a touch screen.\n* [[Brain\u2013computer interface|Mind-controlled]] headset: As of March 24, 2007 a United States/Australian company called [[Emotiv Systems]] began launching a mind-controlled device for [[video game]]s based on [[electroencephalography]]. It was reported by [[The Wall Street Journal]]'s Don Clark on [[MSNBC]].<ref name=\"MSNBC report\">{{cite web|url=http://video.msn.com/?mkt=en-us&brand=msnbc&tab=m5&rf=&from=00&vid=09e9f856-63f3-40cd-83e6-eb6f2910a31c| publisher=MSNBC|title=Video Game Mind Control|accessdate=2007-03-25|year=2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n* [[PCGamerBike]] similar to a pair of pedals removed from an exercise bike, then set down in front of a chair & used to precisely control game characters instead.\n* [[Optical motion tracking]] systems such as [[TrackIR]] and [[FreeTrack]] use a video camera to track an infrared illuminated or emissive headpiece. Small head movements are tracked and then translated into much larger virtual in-game movements, allowing hands-free view control and improved immersiveness.\n* Mechanical motion tracking systems like [[Gametrak]] use cables attached to gloves for tracking position of physical elements in [[three-dimensional space]] in [[wiktionary:real time|real time]]. The Gametrak mechanism contains a retracting cable reel and a small tubular guide arm from which the cable passes out. The guide arm is articulated in a [[ball joint]] such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism. The distance of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure the rotation of the spool drum for the retracting cable reel, and calculating how far the cable is extended.\n* Exoskeleton controllers use exoskeleton technology to provide the player with different responses based on the player's body position, speed of movement, and other sensed data. In addition to audio and visual responses, an exoskeleton controller may provide a controlled resistance to movement and other stimuli to provide realism to the action. This not only lets players feel as if they are actually performing the function, but also helps reinforce the correct muscle pattern for the activity being simulated. The Forcetek XIO is an example of an exoskeleton video game controller.\n* [[Flight instruments|Instrument panels]] are simulated aircraft instrument panels, either generic or specific to a real aircraft, that are used in place of the keyboard to send commands to a flight simulation program. Some of these are far more expensive than all the rest of a computer system combined. The panels usually only simulate switches, buttons, and controls, rather than output instrument displays.\n** Train controls: Other instrument panel like hardware such as train controls have been produced. The \"[[RailDriver]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raildriver.com/products/raildriver.php|title=RailDriver&nbsp;\u2013 Desktop Train Cab Controller|publisher = www.raildriver.com|accessdate=2009-01-24|last = |first = }}</ref> for example is designed to work with ''[[Trainz]]'', ''[[Microsoft Train Simulator]]'' and ''[[Rail Simulator|Kuju Rail Simulator]]''. (as of January 2009) it is limited in ease of use by the lack of a Windows API for some of the software it is designed to work with. A train controller for a [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] bullet train sim has also been made for the [[Wii]] console.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamersquad.com/category/Nintendo-Wii/Wii-train-sim-controller-is-sweeeet/| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071219000000/http://www.gamersquad.com/category/Nintendo-Wii/Wii-train-sim-controller-is-sweeeet/|archivedate=2007-12-19|title=Wii train sim controller \u2013 Bullet Train Controller Wii: GamerSquad discusses the Bullet Train Controller for Nintendo Wii|publisher=www.gamersquad.com|accessdate=2009-01-24|last=|first=}}</ref>\n* [[R.O.B.]] (Robotic Operating Buddy) is an accessory for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES), which allowed players to interact with NES games by controlling the robot. Known in Japan as the ''Famicom Robot'', this short-lived accessory jumpstarted [[Nintendo]]'s involvement in the western market, though only used for ''[[Stack-Up]]'' and ''[[Gyromite]]''. It has been considered a \"Trojan horse\" for getting NESs into stores during the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game market crash of 1983]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} and the accessory was called by GameSpy the fifth greatest video game marketing move within twenty-five.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} As a character, R.O.B. appeared in later Nintendo games such as ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros.

Before the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]], plugging in a controller into one of a console's controller ports were the primary means of using a game controller, although since then they have been replaced by wireless controllers, which do not require controller ports on the console but are [[Electric battery|battery]]-powered. [[USB]] game controllers could also be connected to a [[computer]] with a USB port. [[Input devices]] that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as [[steering wheels]] for [[Racing video game|driving games]] and light guns for [[Shooter games|shooting games]], are also game controllers.\n\nGame controllers have been designed and improved over the years to be as user friendly as possible. The [[Xbox (console)|Microsoft Xbox]] controller, with its ''shoulder triggers'' that mimic actual triggers such as those found on guns, has become popular for [[Shooter game|shooting games]].<ref name = \"stanford\">{{cite web|title = Evolution of Video Game Controllers| url = http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/sites/default/files2/wlu_2003_1.pdf| first = William| last = Lu|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Some controllers are designed to be best for one type of game, such as steering wheels for [[Racing video game|driving games]], or [[dance pad]]s for dancing games.\n\nOne of the first video game controllers was a simple dial and single button, used to control the game ''[[Tennis for Two]]''. Controllers have since evolved to include [[D-pad|directional pads]], multiple buttons, [[analog stick]]s, [[joystick]]s, [[motion detection]], [[touch screen]]s and a plethora of other features.\n\n== Variants ==\n{{Cleanup|section|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Gamepad ===\n[[File:Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-FL.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A [[ Nintendo Switch Pro Controller]]]]\n{{Main article|Gamepad}}\n:A [[gamepad]], also known as a joypad, is held in both hands with thumbs and fingers used to provide input. Gamepads can have a number of [[Gamepad|action button]]s combined with one or more omnidirectional control sticks or buttons. Action buttons are generally handled with the digits on the right hand, and the directional input handled with the left. Gamepads are the primary means of input on most modern [[video game console]]s. Due to the ease of use and user-friendly nature of gamepads, they have spread from their origin on traditional consoles to [[computer]]s, where a variety of games and emulators support their input as a replacement for [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] input.<ref name=\"PCGamepad\">{{cite web| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/187658/how_to_use_your_console_gamepad_with_your_PC.html| title = How to use your console gamepad with your PC| accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Most modern game controllers are a variation of a standard gamepad. Common additions include shoulder buttons placed along the edges of the pad, centrally placed buttons labeled ''start'', ''select'', and ''mode'', and an internal motor to provide [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]]. \n:As modern game controllers advance, so too do their user ability qualities. Typically, the controllers become smaller and more compact to more easily, and comfortably, fit within the user's hand. Modern examples can be drawn from systems such as Xbox, whose controller has transformed subtly, yet dramatically, from the original [[Xbox 360 controller]] to the Xbox One controller introduced in 2013.\n:\n\n=== Paddle ===\n[[File:Atari-2600-Paddle-Controller-FR.jpg|thumb|Paddle controllers were popular early in the 2nd console generation for Pong games.]]\n{{Main article|Paddle (game controller)}}\n: A [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] is a controller that features a round wheel and one or more fire buttons. The wheel is typically used to control movement of the player or of an object along one axis of the video screen. As the user turns the wheel further from the default position, the speed of control in the game become more intensive. Paddle controllers were the first analog controllers and they lost popularity when \"paddle and ball\" type games fell out of favor. A variation, the Atari driving controller, appeared on the [[Atari 2600]]. Designed specifically for the game ''[[Indy 500 (1977 video game)|Indy 500]]'', it functioned almost identically in operation and design to the regular paddle controller. The exceptions were that its wheel could be continuously rotated in either direction, and that it was missing the extra paddle included on the previous model. Unlike a spinner, friction prevented the wheel from gaining momentum.\n\n=== Joystick ===\n[[File:PlayStation-Analog-Joystick.jpg|thumb|A dual-joystick controller for the original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]]][[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Arcade-Stick.jpg|thumb|An [[Arcade controller|arcade style controller]] for the Sega [[Dreamcast]].]]\n{{Main article|Joystick}}\n:A [[joystick]] is a [[peripheral]] that consists of a handheld stick that can be tilted around either of two axes and (sometimes) twisted around a third. The joystick is often used for [[flight simulator]]s. [[HOTAS]] (hands on throttle and stick) controllers, composed of a joystick and throttle quadrant (see below) are a popular combination for flight simulation among its most fanatic devotees. Most joysticks are designed to be operated with the user's primary hand (e.g. with the right hand of a right-handed person), with the base either held in the opposite hand or mounted on a desk. [[Arcade controller]]s are typically joysticks featuring a shaft that has a ball or drop-shaped handle, and one or more buttons for in game actions. Generally the layout has the joystick on the left, and the buttons on the right, although there are instances when this is reversed.\n\n=== Trackball ===\n{{Main article|Trackball}}\n: A [[trackball]] is a smooth sphere that is manipulated with the palm of one's hand. The user can roll the ball in any direction to control the cursor. It has the advantage that it can be faster than a mouse depending on the speed of rotation of the physical ball. Another advantage is that it requires less space than a [[Computer mouse|mouse]], which the trackball was a precursor of. Notable uses of a Trackball as a gaming controller would be games such as ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Marble Madness]]'', ''[[Golden Tee Golf]]'' and ''[[SegaSonic the Hedgehog]]''.\n\n=== Throttle quadrant ===\n: A throttle quadrant is a set of one or more levers that are most often used to simulate throttles or other similar controls in a real vehicle, particularly an aircraft. Throttle quadrants are most popular in conjunction with joysticks or yokes used in flight simulation.\n\n=== Steering wheel ===\n[[File:Logitech-Driving-Force-PS3.jpg|thumb|A [[Logitech]] steering wheel for the [[PlayStation 3]]]]\n{{Main article|Racing wheel}}\n:A [[Racing wheel]], essentially a larger version of a paddle, is used in most [[racing video game|racing]] [[arcade game]]s as well as more recent [[Sim racing|racing simulators]] such as ''[[Live for Speed]]'', ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'', ''[[GTR 2 \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR2]]'', and ''[[Richard Burns Rally]]''. While most [[Arcade racer|arcade racing]] games have been using steering wheels since ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'' in 1974,<ref name=\"Kohler-16\">{{citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-up: how Japanese video games gave the world an extra life|page=16|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> the first steering wheels for home systems appeared on [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth-generation consoles]] such as the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Nintendo 64]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Many are [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] (see [[Haptic technology|Force Feedback Wheel]]), designed to give the same feedback as would be experienced when driving a real car, but the realism of this depends on the game. They usually come with pedals to control the gas and brake. Shifting is taken care of in various ways including paddle shifting systems, simple stick shifters which are moved forward or back to change gears or more complex shifters which mimic those of real vehicles, which may also use a clutch. Most wheels turn only 200 to 270 degrees lock-to-lock but some models, such as the [[Logitech]] [[Driving Force Pro]], [[Logitech G25]] and [[Logitech G27]] can turn 900 degrees, or 2.5 turns, lock-to-lock. The [[Namco]] [[Jogcon]] paddle was available for the PlayStation game ''[[R4: Ridge Racer Type 4]]''. Unlike \"real\" video game steering wheels, the Jogcon was designed to fit in the player's hand. Its much smaller wheel (diameter roughly similar to a [[aluminum can|soda can]]'s) resembles the jog-and-shuttle control wheel used on some [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s. The [[Nintendo Wii]] game ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' is bundled with the [[Wii Wheel]]: a steering wheel-shaped shell that the [[Wii Remote]] is placed inside thus using the Wii Remote's motion sensing capabilities to control the [[Go-kart|kart]] during the game. Hori also has a steering wheel that is made for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''. When the steering wheel is placed on the back of the console, then it will have the same ability as in ''Mario Kart Wii'' by using the [[gyroscope]] in [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] mode.\n\n=== Yoke ===\n: A yoke is very similar to a steering wheel except that it resembles the control yoke found on many aircraft and has two axes of movement: not only rotational movement about the shaft of the yoke, but also a forward-and-backward axis equivalent to that of pitch control on the yoke of an aircraft. Some yokes have additional controls attached directly to the yoke for simulation of aircraft functions such as radio push-to-talk buttons. Some flight simulator sets that include yokes also come with various other aircraft controls such as throttle quadrants and pedals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.logitechg.com/en-roeu/products/flight/flight-simulator-yoke-system.html|title=Logitech G Flight Simulator Yoke System with Throttle Quadrant|website=www.logitechg.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref> These sets, including the yoke, are intended to be used in a [[flight simulator]].\n\n=== Pedals ===\n:[[File:LDFGT.JPG|thumb|Logitech Driving Force GT]]Pedals may be used for driving simulations or flight simulations and often ships with a steering-wheel-type input device.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals|last=Shelly|first=Gary|last2=Vermaat|first2=Misty|publisher=Course Technology Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=9781423927020|location=Boston, MA|pages=172}}</ref> In the former case, an asymmetric set of pedals can simulate accelerator, brake, and clutch pedals in a real automobile. In the latter case, a symmetric set of pedals simulates rudder controls and toe brakes in an aircraft. As mentioned, most steering wheel controllers come with a set of pedals.

The mouse is often used with a [[mousepad]] to achieve greater speed, comfort, accuracy and smoother movement for the gamer. Some video game consoles also have the ability to function with a keyboard and a mouse. The computer keyboard is modelled after the [[typewriter keyboard]] and was designed for the input of written text. A mouse is a handheld [[pointing device]] used in addition to the keyboard. For games, the keyboard typically controls movement of the character while the mouse is used to control the game camera or used for aiming. While originally designed for general computer input, there are several keyboard and mouse peripherals available which are designed specifically for gaming, often with gaming-specific functions built-in. Examples include peripherals by [[Razer USA|Razer]], the \"Zboard\" range of keyboards and [[Logitech]]'s 'G' series. The numeric [[Keyboard technology|keypad]] found on the keyboard is also used as a game controller and can be found on a number of separate devices, most notably early consoles, usually attached to a joystick or a paddle. The keypad is a small grid of keys with at least the digits 0-9. A [[Gaming keypad]] is a specialized controller used for [[first-person shooter|FPSs]], [[Real-time strategy|RTSs]] and some arcade type games. These controllers can be programmed to allow the emulation of keys, and macros in some cases. These generally resemble a small part of a keyboard but may also feature other inputs such as [[analog stick]]s. They were developed because some of these games require a keyboard to play, and some players find this to be awkward for such a task.\n\n=== Touchscreen ===\n:[[File:Nintendo-DS-Lite-w-stylus.png|thumb|240px|Nintendo DS touchscreen (bottom) with [[stylus]].]]A [[touchscreen]] is an input device that allows the user to interact with the computer by touching the display screen. The first attempt at a [[handheld game console]] with touchscreen controls was Sega's intended successor to the [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]], though the device was ultimately shelved and never released due to the high cost of touchscreen technology in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p7.html|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA|page=7|website=IGN|first=Travis|last=Fahs|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref> The first released console to use a touchscreen was the [[Tiger Electronics|Tiger]] [[game.com]] in 1997. Nintendo popularized it for use in video games with the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]]; other systems including the [[Tapwave Zodiac]] as well as [[Smartphone]]s and the vast majority of [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] have also included this feature. The primary controller for Nintendo's [[Wii U]] console, the [[Wii U GamePad]], features an embedded touchscreen. Modern touch screens use a thin, durable, transparent plastic sheet overlaid onto a glass screen. The location of a touch is calculated from the [[capacitance]] for the X and Y [[Coordinate system|axes]], which varies based upon where the sheet is touched. One console that is touchscreen, but is not manufactured by Nintendo is Sony's PlayStation Vita which has a 5 inch OLED touchscreen. The [[Nintendo Switch]] features a 6.2 inch touchscreen.\n\n=== Breathing controllers ===\n: Breathing controllers help their users improve breathing through video games. All controllers have sensors that sense users breath, with which user controls video game on computer, tablet or on smartphone.

The [[Sixaxis]], [[DualShock 3]], and [[PlayStation Move]] controllers for Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] system have similar motion sensing capabilities. In 2010, Microsoft released the [[Kinect]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. This motion sensing controller uses cameras to track a players movement. Microsoft released a revised version of the Kinect with the launch of the [[Xbox One]]. This controller was bundled with the console on launch, and was removed from the default bundle in June 2014. Sony's [[EyeToy]] similarly uses cameras to detect the player's motions and translate them into inputs for the game.\n\n=== Light gun ===\n[[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Lightgun-FL.jpg|thumb|The Dreamcast light gun]]\n{{Main article|Light gun}}\n: A [[light gun]] is a peripheral used to \"shoot\" targets on a screen. They usually roughly resemble firearms or ray guns. Their use is normally limited to [[rail shooter]]s, or [[Shooter game#Shooting gallery|shooting gallery]] games like [[Duck Hunt]] and those which came with the ''[[Shooting Gallery (game accessory)|Shooting Gallery]]'' light gun. A rare example of a non-rail first person shooter game is [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s 1992 [[video game]] ''Gun Buster'', a [[first-person shooter]] that used a [[joystick]] to move and a light gun to [[Free look|aim]].<ref>{{KLOV game|8036|Gun Buster}}</ref> Though light guns have been used in earlier [[arcade game]]s such as [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sega Periscope|Periscope]]'' in 1966<ref>Ashcraft, Brian (2008), ''Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers'', p. 133, Kodansha International</ref> and ''Missile'' in 1969,<ref>{{KLOV game|10600|Missile}}</ref> the first home console light gun was released for the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] in 1972; later on, [[Nintendo]] would include one standard on their Famicom and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], called the [[NES Zapper]]. Nintendo has also released a \"shell\" in the style of a light gun for the more recent [[Wii Remote]] called the [[Wii Zapper]] which comes bundled with the game ''[[Link's Crossbow Training]]''.\n\n=== Rhythm game controllers ===\n\n[[File:Guitar Hero series controllers.jpg|thumb|Guitar controllers.]]\n: A [[Rhythm game accessories]] used for [[rhythm games]] can resemble musical instruments, such as [[guitar]]s (from 5-button guitars in ''[[Guitar Freaks]]'', the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' series, the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series to real guitars in ''[[Rock Band 3]]'' and ''[[Rocksmith]]''), [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s (''Rock Band 3''), [[drum]]s (''[[Donkey Konga]]'', ''[[Drum Mania]]'', the ''Rock Band'' series and the ''Guitar Hero'' series), or [[maraca]]s (''[[Samba de Amigo]]'') have also seen some success in arcades and home consoles. Other rhythm games are based around the art of Djing or [[turntablism]] (''[[DJ Hero]]''), or playing a [[synthesizer]] (''[[IIDX]]'')  using a [[Turntablism|turntable]] shaped peripheral with buttons.\n\n=== Wireless ===\n: [[Wireless]] versions of many popular controller types (joypads, mice, keyboards) exist, and wireless motion controls are an emerging class for virtual reality.\n\n=== Others ===\n* Pinball controllers and multi-button consoles for strategy games were released in the past, but their popularity was limited to hardcore fans of the genre.\n* [[Dance pad]]s, essentially a grid of flat pressure-sensitive gamepad buttons set on a mat meant to be stepped on, have seen niche success with the popularity of rhythm games like ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' and ''[[Pump It Up (video game)|Pump It Up]]''. The dance pad was first introduced by Bandai on the Famicom in 1986 as a part of their \"Family Fun Fitness\" set, then Exus released the \"Foot Craz\" pad for the Atari 2600 in 1987. Nintendo purchased the technology from Bandai in 1988 and used it on their \"Power Pad\", for the Famicom and NES.\n* [[Balance board]]: The [[Wii Balance Board]] comes with the game ''[[Wii Fit]]''. Several other game are in development which will be compatible with the balance board. This was preceded by decades by the ''[[Joyboard]]'', made to plug into an Atari 2600, to play skiing and surfing games.\n* Buzzers: A recent example of specialized, while very simple, game controllers, is the four large \"buzzers\" (round buttons) supplied with the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 [[Game show|quiz show]] game series ''[[Buzz!]]'' (2005\u2013present); both game and controllers clearly being inspired by the television show genre.\n* [[NeGcon]]: is a unique controller for racing games on the PlayStation. Physically it resembles a gamepad, but its left and right halves twist relative to each other, making it a variation of the paddle controller.\n* [[Microphone]]: A few games have made successes in using a headset or microphone as a secondary controller, such as ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'', the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series, the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]], the ''[[SingStar]]'' series, ''[[Tom Clancy's Endwar]]'', the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, and the ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' series. The use of these microphones allowed players to issue commands to the game, controlling teammates (as in ''SOCOM'') and other AI characters (e.g., Pikachu). The [[Nintendo DS]] features a microphone that is built into the system. It has been used for a variety of purposes, including [[speech recognition]] (''[[Nintendogs]]'', ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!]]''), chatting online between and during gameplay sessions ([[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]), and minigames that require the player to blow or shout into the microphone (''[[Feel the Magic: XY/XX]]'', ''[[WarioWare: Touched!]]'', ''[[Mario Party DS]]'').\n* ''[[Steel Battalion]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] was bundled with a full dashboard, with 2 joysticks and over 30 buttons, in an attempt to make it feel like an actual mecha simulator.\n* [[Fishing rod]]: the first fishing rod controller appeared as an accessory for the [[Dreamcast]] video console for playing ''[[Sega Marine Fishing]]''. Later other games for PlayStation console use also a similar controllers.\n* [[Fog display|Floating Interactive Display]]: at least two commercial systems ([[Heliodisplay]] and [http://fogscreen.com/ FogScreen]) offer interactive \"floating interfaces\" which display an image projected in mid-air but can be interacted with by finger similar to a touch screen.\n* [[Brain\u2013computer interface|Mind-controlled]] headset: As of March 24, 2007 a United States/Australian company called [[Emotiv Systems]] began launching a mind-controlled device for [[video game]]s based on [[electroencephalography]]. It was reported by [[The Wall Street Journal]]'s Don Clark on [[MSNBC]].<ref name=\"MSNBC report\">{{cite web|url=http://video.msn.com/?mkt=en-us&brand=msnbc&tab=m5&rf=&from=00&vid=09e9f856-63f3-40cd-83e6-eb6f2910a31c| publisher=MSNBC|title=Video Game Mind Control|accessdate=2007-03-25|year=2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n* [[PCGamerBike]] similar to a pair of pedals removed from an exercise bike, then set down in front of a chair & used to precisely control game characters instead.\n* [[Optical motion tracking]] systems such as [[TrackIR]] and [[FreeTrack]] use a video camera to track an infrared illuminated or emissive headpiece. Small head movements are tracked and then translated into much larger virtual in-game movements, allowing hands-free view control and improved immersiveness.\n* Mechanical motion tracking systems like [[Gametrak]] use cables attached to gloves for tracking position of physical elements in [[three-dimensional space]] in [[wiktionary:real time|real time]]. The Gametrak mechanism contains a retracting cable reel and a small tubular guide arm from which the cable passes out. The guide arm is articulated in a [[ball joint]] such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism. The distance of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure the rotation of the spool drum for the retracting cable reel, and calculating how far the cable is extended.\n* Exoskeleton controllers use exoskeleton technology to provide the player with different responses based on the player's body position, speed of movement, and other sensed data. In addition to audio and visual responses, an exoskeleton controller may provide a controlled resistance to movement and other stimuli to provide realism to the action. This not only lets players feel as if they are actually performing the function, but also helps reinforce the correct muscle pattern for the activity being simulated. The Forcetek XIO is an example of an exoskeleton video game controller.\n* [[Flight instruments|Instrument panels]] are simulated aircraft instrument panels, either generic or specific to a real aircraft, that are used in place of the keyboard to send commands to a flight simulation program. Some of these are far more expensive than all the rest of a computer system combined. The panels usually only simulate switches, buttons, and controls, rather than output instrument displays.\n** Train controls: Other instrument panel like hardware such as train controls have been produced. The \"[[RailDriver]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raildriver.com/products/raildriver.php|title=RailDriver&nbsp;\u2013 Desktop Train Cab Controller|publisher = www.raildriver.com|accessdate=2009-01-24|last = |first = }}</ref> for example is designed to work with ''[[Trainz]]'', ''[[Microsoft Train Simulator]]'' and ''[[Rail Simulator|Kuju Rail Simulator]]''. (as of January 2009) it is limited in ease of use by the lack of a Windows API for some of the software it is designed to work with.

([[Turia (Ca\u0219in)|Torja]] is the name of a stream nearby and is also the Hungarian name of the nearby village [[Turia, Covasna|Turia]].) Originally, the Hungarian name K\u00e9zdiv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely was also used in Romanian in the form Chezdi-O\u0219orheiu, but this was altered to T\u00eergu Secuiesc (now spelled T\u00e2rgu Secuiesc) after the accession to [[Romania]] in 1920 under the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. The Hungarian native name means \u201cK\u00e9zdi Market\u201d, K\u00e9zdi being the name of a [[Sz\u00e9kely Land|Sz\u00e9kely]] \u201cseat\u201d, a historical administrative unit. Its status as a market town dates back to the Middle Ages. The city was taken over by Hungary during World War II, following the [[Second Vienna Award]] of August, 1940.{{cn|date=January 2020}} A small Jewish community was set up in the 1880s; it numbered 66 in 1920. In May 1944, the Hungarian authorities sent its members to the [[Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe ghetto]], and deported them to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] the following month.<ref name=\u201cspector\u201d>Shmuel Spector, Geoffrey Wigoder (eds.), ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: Seredina-Buda\u2014Z'', p. 1290.

([[Turia (Ca\u0219in)|Torja]] is the name of a stream nearby and is also the Hungarian name of the nearby village [[Turia, Covasna|Turia]].) Originally, the Hungarian name K\u00e9zdiv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely was also used in Romanian in the form Chezdi-O\u0219orheiu, but this was altered to T\u00eergu Secuiesc (now spelled T\u00e2rgu Secuiesc) after the accession to [[Romania]] in 1920 under the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. The Hungarian native name means \u201cK\u00e9zdi Market\u201d, K\u00e9zdi being the name of a [[Sz\u00e9kely Land|Sz\u00e9kely]] \u201cseat\u201d, a historical administrative unit. Its status as a market town dates back to the Middle Ages. The city was taken over by Hungary during World War II, following the [[Second Vienna Award]] of August, 1940.{{cn|date=January 2020}} A small Jewish community was set up in the 1880s; it numbered 66 in 1920. In May 1944, the Hungarian authorities sent its members to the [[Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe ghetto]], and deported them to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] the following month.<ref name=\u201cspector\u201d>Shmuel Spector, Geoffrey Wigoder (eds.), ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: Seredina-Buda\u2014Z'', p. 1290.

During this period, his brother Wilhelm married, but Alexander did not attend the nuptials.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=51}}\n\n==Travels and work in Europe==\nHumboldt graduated from the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|Freiberg School of Mines]] in 1792 and was appointed to a Prussian government position in the Department of Mines as an inspector in Bayreuth and the Fichtel mountains. Humboldt was excellent at his job, with production of gold ore in his first year outstripping the previous eight years.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=53}} During his period as a mine inspector, Humboldt demonstrated his deep concern for the men laboring in the mines. He opened a free school for miners, paid for out of his own pocket, which became an unchartered government training school for labor. He also sought to establish an emergency relief fund for miners, aiding them following accidents.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=54-55}}\n\nHumboldt's researches into the vegetation of the mines of [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] led to the publication in Latin (1793) of his ''Florae Fribergensis, accedunt Aphorismi ex Doctrina, Physiologiae Chemicae Plantarum'', which was a compendium of his botanical researches.<ref>Wilson, \"Alexander von Humboldt: A Chronology\", p. lxvii.</ref> That publication brought him to the attention of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who had met Humboldt at the family home when Alexander was a boy, but Goethe was now interested in meeting the young scientist to discuss metamorphism of plants.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=18, 57}} An introduction was arranged by Humboldt's brother, who lived in the university town of Jena, not far from Goethe. Goethe had developed his own extensive theories on comparative anatomy. Working before Darwin, he believed that animals had an internal force, an ''urform'', that gave them a basic shape and then they were further adapted to their environment by an external force. Humboldt urged him to publish his theories. Together, the two discussed and expanded these ideas. Goethe and Humboldt soon became close friends.\n\nHumboldt often returned to Jena in the years that followed. Goethe remarked about Humboldt to friends that he had never met anyone so versatile. Humboldt's drive served as an inspiration for Goethe. In 1797, Humboldt returned to Jena for three months. During this time, Goethe moved from his residence in Weimar to reside in Jena. Together, Humboldt and Goethe attended university lectures on anatomy and conducted their own experiments. One experiment involved hooking up a frog leg to various metals. They found no effect until the moisture of Humboldt's breath triggered a reaction that caused the frog leg to leap off the table. Humboldt described this as one of his favorite experiments because it was as if he were \"breathing life into\" the leg.{{sfn|Wulf|2015}}\n\nDuring this visit, a thunderstorm killed a farmer and his wife. Humboldt obtained their corpses and analyzed them in the anatomy tower of the university.{{sfn|Wulf|2015}}\n\n[[File:Weimarer Klassik.jpg|thumb|Schiller, Wilhelm, and Alexander von Humboldt with Goethe in [[Jena]]]]\nIn 1794, Humboldt was admitted to the famous group of intellectuals and cultural leaders of [[Weimar Classicism]]. Goethe and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] were the key figures at the time. Humboldt contributed (7 June 1795) to Schiller's new periodical, ''Die Horen'', a philosophical [[allegory]] entitled {{lang|de|Die Lebenskraft, oder der rhodische Genius}}.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1792 and 1797, Humboldt was in [[Vienna]]; in 1795 he made a geological and botanical tour through Switzerland and Italy. Although this service to the state was regarded by him as only an apprenticeship to the service of science, he fulfilled its duties with such conspicuous ability that not only did he rise rapidly to the highest post in his department, but he was also entrusted with several important diplomatic missions.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nNeither brother attended the funeral of their mother on 19 November 1796.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=39}} Humboldt had not hidden his aversion to his mother, with one correspondent writing of him after her death, \"her death... must be particularly welcomed by you\".<ref>Carl Freiesleben quoted in {{harvnb|Wulf|2015|p=39}}.</ref> After severing his official connections, he awaited an opportunity to fulfill his long-cherished dream of travel.\n\nHumboldt was able to spend more time on writing up his research. He had used his own body for experimentation on muscular irritability, recently discovered by [[Luigi Galvani]] and published his results, {{lang|de|Versuche \u00fcber die gereizte Muskel- und Nervenfaser}}(Berlin, 1797) (''Experiments on Stimulated Muscle and Nerve Fibres''), enriched in the French translation with notes by Blumenbach.\n\n==Spanish American expedition, 1799\u20131804==\n[[File:Map Alexander von Humboldt expedition-en.svg|thumb|left|400px|Alexander von Humboldt's Latin American expedition]]\n\n===Seeking a foreign expedition===\nWith the financial resources to finance his scientific travels, he sought a ship on a major expedition. Meantime, he went to Paris, where his brother Wilhelm was now living. Paris was a great center of scientific learning and his brother and sister-in-law Caroline were well connected in those circles. [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] urged Humboldt to accompany him on a major expedition, likely to last five years, but the French revolutionary [[Directoire]] placed [[Nicolas Baudin]] at the head of it rather than the aging scientific traveler.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=80}} On the postponement of Captain Baudin's proposed voyage of [[circumnavigation]] due to continuing warfare in Europe, which Humboldt had been officially invited to accompany, Humboldt was deeply disappointed. He had already selected scientific instruments for his voyage. He did, however, have a stroke of luck with meeting [[Aim\u00e9 Bonpland]], the botanist and physician for the voyage. Discouraged, the two left Paris for [[Marseilles]], where they hoped to join [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in Egypt, but North Africans were in revolt against the French invasion in Egypt and French authorities refused permission to travel.

These were lengthy, state-sponsored enterprises to gather information about plants and animals from the Spanish realms, assess economic possibilities, and provide plants and seeds for the Royal Botanical Garden in Madrid (founded 1755).{{sfn|Bleichmar|2012|p=5}} These expeditions took naturalists and artists, who created visual images as well as careful written observations as well as collecting seeds and plants themselves.{{sfn|Bleichmar|2012|p=19}} Crown officials as early as 1779 issued and systematically distributed ''Instructions concerning the most secure and economic means to transport live plants by land and sea from the most distant countries'', with illustrations, including one for the crates to transport seeds and plants.<ref>Casimiro G\u00f3mez Ortega, ''Instrucci\u00f3n sobre el modo m\u00e1s seguro y econ\u00f3mico de transportar plantas vivas por mar y tierra a los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s distantes ilustrada con l\u00e1minas.

Spain under the Habsburg monarchy had guarded its realms against foreigner travelers and intruders. The Bourbon monarch was open to Humboldt's proposal. Spanish Foreign Minister Don [[Mariano Luis de Urquijo]] received the formal proposal and Humboldt was presented to the monarch in March 1799.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=83}} Humboldt was granted access to crown officials and written documentation on Spain's empire.

Humboldt had not mapped out a specific plan of exploration, so that the change did not upend a fixed itinerary. He later wrote that the diversion to Venezuela made possible his explorations along the Orinoco River to the border of Portuguese Brazil. With the diversion, the ''Pizarro'' encountered two large dugout canoes each carrying 18 Guayaqui Indians. The ''Pizarro''{{'}}s captain accepted the offer of one of them to serve as pilot.

A great deal of information on the new jurisdiction had already been compiled by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Pons]], but was not published until 1806.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=517}}<ref>F.J. de Pons.

This trip, which lasted four months and covered {{convert|1725|mi|km}} of wild and largely uninhabited country, had an aim of establishing the existence of the [[Casiquiare canal]] (a communication between the water systems of the rivers Orinoco and [[Amazon River|Amazon]]). Although, unbeknownst to Humboldt, this existence had been established decades before<ref>The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World by Andrea Wulf</ref>, his expedition had the important results of determining the exact position of the [[River bifurcation|bifurcation]],<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> and documenting the life of several native tribes such as the [[Maypure|Maipure]]s and their extinct rivals the Atures (several words of the latter tribe were transferred to Humboldt by one parrot<ref>Mark Forsyth. The etymologicon. Icon Books Ltd. London N79DP, (2011), p. 123.</ref>). Around 19 March 1800, Humboldt and Bonpland discovered dangerous [[electric eel]]s, whose shock could kill a man. To catch them, locals suggested they drive wild horses into the river, which brought the eels out from the river mud, and resulted in a violent confrontation of eels and horses, some of which died. Humboldt and Bonpland captured and dissected some eels, which retained their ability to shock; both received potentially dangerous electric shocks during their investigations. The encounter made Humboldt think more deeply about electricity and magnetism, typical of his ability to extrapolate from an observation to more general principles.<ref>{{harvnb|Wulf|2015|pp=62\u201363}}.

During an initial three-month stay at [[Havana]], his first tasks were to properly survey that city and the nearby towns of [[Guanabacoa]], [[Regla]], and [[Bejucal]]. He befriended Cuban landowner and thinker [[Francisco de Arango y Parre\u00f1o]]; together they visited the {{lang|es|Guines}} area in south Havana, the valleys of [[Matanzas]] Province, and the [[Valley of the Sugar Mills]] in [[Trinidad, Cuba|Trinidad]]. Those three areas were, at the time, the first frontier of sugar production in the island. During those trips, Humboldt collected statistical information on Cuba's population, production, technology and trade, and with Arango, made suggestions for enhancing them. He predicted that the agricultural and commercial potential of Cuba was huge and could be vastly improved with proper leadership in the future.\n\nOn their way back to Europe from Mexico on their way to the United States, Humboldt and Bonpland stopped again in Cuba, leaving from the port of Veracruz and arriving in Cuba on 7 January 1804, staying until 29 April 1804.

Even before Humboldt and Bonpland started on their way to New Spain's [[Mexico City|capital]] on Mexico's central plateau, Humboldt realized the captain of the vessel that brought them to Acapulco had reckoned its location incorrectly. Since Acapulco was the main west-coast port and the terminus of the [[Manila Galleon|Asian trade]] from the Spanish Philippines, having accurate maps of its location was extremely important. Humboldt set up his instruments, surveying the deep-water bay of Acapulco, to determine its longitude.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=149\u2013150}}<ref>\"Alexander von Humboldt Chronology\", p. lxviii-lxvix.</ref>\n\nHumboldt and Bonpland landed in Acapulco on 15 February 1803, and from there they went to [[Taxco]], a silver-mining town in modern [[Guerrero]]. In April 1803, he visited [[Cuernavaca]], [[Morelos]]. Impressed by its climate, he nicknamed the city the ''City of Eternal Spring''.<ref>https://masdemorelos.masdemx.com/2018/04/cuernavaca-morelos-eterna-primavera-von-humboldt-exploraciones-historia/ accessed Dec 28, 2018</ref><ref>http://www.moreloshabla.com/morelos/cuernavaca/por-que-le-decimos-ciudad-de-la-eterna-primavera-a-cuernavaca/ accessed Dec 28, 2018</ref> Humboldt and Bonpland arrived in Mexico City, having been officially welcomed via a letter from the king's representative in New Spain, Viceroy Don [[Jos\u00e9 de Iturrigaray]]. Humboldt was also given a special passport to travel throughout New Spain and letters of introduction to intendants, the highest officials in New Spain's administrative districts (intendancies). This official aid to Humboldt allowed him to have access to crown records, mines, landed estates, canals, and Mexican antiquities from the prehispanic era.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=156}} Humboldt read the writings of Bishop-elect of the important diocese of Michoacan [[Manuel Abad y Queipo]], a [[classical liberal]], that were directed to the crown for the improvement of New Spain.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}}\n\nThey spent the year in the viceroyalty, traveling to different Mexican cities in the central plateau and the northern mining region. The first journey was from Acapulco to Mexico City, through what is now the Mexican state of [[Guerrero]]. The route was suitable only for mule train, and all along the way, Humboldt took measurements of elevation. When he left Mexico a year later in 1804, from the east coast port of Veracruz, he took a similar set of measures, which resulted in a chart in the ''Political Essay'', the physical plan of Mexico with the dangers of the road from Acapulco to Mexico City, and from Mexico City to Veracruz.<ref>''Plano f\u00edsico de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a, Perfil del Camino de Acapulco a M\u00e9gico [sic], y de M\u00e9gico a Veracruz''. Chart is published in Magali M. Carrera, ''Traveling from New Spain to Mexico: Mapping Practices of Nineteenth-century Mexico'', Durham: Duke University Press 2011, p.70, plate 18.</ref> This visual depiction of elevation was part of Humboldt's general insistence that the data he collected be presented in a way more easily understood than statistical charts. A great deal of his success in gaining a more general readership for his works was his understanding that \"anything that has to do with extent or quantity can be represented geometrically. Statistical projections [charts and graphs], which speak to the senses without tiring the intellect have the advantage of bringing attention to a large number of important facts\".<ref>Alexander von Humboldt, ''Atl\u00e1s g\u00e9ographique et physique du Royaume de la Nouvelle-Espagne'', lxxxiii-lxxiv, quoted in Anne Godlewska, ''Geography Unbound: French Geographic Science from Cassini to Humboldt''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1999, p. 257.</ref>\n\nHumboldt was impressed with Mexico City, which at the time was the largest city in the Americas, and one that could be counted as modern. He declared \"no city of the new continent, without even excepting those of the United States, can display such great and solid scientific establishments as the capital of Mexico\".<ref>Humboldt, ''Political essay'', p. 74.</ref> He pointed to the [[Palacio de Miner\u00eda#History|Royal College of Mines]], the [[National Palace (Mexico)#Viceroy palace|Royal Botanical Garden]] and the [[Academy of San Carlos|Royal Academy of San Carlos]] as exemplars of a metropolitan capital in touch with the latest developments on the continent and insisting on its modernity.{{sfn|Brading|1991|pp=526\u201327}} He also recognized important [[Creole peoples#Former Spanish colonies|creole]] savants in Mexico, including [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Alzate y Ram\u00edrez]], who died in 1799, just before Humboldt's visit; Miguel Vel\u00e1squez de Le\u00f3n; and [[Antonio de Le\u00f3n y Gama]].{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}}\n\nHumboldt spent time at the Valenciana silver mine in [[Guanajuato]], central New Spain, at the time the most important in the Spanish empire.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=525}} The bicentennial of his visit in Guanajuato was celebrated with a conference at the [[University of Guanajuato]], with Mexican academics highlighting various aspects of his impact on the city.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Luis Lara Vald\u00e9s, ''Bicentenario de Humboldt en Guanajuato (1803\u20132003)''. Guanajuato: Ediciones La Rana 2003.</ref> Humboldt could have simply examined the geology of the fabulously rich mine, but he took the opportunity to study the entire mining complex as well as analyze mining statistics of its output. His report on silver mining is a major contribution, and considered the strongest and best informed section of his ''Political Essay''. Although Humboldt was himself a trained geologist and mining inspector, he drew on mining experts in Mexico. One was [[Fausto Elhuyar]], then head of the General Mining Court in Mexico City, who, like Humboldt was trained in Freiberg. Another was [[Andr\u00e9s Manuel del R\u00edo]], director of Royal College of Mines, whom Humboldt knew when they were both students in Freiberg.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=51, 156}} The Bourbon monarchs had established the mining court and the college to elevate mining as a profession, since revenues from silver constituted the crown's largest source of income. Humboldt also consulted other German mining experts, who were already in Mexico.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}} While Humboldt was a welcome foreign scientist and mining expert, the Spanish crown had established fertile ground for Humboldt's investigations into mining.\n\nSpanish America's ancient civilizations were a source of interest for Humboldt, who included images of Mexican manuscripts (or codices) and Inca ruins in his richly illustrated ''Vues des cordill\u00e8res et monuments des peuples indig\u00e8nes de l'Amerique'' (1810\u20131813), the most experimental of Humboldt's publications, since it does not have \"a single ordering principle\" but his opinions and contentions based on observation.<ref>Vera M. Kutzinski and Ottmar Ette, \"Introduction\" to ''Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas, A Critical Edition''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2012, p. xxi.</ref> For Humboldt, a key question was the influence of climate on the development of these civilizations.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=523}} When he published his ''Vues des cordill\u00e8res'', he included a color image of the [[Aztec calendar stone]], which had been discovered buried in the [[Z\u00f3calo|main plaza]] of Mexico City in 1790, along with select drawings of the [[Dresden codex]] and others he sought out later in European collections. His aim was to muster evidence that these pictorial and sculptural images could allow the reconstruction of prehispanic history. He sought out Mexican experts in the interpretation of sources from there, especially Antonio Pichardo, who was the literary executor of [[Antonio de Le\u00f3n y Gama]]'s work. For American-born Spaniards ([[Creole peoples#Former Spanish colonies|creoles]]) who were seeking sources of pride in Mexico's ancient past, Humboldt's recognition of these ancient works and dissemination in his publications was a boon. He read the work of exiled Jesuit [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]], which celebrated Mexico's prehispanic civilization, and which Humboldt invoked to counter the pejorative assertions about the new world by Buffon, de Pauw, and Raynal.<ref>Vera M. Kutzinski and Ottmar Ette, \"Introduction\", p. xv.</ref> Humboldt ultimately viewed both the prehispanic realms of Mexico and Peru as despotic and barbaric.{{sfn|Brading|1991|pp=523\u2013525}} However, he also drew attention to indigenous monuments and artifacts as cultural productions that had \"both ... historical ''and'' artistic significance\".<ref>Vera M. Kutzinski and Ottmar Ette, \"Introduction\", p. xxxiii.</ref>\n\nOne of his most widely read publications resulting from his travels and investigations in Spanish America was the ''Essai politique sur le royaum de la Nouvelle Espagne'', quickly translated to English as ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'' (1811).<ref>''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'', (four volumes) translator John Black, London/Edinburgh: Longman, Hurst, Rees Orme and brown; and H.

Jefferson and his cabinet sought information from Humboldt when he visited Washington, D.C., about Spain's territory in Mexico, now bordering the U.S.]]\n\nLeaving from Cuba, Humboldt decided to take an unplanned short visit to the United States. Knowing that the current U.S. president, [[Thomas Jefferson]], was himself a scientist, Humboldt wrote to him saying that he would be in the United States. Jefferson warmly replied, inviting him to visit the [[White House]] in the nation's new capital. In his letter Humboldt had gained Jefferson's interest by mentioning that he had discovered [[mammoth]] teeth near the Equator. Jefferson had previously written that he believed mammoths had never lived so far south. Humboldt had also hinted at his knowledge of New Spain.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Schwarz, Ingo (2001-01-01). \"Alexander von Humboldt's Visit to Washington and Philadelphia, His Friendship with Jefferson, and His Fascination with the United States\". Northeastern Naturalist 8: 43\u201356.</ref>\n\nArriving in [[Philadelphia]], which was a center of learning in the U.S., Humboldt met with some of the major scientific figures of the era, including chemist and anatomist [[Caspar Wistar (physician)|Caspar Wistar]], who pushed for compulsory smallpox vaccination, and botanist [[Benjamin Smith Barton]], as well as physician [[Benjamin Rush]], a signer of the Declaration of Independence, who wished to hear about [[cinchona]] bark from a South American tree, which cured fevers.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=175\u201376}} Humboldt later published a treatise in English on cinchona.<ref>Alexander von Humboldt,[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/14437 ''An illustration of the genus Cinchona :comprising descriptions of all the officinal Peruvian barks, including several new species, Baron de Humboldt's Account of the Cinchona forests of South America, and Laubert's Memoir on the different species of quinquina: to which are added several dissertations of Don Hippolito Ruiz on various medicinal plants of South America '']</ref>\n\nAfter arriving in Washington D.C, Humboldt held numerous intense discussions with Jefferson on both scientific matters and also his year-long stay in New Spain. Jefferson had only recently concluded the [[Louisiana Purchase]], which now placed New Spain on the southwest border of the United States. The Spanish minister in Washington, D.C. had declined to furnish the U.S. government with information about Spanish territories, and access to the territories was strictly controlled. Humboldt was able to supply Jefferson with the latest information on the population, trade agriculture and military of New Spain. This information would later be the basis for his ''Essay on the Political Kingdom of New Spain'' (1810). Jefferson was unsure of where the border of the newly-purchased [[Louisiana]] was precisely, and Humboldt wrote him a two-page report on the matter. Jefferson would later refer to Humboldt as \"the most scientific man of the age\". Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury, said of Humboldt \"I was delighted and swallowed more information of various kinds in less than two hours than I had for two years past in all I had read or heard\". Gallatin, in turn, supplied Humboldt with information he sought on the United States.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nAfter six weeks, Humboldt set sail for Europe from the mouth of the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] and landed at [[Bordeaux]] on 3 August 1804.\n\n===Travel diaries===\nHumboldt kept a detailed diary of his sojourn to Spanish America, running some 4,000 pages, which he drew on directly for his multiple publications following the expedition. The leather-bound diaries themselves are now in Germany, having been returned from Russia to East Germany, where they were taken by the Red Army after World War II. Following German reunification, the diaries were returned to a descendant of Humboldt. For a time, there was concern about their being sold, but that was averted.<ref>http://m.dw.com/en/humboldt-america-diaries-to-stay-in-germany/a-17271671, accessed 1 March 2017</ref> A government-funded project to digitize the Spanish American expedition as well as his later Russian expedition has been undertaken (2014\u20132017) by the University of Potsdam and the German State Library\u2014Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.<ref>http://www.uni-potsdam.de/tapoints/?p=1654 accessed 1 March 2017.</ref>\n\n===Achievements of the Latin American expedition===\n{{see also|Humboldtian science}}\nHumboldt's decades' long endeavor to publish the results of this expedition not only resulted in multiple volumes, but also made his international reputation in scientific circles. Humboldt came to be well-known with the reading public as well, with popular, densely illustrated, condensed versions of his work in multiple languages. Bonpland, his fellow scientist and collaborator on the expedition, collected botanical specimens and preserved them, but unlike Humboldt who had a passion to publish, Bonpland had to be prodded to do the formal descriptions. Many scientific travelers and explorers produced huge visual records, which remained unseen by the general public until the late nineteenth century, in the case of the Malaspina Expedition, and even the late twentieth century, when Mutis's botanical, some 12,000 drawings from New Granada, was published. Humboldt, by contrast, published immediately and continuously, using and ultimately exhausting his personal fortune, to produce both scientific and popular texts. Humboldt's name and fame were made by his travels to Spanish America, particularly his publication of the ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain''. His image as the premier European scientist was a later development.<ref>Nicolaas Rupke, \"A Geography of Enlightenment: The Critical Reception of Alexander von Humboldt's Mexico Work\".

The achievements of the Bourbon regime, especially in New Spain, were evident in the precise data Humboldt systematized and published.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}}\n\nThis memorable expedition may be regarded as having laid the foundation of the sciences of [[physical geography]], [[plant geography]], and [[meteorology]]. Key to that was Humboldt's meticulous and systematic measurement of phenomena with the most advanced instruments then available. He closely observed plant and animal species in situ, not just in isolation, noting all elements in relation to one other. He collected specimens of plants and animals, dividing the growing collection so that if a portion was lost, other parts might survive.\n\n[[File:Frederich heinrich baron von humboldt-charles wilson peale.JPG|thumb|upright|Humboldt depicted by American artist [[Charles Willson Peale]], 1805, who met Humboldt when he visited the U.S. in 1804]]\n\nHumboldt saw the need for an approach to science that could account for the harmony of nature among the diversity of the physical world. For Humboldt, \"the unity of nature\" meant that it was the interrelation of all [[physical sciences]]\u2014such as the conjoining between [[biology]], [[meteorology]] and [[geology]]\u2014that determined where specific plants grew. He found these relationships by unraveling myriad, painstakingly collected data,{{sfn|Helferich|2004|p=25}} data extensive enough that it became an enduring foundation upon which others could base their work. Humboldt viewed nature [[holism|holistically]], and tried to explain natural phenomena without the appeal to religious dogma. He believed in the central importance of observation, and as a consequence had amassed a vast array of the most sophisticated scientific instruments then available. Each had its own velvet lined box and was the most accurate and portable of its time; nothing quantifiable escaped measurement. According to Humboldt, everything should be measured with the finest and most modern instruments and sophisticated techniques available, for that collected data was the basis of all scientific understanding.\n\nThis quantitative methodology would become known as [[Humboldtian science]]. Humboldt wrote \"Nature herself is sublimely eloquent. The stars as they sparkle in firmament fill us with delight and ecstasy, and yet they all move in orbit marked out with mathematical precision.\"<ref>Alexander von Humboldt, ''Personal Narrative of Travels of the Equinocial Regions of the New Continent during Years 1799\u20131804'' (London, 1814), Vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;34\u201335</ref>\n\n[[File:Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich - Ideen zu einer Geographie der Pflanzen nebst einem Naturgem\u00e4lde der Tropenl\u00e4nder - 000012142.jpg|thumb|right|Humboldt's ''Naturgem\u00e4lde'', also known as the Chimborazo Map, is his depiction of the volcanoes Chimborazo and Cotopaxi in cross section, with detailed information about plant geography.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2011, 125.</ref> Humboldt first sketched the map when he was in South America, which included written descriptions on either side of the cross-section of Chimborazo. These detailed the information on temperature, altitude, humidity, atmosphere pressure, and the animal and plants (with their scientific names) found at each elevation. Plants from the same genus appear at different elevations. The depiction is on an east-west axis going from the Pacific coast lowlands to the Andean range of which Chimborazo was a part, and the eastern Amazonian basin. Humboldt showed the three zones of coast, mountains, and Amazonia, based on his own observations, but he also drew on existing Spanish sources, particularly [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]], which he explicitly referred to. The Spanish American scientist [[Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas]] had also measured and observed mountain environments and had earlier come to similar ideas about environmental factors in the distribution of life forms.<ref>Zimmerer, \"Mapping Mountains\", p. 129.</ref> Humboldt was thus not putting forward something entirely new, but it is argued that his finding is not derivative either.<ref>Jorge Ca\u00f1izares-Esguerra, ''How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2001.</ref> The Chimborazo map displayed complex information in an accessible fashion.

Its importance was attested by the speedy emergence of rival claims.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHis services to geology were based on his attentive study of the [[volcano]]es of the Andes and Mexico, which he observed and sketched, climbed, and measured with a variety of instruments. By climbing Chimborazo, he established an altitude record which became the basis for measurement of other volcanoes in the Andes and the Himalayas. As with other aspects of his investigations, he developed methods to show his synthesized results visually, using the graphic method of geologic-cross sections.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=375\u201376}} He showed that volcanoes fell naturally into linear groups, presumably corresponding with vast subterranean fissures; and by his demonstration of the [[igneous rock|igneous]] origin of rocks previously held to be of aqueous formation, he contributed largely to the elimination of erroneous views, such as [[Neptunism]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHumboldt was a significant contributor to cartography, creating maps, particularly of New Spain, that became the template for later mapmakers in Mexico. His careful recording of latitude and longitude led to accurate maps of Mexico, the port of Acapulco, the port of Veracruz, and the Valley of Mexico, and a map showing trade patterns among continents. His maps also included schematic information on geography, converting areas of administrative districts (intendancies) using proportional squares.<ref>Magali M.

Many of his drawings became the basis for illustrations of his many scientific and general publications. Artists whom Humboldt influenced, such as [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]], followed in his path and painted the same places Humboldt had visited and recorded, such as the basalt formations in Mexico, which was an illustration in his ''Vues des Cordill\u00e8res''.<ref>Alexander von Humboldt, ''Vues des Cordill\u00e8res et monumens des peuples indig\u00e8nes de l'Amerique''.

After a short trip to Italy with [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] for the purpose of investigating the law of [[magnetic declination]] and a stay of two and a half years in Berlin, in the spring of 1808, he settled in Paris. His purpose for being located there was to secure the scientific cooperation required for bringing his great work through the press. This colossal task, which he at first hoped would occupy but two years, eventually cost him twenty-one, and even then it remained incomplete.\n\n<gallery heights=\"150px\">\nFile:HumboldtHouseDF.JPG|House where Humboldt and Bonpland lived in [[Mexico City]] in 1803, located at 80 Rep. de Uruguay in the [[Centro (Mexico City)|historic centre]], just south of the [[Zocalo]]\nFile:StatueAlexHumboldtMexico.JPG|Statue to Humboldt in Alameda Park, Mexico City, erected 1999 on the two hundredth-anniversary of the beginning of his travels to Spanish America\nFile:Humboldt_-_Cuernavaca_I.jpg|Statue of Humboldt in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]]\nFile:Prismas Bas\u00e1lticos, Huasca de Ocampo, Hidalgo, M\u00e9xico, 2013-10-10, DD 42.JPG|Waterfall over the [[Basaltic Prisms of Santa Mar\u00eda Regla]], [[Huasca de Ocampo]], Hidalgo, Mexico, that Humboldt sketched\n</gallery>\n\n==Scholarly and public recognition==\n[[File:Alexander von humboldt 1807 225-91-1-PB.jpeg|upright|thumb|Humboldt in Berlin 1807]]\nDuring his lifetime Humboldt became one of the most famous men in Europe.{{sfn|Sachs|2006|p=1}} Academies, both native and foreign, were eager to elect him to their membership, the first being The [[American Philosophical Society]] in Philadelphia, which he visited at the tail end of his travel through the Americas.

The [[Royal Society]], whose president Sir Joseph Banks had aided Humboldt as a young man, now welcomed him as a foreign member.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=166}}\n\nAfter Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government recognized him with high honors for his services to the nation. In 1827, the first [[President of Mexico]], [[Guadalupe Victoria]] granted Humboldt Mexican citizenship<ref>Jaime Labastida. ''Humboldt: ciudadano universal''. Editorial Siglo XXI. M\u00e9xico. 1999. Pg.XVIII.</ref> and in 1859, the President of Mexico, [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], named Humboldt a hero of the nation (''benem\u00e9rito de la naci\u00f3n'').<ref>Labastida, ''Humboldt'', p. xviii.</ref> The gestures were purely honorary; he never returned to the Americas following his expedition.\n\nImportantly for Humboldt's long term financial stability, King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] conferred upon him the honor of the post of royal chamberlain, without at the time exacting the duties. The appointment had a pension of 2,500 [[thaler]]s, afterwards doubled. This official stipend became his main source of income in later years when he exhausted his fortune on the publications of his research. Financial necessity forced his permanent relocation to Berlin in 1827 from Paris. In Paris he found not only scientific sympathy, but the social stimulus which his vigorous and healthy mind eagerly craved. He was equally in his element as the lion of the [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]s and as the savant of the [[Institut de France]] and the observatory.\n\nOn 12 May 1827 he settled permanently in Berlin, where his first efforts were directed towards the furtherance of the science of terrestrial magnetism. In 1827, he began giving public lectures in Berlin, which became the basis for his last major publication, [[Kosmos (Humboldt)|''Kosmos'']] (1845\u201362).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nFor many years, it had been one of his favorite schemes to secure, by means of simultaneous observations at distant points, a thorough investigation of the nature and law of \"[[magnetic storm]]s\" (a term invented by him to designate abnormal disturbances of [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's magnetism]]). The meeting at Berlin, on 18 September 1828, of a newly formed scientific association, of which he was elected president, gave him the opportunity of setting on foot an extensive system of research in combination with his diligent personal observations. His appeal to the Russian government, in 1829, led to the establishment of a line of magnetic and meteorological stations across northern Asia. Meanwhile, his letter to the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]], then (April 1836) president of the [[Royal Society]], secured for the undertaking, the wide basis of the [[British Empire|British dominions]].\n\nThe [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition]], observes, \"Thus that scientific conspiracy of nations which is one of the noblest fruits of modern civilization was by his exertions first successfully organized\".{{sfn|Clerke|1911|p=874}} However, earlier examples of international scientific cooperation exist, notably the 18th-century observations of the [[Transit of Venus|transits of Venus]].\n\nIn 1869, the 100th year of his birth, Humboldt's fame was so great that cities all over America celebrated his birth with large festivals. In New York City, a bust of his head was unveiled in [[Central Park]].<ref name=\"Nichols, Sandra 2006\">Nichols, Sandra. \"Why Was Humboldt Forgotten in the United States?\" Geographical Review 96, no. 3 (July 2006): 399\u2013415. Accessed July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\nScholars have speculated about the reasons for Humboldt's declining renown among the public. Sandra Nichols has argued that there are three reasons for this. First, a trend towards specialization in scholarship. Humboldt was a generalist who connected many disciplines in his work. Today, academics have become more and more focused on narrow fields of work. Humboldt combined [[ecology]], geography and even social sciences. Second, a change in writing style. Humboldt's works, which were considered essential to a library in 1869, had flowery prose that fell out of fashion. One critic said they had a \"laborious picturesqueness\". Humboldt himself said that, \"If I only knew how to describe adequately how and what I felt, I might, after this long journey of mine, really be able to give happiness to people. The disjointed life I lead makes me hardly certain of my way of writing\". Third, a rising anti-German sentiment in the late 1800s and the early 1900s due to heavy German immigration to the United States and later World War 1.<ref name=\"Nichols, Sandra 2006\"/> On the eve of the 1959 hundredth anniversary of the death of Humboldt, the government of West Germany planned significant celebrations in conjunction with nations that Humboldt visited.<ref>Adolf Meyer Abich, \"The Hundredth Anniversary of the Death of Alexander von Humboldt\", [[The Hispanic American Historical Review]], vol. 38, No. 3, (August 1958), pp. 394\u201396.</ref>\n\n==Expedition in Russia, 1829==\n\n[[File:Humboldt RUS.jpg|thumb|400px|Map of Humboldt's expedition to Russia in 1829]]\nIn 1811, and again in 1818, projects of Asiatic exploration were proposed to Humboldt, first by Czar [[Nicolas I]]'s Russian government, and afterwards by the Prussian government; but on each occasion, untoward circumstances interposed. It was not until he had begun his sixtieth year that he resumed his early role of traveler in the interests of science.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Minister, Count [[Georg von Cancrin]] contacted Humboldt about whether a platinum-based currency was possible in Russia and invited him to visit the Ural Mountains. Humboldt was not encouraging about a [[platinum]]-based currency, when silver was the standard as a world currency. But the invitation to visit the Urals was intriguing, especially since Humboldt had long dreamed of going to Asia. He had wanted to travel to India and made considerable efforts to persuade the [[British East India Company]] to authorize a trip, but those efforts were fruitless.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=171\u201374, 199\u2013200}} When Russia renewed its earlier invitation to Humboldt, Humboldt accepted.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=199\u2013200}} The Russians sought to entice Humboldt by engaging his enduring interest in mining sites, for comparative scientific purposes for Humboldt, but for the Russians to gain expert knowledge about their resources. For Humboldt, the Russian monarch's promise to fund the trip was extremely important, since Humboldt's inherited 100,000 thaler fortune was gone and he lived on the Prussian government pension of 2,500\u20133,000 thalers as the monarch's chamberlain. The Russian government gave an advance of 1200 {{transl|rus|chervontsev}} in Berlin and another 20,000 when he arrived in St. Petersburg.<ref>M.A. Engel'gardt, ''A Gumbol'dt: Ego zhizn', puteshestviia i nauchnaia d\"iatel'nost''. Saint Petersburg: Tip. Tovarishchestva \"obshchestvennaia Pol'za 1900, p. 60.</ref>\n\nHumboldt was eager to travel not just to the Urals, but also across the steppes of Siberia to Russia's border with China. Humboldt wrote Cancrin saying that he intended to learn Russian to read mining journals in the language.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=283\u201385}} As the details of the expedition were worked out, Humboldt said that he would travel to Russia in his own French coach, with a German servant, as well as [[Gustav Rose]], a professor of chemistry and mineralogy. He also invited [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] to join the expedition, to study water micro-organisms in [[Lake Baikal]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. Humboldt himself was keen to continue his studies of magnetism of mountains and mineral deposits. As was usual for his research, he brought scientific instruments to take the most accurate measurements.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=287}} The Russians organized the local arrangements, including lodging, horses, accompanying crew. Humboldt's title for the expedition was as an official of the Department of Mines. As the expedition neared dangerous areas, he had to travel in a convoy with an escort.<ref>Engel'gardt, ''A. Gumbol'dt'', p. 60.</ref>\n\nPhysically Humboldt was in good condition, despite his advancing years, writing to Cancrin \"I still walk very lightly on foot, nine to ten hours without resting, despite my age and my white hair\".<ref>Humboldt to Cancrin, quoted in {{harvnb|de Terra|1955|p=286}}.</ref>\n\nBetween May and November 1829 he and the growing expedition traversed the wide expanse of the Russian empire from the [[Neva]] to the [[Yenisei]], accomplishing in twenty-five weeks a distance of {{convert|9614|mi|km}}. Humboldt and the expedition party traveled by coach on well maintained roads, with rapid progress being made because of changes of horses at way stations. The party had grown, with Johann Seifert, who was a huntsman and collector of animal specimens; a Russian mining official; Count Adolphe Polier, one of Humboldt's friends from Paris; a cook; plus a contingent of [[Cossacks]] for security. Three carriages were filled with people, supplies, and scientific instruments. For Humboldt's magnetic readings to be accurate, they carried an iron-free tent.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=201\u2013202}} This expedition was unlike his Spanish American travels with Bonpland, with the two alone and sometimes accompanied by local guides.\n\nThe Russian government was interested in Humboldt finding prospects for mining and commercial advancement of the realm and made it clear that Humboldt was not to investigate social issues, nor criticize social conditions of Russian [[serfs]]. In his publications on Spanish America, he did comment on the conditions of the indigenous populations, and deplored black slavery, but well after he had left those territories.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=205}} As Humboldt discovered, the government kept tight control of the expedition, even when it was {{convert|1000|mi}} from Moscow, with local government officials greeting the expedition at every stop. The itinerary was planned with [[Tobolsk]] the farthest destination, then a return to [[St Petersburg]].\n\nHumboldt wrote to the Russian Minister Cancrin that he was extending his travel, knowing that the missive would not reach him in time to scuttle the plan. The further east he journeyed into wilder territory, the more Humboldt enjoyed it. They still followed the Siberian Highway and made excellent progress, sometimes a hundred miles (160&nbsp;km) in a day.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=206\u2013207}} Although they were halted at the end of July and warned of an [[anthrax]] outbreak, Humboldt decided to continue despite the danger. \"At my age, nothing should be postponed\".<ref>quoted in {{harvnb|Wulf|2015|p=207}}.</ref>\n\nThe journey though carried out with all the advantages afforded by the immediate patronage of the Russian government, was too rapid to be profitable scientifically. The correction of the prevalent exaggerated estimate of the height of the Central Asian plateau, and the prediction of the discovery of diamonds in the gold-washings of the Urals, were important aspects of these travels. In the end, the expedition took 8 months, traveled 15,500&nbsp;km, stopped at 658 post stations, and used 12,244 horses.<ref>Engel'gardt, ''A. Gumbol'dt'', p. 62.</ref>\n\nOne writer claims that \"Nothing was quite as Humboldt wanted it. The entire expedition was a compromise.\"{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=203}} The Russian emperor offered Humboldt an invitation to return to Russia, but Humboldt declined, due to his disapproval of Nicholas's restrictions on his freedom of movement during the expedition and his ability to freely report on it.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=306}} Humboldt published two works on the Russian expedition, first {{lang|fr|Fragments de g\u00e9ologie et de climatologie asiatiques}} in 1831, based on lectures he gave on the topic. In 1843, he completed the three-volume ''Asie Centrale'',<ref>Alexander von Humboldt, ''Asie centrale, recherches sur les cha\u00eenes des montagnes et la climotologie compar\u00e9e''. 3 vols. 1843.</ref> which he dedicated to Czar Nicholas, which he called \"an unavoidable step, as the expedition was accomplished at his expense\".<ref>quoted in {{harvnb|de Terra|1955|p=307}}.</ref> As of 2016, these works have not been translated to English.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=433}} His 1829 expedition to Russia when he was an old man is much less known than his five-year travels in Spanish America, which had resulted in many published volumes over the decades since his 1804 return. Nevertheless, it gave Humboldt comparative data for his various later scientific publications.\n\n==Publications==\n===''Cosmos''===\n{{see also|Kosmos (Humboldt)}}\n[[File:Alexander von Humboldt photo 1857.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Photograph of Humboldt in his later years]]\n\n[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|''Kosmos'']] was Humboldt's multi-volume effort in his later years to write a work bringing together all the research from his long career. The writing took shape in [[public lecture|lecture]]s he delivered before the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] in the winter of 1827\u201328. These lectures would form \"the [[cartoon]] for the great fresco of the ''[K]osmos''\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Dickinson|Howarth|1933|p=145}}</ref> His 1829 expedition to Russia supplied him with data comparative to his Latin American expedition.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=235}}\n\nThe first two volumes of the ''Kosmos'' were published between the years 1845 and 1847 were intended to comprise the entire work, but Humboldt published three more volumes, one of which was posthumous. Humboldt had long aimed to write a comprehensive work about geography and the natural sciences. The work attempted to unify the sciences then known in a Kantian framework. With inspiration from [[German Romanticism]], Humboldt sought to create a compendium of the world's environment.<ref name=\"Walls 2009 3\u201315\"/> He spent the last decade of his long life\u2014as he called them, his \"improbable\" years\u2014continuing this work. The third and fourth volumes were published in 1850\u201358; a fragment of a fifth appeared posthumously in 1862.\n\nHis reputation had long since been made with his publications on the Latin American expedition. There is not a consensus on the importance of ''Kosmos''. One scholar, who stresses the importance of Humboldt's ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'' as essential reading, dismisses ''Kosmos'' as \"little more than an academic curiosity\".{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=534}} A different opinion is that ''Kosmos'' was his \"most influential book\".{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=235}}\n\nAs with most of Humboldt's works, ''Kosmos'' was also translated into multiple languages in editions of uneven quality. It was very popular in Britain and America. In 1849 a German newspaper commented that in England two of the three different translations were made by women, \"while in Germany most of the men do not understand it\".<ref>Beilage zu No. 102 der (Augsburger) Allgemeinen Zeitung, 12 April 1849.</ref> The first translation by Augustin Pritchard\u2014published anonymously by Mr. Bailli\u00e8re (volume I in 1845 and volume II in 1848)\u2014suffered from being hurriedly made. In a letter Humboldt said of it: \"It will damage my reputation. All the charm of my description is destroyed by an English sounding like Sanskrit.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe other two translations were made by [[Elizabeth Juliana Leeves Sabine]] under the superintendence of her husband Col. [[Edward Sabine]] (4 volumes 1846\u20131858), and by [[Elise Ott\u00e9]] (5 volumes 1849\u20131858, the only complete translation of the 4 German volumes). These three translations were also published in the United States. The numbering of the volumes differs between the German and the English editions. Volume 3 of the German edition corresponds to the volumes 3 and 4 of the English translation, as the German volume appeared in 2 parts in 1850 and 1851. Volume 5 of the German edition was not translated until 1981, again by a woman.<ref name=Bowen1981>{{Cite book|first=Margarita |last=Bowen|title=Empiricism and Geographical Thought: From Francis Bacon to Alexander von Humboldt|series=Cambridge Geographical Studies (No. 15)|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=978-0-521-10559-0}}</ref> Ott\u00e9's translation benefited from a detailed table of contents, and an index for every volume; of the German edition only volumes 4 and 5 had (extremely short) tables of contents, and the index to the whole work only appeared with volume 5 in 1862.

He and Bonpland parted ways after their return to Europe, and Humboldt largely took on the task of publishing the results of their Latin American expedition at Humboldt's expense, but he included Bonpland as co-author on the nearly published 30 volumes. Bonpland returned to Latin America, settling in Buenos Aires, Argentina, then moved to the countryside near the border with Paraguay. The forces of Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], the strong man of Paraguay, abducted Bonpland after killing Bonpland's estate workers. Bonpland was accused of \"agricultural espionage\" and of threatening Paraguay's virtual monopoly on the cultivation of [[yerba mate]]. Despite international pressure, including the British government and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's, along with European scientists including Humboldt, Francia kept Bonpland prisoner until 1831. He was released after nearly 10 years in Paraguay. Humboldt and Bonpland maintained a warm correspondence about science and politics until Bonpland's death in 1858.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=272}}\n\nDuring Humboldt's time in Paris, he met in 1818 the young and brilliant Peruvian student of the Royal Mining School of Paris, [[Mariano Eduardo de Rivero y Ustariz]]. Subsequently, Humboldt acted as a mentor of the career of this promising Peruvian scientist. Another recipient of Humboldt's aid was [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807\u20131873), who was directly aided with needed cash from Humboldt, assistance in securing an academic position, and help with getting his research on zoology published. Agassiz sent him copies of his publications and went on to gain considerable scientific recognition as a professor at Harvard.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=326\u201327}} Agassiz delivered an address to the Boston Society of Natural History in 1869, on the centenary of his patron's birth.<ref>Louis Agassiz, ''Address delivered on the Centennial Anniversary of the Birth of Alexander von Humboldt, under the auspices of the Boston Society of Natural History''.

The Prussian royal family returned to Berlin, but sought better terms of the treaty and [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]] commissioned his younger brother [[Prince Wilhelm of Prussia (1783\u20131851)|Prince Wilhelm]] with this. Friedrich Wilhelm III asked Alexander to be part of the mission, charged with introducing the prince to Paris society. This turn of events for Humboldt could not have been better, since he desired to live in Paris rather than Berlin.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=210}}\n\nIn 1814 Humboldt accompanied the allied sovereigns to London. Three years later he was summoned by the king of Prussia to attend him at the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|congress of Aachen]]. Again in the autumn of 1822 he accompanied the same monarch to the [[Congress of Verona]], proceeded thence with the royal party to Rome and Naples and returned to Paris in the spring of 1823. Humboldt had long regarded Paris as his true home. Thus, when at last he received from his sovereign a summons to join his court at Berlin, he obeyed reluctantly.\n\nBetween 1830 and 1848 Humboldt was frequently employed in diplomatic missions to the court of [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis Philippe]] of France, with whom he always maintained the most cordial personal relations. [[Charles X of France]] had been overthrown, with Louis-Philippe of the [[house of Orl\u00e9ans]] becoming king. Humboldt knew the family, and he was sent by the Prussian monarch to Paris to report on events to his monarch. He spent three years in France, from 1830 to 1833. His friends [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]], were appointed to posts in Louis-Philippe's government.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=311}}\n\nHumboldt's brother, [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Wilhelm]], died on 8 April 1835. Alexander lamented that he had lost half of himself with the death of his brother. Upon the accession of the crown prince [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] in June 1840, Humboldt's favor at court increased. Indeed, the new king's craving for Humboldt's company became at times so importunate as to leave him only a few waking hours to work on his writing.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Baron Alexander von Humboldt by Julius Schrader 1859.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Humboldt by [[Julius Schrader]], 1859.

Ingersoll]], who went so far as to use Humboldtian science to campaign against religion,<ref>{{harvnb|Sachs|2006|loc=Ch. 3}}</ref> Humboldt himself denied imputations of atheism. In a letter to [[Karl August Varnhagen von Ense|Varnhagen von Ense]] he emphasized that he believed the world had indeed been created, writing of ''Cosmos'': \"...'creation' and the 'created world' are never lost sight of in the book. And did I not, only eight months ago, in the French translation, say, in the plainest terms: 'It is this necessity of things, this occult but permanent connection, this periodical return in the progress, development of formation, phenomena, and events which constitute 'Nature' submissive to a controlling power?'\"<ref>Humboldt, Alexander von. 1860. ''Letters of Alexander von Humboldt to Varnhagen von Ense''. Rudd & Carleton. p. 194</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that \"although Humboldt emphasizes the basis of morality in the nature of man, he does acknowledge that a belief in God is linked directly to acts of virtue\" and therefore \"the dignity of man lies at the centre of Humboldt's religious thought\".<ref>Garbooshian, Adrina Michelle. 2006. ''The Concept of Human Dignity in the French and American Enlightenments: Religion, Virtue, Liberty''.

Chapter IV: \"The Foundations and Expressions of Humboldt's ideal\"; pp. 56\u201360</ref> A letter he wrote to his friend Charlotte Hildebrand Diede states: \"God constantly appoints the course of nature and of circumstances; so that, including his existence in an eternal future, the happiness of the individual does not perish, but on the contrary grows and increases.\"<ref>Wilhelm Humboldt (Freiherr von), Charlotte Hildebrand Diede, Catharine M.

''[[s:Page:Popular Science Monthly Volume 9.djvu/727|Popular Science Monthly Volume 9]]''. \"Science and Religion as Allies\"</ref>\n\nHumboldt showed [[religious tolerance]] towards Judaism, and he criticized the political ''Jews Bill'', which was an initiative intended to establish legal discrimination against Jews.

While a gregarious personality, he may have harbored a sense of social alienation, which drove his passion for escape through travel.{{sfn|Sachs|2007|p=64}}\n\nHumboldt never married: while he was charmed by a number of attractive women, including [[Henriette Herz|Henriette]], the wife of his mentor Marcus Herz, his sister-in-law Caroline von Humboldt stated \"nothing will ever have a great influence on Alexander that doesn't come through men\".{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=71}} He had many strong male friendships, and at times had romances with men.{{sfn|Sachs|2007|p=65}}\n\nAs a student he became infatuated with Wilhelm Gabriel Wegener, a theology student, penning a succession of letters expressing his \"fervent love\".{{sfn|Helferich|2004|p=8}} At 25 he met Reinhardt von Haeften (19 May 1772 \u2013 20 October 1803), a 21-year-old lieutenant, with whom he lived and travelled for two years, and to whom he wrote in 1794: \"I only live through you, my good precious Reinhardt\". When von Haeften became engaged, Humboldt begged to remain living with him and his wife: \"Even if you must refuse me, treat me coldly with disdain, I should still want to be with you... the love I have for you is not just friendship or brotherly love, it is veneration\".{{sfn|Rupke|2008|pp=187\u2013200}}\n\nA traveling companion in the Americas for five years was [[Aim\u00e9 Bonpland]], and in [[Quito]] in 1802 he met the Ecuadorian aristocrat Don Carlos Mont\u00fafar, who traveled with Humboldt to Europe and lived with him. In France, Humboldt traveled and lived with the physicist and balloonist [[Joseph Louis Gay Lussac]]. Later he had a deep friendship with the married French astronomer [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]], whom he met daily for 15 years.<ref>Pratt, Mary Louise ''Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation'', Routledge, New York, 1992, {{ISBN|0415438160}}, p. 256</ref>\n\nHumboldt once wrote \"I don't know sensual needs\".{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=71}} However, a pious travelling companion, [[Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas]], accused him of frequenting houses in Quito where \"impure love reigned\", of making friends with \"obscene dissolute youths\", of giving vent to \"shameful passions of his heart\", and dropping him to travel with \"Bonpland and his Adonis\"[Mon\u00fafar].<ref>Aldrich, Robert F.

It is the Dutch equivalent of the widely known annual [[Alfred Hettner|Hettner]] lectures at the [[University of Heidelberg]].\n\n===The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation===\nAfter his death, Humboldt's friends and colleagues created the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] (''Stiftung'' in German) to continue his generous support of young academics. Although the original endowment was lost in the [[German hyperinflation of the 1920s]], and again as a result of World War II, the Foundation has been re-endowed by the German government to award young academics and distinguished senior academics from abroad. It plays an important role in attracting foreign researchers to work in Germany and enabling German researchers to work abroad for a period.\n\n===Dedications===\n[[Edgar Allan Poe]] dedicated his last major work, ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem]]'', to Humboldt, \"With Very Profound Respect\". Humboldt's attempt to unify the sciences in his ''Kosmos'' was a major inspiration for Poe's project.\n\n===Ships===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}\n''[[Alexander von Humboldt (ship)|Alexander von Humboldt]]'' is also a German ship named after the scientist, originally built in 1906 by the German shipyard AG Weser at [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] as '''''Reserve Sonderburg'''''. She was operated throughout the North and Baltic Seas until being retired in 1986. Subsequently, she was converted into a three-masted [[barque]] by the German shipyard Motorwerke Bremerhaven, and was re-launched in 1988 as ''Alexander von Humboldt''.\n\nThe [[Jan De Nul Group]] operates a hopper dredger built in 1998 also named ''Alexander von Humboldt''.<ref>https://www.jandenul.com/sites/default/files/equipment-item/pdfs/01.tshd_en_-_v2013-2_-_alexander_von_humboldt.pdf</ref>\n\n===Recognitions by contemporaries===\n\n[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] wrote that \"The real discoverer of South America was Humboldt, since his work was more useful for our people than the work of all conquerors\".<ref>Raymond Erickson, Mauricio A.

His depth, his sharp mind and his incredible speed are a rare combination.\" [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] observed that \"Humboldt showers us with true treasures\". [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote that \"Alexander impresses many, particularly when compared to his brother\u2014because he shows off more!\" [[Jos\u00e9 de la Luz y Caballero]] wrote that \"Columbus gave Europe a New World; Humboldt made it known in its physical, material, intellectual, and moral aspects\". [[Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] remarked \"You have been studying Botanics? Just like my wife!\" [[Claude Louis Berthollet]] said \"This man is as knowledgeable as a whole academy\". [[Thomas Jefferson]] remarked \"I consider him the most important scientist whom I have met\". [[Emil Du Bois-Reymond]] wrote that \"Every scientist is a descendant of Humboldt. We are all his family.\" [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] wrote that \"He was to science what Shakespeare was to the drama\".<ref>''The Writings of Robert G Ingersoll'' (Dresden Edition), C. P. Farrell (1900)</ref>\n\n[[Hermann von Helmholtz]] wrote that \"During the first half of the present century we had an Alexander von Humboldt, who was able to scan the scientific knowledge of his time in its details, and to bring it within one vast generalization. At the present juncture, it is obviously very doubtful whether this task could be accomplished in a similar way, even by a mind with gifts so peculiarly suited for the purpose as Humboldt's was, and if all his time and work were devoted to the purpose.\"<ref>H.

She had high ambitions for Alexander and his older brother Wilhelm, hiring excellent tutors, who were [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, including Kantian physician [[Marcus Herz]] and botanist [[Karl Ludwig Willdenow]], who became one of the most important botanists in Germany.{{sfn|Nicolson|1995|p=xvi}} Humboldt's mother expected them to become civil servants of the Prussian state.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=13, 17}} The money Baron Holwede left to Alexander's mother became, after her death, instrumental in funding Alexander's explorations, contributing more than 70% of his private income.{{clarify|date=January 2016}}\n\n[[File:Schloss Tegel1.JPG|thumb|right|The Tegel Palace, Berlin, where Alexander and his brother [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Wilhelm]] lived for several years]]\n\nDue to his youthful penchant for collecting and labeling plants, shells, and insects, Alexander received the playful title of \"the little apothecary\".<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Marked for a political career, Alexander studied [[finance]] for six months in 1787 at the [[Viadrina European University|University of Frankfurt (Oder)]], which his mother might have chosen less for its academic excellence than its closeness to their home in Berlin.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=17}} On 25 April 1789, he matriculated at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], then known for the lectures of [[Christian Gottlob Heine|C.

Banks also mobilized his scientific contacts in later years to aid Humboldt's work.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=76, 136}}\n\nHumboldt's scientific excursion up the [[Rhine]] resulted in his 1790 treatise ''Mineralogische Beobachtungen \u00fcber einige Basalte am Rhein'' (Brunswick, 1790)<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> (''Mineralogic Observations on Several Basalts on the River Rhine'').\n\nHumboldt's passion for travel was of long standing. Humboldt's talents were devoted to the purpose of preparing himself as a scientific explorer. With this emphasis, he studied commerce and foreign languages at [[Hamburg]], geology at [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|Freiberg School of Mines]] in 1791 under [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|A.G. Werner]], leader of the [[Neptunist]] school of geology;<ref>Jason Wilson, \"Alexander von Humboldt: A Chronology from 1769 to 1859\" in ''Personal Narrative of A Journey to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent'' by Alexander von Humboldt.

K\u00f6hler]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> At Freiberg, he met a number of men who were to prove important to him in his later career, including Spaniard Manuel del Rio, who became director of the School of Mines the crown established in Mexico; [[Christian Leopold von Buch]], who became a regional geologist; and, most importantly, Karl Freiesleben, who became Humboldt's tutor and close friend. During this period, his brother Wilhelm married, but Alexander did not attend the nuptials.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=51}}\n\n==Travels and work in Europe==\nHumboldt graduated from the [[Freiberg University of Mining and Technology|Freiberg School of Mines]] in 1792 and was appointed to a Prussian government position in the Department of Mines as an inspector in Bayreuth and the Fichtel mountains. Humboldt was excellent at his job, with production of gold ore in his first year outstripping the previous eight years.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=53}} During his period as a mine inspector, Humboldt demonstrated his deep concern for the men laboring in the mines. He opened a free school for miners, paid for out of his own pocket, which became an unchartered government training school for labor. He also sought to establish an emergency relief fund for miners, aiding them following accidents.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=54-55}}\n\nHumboldt's researches into the vegetation of the mines of [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] led to the publication in Latin (1793) of his ''Florae Fribergensis, accedunt Aphorismi ex Doctrina, Physiologiae Chemicae Plantarum'', which was a compendium of his botanical researches.<ref>Wilson, \"Alexander von Humboldt: A Chronology\", p. lxvii.</ref> That publication brought him to the attention of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who had met Humboldt at the family home when Alexander was a boy, but Goethe was now interested in meeting the young scientist to discuss metamorphism of plants.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=18, 57}} An introduction was arranged by Humboldt's brother, who lived in the university town of Jena, not far from Goethe. Goethe had developed his own extensive theories on comparative anatomy. Working before Darwin, he believed that animals had an internal force, an ''urform'', that gave them a basic shape and then they were further adapted to their environment by an external force. Humboldt urged him to publish his theories. Together, the two discussed and expanded these ideas. Goethe and Humboldt soon became close friends.\n\nHumboldt often returned to Jena in the years that followed. Goethe remarked about Humboldt to friends that he had never met anyone so versatile. Humboldt's drive served as an inspiration for Goethe. In 1797, Humboldt returned to Jena for three months. During this time, Goethe moved from his residence in Weimar to reside in Jena. Together, Humboldt and Goethe attended university lectures on anatomy and conducted their own experiments. One experiment involved hooking up a frog leg to various metals. They found no effect until the moisture of Humboldt's breath triggered a reaction that caused the frog leg to leap off the table. Humboldt described this as one of his favorite experiments because it was as if he were \"breathing life into\" the leg.{{sfn|Wulf|2015}}\n\nDuring this visit, a thunderstorm killed a farmer and his wife. Humboldt obtained their corpses and analyzed them in the anatomy tower of the university.{{sfn|Wulf|2015}}\n\n[[File:Weimarer Klassik.jpg|thumb|Schiller, Wilhelm, and Alexander von Humboldt with Goethe in [[Jena]]]]\nIn 1794, Humboldt was admitted to the famous group of intellectuals and cultural leaders of [[Weimar Classicism]]. Goethe and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] were the key figures at the time. Humboldt contributed (7 June 1795) to Schiller's new periodical, ''Die Horen'', a philosophical [[allegory]] entitled {{lang|de|Die Lebenskraft, oder der rhodische Genius}}.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1792 and 1797, Humboldt was in [[Vienna]]; in 1795 he made a geological and botanical tour through Switzerland and Italy. Although this service to the state was regarded by him as only an apprenticeship to the service of science, he fulfilled its duties with such conspicuous ability that not only did he rise rapidly to the highest post in his department, but he was also entrusted with several important diplomatic missions.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nNeither brother attended the funeral of their mother on 19 November 1796.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=39}} Humboldt had not hidden his aversion to his mother, with one correspondent writing of him after her death, \"her death... must be particularly welcomed by you\".<ref>Carl Freiesleben quoted in {{harvnb|Wulf|2015|p=39}}.</ref> After severing his official connections, he awaited an opportunity to fulfill his long-cherished dream of travel.\n\nHumboldt was able to spend more time on writing up his research. He had used his own body for experimentation on muscular irritability, recently discovered by [[Luigi Galvani]] and published his results, {{lang|de|Versuche \u00fcber die gereizte Muskel- und Nervenfaser}}(Berlin, 1797) (''Experiments on Stimulated Muscle and Nerve Fibres''), enriched in the French translation with notes by Blumenbach.\n\n==Spanish American expedition, 1799\u20131804==\n[[File:Map Alexander von Humboldt expedition-en.svg|thumb|left|400px|Alexander von Humboldt's Latin American expedition]]\n\n===Seeking a foreign expedition===\nWith the financial resources to finance his scientific travels, he sought a ship on a major expedition. Meantime, he went to Paris, where his brother Wilhelm was now living. Paris was a great center of scientific learning and his brother and sister-in-law Caroline were well connected in those circles. [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] urged Humboldt to accompany him on a major expedition, likely to last five years, but the French revolutionary [[Directoire]] placed [[Nicolas Baudin]] at the head of it rather than the aging scientific traveler.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=80}} On the postponement of Captain Baudin's proposed voyage of [[circumnavigation]] due to continuing warfare in Europe, which Humboldt had been officially invited to accompany, Humboldt was deeply disappointed. He had already selected scientific instruments for his voyage. He did, however, have a stroke of luck with meeting [[Aim\u00e9 Bonpland]], the botanist and physician for the voyage. Discouraged, the two left Paris for [[Marseilles]], where they hoped to join [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in Egypt, but North Africans were in revolt against the French invasion in Egypt and French authorities refused permission to travel. Humboldt and Bonpland eventually found their way to [[Madrid]], where their luck changed spectacularly.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=83}}\n\n===Spanish royal authorization, 1799===\n[[File:Carlos IV de rojo.jpg|thumb|[[Charles IV of Spain]] who authorized Humboldt's travels and research in Spanish America]]\nIn Madrid, Humboldt sought authorization to travel to Spain's realms in the Americas; he was aided in obtaining it by the German representative of Saxony at the royal Bourbon court. Baron Forell had an interest in mineralogy and science endeavors and was inclined to help Humboldt.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=83}} At that time, the [[Bourbon Reforms]] sought to reform administration of the realms and revitalize their economies.<ref>[[Ida Altman]], Sarah Cline, Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''.

For Humboldt \"the confluent effect of the Bourbon revolution in government and the Spanish Enlightenment had created ideal conditions for his venture\".{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=517}}\n\nThe Bourbon monarchy had already authorized and funded expeditions, with the [[Botanical Expedition to the Viceroyalty of Peru]] to Chile and Peru (1777\u201388), New Granada (1783\u20131816), New Spain (Mexico) (1787\u20131803), and the [[Malaspina Expedition]] (1789\u201394). These were lengthy, state-sponsored enterprises to gather information about plants and animals from the Spanish realms, assess economic possibilities, and provide plants and seeds for the Royal Botanical Garden in Madrid (founded 1755).{{sfn|Bleichmar|2012|p=5}} These expeditions took naturalists and artists, who created visual images as well as careful written observations as well as collecting seeds and plants themselves.{{sfn|Bleichmar|2012|p=19}} Crown officials as early as 1779 issued and systematically distributed ''Instructions concerning the most secure and economic means to transport live plants by land and sea from the most distant countries'', with illustrations, including one for the crates to transport seeds and plants.<ref>Casimiro G\u00f3mez Ortega, ''Instrucci\u00f3n sobre el modo m\u00e1s seguro y econ\u00f3mico de transportar plantas vivas por mar y tierra a los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s distantes ilustrada con l\u00e1minas.

Spain under the Habsburg monarchy had guarded its realms against foreigner travelers and intruders. The Bourbon monarch was open to Humboldt's proposal. Spanish Foreign Minister Don [[Mariano Luis de Urquijo]] received the formal proposal and Humboldt was presented to the monarch in March 1799.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=83}} Humboldt was granted access to crown officials and written documentation on Spain's empire. With Humboldt's experience working for the absolutist Prussian monarchy as a government mining official, Humboldt had both the academic training and experience of working well within a bureaucratic structure.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=517}}\n[[File:Alexandre humboldt.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Alexander von Humboldt by [[Friedrich Georg Weitsch]], 1806]]\n\nBefore leaving Madrid in 1799, Humboldt and Bonpland visited the Natural History Museum, which held results of [[Mart\u00edn de Sess\u00e9 y Lacasta]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Moci\u00f1o]]'s botanical expedition to [[New Spain]].<ref>Stephen T.

The ship stopped six days on the island of [[Tenerife]], where Humboldt climbed the volcano [[Teide]], and then sailed on to the New World, landing at [[Cuman\u00e1]], [[Venezuela]], on 16 July.\n\nThe ship's destination was not originally Cuman\u00e1, but an outbreak of typhoid on board meant that the captain changed course from [[Havana]] to land in northern South America. Humboldt had not mapped out a specific plan of exploration, so that the change did not upend a fixed itinerary. He later wrote that the diversion to Venezuela made possible his explorations along the Orinoco River to the border of Portuguese Brazil. With the diversion, the ''Pizarro'' encountered two large dugout canoes each carrying 18 Guayaqui Indians. The ''Pizarro''{{'}}s captain accepted the offer of one of them to serve as pilot. Humboldt hired this Indian, named Carlos del Pino, as a guide.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nVenezuela from the 16th to the 18th centuries was a relative backwater compared to the seats of the Spanish viceroyalties based in New Spain (Mexico) and Peru, but during the Bourbon reforms, the northern portion of Spanish South America was reorganized administratively, with the 1777 establishment of a captaincy-general based at Caracas. A great deal of information on the new jurisdiction had already been compiled by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Pons]], but was not published until 1806.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=517}}<ref>F.J. de Pons.

Humboldt met the Venezuelan Bol\u00edvar himself in 1804 in Paris and spent time with him in Rome. The documentary record does not support the supposition that Humboldt inspired Bol\u00edvar to participate in the struggle for independence, but it does indicate Bol\u00edvar's admiration for Humboldt's production of new knowledge on Spanish America.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=232\u201333}}\n\nIn February 1800, Humboldt and Bonpland left the coast with the purpose of exploring the course of the [[Orinoco River]] and its tributaries. This trip, which lasted four months and covered {{convert|1725|mi|km}} of wild and largely uninhabited country, had an aim of establishing the existence of the [[Casiquiare canal]] (a communication between the water systems of the rivers Orinoco and [[Amazon River|Amazon]]). Although, unbeknownst to Humboldt, this existence had been established decades before<ref>The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World by Andrea Wulf</ref>, his expedition had the important results of determining the exact position of the [[River bifurcation|bifurcation]],<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> and documenting the life of several native tribes such as the [[Maypure|Maipure]]s and their extinct rivals the Atures (several words of the latter tribe were transferred to Humboldt by one parrot<ref>Mark Forsyth. The etymologicon. Icon Books Ltd. London N79DP, (2011), p. 123.</ref>). Around 19 March 1800, Humboldt and Bonpland discovered dangerous [[electric eel]]s, whose shock could kill a man. To catch them, locals suggested they drive wild horses into the river, which brought the eels out from the river mud, and resulted in a violent confrontation of eels and horses, some of which died. Humboldt and Bonpland captured and dissected some eels, which retained their ability to shock; both received potentially dangerous electric shocks during their investigations. The encounter made Humboldt think more deeply about electricity and magnetism, typical of his ability to extrapolate from an observation to more general principles.<ref>{{harvnb|Wulf|2015|pp=62\u201363}}.

During an initial three-month stay at [[Havana]], his first tasks were to properly survey that city and the nearby towns of [[Guanabacoa]], [[Regla]], and [[Bejucal]]. He befriended Cuban landowner and thinker [[Francisco de Arango y Parre\u00f1o]]; together they visited the {{lang|es|Guines}} area in south Havana, the valleys of [[Matanzas]] Province, and the [[Valley of the Sugar Mills]] in [[Trinidad, Cuba|Trinidad]]. Those three areas were, at the time, the first frontier of sugar production in the island. During those trips, Humboldt collected statistical information on Cuba's population, production, technology and trade, and with Arango, made suggestions for enhancing them. He predicted that the agricultural and commercial potential of Cuba was huge and could be vastly improved with proper leadership in the future.\n\nOn their way back to Europe from Mexico on their way to the United States, Humboldt and Bonpland stopped again in Cuba, leaving from the port of Veracruz and arriving in Cuba on 7 January 1804, staying until 29 April 1804. In Cuba, he collected plant material and made extensive notes. During this time, he socialized with his scientific and landowner friends, conducted mineralogical surveys, and finished his vast collection of the island's flora and fauna that he eventually published as ''Essai politique sur l'\u00eesle de Cuba''.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">\"Alexander von Humboldt Chronology\", p. lxix.</ref>\n\n===The Andes, 1801\u20131803===\n[[File:Humboldt-Bonpland Chimborazo.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Humboldt and his fellow scientist Aim\u00e9 Bonpland near the foot of the [[Chimborazo]] volcano, painting by [[Friedrich Georg Weitsch]] (1810)]]\n\nAfter their first stay in Cuba of three months, they returned to the mainland at [[Cartagena de Indias]] (now in Colombia), a major center of trade in northern South America. Ascending the swollen stream of the [[Magdalena River]] to Honda, they arrived in Bogot\u00e1 on 6 July 1801, where they met the Spanish botanist [[Jos\u00e9 Celestino Mutis]], head of the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada, staying there until 8 September 1801. Mutis was generous with his time and gave Humboldt access to the huge pictorial record he had compiled since 1783. Mutis was based in Bogot\u00e1, but as with other Spanish expeditions, he had access to local knowledge and a workshop of artists, who created highly accurate and detailed images. This type of careful recording meant that even if specimens were not available to study at a distance, \"because the images traveled, the botanists did not have to\".{{sfn|Bleichmar|2012|p=190}} Humboldt was astounded at Mutis's accomplishment; when Humboldt published his first volume on botany, he dedicated it to Mutis \"as a simply mark of our admiration and acknowledgement\".<ref>Alexander von Humboldt and Aim\u00e9 Bonpland, ''Plantes \u00e9quinoxiles, in ''Voyage de Humboldt et Bonpland, Sixi\u00e8me Partie, Botanique, vo. 1 Paris 1808.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ilustraciones_Jos\u00e9_Celestino_Mutis.jpg|thumb|Illustrations from Spanish botanist [[Jos\u00e9 Celestino Mutis]]'s work in Colombia]]\n\nHumboldt had hopes of connecting with the French sailing expedition of Baudin, now finally underway, so Bonpland and Humboldt hurried to Ecuador.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> They crossed the frozen ridges of the [[Cordillera Real (Ecuador)|Cordillera Real]], they reached [[Quito]] on 6 January 1802, after a tedious and difficult journey.\n\nTheir stay in Ecuador was marked by the ascent of [[Pichincha (volcano)|Pichincha]] and their climb of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]], where Humboldt and his party reached an altitude of {{convert|19286|ft|m}}.

Even before Humboldt and Bonpland started on their way to New Spain's [[Mexico City|capital]] on Mexico's central plateau, Humboldt realized the captain of the vessel that brought them to Acapulco had reckoned its location incorrectly. Since Acapulco was the main west-coast port and the terminus of the [[Manila Galleon|Asian trade]] from the Spanish Philippines, having accurate maps of its location was extremely important.

Humboldt was also given a special passport to travel throughout New Spain and letters of introduction to intendants, the highest officials in New Spain's administrative districts (intendancies). This official aid to Humboldt allowed him to have access to crown records, mines, landed estates, canals, and Mexican antiquities from the prehispanic era.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=156}} Humboldt read the writings of Bishop-elect of the important diocese of Michoacan [[Manuel Abad y Queipo]], a [[classical liberal]], that were directed to the crown for the improvement of New Spain.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}}\n\nThey spent the year in the viceroyalty, traveling to different Mexican cities in the central plateau and the northern mining region. The first journey was from Acapulco to Mexico City, through what is now the Mexican state of [[Guerrero]]. The route was suitable only for mule train, and all along the way, Humboldt took measurements of elevation. When he left Mexico a year later in 1804, from the east coast port of Veracruz, he took a similar set of measures, which resulted in a chart in the ''Political Essay'', the physical plan of Mexico with the dangers of the road from Acapulco to Mexico City, and from Mexico City to Veracruz.<ref>''Plano f\u00edsico de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a, Perfil del Camino de Acapulco a M\u00e9gico [sic], y de M\u00e9gico a Veracruz''. Chart is published in Magali M. Carrera, ''Traveling from New Spain to Mexico: Mapping Practices of Nineteenth-century Mexico'', Durham: Duke University Press 2011, p.70, plate 18.</ref> This visual depiction of elevation was part of Humboldt's general insistence that the data he collected be presented in a way more easily understood than statistical charts. A great deal of his success in gaining a more general readership for his works was his understanding that \"anything that has to do with extent or quantity can be represented geometrically. Statistical projections [charts and graphs], which speak to the senses without tiring the intellect have the advantage of bringing attention to a large number of important facts\".<ref>Alexander von Humboldt, ''Atl\u00e1s g\u00e9ographique et physique du Royaume de la Nouvelle-Espagne'', lxxxiii-lxxiv, quoted in Anne Godlewska, ''Geography Unbound: French Geographic Science from Cassini to Humboldt''.

He declared \"no city of the new continent, without even excepting those of the United States, can display such great and solid scientific establishments as the capital of Mexico\".<ref>Humboldt, ''Political essay'', p. 74.</ref> He pointed to the [[Palacio de Miner\u00eda#History|Royal College of Mines]], the [[National Palace (Mexico)#Viceroy palace|Royal Botanical Garden]] and the [[Academy of San Carlos|Royal Academy of San Carlos]] as exemplars of a metropolitan capital in touch with the latest developments on the continent and insisting on its modernity.{{sfn|Brading|1991|pp=526\u201327}} He also recognized important [[Creole peoples#Former Spanish colonies|creole]] savants in Mexico, including [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Alzate y Ram\u00edrez]], who died in 1799, just before Humboldt's visit; Miguel Vel\u00e1squez de Le\u00f3n; and [[Antonio de Le\u00f3n y Gama]].{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}}\n\nHumboldt spent time at the Valenciana silver mine in [[Guanajuato]], central New Spain, at the time the most important in the Spanish empire.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=525}} The bicentennial of his visit in Guanajuato was celebrated with a conference at the [[University of Guanajuato]], with Mexican academics highlighting various aspects of his impact on the city.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Luis Lara Vald\u00e9s, ''Bicentenario de Humboldt en Guanajuato (1803\u20132003)''. Guanajuato: Ediciones La Rana 2003.</ref> Humboldt could have simply examined the geology of the fabulously rich mine, but he took the opportunity to study the entire mining complex as well as analyze mining statistics of its output. His report on silver mining is a major contribution, and considered the strongest and best informed section of his ''Political Essay''. Although Humboldt was himself a trained geologist and mining inspector, he drew on mining experts in Mexico. One was [[Fausto Elhuyar]], then head of the General Mining Court in Mexico City, who, like Humboldt was trained in Freiberg. Another was [[Andr\u00e9s Manuel del R\u00edo]], director of Royal College of Mines, whom Humboldt knew when they were both students in Freiberg.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=51, 156}} The Bourbon monarchs had established the mining court and the college to elevate mining as a profession, since revenues from silver constituted the crown's largest source of income. Humboldt also consulted other German mining experts, who were already in Mexico.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}} While Humboldt was a welcome foreign scientist and mining expert, the Spanish crown had established fertile ground for Humboldt's investigations into mining.\n\nSpanish America's ancient civilizations were a source of interest for Humboldt, who included images of Mexican manuscripts (or codices) and Inca ruins in his richly illustrated ''Vues des cordill\u00e8res et monuments des peuples indig\u00e8nes de l'Amerique'' (1810\u20131813), the most experimental of Humboldt's publications, since it does not have \"a single ordering principle\" but his opinions and contentions based on observation.<ref>Vera M. Kutzinski and Ottmar Ette, \"Introduction\" to ''Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas, A Critical Edition''.

His aim was to muster evidence that these pictorial and sculptural images could allow the reconstruction of prehispanic history. He sought out Mexican experts in the interpretation of sources from there, especially Antonio Pichardo, who was the literary executor of [[Antonio de Le\u00f3n y Gama]]'s work. For American-born Spaniards ([[Creole peoples#Former Spanish colonies|creoles]]) who were seeking sources of pride in Mexico's ancient past, Humboldt's recognition of these ancient works and dissemination in his publications was a boon. He read the work of exiled Jesuit [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]], which celebrated Mexico's prehispanic civilization, and which Humboldt invoked to counter the pejorative assertions about the new world by Buffon, de Pauw, and Raynal.<ref>Vera M.

Jefferson and his cabinet sought information from Humboldt when he visited Washington, D.C., about Spain's territory in Mexico, now bordering the U.S.]]\n\nLeaving from Cuba, Humboldt decided to take an unplanned short visit to the United States. Knowing that the current U.S. president, [[Thomas Jefferson]], was himself a scientist, Humboldt wrote to him saying that he would be in the United States. Jefferson warmly replied, inviting him to visit the [[White House]] in the nation's new capital. In his letter Humboldt had gained Jefferson's interest by mentioning that he had discovered [[mammoth]] teeth near the Equator. Jefferson had previously written that he believed mammoths had never lived so far south. Humboldt had also hinted at his knowledge of New Spain.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Schwarz, Ingo (2001-01-01). \"Alexander von Humboldt's Visit to Washington and Philadelphia, His Friendship with Jefferson, and His Fascination with the United States\". Northeastern Naturalist 8: 43\u201356.</ref>\n\nArriving in [[Philadelphia]], which was a center of learning in the U.S., Humboldt met with some of the major scientific figures of the era, including chemist and anatomist [[Caspar Wistar (physician)|Caspar Wistar]], who pushed for compulsory smallpox vaccination, and botanist [[Benjamin Smith Barton]], as well as physician [[Benjamin Rush]], a signer of the Declaration of Independence, who wished to hear about [[cinchona]] bark from a South American tree, which cured fevers.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=175\u201376}} Humboldt later published a treatise in English on cinchona.<ref>Alexander von Humboldt,[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/14437 ''An illustration of the genus Cinchona :comprising descriptions of all the officinal Peruvian barks, including several new species, Baron de Humboldt's Account of the Cinchona forests of South America, and Laubert's Memoir on the different species of quinquina: to which are added several dissertations of Don Hippolito Ruiz on various medicinal plants of South America '']</ref>\n\nAfter arriving in Washington D.C, Humboldt held numerous intense discussions with Jefferson on both scientific matters and also his year-long stay in New Spain. Jefferson had only recently concluded the [[Louisiana Purchase]], which now placed New Spain on the southwest border of the United States. The Spanish minister in Washington, D.C. had declined to furnish the U.S. government with information about Spanish territories, and access to the territories was strictly controlled. Humboldt was able to supply Jefferson with the latest information on the population, trade agriculture and military of New Spain. This information would later be the basis for his ''Essay on the Political Kingdom of New Spain'' (1810). Jefferson was unsure of where the border of the newly-purchased [[Louisiana]] was precisely, and Humboldt wrote him a two-page report on the matter. Jefferson would later refer to Humboldt as \"the most scientific man of the age\". Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury, said of Humboldt \"I was delighted and swallowed more information of various kinds in less than two hours than I had for two years past in all I had read or heard\". Gallatin, in turn, supplied Humboldt with information he sought on the United States.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nAfter six weeks, Humboldt set sail for Europe from the mouth of the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] and landed at [[Bordeaux]] on 3 August 1804.\n\n===Travel diaries===\nHumboldt kept a detailed diary of his sojourn to Spanish America, running some 4,000 pages, which he drew on directly for his multiple publications following the expedition. The leather-bound diaries themselves are now in Germany, having been returned from Russia to East Germany, where they were taken by the Red Army after World War II. Following German reunification, the diaries were returned to a descendant of Humboldt. For a time, there was concern about their being sold, but that was averted.<ref>http://m.dw.com/en/humboldt-america-diaries-to-stay-in-germany/a-17271671, accessed 1 March 2017</ref> A government-funded project to digitize the Spanish American expedition as well as his later Russian expedition has been undertaken (2014\u20132017) by the University of Potsdam and the German State Library\u2014Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.<ref>http://www.uni-potsdam.de/tapoints/?p=1654 accessed 1 March 2017.</ref>\n\n===Achievements of the Latin American expedition===\n{{see also|Humboldtian science}}\nHumboldt's decades' long endeavor to publish the results of this expedition not only resulted in multiple volumes, but also made his international reputation in scientific circles. Humboldt came to be well-known with the reading public as well, with popular, densely illustrated, condensed versions of his work in multiple languages. Bonpland, his fellow scientist and collaborator on the expedition, collected botanical specimens and preserved them, but unlike Humboldt who had a passion to publish, Bonpland had to be prodded to do the formal descriptions. Many scientific travelers and explorers produced huge visual records, which remained unseen by the general public until the late nineteenth century, in the case of the Malaspina Expedition, and even the late twentieth century, when Mutis's botanical, some 12,000 drawings from New Granada, was published. Humboldt, by contrast, published immediately and continuously, using and ultimately exhausting his personal fortune, to produce both scientific and popular texts. Humboldt's name and fame were made by his travels to Spanish America, particularly his publication of the ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain''. His image as the premier European scientist was a later development.<ref>Nicolaas Rupke, \"A Geography of Enlightenment: The Critical Reception of Alexander von Humboldt's Mexico Work\".

The achievements of the Bourbon regime, especially in New Spain, were evident in the precise data Humboldt systematized and published.{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=527}}\n\nThis memorable expedition may be regarded as having laid the foundation of the sciences of [[physical geography]], [[plant geography]], and [[meteorology]]. Key to that was Humboldt's meticulous and systematic measurement of phenomena with the most advanced instruments then available. He closely observed plant and animal species in situ, not just in isolation, noting all elements in relation to one other. He collected specimens of plants and animals, dividing the growing collection so that if a portion was lost, other parts might survive.\n\n[[File:Frederich heinrich baron von humboldt-charles wilson peale.JPG|thumb|upright|Humboldt depicted by American artist [[Charles Willson Peale]], 1805, who met Humboldt when he visited the U.S. in 1804]]\n\nHumboldt saw the need for an approach to science that could account for the harmony of nature among the diversity of the physical world. For Humboldt, \"the unity of nature\" meant that it was the interrelation of all [[physical sciences]]\u2014such as the conjoining between [[biology]], [[meteorology]] and [[geology]]\u2014that determined where specific plants grew. He found these relationships by unraveling myriad, painstakingly collected data,{{sfn|Helferich|2004|p=25}} data extensive enough that it became an enduring foundation upon which others could base their work. Humboldt viewed nature [[holism|holistically]], and tried to explain natural phenomena without the appeal to religious dogma. He believed in the central importance of observation, and as a consequence had amassed a vast array of the most sophisticated scientific instruments then available. Each had its own velvet lined box and was the most accurate and portable of its time; nothing quantifiable escaped measurement. According to Humboldt, everything should be measured with the finest and most modern instruments and sophisticated techniques available, for that collected data was the basis of all scientific understanding.\n\nThis quantitative methodology would become known as [[Humboldtian science]]. Humboldt wrote \"Nature herself is sublimely eloquent. The stars as they sparkle in firmament fill us with delight and ecstasy, and yet they all move in orbit marked out with mathematical precision.\"<ref>Alexander von Humboldt, ''Personal Narrative of Travels of the Equinocial Regions of the New Continent during Years 1799\u20131804'' (London, 1814), Vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;34\u201335</ref>\n\n[[File:Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich - Ideen zu einer Geographie der Pflanzen nebst einem Naturgem\u00e4lde der Tropenl\u00e4nder - 000012142.jpg|thumb|right|Humboldt's ''Naturgem\u00e4lde'', also known as the Chimborazo Map, is his depiction of the volcanoes Chimborazo and Cotopaxi in cross section, with detailed information about plant geography.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2011, 125.</ref> Humboldt first sketched the map when he was in South America, which included written descriptions on either side of the cross-section of Chimborazo. These detailed the information on temperature, altitude, humidity, atmosphere pressure, and the animal and plants (with their scientific names) found at each elevation. Plants from the same genus appear at different elevations. The depiction is on an east-west axis going from the Pacific coast lowlands to the Andean range of which Chimborazo was a part, and the eastern Amazonian basin. Humboldt showed the three zones of coast, mountains, and Amazonia, based on his own observations, but he also drew on existing Spanish sources, particularly [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]], which he explicitly referred to. The Spanish American scientist [[Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas]] had also measured and observed mountain environments and had earlier come to similar ideas about environmental factors in the distribution of life forms.<ref>Zimmerer, \"Mapping Mountains\", p. 129.</ref> Humboldt was thus not putting forward something entirely new, but it is argued that his finding is not derivative either.<ref>Jorge Ca\u00f1izares-Esguerra, ''How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2001.</ref> The Chimborazo map displayed complex information in an accessible fashion.

By climbing Chimborazo, he established an altitude record which became the basis for measurement of other volcanoes in the Andes and the Himalayas. As with other aspects of his investigations, he developed methods to show his synthesized results visually, using the graphic method of geologic-cross sections.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=375\u201376}} He showed that volcanoes fell naturally into linear groups, presumably corresponding with vast subterranean fissures; and by his demonstration of the [[igneous rock|igneous]] origin of rocks previously held to be of aqueous formation, he contributed largely to the elimination of erroneous views, such as [[Neptunism]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nHumboldt was a significant contributor to cartography, creating maps, particularly of New Spain, that became the template for later mapmakers in Mexico. His careful recording of latitude and longitude led to accurate maps of Mexico, the port of Acapulco, the port of Veracruz, and the Valley of Mexico, and a map showing trade patterns among continents. His maps also included schematic information on geography, converting areas of administrative districts (intendancies) using proportional squares.<ref>Magali M.

After a short trip to Italy with [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] for the purpose of investigating the law of [[magnetic declination]] and a stay of two and a half years in Berlin, in the spring of 1808, he settled in Paris. His purpose for being located there was to secure the scientific cooperation required for bringing his great work through the press.

In 1827, the first [[President of Mexico]], [[Guadalupe Victoria]] granted Humboldt Mexican citizenship<ref>Jaime Labastida. ''Humboldt: ciudadano universal''. Editorial Siglo XXI. M\u00e9xico. 1999. Pg.XVIII.</ref> and in 1859, the President of Mexico, [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], named Humboldt a hero of the nation (''benem\u00e9rito de la naci\u00f3n'').<ref>Labastida, ''Humboldt'', p. xviii.</ref> The gestures were purely honorary; he never returned to the Americas following his expedition.\n\nImportantly for Humboldt's long term financial stability, King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] conferred upon him the honor of the post of royal chamberlain, without at the time exacting the duties. The appointment had a pension of 2,500 [[thaler]]s, afterwards doubled. This official stipend became his main source of income in later years when he exhausted his fortune on the publications of his research. Financial necessity forced his permanent relocation to Berlin in 1827 from Paris. In Paris he found not only scientific sympathy, but the social stimulus which his vigorous and healthy mind eagerly craved. He was equally in his element as the lion of the [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]s and as the savant of the [[Institut de France]] and the observatory.\n\nOn 12 May 1827 he settled permanently in Berlin, where his first efforts were directed towards the furtherance of the science of terrestrial magnetism. In 1827, he began giving public lectures in Berlin, which became the basis for his last major publication, [[Kosmos (Humboldt)|''Kosmos'']] (1845\u201362).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nFor many years, it had been one of his favorite schemes to secure, by means of simultaneous observations at distant points, a thorough investigation of the nature and law of \"[[magnetic storm]]s\" (a term invented by him to designate abnormal disturbances of [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's magnetism]]). The meeting at Berlin, on 18 September 1828, of a newly formed scientific association, of which he was elected president, gave him the opportunity of setting on foot an extensive system of research in combination with his diligent personal observations. His appeal to the Russian government, in 1829, led to the establishment of a line of magnetic and meteorological stations across northern Asia. Meanwhile, his letter to the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]], then (April 1836) president of the [[Royal Society]], secured for the undertaking, the wide basis of the [[British Empire|British dominions]].\n\nThe [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition]], observes, \"Thus that scientific conspiracy of nations which is one of the noblest fruits of modern civilization was by his exertions first successfully organized\".{{sfn|Clerke|1911|p=874}} However, earlier examples of international scientific cooperation exist, notably the 18th-century observations of the [[Transit of Venus|transits of Venus]].\n\nIn 1869, the 100th year of his birth, Humboldt's fame was so great that cities all over America celebrated his birth with large festivals.

Accessed July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\nScholars have speculated about the reasons for Humboldt's declining renown among the public. Sandra Nichols has argued that there are three reasons for this. First, a trend towards specialization in scholarship. Humboldt was a generalist who connected many disciplines in his work. Today, academics have become more and more focused on narrow fields of work. Humboldt combined [[ecology]], geography and even social sciences. Second, a change in writing style. Humboldt's works, which were considered essential to a library in 1869, had flowery prose that fell out of fashion. One critic said they had a \"laborious picturesqueness\". Humboldt himself said that, \"If I only knew how to describe adequately how and what I felt, I might, after this long journey of mine, really be able to give happiness to people. The disjointed life I lead makes me hardly certain of my way of writing\". Third, a rising anti-German sentiment in the late 1800s and the early 1900s due to heavy German immigration to the United States and later World War 1.<ref name=\"Nichols, Sandra 2006\"/> On the eve of the 1959 hundredth anniversary of the death of Humboldt, the government of West Germany planned significant celebrations in conjunction with nations that Humboldt visited.<ref>Adolf Meyer Abich, \"The Hundredth Anniversary of the Death of Alexander von Humboldt\", [[The Hispanic American Historical Review]], vol. 38, No. 3, (August 1958), pp. 394\u201396.</ref>\n\n==Expedition in Russia, 1829==\n\n[[File:Humboldt RUS.jpg|thumb|400px|Map of Humboldt's expedition to Russia in 1829]]\nIn 1811, and again in 1818, projects of Asiatic exploration were proposed to Humboldt, first by Czar [[Nicolas I]]'s Russian government, and afterwards by the Prussian government; but on each occasion, untoward circumstances interposed. It was not until he had begun his sixtieth year that he resumed his early role of traveler in the interests of science.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Minister, Count [[Georg von Cancrin]] contacted Humboldt about whether a platinum-based currency was possible in Russia and invited him to visit the Ural Mountains. Humboldt was not encouraging about a [[platinum]]-based currency, when silver was the standard as a world currency. But the invitation to visit the Urals was intriguing, especially since Humboldt had long dreamed of going to Asia. He had wanted to travel to India and made considerable efforts to persuade the [[British East India Company]] to authorize a trip, but those efforts were fruitless.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=171\u201374, 199\u2013200}} When Russia renewed its earlier invitation to Humboldt, Humboldt accepted.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=199\u2013200}} The Russians sought to entice Humboldt by engaging his enduring interest in mining sites, for comparative scientific purposes for Humboldt, but for the Russians to gain expert knowledge about their resources. For Humboldt, the Russian monarch's promise to fund the trip was extremely important, since Humboldt's inherited 100,000 thaler fortune was gone and he lived on the Prussian government pension of 2,500\u20133,000 thalers as the monarch's chamberlain. The Russian government gave an advance of 1200 {{transl|rus|chervontsev}} in Berlin and another 20,000 when he arrived in St. Petersburg.<ref>M.A. Engel'gardt, ''A Gumbol'dt: Ego zhizn', puteshestviia i nauchnaia d\"iatel'nost''. Saint Petersburg: Tip. Tovarishchestva \"obshchestvennaia Pol'za 1900, p. 60.</ref>\n\nHumboldt was eager to travel not just to the Urals, but also across the steppes of Siberia to Russia's border with China. Humboldt wrote Cancrin saying that he intended to learn Russian to read mining journals in the language.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=283\u201385}} As the details of the expedition were worked out, Humboldt said that he would travel to Russia in his own French coach, with a German servant, as well as [[Gustav Rose]], a professor of chemistry and mineralogy. He also invited [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] to join the expedition, to study water micro-organisms in [[Lake Baikal]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. Humboldt himself was keen to continue his studies of magnetism of mountains and mineral deposits. As was usual for his research, he brought scientific instruments to take the most accurate measurements.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=287}} The Russians organized the local arrangements, including lodging, horses, accompanying crew. Humboldt's title for the expedition was as an official of the Department of Mines. As the expedition neared dangerous areas, he had to travel in a convoy with an escort.<ref>Engel'gardt, ''A. Gumbol'dt'', p. 60.</ref>\n\nPhysically Humboldt was in good condition, despite his advancing years, writing to Cancrin \"I still walk very lightly on foot, nine to ten hours without resting, despite my age and my white hair\".<ref>Humboldt to Cancrin, quoted in {{harvnb|de Terra|1955|p=286}}.</ref>\n\nBetween May and November 1829 he and the growing expedition traversed the wide expanse of the Russian empire from the [[Neva]] to the [[Yenisei]], accomplishing in twenty-five weeks a distance of {{convert|9614|mi|km}}. Humboldt and the expedition party traveled by coach on well maintained roads, with rapid progress being made because of changes of horses at way stations. The party had grown, with Johann Seifert, who was a huntsman and collector of animal specimens; a Russian mining official; Count Adolphe Polier, one of Humboldt's friends from Paris; a cook; plus a contingent of [[Cossacks]] for security. Three carriages were filled with people, supplies, and scientific instruments. For Humboldt's magnetic readings to be accurate, they carried an iron-free tent.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=201\u2013202}} This expedition was unlike his Spanish American travels with Bonpland, with the two alone and sometimes accompanied by local guides.\n\nThe Russian government was interested in Humboldt finding prospects for mining and commercial advancement of the realm and made it clear that Humboldt was not to investigate social issues, nor criticize social conditions of Russian [[serfs]]. In his publications on Spanish America, he did comment on the conditions of the indigenous populations, and deplored black slavery, but well after he had left those territories.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=205}} As Humboldt discovered, the government kept tight control of the expedition, even when it was {{convert|1000|mi}} from Moscow, with local government officials greeting the expedition at every stop. The itinerary was planned with [[Tobolsk]] the farthest destination, then a return to [[St Petersburg]].\n\nHumboldt wrote to the Russian Minister Cancrin that he was extending his travel, knowing that the missive would not reach him in time to scuttle the plan. The further east he journeyed into wilder territory, the more Humboldt enjoyed it. They still followed the Siberian Highway and made excellent progress, sometimes a hundred miles (160&nbsp;km) in a day.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|pp=206\u2013207}} Although they were halted at the end of July and warned of an [[anthrax]] outbreak, Humboldt decided to continue despite the danger. \"At my age, nothing should be postponed\".<ref>quoted in {{harvnb|Wulf|2015|p=207}}.</ref>\n\nThe journey though carried out with all the advantages afforded by the immediate patronage of the Russian government, was too rapid to be profitable scientifically. The correction of the prevalent exaggerated estimate of the height of the Central Asian plateau, and the prediction of the discovery of diamonds in the gold-washings of the Urals, were important aspects of these travels. In the end, the expedition took 8 months, traveled 15,500&nbsp;km, stopped at 658 post stations, and used 12,244 horses.<ref>Engel'gardt, ''A. Gumbol'dt'', p. 62.</ref>\n\nOne writer claims that \"Nothing was quite as Humboldt wanted it. The entire expedition was a compromise.\"{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=203}} The Russian emperor offered Humboldt an invitation to return to Russia, but Humboldt declined, due to his disapproval of Nicholas's restrictions on his freedom of movement during the expedition and his ability to freely report on it.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=306}} Humboldt published two works on the Russian expedition, first {{lang|fr|Fragmens de g\u00e9ologie et de la climatologie asiastique}} in 1831, based on lectures he gave on the topic. In 1843, he completed the three-volume ''Asie Centrale'',<ref>Alexander von Humboldt, ''Asie centrale, recherches sur les cha\u00eenes des montagnes et la climotologie compar\u00e9e''. 3 vols. 1843.</ref> which he dedicated to Czar Nicholas, which he called \"an unavoidable step, as the expedition was accomplished at his expense\".<ref>quoted in {{harvnb|de Terra|1955|p=307}}.</ref> As of 2016, these works have not been translated to English.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=433}} His 1829 expedition to Russia when he was an old man is much less known than his five-year travels in Spanish America, which had resulted in many published volumes over the decades since his 1804 return. Nevertheless, it gave Humboldt comparative data for his various later scientific publications.\n\n==Publications==\n===''Cosmos''===\n{{see also|Kosmos (Humboldt)}}\n[[File:Alexander von Humboldt photo 1857.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Photograph of Humboldt in his later years]]\n\n[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|''Kosmos'']] was Humboldt's multi-volume effort in his later years to write a work bringing together all the research from his long career. The writing took shape in [[public lecture|lecture]]s he delivered before the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] in the winter of 1827\u201328. These lectures would form \"the [[cartoon]] for the great fresco of the ''[K]osmos''\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Dickinson|Howarth|1933|p=145}}</ref> His 1829 expedition to Russia supplied him with data comparative to his Latin American expedition.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=235}}\n\nThe first two volumes of the ''Kosmos'' were published between the years 1845 and 1847 were intended to comprise the entire work, but Humboldt published three more volumes, one of which was posthumous. Humboldt had long aimed to write a comprehensive work about geography and the natural sciences. The work attempted to unify the sciences then known in a Kantian framework. With inspiration from [[German Romanticism]], Humboldt sought to create a compendium of the world's environment.<ref name=\"Walls 2009 3\u201315\"/> He spent the last decade of his long life\u2014as he called them, his \"improbable\" years\u2014continuing this work. The third and fourth volumes were published in 1850\u201358; a fragment of a fifth appeared posthumously in 1862.\n\nHis reputation had long since been made with his publications on the Latin American expedition. There is not a consensus on the importance of ''Kosmos''. One scholar, who stresses the importance of Humboldt's ''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain'' as essential reading, dismisses ''Kosmos'' as \"little more than an academic curiosity\".{{sfn|Brading|1991|p=534}} A different opinion is that ''Kosmos'' was his \"most influential book\".{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=235}}\n\nAs with most of Humboldt's works, ''Kosmos'' was also translated into multiple languages in editions of uneven quality. It was very popular in Britain and America. In 1849 a German newspaper commented that in England two of the three different translations were made by women, \"while in Germany most of the men do not understand it\".<ref>Beilage zu No. 102 der (Augsburger) Allgemeinen Zeitung, 12 April 1849.</ref> The first translation by Augustin Pritchard\u2014published anonymously by Mr. Bailli\u00e8re (volume I in 1845 and volume II in 1848)\u2014suffered from being hurriedly made. In a letter Humboldt said of it: \"It will damage my reputation. All the charm of my description is destroyed by an English sounding like Sanskrit.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe other two translations were made by [[Elizabeth Juliana Leeves Sabine]] under the superintendence of her husband Col. [[Edward Sabine]] (4 volumes 1846\u20131858), and by [[Elise Ott\u00e9]] (5 volumes 1849\u20131858, the only complete translation of the 4 German volumes). These three translations were also published in the United States. The numbering of the volumes differs between the German and the English editions. Volume 3 of the German edition corresponds to the volumes 3 and 4 of the English translation, as the German volume appeared in 2 parts in 1850 and 1851. Volume 5 of the German edition was not translated until 1981, again by a woman.<ref name=Bowen1981>{{Cite book|first=Margarita |last=Bowen|title=Empiricism and Geographical Thought: From Francis Bacon to Alexander von Humboldt|series=Cambridge Geographical Studies (No. 15)|place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1981|isbn=978-0-521-10559-0}}</ref> Ott\u00e9's translation benefited from a detailed table of contents, and an index for every volume; of the German edition only volumes 4 and 5 had (extremely short) tables of contents, and the index to the whole work only appeared with volume 5 in 1862.

He and Bonpland parted ways after their return to Europe, and Humboldt largely took on the task of publishing the results of their Latin American expedition at Humboldt's expense, but he included Bonpland as co-author on the nearly published 30 volumes. Bonpland returned to Latin America, settling in Buenos Aires, Argentina, then moved to the countryside near the border with Paraguay. The forces of Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], the strong man of Paraguay, abducted Bonpland after killing Bonpland's estate workers. Bonpland was accused of \"agricultural espionage\" and of threatening Paraguay's virtual monopoly on the cultivation of [[yerba mate]]. Despite international pressure, including the British government and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's, along with European scientists including Humboldt, Francia kept Bonpland prisoner until 1831. He was released after nearly 10 years in Paraguay. Humboldt and Bonpland maintained a warm correspondence about science and politics until Bonpland's death in 1858.{{sfn|Wulf|2015|p=272}}\n\nDuring Humboldt's time in Paris, he met in 1818 the young and brilliant Peruvian student of the Royal Mining School of Paris, [[Mariano Eduardo de Rivero y Ustariz]]. Subsequently, Humboldt acted as a mentor of the career of this promising Peruvian scientist. Another recipient of Humboldt's aid was [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807\u20131873), who was directly aided with needed cash from Humboldt, assistance in securing an academic position, and help with getting his research on zoology published. Agassiz sent him copies of his publications and went on to gain considerable scientific recognition as a professor at Harvard.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|pp=326\u201327}} Agassiz delivered an address to the Boston Society of Natural History in 1869, on the centenary of his patron's birth.<ref>Louis Agassiz, ''Address delivered on the Centennial Anniversary of the Birth of Alexander von Humboldt, under the auspices of the Boston Society of Natural History''.

The Prussian royal family returned to Berlin, but sought better terms of the treaty and [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]] commissioned his younger brother [[Prince Wilhelm of Prussia (1783\u20131851)|Prince Wilhelm]] with this. Friedrich Wilhelm III asked Alexander to be part of the mission, charged with introducing the prince to Paris society. This turn of events for Humboldt could not have been better, since he desired to live in Paris rather than Berlin.{{sfn|de Terra|1955|p=210}}\n\nIn 1814 Humboldt accompanied the allied sovereigns to London. Three years later he was summoned by the king of Prussia to attend him at the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|congress of Aachen]]. Again in the autumn of 1822 he accompanied the same monarch to the [[Congress of Verona]], proceeded thence with the royal party to Rome and Naples and returned to Paris in the spring of 1823. Humboldt had long regarded Paris as his true home. Thus, when at last he received from his sovereign a summons to join his court at Berlin, he obeyed reluctantly.\n\nBetween 1830 and 1848 Humboldt was frequently employed in diplomatic missions to the court of [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis Philippe]] of France, with whom he always maintained the most cordial personal relations. [[Charles X of France]] had been overthrown, with Louis-Philippe of the [[house of Orl\u00e9ans]] becoming king. Humboldt knew the family, and he was sent by the Prussian monarch to Paris to report on events to his monarch. He spent three years in France, from 1830 to 1833.
