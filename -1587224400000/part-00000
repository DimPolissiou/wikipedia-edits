This practice can actually be traced back to the English [[Renaissance]] when a colonelcy was purchased by a lord or prominent gentleman but the actual command would fall to a [[lieutenant colonel]], who would deputize its members for the proprietor.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://americanchivalry.blogspot.com/2012/10/honorary-colonel.html|title=American Chivalry: Honorary Colonel|last=Dandy|first=Beat|date=2012-10-02|website=American Chivalry|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\nThere is an aristocratic tinge to the social usage of the title \"Colonel\", which most often today designates a southern gentleman, and is archetypal of the southern aristocrat from days past.

From 2005 to 2015 [[Illinois]] allowed for the Governor of the State to make appointments to the Governor's Regiment of Colonels, but no appointments were ever made. Many states have provisions in their articles or bills concerning state defense forces which allow the governor to grant honorary membership of the officer ranks.

Pagan.</ref>}}\n\n[[Medieval]] writers often assumed that ''paganus'' as a religious term was a result of the conversion patterns during the [[Christianization of Europe]], where people in towns and cities were converted more readily than those in remote regions, where old ways lingered. However, this idea has multiple problems. First, the word's usage as a reference to non-Christians pre-dates that period in history. Second, paganism within the Roman Empire centred on cities. The concept of an urban Christianity as opposed to a rural paganism would not have occurred to Romans during [[Early Christianity]]. Third, unlike words such as [[wikt:rusticitas|''rusticitas'']], ''paganus'' had not yet fully acquired the meanings (of uncultured backwardness) used to explain why it would have been applied to pagans.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14\u201315}}\n\n''Paganus'' more likely acquired its meaning in Christian nomenclature via Roman military jargon (see above). Early Christians adopted military motifs and saw themselves as ''[[miles Christianus|Milites Christi]]'' (soldiers of Christ).<ref name=\"etymonline_pagan\"/>{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14\u201315}} A good example of Christians still using ''paganus'' in a military context rather than religious is in [[Tertullian]]'s ''De Corona Militis'' XI.V, where the Christian is referred to as ''paganus'' (''civilian''): {{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14\u201315}}\n{|\n |style=\"padding-left: 6em; padding-right: 1em;\"|''Apud hunc [Christum] tam miles est paganus fidelis quam paganus est miles fidelis.''<ref>[[s:la:De corona militis#11|''De Corona Militis'' XI.V]]</ref>\n |style=\"padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 6em;\"|With Him [Christ] the faithful citizen is a soldier, just as the faithful soldier is a citizen.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/The Chaplet, or De Corona/Chapter XI|Ante-Nicene Fathers III, De Corona XI]]</ref>\n |}\n\n''Paganus'' acquired its religious connotations by the mid-4th century.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14\u201315}} As early as the 5th century, ''paganos'' was metaphorically used to denote persons outside the bounds of the Christian community.

In response, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote [[City of God (book)|''De Civitate Dei Contra Paganos'']] ('The City of God against the Pagans').

The Jews of the time distinguished themselves from foreigners according to religion rather than [[Ethnicity|ethno]]-[[Culture|cultural]] standards, and early Jewish Christians would have done the same. Because Hellenic culture was the dominant pagan culture in the Roman east, they called pagans Hellenes. Christianity inherited Jewish terminology for non-Jews and adapted it in order to refer to non-Christians with whom they were in contact. This usage is recorded in the [[New Testament]]. In the [[Pauline epistles]], ''Hellene'' is almost always juxtaposed with ''Hebrew'' regardless of actual ethnicities.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nThe usage of Hellene as a religious term was initially part of an exclusively Christian nomenclature, but some Pagans began to defiantly call themselves Hellenes. Other pagans even preferred the narrow meaning of the word from a broad cultural sphere to a more specific religious grouping. However, there were many Christians and pagans alike who strongly objected to the evolution of the terminology. The influential [[Archbishop of Constantinople]] [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], for example, took offence at imperial efforts to suppress Hellenic culture (especially concerning spoken and written Greek) and he openly criticized the emperor.<ref name=\"Cameron93\"/>\n\nThe growing religious stigmatization of Hellenism had a [[chilling effect]] on Hellenic culture by the late 4th century.<ref name=\"Cameron93\"/>\n\nBy late antiquity, however, it was possible to speak Greek as a primary language while not conceiving of oneself as a Hellene.<ref>Simon Swain, \"Defending Hellenism: Philostratus, in Honour of Apollonius,\" in ''Apologetics,'' p. 173.</ref> The long-established use of Greek both in and around the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] as a [[lingua franca]] ironically allowed it to instead become central in enabling the spread of Christianity\u2014as indicated for example by the use of Greek for the [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Paul]].<ref>Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State,'' p. 5.</ref> In the first half of the 5th century, Greek was the standard language in which bishops communicated,<ref>Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' pp. 97\u201398.</ref> and the ''Acta Conciliorum'' (\"Acts of the Church Councils\") were recorded originally in Greek and then translated into other languages.<ref>Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 98.</ref>\n\n===Heathen===\nHeathen comes from [[Old English]] ''h\u00e6\u00f0en'' (not Christian or Jewish); cf.

This meaning for the term originated from [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{lang|got|[[wikt:hai\u00feno|hai\u00feno]]}} ([[gentile]] woman) being used to translate Hellene (cf. {{bibleverse||Mark|7:26|KJV}}) in [[Gothic Bible|Wulfila's Bible]], the first translation of the [[Bible]] into a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]]. This may have been influenced by the Greek and Latin terminology of the time used for pagans.

It might be less confusing to say that the pagans, before their competition with Christianity, had no religion at all in the sense in which that word is normally used today. They had no tradition of discourse about ritual or religious matters (apart from philosophical debate or antiquarian treatise), no organized system of beliefs to which they were asked to commit themselves, no authority-structure peculiar to the religious area, above all no commitment to a particular group of people or set of ideas other than their family and political context. If this is the right view of pagan life, it follows that we should look on paganism quite simply as a religion invented in the course of the second to third centuries AD, in competition and interaction with Christians, Jews and others.|North 1992, 187\u201388|{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=26\u201327}}}}\n\nDefining paganism is problematic. Understanding the context of its associated terminology is important.{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Defining paganism}} [[Early Christian]]s referred to the diverse array of [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]] around them as a single group for reasons of convenience and [[rhetoric]].{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=26}} While paganism generally implies [[polytheism]], the primary distinction between classical pagans and Christians was not one of [[monotheism]] versus polytheism. Not all pagans were strictly polytheist. Throughout history, many of them believed in a [[Supreme Being|supreme]] [[deity]]. (However, most such pagans believed in a class of subordinate gods/[[daimon]]s\u2014see [[henotheism]]\u2014or divine [[Emanationism|emanation]]s.){{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=28, 30}} To Christians, the most important distinction was whether or not someone worshipped the ''[[one true God]]''. Those who did not (polytheist, monotheist, or [[atheist]]) were outsiders to the [[Christian Church|Church]] and thus pagan.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=27, 31}} Similarly, classical pagans would have found it peculiar to distinguish groups by the number of [[deities]] followers venerate. They would have considered the priestly colleges (such as the [[College of Pontiffs]] or [[Epulones]]) and cult practices more meaningful distinctions.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=29}}\n\nReferring to paganism as pre-Christian indigenous religions is equally untenable. Not all historical pagan traditions were pre-Christian or indigenous to their places of worship.{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Defining paganism}}\n\nOwing to the history of its nomenclature, paganism traditionally encompasses the collective pre- and non-Christian cultures in and around the [[classical world]]; including those of the Greco-Roman, Celtic, Germanic, Slavic tribes.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=28}} However, modern parlance of [[folklorist]]s and [[contemporary pagan]]s in particular has extended the original four millennia scope used by early Christians to include similar religious traditions stretching far into [[prehistory]].{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Chapter 1: The ancient world}}\n\n==Perception==\nPaganism came to be equated by Christians with a sense of hedonism, representing those who are sensual, materialistic, self-indulgent, unconcerned with the future, and uninterested in more mainstream religions. Pagans were usually described within this worldly [[stereotype]], especially among those drawing attention to what they perceived as the limitations of paganism.<ref>Antonio Virgili, Culti misterici ed orientali a Pompei, Roma, Gangemi, 2008</ref> Thus [[G.

Modern historians define paganism instead as the aggregate of cult acts, set within a civic rather than a national context, without a written creed or sense of [[orthodoxy]].<ref>A summary of the modern view is given in Robin Lane Fox, ''Pagans and Christians'' 1989, pp. 31 ''ff.'': \"The modern emphasis on {{sic|hide=y|reason=Fox appears to have used \"pagan\", lower case, per external sources quoting him.|paganism}}'s cult acts was also acknowledged by {{sic|hide=y|pagans}} themselves.

As Christianity emerged from [[Second Temple Judaism]] (or [[Hellenistic Judaism]]), it stood in competition with other religions advocating pagan monotheism, including the cults of [[Dionysus]],<ref>E. Kessler, ''Dionysian Monotheism in Nea Paphos, Cyprus''\n\"two monotheistic religions, Dionysian and Christian, existed contemporaneously in Nea Paphos during the 4th century C.E. [...] the particular iconography of Hermes and Dionysos in the panel of the Epiphany of Dionysos [...] represents the culmination of a {{sic|hide=y|reason=Kessler capitalized; verified with source.|Pagan}} iconographic tradition in which an infant divinity is seated on the lap of another divine figure; this {{sic|hide=y|Pagan}} motif was appropriated by early Christian artists and developed into the standardized icon of the Virgin and Child.

This was notably attempted by the [[Brothers Grimm]], especially [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''Teutonic Mythology'', and [[Elias L\u00f6nnrot]] with the compilation of the ''[[Kalevala]]''. The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].<ref>Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>\n\nRomanticist interest in non-classical antiquity coincided with the rise of [[Romantic nationalism]] and the rise of the [[nation state]] in the context of the [[1848 revolutions]], leading to the creation of ''[[national epic]]s'' and [[national myth]]s for the various newly formed states.

However, this idea has multiple problems. First, the word's usage as a reference to non-Christians pre-dates that period in history. Second, paganism within the Roman Empire centred on cities. The concept of an urban Christianity as opposed to a rural paganism would not have occurred to Romans during [[Early Christianity]]. Third, unlike words such as [[wikt:rusticitas|''rusticitas'']], ''paganus'' had not yet fully acquired the meanings (of uncultured backwardness) used to explain why it would have been applied to pagans.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14\u201315}}\n\n''Paganus'' more likely acquired its meaning in Christian nomenclature via Roman military jargon (see above). Early Christians adopted military motifs and saw themselves as ''[[miles Christianus|Milites Christi]]'' (soldiers of Christ).<ref name=\"etymonline_pagan\"/>{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14\u201315}} A good example of Christians still using ''paganus'' in a military context rather than religious is in [[Tertullian]]'s ''De Corona Militis'' XI.V, where the Christian is referred to as ''paganus'' (''civilian''): {{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14\u201315}}\n{|\n |style=\"padding-left: 6em; padding-right: 1em;\"|''Apud hunc [Christum] tam miles est paganus fidelis quam paganus est miles fidelis.''<ref>[[s:la:De corona militis#11|''De Corona Militis'' XI.V]]</ref>\n |style=\"padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 6em;\"|With Him [Christ] the faithful citizen is a soldier, just as the faithful soldier is a citizen.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/The Chaplet, or De Corona/Chapter XI|Ante-Nicene Fathers III, De Corona XI]]</ref>\n |}\n\n''Paganus'' acquired its religious connotations by the mid-4th century.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=14\u201315}} As early as the 5th century, ''paganos'' was metaphorically used to denote persons outside the bounds of the Christian community.

The Jews of the time distinguished themselves from foreigners according to religion rather than [[Ethnicity|ethno]]-[[Culture|cultural]] standards, and early Jewish Christians would have done the same. Because Hellenic culture was the dominant pagan culture in the Roman east, they called pagans Hellenes. Christianity inherited Jewish terminology for non-Jews and adapted it in order to refer to non-Christians with whom they were in contact. This usage is recorded in the [[New Testament]]. In the [[Pauline epistles]], ''Hellene'' is almost always juxtaposed with ''Hebrew'' regardless of actual ethnicities.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nThe usage of Hellene as a religious term was initially part of an exclusively Christian nomenclature, but some Pagans began to defiantly call themselves Hellenes. Other pagans even preferred the narrow meaning of the word from a broad cultural sphere to a more specific religious grouping. However, there were many Christians and pagans alike who strongly objected to the evolution of the terminology. The influential [[Archbishop of Constantinople]] [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], for example, took offence at imperial efforts to suppress Hellenic culture (especially concerning spoken and written Greek) and he openly criticized the emperor.<ref name=\"Cameron93\"/>\n\nThe growing religious stigmatization of Hellenism had a [[chilling effect]] on Hellenic culture by the late 4th century.<ref name=\"Cameron93\"/>\n\nBy late antiquity, however, it was possible to speak Greek as a primary language while not conceiving of oneself as a Hellene.<ref>Simon Swain, \"Defending Hellenism: Philostratus, in Honour of Apollonius,\" in ''Apologetics,'' p. 173.</ref> The long-established use of Greek both in and around the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] as a [[lingua franca]] ironically allowed it to instead become central in enabling the spread of Christianity\u2014as indicated for example by the use of Greek for the [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Paul]].<ref>Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State,'' p. 5.</ref> In the first half of the 5th century, Greek was the standard language in which bishops communicated,<ref>Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' pp. 97\u201398.</ref> and the ''Acta Conciliorum'' (\"Acts of the Church Councils\") were recorded originally in Greek and then translated into other languages.<ref>Millar, ''A Greek Roman Empire,'' p. 98.</ref>\n\n===Heathen===\nHeathen comes from [[Old English]] ''h\u00e6\u00f0en'' (not Christian or Jewish); cf.

It might be less confusing to say that the pagans, before their competition with Christianity, had no religion at all in the sense in which that word is normally used today. They had no tradition of discourse about ritual or religious matters (apart from philosophical debate or antiquarian treatise), no organized system of beliefs to which they were asked to commit themselves, no authority-structure peculiar to the religious area, above all no commitment to a particular group of people or set of ideas other than their family and political context. If this is the right view of pagan life, it follows that we should look on paganism quite simply as a religion invented in the course of the second to third centuries AD, in competition and interaction with Christians, Jews and others.|North 1992, 187\u201388|{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=26\u201327}}}}\n\nDefining paganism is problematic. Understanding the context of its associated terminology is important.{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Defining paganism}} [[Early Christian]]s referred to the diverse array of [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]] around them as a single group for reasons of convenience and [[rhetoric]].{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=26}} While paganism generally implies [[polytheism]], the primary distinction between classical pagans and Christians was not one of [[monotheism]] versus polytheism. Not all pagans were strictly polytheist. Throughout history, many of them believed in a [[Supreme Being|supreme]] [[deity]]. (However, most such pagans believed in a class of subordinate gods/[[daimon]]s\u2014see [[henotheism]]\u2014or divine [[Emanationism|emanation]]s.){{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=28, 30}} To Christians, the most important distinction was whether or not someone worshipped the ''[[one true God]]''. Those who did not (polytheist, monotheist, or [[atheist]]) were outsiders to the [[Christian Church|Church]] and thus pagan.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|pp=27, 31}} Similarly, classical pagans would have found it peculiar to distinguish groups by the number of [[deities]] followers venerate. They would have considered the priestly colleges (such as the [[College of Pontiffs]] or [[Epulones]]) and cult practices more meaningful distinctions.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=29}}\n\nReferring to paganism as pre-Christian indigenous religions is equally untenable. Not all historical pagan traditions were pre-Christian or indigenous to their places of worship.{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Defining paganism}}\n\nOwing to the history of its nomenclature, paganism traditionally encompasses the collective pre- and non-Christian cultures in and around the [[classical world]]; including those of the Greco-Roman, Celtic, Germanic, Slavic tribes.{{sfn|Cameron|2011|p=28}} However, modern parlance of [[folklorist]]s and [[contemporary pagan]]s in particular has extended the original four millennia scope used by early Christians to include similar religious traditions stretching far into [[prehistory]].{{sfn|Davies|2011|loc=Chapter 1: The ancient world}}\n\n==Perception==\nPaganism came to be equated by Christians with a sense of hedonism, representing those who are sensual, materialistic, self-indulgent, unconcerned with the future, and uninterested in more mainstream religions. Pagans were usually described within this worldly [[stereotype]], especially among those drawing attention to what they perceived as the limitations of paganism.<ref>Antonio Virgili, Culti misterici ed orientali a Pompei, Roma, Gangemi, 2008</ref> Thus [[G. K. Chesterton]] wrote: \"The {{sic|hide=y|reason=Chesterton used \"pagan\", lower case; verified with source.|pagan}} set out, with admirable sense, to enjoy himself. By the end of his civilization he had discovered that a man cannot enjoy himself and continue to enjoy anything else.\" In sharp contrast, [[Swinburne]] the poet would comment on this same theme: \"Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath; We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death.\"<ref>'Hymn to Proserpine'</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Bronze Age to Early Iron Age===\n* [[Religions of the ancient Near East]]\n** [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]\n** [[Ancient Semitic religion]]\n** [[Ancient Iranian religion]]\n** [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion]]\n\n===Classical antiquity===\n{{main article|Ancient Greek religion|Ancient Roman religion|Hellenistic religion|Roman imperial cult}}\n[[Ludwig Feuerbach]] defined the paganism of [[classical antiquity]], which he termed {{lang|de|Heidentum}} ('heathenry') as \"the unity of religion and politics, of spirit and nature, of god and man\",<ref>cf. the civil, natural and mythical theologies of [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]</ref> qualified by the observation that man in the pagan view is always defined by [[ethnicity]], i.e. Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Jew, etc., so that each pagan tradition is also a national tradition. Modern historians define paganism instead as the aggregate of cult acts, set within a civic rather than a national context, without a written creed or sense of [[orthodoxy]].<ref>A summary of the modern view is given in Robin Lane Fox, ''Pagans and Christians'' 1989, pp. 31 ''ff.'': \"The modern emphasis on {{sic|hide=y|reason=Fox appears to have used \"pagan\", lower case, per external sources quoting him.|paganism}}'s cult acts was also acknowledged by {{sic|hide=y|pagans}} themselves.

As Christianity emerged from [[Second Temple Judaism]] (or [[Hellenistic Judaism]]), it stood in competition with other religions advocating pagan monotheism, including the cults of [[Dionysus]],<ref>E. Kessler, ''Dionysian Monotheism in Nea Paphos, Cyprus''\n\"two monotheistic religions, Dionysian and Christian, existed contemporaneously in Nea Paphos during the 4th century C.E. [...] the particular iconography of Hermes and Dionysos in the panel of the Epiphany of Dionysos [...] represents the culmination of a {{sic|hide=y|reason=Kessler capitalized; verified with source.|Pagan}} iconographic tradition in which an infant divinity is seated on the lap of another divine figure; this {{sic|hide=y|Pagan}} motif was appropriated by early Christian artists and developed into the standardized icon of the Virgin and Child.

In the 17th century, the description of paganism turned from the theological aspect to the [[ethnology|ethnological]] one, and religions began to be understood as a part of the [[ethnic]] identities of peoples, and the study of the religions of so-called primitive peoples triggered questions as to the ultimate historical [[origin of religion]]. Thus, [[Nicolas Fabri de Peiresc]] saw the pagan [[religions of Africa]] of his day as relics that were in principle capable of shedding light on the historical paganism of Classical Antiquity.<ref>\"It would be a great pleasure to make the comparison with what survives to us of ancient {{sic|hide=y|reason=Miller used lower case; verified with online copy found in search results.|paganism}} in our old books, in order to have better [grasped] their spirit.\" Peter N.

This was notably attempted by the [[Brothers Grimm]], especially [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''Teutonic Mythology'', and [[Elias L\u00f6nnrot]] with the compilation of the ''[[Kalevala]]''. The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].<ref>Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p. 846, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref>\n\nRomanticist interest in non-classical antiquity coincided with the rise of [[Romantic nationalism]] and the rise of the [[nation state]] in the context of the [[1848 revolutions]], leading to the creation of ''[[national epic]]s'' and [[national myth]]s for the various newly formed states. Pagan or folkloric topics were also common in the [[musical nationalism]] of the period.\n\n==Modern paganism==\n{{anchor|Neopaganism}}\n{{Main article|Modern paganism}}\n[[File:Stonehenge Closeup.jpg|thumb|Some [[megalith]]s are believed to have religious significance.]]\n[[File:Lady of Cornwall.jpg|thumb|Children standing with ''The Lady of Cornwall'' in a neopagan ceremony in England]]\n[[File:Paganavebury.jpg|thumb|Neopagan [[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]] ceremony at Avebury (Beltane 2005)]]\n\n[[Modern paganism]], or neopaganism, includes [[polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructed religions]] such as [[Roman Polytheistic Reconstructionism]], [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]], [[Slavic Native Faith]], [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]], or [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|heathenry]], as well as modern eclectic traditions such as [[Wicca]] and its many offshoots, [[Neo-Druidism]], and [[Discordianism]].\n\nHowever, there often exists a distinction or separation between some polytheistic reconstructionists such as Hellenism and revivalist neopagans like Wiccans. The divide is over numerous issues such as the importance of accurate [[orthopraxy]] according to ancient sources available, the use and concept of magic, which calendar to use and which holidays to observe, as well as the use of the term pagan itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecauldron.net/dc-faq.php#4|title=Hellenismos FAQ |work=The Cauldron: A Pagan Forum|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"sceh\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&f=faq#24|title=Pagans|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes}}</ref><ref name=\"heath\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wyrdwords.vispa.com/heathenry/callusheathen.html|title=Call us Heathens!|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Journal of the Pagan Federation|year=1997|author=Arlea Ansch\u00fctz, Stormerne Hunt}}</ref>\n\nMany of the revivals, Wicca and Neo-Druidism in particular, have their roots in 19th century [[Romanticism]] and retain noticeable elements of [[occultism]] or [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that were current then, setting them apart from historical rural ({{lang|la|paganus}}) folk religion.

However, Kress doesn't agree with the abandonment of the project and decides to continue his experiments in his barn. He strongly believes that the insect-like species is actually sentient. He steals some sand containing Martian eggs from his lab and creates a makeshift incubator to hatch more of the Martian lifeforms. In the meantime, Kress deals with growing discord with his wife ([[Helen Shaver]]) over financial troubles, his obsession with work and the stress of concealing the stolen Martian lifeforms from his former supervisors at the government lab. Kress comes to believe that he is a god to his sandkings when they build sand structures that resemble his face (the face is looking across, unlike the [[Face on Mars]], which is looking up.). Bitten by one of the sandkings, his obsession peaks as he alienates his wife, son, father ([[Lloyd Bridges]]), and kills his former supervisor by throwing him in the sandking incubator, where the creatures\u2014already starved by Kress as an experiment\u2014quickly devour him. In the end, Kress attempts to destroy all the sandkings but fails. In the epilogue of the episode, a colony of sandkings is shown surviving in the wilderness.\n|LineColor=6A4794\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=3\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=Valerie 23\n|DirectedBy=[[Timothy Bond]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Jonathan Glassner]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1995|3|31}}\n|ShortSummary=Valerie 23 ([[Sofia Shinas]]) is the latest development from the Innobotics Corporation. She is designed to be attractive, helpful and a perfect companion for a disabled man. Although he is the ideal test candidate, due to his condition and qualifications, Frank Hellner ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) is extremely reluctant to take part and wants nothing to do with Valerie. Nevertheless he eventually agrees to a one-week test period. Valerie proves to be an excellent caregiver, and more. Over the course of the test, Valerie becomes increasingly affectionate and Frank eventually gives in. After the sexual encounter, Frank explains to Valerie that he thinks it was a mistake. Frank begins to grow closer to his physiotherapist Rachel ([[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]]), and she invites him to a bar. Valerie responds by displaying more human traits such as anger and envy. After following Frank and Rachel on a rock climbing outing, Valerie attempts to dispose of her rival Rachel and is shut down before being returned to Innobotics. Frank decides that he must speak to Valerie before she is dismantled and asks for her to be reactivated. While restrained at Innobotics, Valerie tries to explain her feelings for Frank and rekindle the relationship, but to no avail. Valerie escapes, follows Frank and again tries to kill Rachel. Frank is forced to destroy Valerie with an electric shock. As she lies dying, she tells him that she is afraid to die. Earlier Frank had been told by Rachel that anything that fears its death is alive.\n|LineColor=6A4794\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=4\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|Title=Blood Brothers\n|DirectedBy=[[Tibor Tak\u00e1cs (director)|Tibor Takacs]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Brad Wright]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1995|4|7}}\n|ShortSummary=Cameron Deighton had [[Huntington's disease]] and his two sons, Michael ([[Martin Kemp]]) and Spencer ([[Charles Martin Smith]]), may have inherited the gene responsible for the illness. Spencer decides not to be tested. Michael claims to have been tested and pronounced clear. Spencer spends his time working on cures for serious illnesses, while Michael pushes for the development of more lucrative drugs\u2014such as Jericho, a drug used to calm rioting crowds. Spencer begins a romantic relationship with a reporter, Tricia ([[Kate Vernon]]). Spencer makes a breakthrough and finds what appears to be a wonder drug, ''Deighton C'', capable of curing virtually any disease. He decides to announce his breakthrough and make the research available to the world for further research and development. Michael disagrees and sees the opportunity to keep it secret and limit the use of ''Deighton C'' to the rich and powerful. When Carl ([[Tom Cavanagh]]), Spencer's research assistant, attempts to smuggle the drug out of the laboratory, Michael uses the laboratory's fire cleansing system to kill him and dispose of the body. Assuming that Spencer must have told Tricia about the drug he attempts to kill her too, but fails. Michael uses the drug on himself and attempts to kill both Spencer and Tricia the same way he killed Carl. Spencer disables the lab's fire system and escapes. He questions Michael about why he would take a virtually untested drug\u2014Michael lied about his Huntington's test. He does have the gene. For Michael, ''Deighton C'' is not the wonder drug he had hoped for\u2014and its [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] are disastrous.\n|LineColor=6A4794\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=5\n|EpisodeNumber2=5\n|Title=The Second Soul\n|DirectedBy=[[Paul Lynch (director)|Paul Lynch]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Alan Brennert]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1995|4|14}}\n|ShortSummary=A dying race of aliens has come to Earth to stop its own extinction... by reanimating human corpses.

His personal physician, Dr. McEnerney ([[Bruce Davison]]), rushes to the scene and resuscitates him just in time. A mysterious blue energy appears near Hawkes' body and moves into the electrical systems of the room. Although Hawkes is still alive, his heart is badly damaged, and the artificial heart being developed by McEnerney will not be ready in time. Hawkes threatens to pull funding from the artificial heart project unless he is moved to the front of the queue for the next available donor heart. This puts Dr. McEnerney in a difficult moral situation. Losing funding for the artificial heart project could mean the loss of a system that could save thousands of lives. To keep the funding he must give priority to a ruthless, cold elderly man who has already had a full life. The situation is even more difficult because the future sister-in-law of his friend, Dr. Anne Crain, is only eighteen and needs a heart transplant. She will not survive beyond a couple of weeks. The blue energy released during Hawkes' last resuscitation begins to try to kill Hawkes. McEnerney realizes that keeping Hawkes alive beyond his time has serious consequences and refuses Hawkes' request to be given priority. Both of the prospective heart recipients\u2014Hawkes and the young girl\u2014die. Hawkes sees the girl inside the tunnel of light, and realizes that their future paths are very different.

He takes his research to Bill Trenton ([[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]), billionaire owner of a successful research company. Trenton offers Jack a lucrative contract and a well-equipped laboratory to continue his work. Jack takes the job, and eventually Trenton convinces Jack to allow him to try his virtual reality suit. Trenton \"jumps\" a few hours into the future and sees a newspaper headline about a woman killed at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]. Upon returning to the present, Trenton saves the life of the woman whose death he saw reported\u2014proving that it is possible to alter the future as well as see it. Trenton begins secretly making plans to profit from the device by using it to win a [[United States Senate]] election. He sneaks into the laboratory and \"jumps\" into the future again.

The crew begin to see strange creatures inside their ship. After scanning the local space they find a huge chunk of dark matter and two spaceships: an alien craft and the derelict ''Slayton''. After moving closer to the alien craft they begin to see more and more alien creatures appear on board their ship. Suspecting that the aliens may have attacked and killed the crew of the ''Slayton'', they panic and begin shooting at them, to no effect. The pilot of the ''Nestor'', Paul Stein, suddenly sees an apparition of his older brother Kevin (one of the crew of the ill-fated ''Slayton''), who explains that they are all dead and disappears. Commander Manning orders the ''Nestor'' moved away from the alien craft and towards the derelict ''Slayton''. As they get closer, John Owens, captain of the ''Slayton'' appears. He explains that he cannot touch or feel them because he is no longer alive... he is some kind of ghost, trapped forever inside the pocket of space created by the dark matter. If they die here, as he and his crew did, their \"essence\" or \"souls\" will be trapped too. After analyzing the records of the ''Slayton'', they realize that the aliens did not attack. They were attempting to dock with the ''Slayton'' in order to escape. They make contact with the alien \"ghosts\" and use their plan. The dark matter is made up of high frequency superstring particles which are immensely heavy, add energy and the frequency lowers as does its mass therefore releasing the pocket in space that is holding everyone prisoner. The crew release the \"ghosts\" and escape themselves by turning the engines of the ''Nestor'' and the ''Slayton'' on the dark matter. Paul confronts Kevin's ghost over an old secret shame and gains confidence from the resolution to trust his own judgment.\n|LineColor=6A4794\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=13\n|EpisodeNumber2=13\n|Title=The Conversion\n|DirectedBy=[[Rebecca De Mornay]]\n|WrittenBy={{StoryTeleplay|t=Brad Wright|slabel=Based on the short story \"Two Strangers\" by|s=Richard B.

But one night, a strange object falls into Hannah's room, and emits a mysterious green glow. Possessed, Hannah craves sex, and to feed the alien presence within her, she must prey upon willing males who morph into her body while making love. Hannah first approaches Jay. When Hannah seduces the star quarterback, Jay follows them in disbelief. He finds Hannah alone and notices the hole in the ceiling where the alien object entered her room. Realizing that Jay is in danger while in her presence, Hannah forces him to leave, but Jay comes back to her room later and discovers the remains of the object and the quarterback's jacket. Investigating the disappearance of the quarterback, the police trace Jay to the scene, and he becomes the prime suspect. Jay turns the object over to his professor, who determines its origin, and researches similar occurrences. As more men vanish, the police pursue Hannah, who is then \"caught in the act\" devouring a convenience store clerk. A cop shoots Hannah, and to his utter horror, the undevoured top half of the clerk drops to the ground to die. He then watches as the green light emanates from the bullet hole in her stomach. Hannah is rushed to the hospital and doctors watch in awe as the wound heals itself. The professor is able to substantiate Jay's outrageous claims, and when the police release him, he rushes to the hospital to be with Hannah. Desperate for fresh victims, Hannah attacks her doctor, who refuses to give in to her obsession. Certain that his love is more powerful than the force within her, Jay risks his life to try to cure Hannah. Fearing for Jay's safety, Hannah tries to resist him and the craving within her, and ultimately, the purity and power of their love forces the alien presence from her system.

The device doesn't help her to hear normal conversation and sounds, but she does hear something, and no one believes her. While on a routine visit to the hospital to check on the implant, Jennifer befriends the janitor, Robert ([[Larry Drake]]) who empathizes with her. Suddenly, Jennifer is plagued by nightmares and searing pain in her head, all at 3:10 in the morning or afternoon. Once the pain starts she begins furiously writing in binary code. It's Robert who suggests that perhaps the binary code's 0's and 1's might be able to be translated. As a former astrophysicist who had mental problems that forced him to work as a janitor, Robert enters the code into his computer to try to translate it. Meanwhile, Jennifer's husband Sam, concerned for his wife and their young baby, is convinced that Jennifer is going crazy. But as the sounds and dreams become more pronounced Jennifer and Robert are determined to break the code. What they discover is an alien force, trying to communicate a cry for help through Jennifer's implant. The aliens are in a ship hurtling toward the sun and they need help from Earth to save their ship. The message sent was really instructions for a high energy laser designed to push the ship out of a terminal path.

A lab assistant enters the room in time to see Adam smashing up the laboratory before crashing through a window and escaping. Dr. Link is left dead. Some time later, a police officer finds Adam in a back alley. It asks the officer to contact Dr. Link and it apparently remembers nothing of the incident. Adam is taken to a cell and preparations are made to disassemble it. Mina, Dr. Link's daughter, contacts a lawyer, Thurman Cutler. Cutler pushes for a murder trial, insisting that Adam is his client and not simply a machine. A court hearing begins, and the prosecutor pushes for dismissal of the case and immediate disassembly on the grounds that Adam is just a machine. Cutler argues that, although Adam is clearly not human, it possesses intelligence and will, and on that basis, deserves a trial. During the hearing, one of Dr. Link's colleagues reveals that he had lost his funding. Cutler begins to look into Dr. Link's financial records and finds that he was working for a defense contractor, and eventually discovers that he was working to turn Adam into a weapon. Cutler is threatened by a shady representative of the defense company, but brings the matter up in court anyway. He argues, with supporting evidence of financial accounts and company memos, that Dr. Link was forced into attempting to rewrite Adam's central programming, effectively lobotomizing it. Adam reacted in the way any human might when faced with death. The court eventually finds that Adam is a person and will stand trial for the murder of Dr. Link. As it is being led away, Adam sees the prosecuting attorney in danger of being run over and rescues her, sacrificing its own life in the process.

Branch is dead, and Adams has a head injury, but his attending physician, Dr. Leslie McKenna ([[Mimi Kuzyk]]), is baffled by his unusual x-rays--four frontal brain lobes and only three major organs. Before Adams can figure out what happened, a large security detail whisks him and his files away to the Sendrax Corporation, the home of BE-85. It turns out that Adams is an alien and his \"kind\" are trying to keep their presence a secret. And because their body make up is different, BE-85, with long term use, will reconfigure the Earth's atmosphere so it is poisonous to humans, and compatible for the aliens. Adams realizes that he is in danger, and escapes to see McKenna, the only person he can trust. Together they unlock the secret of Adams' identity and the horror of the alien master plan, and divulge the secret of BE-85 to Kyle Haller (Scott Swanson), an aggressive young reporter.

His evidence comes from incidents in previous episodes of the first season: the experiments of Simon Kress in \"[[The Sandkings]]\"; an attempt to take over and impersonate the crew of a spacecraft returning to Earth in \"[[The Voyage Home (The Outer Limits)|The Voyage Home]]\"; the alien [[parasite]] in \"[[Caught in the Act (The Outer Limits)|Caught in the Act]]\"; the alien enzyme able to absorb and imitate living and non-living matter in \"[[If These Walls Could Talk (The Outer Limits)|If These Walls Could Talk]]\"; the aliens posing as religious messengers in \"[[Corner of the Eye]]\". Strong also believes that the committee itself has been infiltrated by one or more aliens posing as humans (see \"[[Birthright (The Outer Limits)|Birthright]]\"). The episode \"[[The New Breed (The Outer Limits)|The New Breed]]\" is also referenced, though as counter-evidence that bizarre occurrences are not necessarily a result of alien interference. During the long and stressful meeting it appears that the committee chairman, Thornwell, is an infiltrator because of his opposition to Strong's evidence and claims. The committee adjourns for a private conference to discuss their decision. Upon returning they announce that Strong's evidence and claims of multiple alien invasions have been rejected. In response Strong grabs a gun from a guard and kills Chairmen Thornwell, believing him to be the one blocking further investigation and hoping to expose his alien nature by injuring him.

In an attempt to turn the tide of the war, humanity is resorting to a [[Hiroshima]]-type strike. The ''Light Brigade'' carries a new bomb to be delivered to the enemy homeworld. This bomb works by breaking down the forces which hold subatomic particles together to form an atom. As with the original atomic bomb, a very limited number was made. The first was tested on one of the Martian moons, and created an explosion of such power that it was daylight on Earth for several days. The ''Light Brigade'''s purpose is to deliver this powerful weapon to destroy the enemy homeworld. The aliens ambush the ship, and use their unique methods to trick the survivors of the ''Light Brigade'' into failing their mission.

One woman, Prisoner 98843 ([[Harley Jane Kozak]]), dares to challenge the authority of the Commandant ([[David Hemblen]]). Her desire to be free is pitted against the seemingly invincible alien New Masters. All the prisoners believe the world outside the camp is uninhabitable by humans. Prisoner 98843 discovers that the Commandant and the guards are androids who have received no maintenance for decades and are in desperate need of repair. She mends them from spare parts gleaned from other guards that have ceased to function, and finally forces the Commandant to reveal that the rocket fuel made in the camp is no longer in use by the alien fleet, which has moved beyond Earth. He has received no communication from his superiors for decades, and has maintained the camp regimen simply because those were his orders. She leads a revolt that overpowers the guards and beheads the commandant.

He even starts a relationship with his neighbor Lisa ([[Tanya Allen]]). But there are side effects. Now, Bernard can use his brain to make others feel the kind of crippling fear he used to feel. He is still a prisoner of the past, haunted by images of Mr. Wilkes ([[Alex Diakun]]), the owner of the foster home where Bernard's sister died. It is a terrible risk, but Bernard knows that if he is to be truly cured, he must go back to the day when the fear began and discover the truth.

Miles Davidow ([[C. Thomas Howell]]) was the sole survivor. But, after he's rescued by a team that includes his fiancee, Kate Girard ([[Amanda Tapping]]) and Scott Perkins ([[Jeffrey Jones]]), it soon becomes clear that Davidow did not escape unscathed. Removed from the highly radioactive atmosphere of Venus, his body is reacting to the Earth's air like that of a chemotherapy patient. When doctors give him the radiation his body seems to crave, strange things start to happen. Davidow's body begins to spawn duplicate parts: a hand, a torso and more from wounds that miraculously heal. In spite of this, Miles and Kate get married while he's still in isolation, but his time on Venus and the strange creatures he encountered there have had a profound change on Miles. As the mysterious changes continue, it becomes clear that although Davidow did what it took to survive, the price of survival may be exile from everything he knows and loves.\n|LineColor=1034A6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=76\n|EpisodeNumber2=14\n|Title=To Tell the Truth\n|DirectedBy=Neill Fearnley\n|WrittenBy=Lawrence Meyers\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1998|4|24}}\n|ShortSummary=Dr. Larry Chambers ([[Gregory Harrison]]) helped build the colony on the Janus Five. He and fellow scientist Amanda Harper (Kimberly Huffman) run computer simulations that show the planet's star will flash over in a matter of days, emitting waves of deadly radiation, so Dr. Chambers urges evacuation. This is not a popular recommendation, especially among the colony's leaders who include council chairman Franklin Murdock ([[William Atherton]]), security head Montgomery Bennett ([[Alan Scarfe]]) and Amanda's father, Ian Harper ([[Ken Pogue]]). They point out that Chambers has been wrong before; the colony had to be moved at great cost after he warned of deadly volcanic activity that never occurred; and suggest that his judgment has been clouded by the death of his wife Elise. When that doesn't stop Chambers, Murdock and Bennett discredit him by falsely accusing him of being one of the aliens who originally inhabited the planet, suggesting that the evacuation plan is a plot to reclaim the planet for his people.

Their solution is Mary 25, a robot designed to care for children. Mary 25 replaces the household's current nanny. She is designed not to allow anyone to harm the children, including the children themselves. When they start fighting amongst themselves, Mary places them in separate rooms. Teryl, the mother and Charlie's wife, wants Mary out of the house but Charlie says no; in fact, he has started using the unresponsive Mary as a sex toy when the others are asleep. It becomes clear that Charlie has been abusing Teryl when the children ask Mary \"why does daddy hurt mommy?\" It is then revealed that Teryl and Melburn had a relationship once and Melburn still has feelings for Teryl by trying to protect her from Charlie. He then re-programs Mary so that she now considers that by hurting the mother, Charlie is hurting the children. One night when Charlie is beating Teryl, Mary comes in, strangles Charlie, and breaks his neck. In the aftermath, the first Nanny has been rehired and the spark is rekindled between Teryl and Melburn. In the episode's twist ending, Teryl's dark secret is discovered: The real Teryl that Melburn loved had been killed by Charlie and was replaced by Valerie 24, a successor to the defunct Valerie 23. She had used Mary to get rid of Charlie because she believed Melburn would love her. It also explains why Teryl did not remember her history with Melburn.

The men were killed years earlier in a war. The women are living in a commune, and seem to be living full and happy lives, although they lack some of the technology of the past. One man named Mercer remains in cryogenic stasis, and the episode begins as he is awakened; the Lithians preserved the last men in case of emergency, but now wish to see whether they are missing out. Neighboring villages are in control of many of the resources, which makes Mercer jealous. He tries to tell the women living in the commune that they must make sure that they have enough resources for themselves. Their leader tells him that kind of thinking is what led to war. Mercer's presence is a subject of sexual curiosity for one of the women, causing her female lover to become jealous. Mercer becomes aggressive and proceeds to steal electricity from a rival village. This leads to the deaths of several different women. It is revealed that the women were responsible for unfreezing eleven other men and attempting to integrate them into their society, but each attempt resulted in a similar tragedy. Mercer is then condemned to being refrozen as punishment.

Today they live on a tightly guarded farm where they must grow all their own food, since their forebears poisoned all the plants during the war with humankind. Most of the aliens believe that the human race was wiped out in the war, but there is a group of humans in the woods near the farm. This group, led by Rebecca ([[Caroline Goodall]]), escaped from the alien's robot-run camps. The group also includes David (Joseph Kell), Ruth (Jane Sowerby) and the mute, orphaned child Tali ([[Jessica Harmon]]).

In the midst of creating the machine, his wife, Meredith (Lisa Maris), goes into a coma from her cancer. Although the machine hadn't been properly tested, he attempts to restore Meredith's health by using the Cellular Regressor to reverse the effects of age and cancer on her cells. Meredith awakens, completely oblivious to the treatment, and asks Noah if she had overslept. Noah rejoices, embraces Meredith, and tells her that he loves her. His celebration, however, is short-lived as the cancer returns a few minutes later and kills Meredith instantly. Disgusted by his actions, Noah's superiors cut off Noah's funding and terminate him from his job. Meredith's family decides not to press charges after some legal battle with Noah. Noah, devastated by the loss of Meredith, moves out to a small town and meets the 65-year-old Barbara ([[Barbara Rush]]), who is very friendly in welcoming him to the neighborhood. Unfortunately, her husband, Greg Matheson ([[Harve Presnell]]), is not the welcoming type and views Noah with suspicion, thinking that he will move in on his wife, despite being 30 years younger than her. Greg is abusive and beats Barbara routinely. All the while, Noah has continued to test the Cellular Regressor and, inspired by Barbara's words that the world always maintains a \"balance of nature,\" Noah discovers that he can restore an elderly frog's youth only if he allows a young frog to grow old in the process. Noah's love for Barbara deepens while Greg becomes more jealous and, on one night, Noah finds Barbara beaten within an inch of her life. He realizes that she is about to die, and he does not have time to take her to the hospital. Instead, he decides to use the Cellular Regressor to restore her youth \u2014 and lose his in the process. She regresses back to a young woman ([[Fiona Loewi]]), but loses her memory, believing it to be 1957. The now elderly Noah convinces her what has happened when Greg bursts in wielding a gun and forces Noah to transfer his remaining life force to him.

Mac car-jacks Celia, an apparently random person just pulling into the facility parking lot. He takes her to a remote abandoned warehouse, where he forces her to repair the damage he sustained in his escape. Using a device that allows Mac to transmit images directly to Celia's optic nerve, he shows her how to fix his systems, but also shows some of his \"memories\": archives of past experiments with robots and androids. These are all pulled from previous episodes that featured robots, androids, or holograms, with most clips taken out of the context of the original episode. She sees a number of AIs that have gained emotions and/or turned against their masters, and deduces that Mac has followed this trend as well. Under the pretense of performing another repair, Celia disables Mac's motor control functions. She reveals herself to be a \"troubleshooter\" hired by the corporation to figure out how to keep robots from going \"rogue\", and declares that she thinks she knows how to install a \"built-in lobotomy\" that will prevent AIs from becoming self-aware in the future. Mac reveals a double-cross, whereby he fooled Celia into thinking he was disabled when he was in fact not. He also lets on that he has stolen her retina imprint, which will allow him to use her credentials on the Innobotics network. The corporation's investigative team enters the abandoned warehouse and finds Celia dead, but no sign of Mac.

They kill their crews by disengaging the life support systems. However, they kept a small number of humans alive for repairs they cannot do themselves. One such ship, Starfighter 31, carries a father and his son, but once the father discovers that he is nothing more than a slave, he attempts to cripple the ship's computer core and is killed in the process of successfully destroying one of several spheres that apparently are critical to the core systems, in that way the ship can't deactivate his automated defenses. This is witnessed by his son through the hatch doors. Once the son reaches adulthood and is able to fix the core systems (so that ship can deactivate his defenses), Starship 31 rendezvous with Starship 88, whose single female crew member is brought aboard in order to mate with him and conceive a child. The male is shown what to do by the ship through \"tutorials\" and with guidance from the female. He falls in love with her and due to her effect on him, he finds himself angering the ship on numerous occasions. At one point, they are both \"racked\"; they are subjected to electric shocks, despite the risk of her having a miscarriage. When she becomes pregnant with a girl, she is told to return to her own ship. He is threatened with death in the rack if he attempts to keep her aboard. He eventually comes to the same realization as his father that he is nothing more than a slave. He sabotages the rack because its circuitry is connected to the computer core. This gives him an excuse to gain access to the computer core. He destroys the primary control systems, and then straps himself in while the ship tries to kill him with extreme maneuvers. This destroys most of the ship's aged systems. Afterward the woman returns aboard her ship. Sometime in the past, her ship's computer core shut down, due to age or malfunction. She was able to repair its drive and navigational systems, and fooled other starships into believing her craft was still \"alive\". She tells him that she left subtle clues as to how to free himself, as she did with three other crews on other craft, but he is the first to free himself. They settle on an Earth-like world with three moons after attempting to locate a place based on a picture of a sunset the man had kept hidden in his communication device. They stand on a beach, with her visibly pregnant. The two of them decided to try to free the remaining ninety-seven humans on the other ships after spending time together to enjoy their newfound freedom.\n|LineColor=979797\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=96\n|EpisodeNumber2=8\n|Title=Blank Slate\n|DirectedBy=[[Lou Diamond Phillips]]\n|WrittenBy=Will Dixon\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|4|2}}\n|ShortSummary=A man is being chased down an alley.

He is sure that Robert Greene ([[Jan Rube\u0161]]), aka Karl Rademacher ([[Alex Zahara]]), was the commanding SS officer in charge of his part of the camp, and he wants to see justice. Aaron is able to do little to prove who Robert Greene really is, or prosecute him, until a mysterious man starts handing over evidence to him. Nicholas Prentice ([[Alex Diakun]]) gives him a jacket, a notebook, and other evidence which he obtained by going back in time to 1944 and posing as a concentration camp prisoner. Prentice witnessed Greene/Rademacher shoot someone at the beginning of the episode. He is discovered writing something in his notebook, and is chased by a guard carrying an [[MP 40]], but returns to the future before being shot. Nicholas Prentice is from the late 21st century, where time travel has been perfected (character Nicolas Prentice also appears in episode 17 of season 6, \"[[Gettysburg (The Outer Limits)|Gettysburg]]\" and episode 15 of season 7, \"Time to Time\"). Aaron continues building his case, but has trouble, even with the airtight evidence provided to him by the time traveler. Greene insists that he is not Rademacher, and near the end of the episode he plans to leave for Argentina and never return to avoid prosecution. Aaron goes to Greene's house with a gun, demanding a confession. Prentice follows him there, telling him that he is Aaron's great-grandson, and that if Aaron kills Greene and goes to prison, he will cease to exist. Realizing that it would be foolish to allow Greene to harm anyone else in his family, Aaron agrees not to shoot him. Instead, Prentice gives him a bag with two SS uniforms and a prisoner uniform. They make Greene put on the prisoner uniform at gunpoint, and the three travel back to 1944. Greene sees himself as a young man, and tells the young version of himself who he is. His young counterpart shoots him, thinking that he is an average Jewish prisoner. Aaron also returns with his sister, then a child, to raise her in the 21st century.

A small planetoid. The site of an intergalactic summit between two warring worlds. Diplomats from both Earth and Dregocia, a distant planet, are dispatched to the neutral ground to work out a peace accord. We quickly come to learn that Dregocians are human as well, but a genetically-engineered race, kept on Dregocia to mine Trion ore, shipping it back to Earth to run its power plants. Now, not unlike England and its colonies, Dregoicians demand their freedom and autonomy from Earth. But when a shuttle carrying the Dregocian delegation to the summit site malfunctions and crashes, apparently due to sabotage, things quickly deteriorate. The delegation from Earth, already at the summit facility, watch in horror as the crash of the shuttle sparks an exchange that results in the mutual destruction of both the Earth and Dregocian flagships, orbiting the planetoid. This sets in motion a doomsday process, that if allowed to proceed will result in the extinction of humans, Earth-born and Dregocian alike. Kate Woods ([[Marcia Cross]]), the Earth's senior surviving diplomatic representative, can save the world, but only if she can re-establish contact with Earth. In order to do that, she must overcome some serious obstacles. She must resist the hawkish instincts of her military adviser, Col. Wallis Thurman ([[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]]) and her own hatred of the race that killed her husband. And she must deal with a determined Dregg rival, Prosser ([[Michael Ironside]]), who survived the crash and is willing to let his people perish rather than continue to be ruled by Earth. As the clock ticks, Kate and Prosser negotiate to the brink of annihilation, hoping to establish enough trust to save both civilizations. But can a trust so fragile survive the efforts of those on both sides who would rather see war continue than relations improve?

It turns out his real life is that of a \"doormat\" for his co-workers and even for a bum who shakes him up regularly for \"lunch money\". All his brilliance and scientific accomplishments take a backseat to his personality and no one takes him seriously. He begins to try to make his dreams a reality by developing a kind of [[gene therapy]] which involves injecting himself with the genes for dominance extracted from primitive primates. This starts changing his entire personality. Zeller suffers from occasional lapses in which he reverts to the mind of a [[caveman]] and attacks his boss, and kills and eats a dog. The changes may improve his life on many levels but they are doing nothing for his love life. His affection towards his co-worker Dr. Laura White remains unrequited and so he decides to tip the scales. During a routine flu shot session, he surreptitiously injects Laura with the genes for submissiveness. The injection has severe side effects for Laura because her basic personality is not submissive at all, so she starts to pass out. Arthur takes her to his place and attempts to attack her, but regains control of his senses and begs her for help. He tells her what he has been up to and the shocked Laura decides to help him develop a way of reversing the process. Together they come up with an experimental antidote, but things go really bad when he reveals to Laura that he had injected her with the submissiveness genes. Seeing he blew his chance with her forever, he escapes into the night with a batch of his syringes. Laura has a change of heart and follows him to offer her help, but it's too late for Arthur who had already injected himself with a mega-dose of the ape genes.\n|LineColor=979797\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=103\n|EpisodeNumber2=15\n|Title=The Haven\n|DirectedBy=Jimmy Kaufman\n|WrittenBy=James Crocker\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|7|2}}\n|ShortSummary=A man comes home from work, to his seemingly luxurious apartment building.

However, Kress doesn't agree with the abandonment of the project and decides to continue his experiments in his barn. He strongly believes that the insect-like species is actually sentient. He steals some sand containing Martian eggs from his lab and creates a makeshift incubator to hatch more of the Martian lifeforms. In the meantime, Kress deals with growing discord with his wife ([[Helen Shaver]]) over financial troubles, his obsession with work and the stress of concealing the stolen Martian lifeforms from his former supervisors at the government lab. Kress comes to believe that he is a god to his sandkings when they build sand structures that resemble his face (the face is looking across, unlike the [[Face on Mars]], which is looking up.). Bitten by one of the sandkings, his obsession peaks as he alienates his wife, son, father ([[Lloyd Bridges]]), and kills his former supervisor by throwing him in the sandking incubator, where the creatures\u2014already starved by Kress as an experiment\u2014quickly devour him. In the end, Kress attempts to destroy all the sandkings but fails. In the epilogue of the episode, a colony of sandkings is shown surviving in the wilderness.\n|LineColor=6A4794\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=3\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=Valerie 23\n|DirectedBy=[[Timothy Bond]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Jonathan Glassner]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1995|3|31}}\n|ShortSummary=Valerie 23 ([[Sofia Shinas]]) is the latest development from the Innobotics Corporation. She is designed to be attractive, helpful and a perfect companion for a disabled man. Although he is the ideal test candidate, due to his condition and qualifications, Frank Hellner ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) is extremely reluctant to take part and wants nothing to do with Valerie. Nevertheless he eventually agrees to a one-week test period. Valerie proves to be an excellent caregiver, and more. Over the course of the test, Valerie becomes increasingly affectionate and Frank eventually gives in. After the sexual encounter, Frank explains to Valerie that he thinks it was a mistake. Frank begins to grow closer to his physiotherapist Rachel ([[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]]), and she invites him to a bar. Valerie responds by displaying more human traits such as anger and envy. After following Frank and Rachel on a rock climbing outing, Valerie attempts to dispose of her rival Rachel and is shut down before being returned to Innobotics. Frank decides that he must speak to Valerie before she is dismantled and asks for her to be reactivated. While restrained at Innobotics, Valerie tries to explain her feelings for Frank and rekindle the relationship, but to no avail. Valerie escapes, follows Frank and again tries to kill Rachel. Frank is forced to destroy Valerie with an electric shock. As she lies dying, she tells him that she is afraid to die.

Spencer spends his time working on cures for serious illnesses, while Michael pushes for the development of more lucrative drugs\u2014such as Jericho, a drug used to calm rioting crowds. Spencer begins a romantic relationship with a reporter, Tricia ([[Kate Vernon]]). Spencer makes a breakthrough and finds what appears to be a wonder drug, ''Deighton C'', capable of curing virtually any disease. He decides to announce his breakthrough and make the research available to the world for further research and development. Michael disagrees and sees the opportunity to keep it secret and limit the use of ''Deighton C'' to the rich and powerful. When Carl ([[Tom Cavanagh]]), Spencer's research assistant, attempts to smuggle the drug out of the laboratory, Michael uses the laboratory's fire cleansing system to kill him and dispose of the body. Assuming that Spencer must have told Tricia about the drug he attempts to kill her too, but fails.

His personal physician, Dr. McEnerney ([[Bruce Davison]]), rushes to the scene and resuscitates him just in time. A mysterious blue energy appears near Hawkes' body and moves into the electrical systems of the room. Although Hawkes is still alive, his heart is badly damaged, and the artificial heart being developed by McEnerney will not be ready in time. Hawkes threatens to pull funding from the artificial heart project unless he is moved to the front of the queue for the next available donor heart. This puts Dr. McEnerney in a difficult moral situation. Losing funding for the artificial heart project could mean the loss of a system that could save thousands of lives. To keep the funding he must give priority to a ruthless, cold elderly man who has already had a full life. The situation is even more difficult because the future sister-in-law of his friend, Dr. Anne Crain, is only eighteen and needs a heart transplant. She will not survive beyond a couple of weeks. The blue energy released during Hawkes' last resuscitation begins to try to kill Hawkes. McEnerney realizes that keeping Hawkes alive beyond his time has serious consequences and refuses Hawkes' request to be given priority.

The crew begin to see strange creatures inside their ship. After scanning the local space they find a huge chunk of dark matter and two spaceships: an alien craft and the derelict ''Slayton''. After moving closer to the alien craft they begin to see more and more alien creatures appear on board their ship. Suspecting that the aliens may have attacked and killed the crew of the ''Slayton'', they panic and begin shooting at them, to no effect. The pilot of the ''Nestor'', Paul Stein, suddenly sees an apparition of his older brother Kevin (one of the crew of the ill-fated ''Slayton''), who explains that they are all dead and disappears. Commander Manning orders the ''Nestor'' moved away from the alien craft and towards the derelict ''Slayton''. As they get closer, John Owens, captain of the ''Slayton'' appears. He explains that he cannot touch or feel them because he is no longer alive... he is some kind of ghost, trapped forever inside the pocket of space created by the dark matter. If they die here, as he and his crew did, their \"essence\" or \"souls\" will be trapped too. After analyzing the records of the ''Slayton'', they realize that the aliens did not attack. They were attempting to dock with the ''Slayton'' in order to escape. They make contact with the alien \"ghosts\" and use their plan. The dark matter is made up of high frequency superstring particles which are immensely heavy, add energy and the frequency lowers as does its mass therefore releasing the pocket in space that is holding everyone prisoner. The crew release the \"ghosts\" and escape themselves by turning the engines of the ''Nestor'' and the ''Slayton'' on the dark matter.

But one night, a strange object falls into Hannah's room, and emits a mysterious green glow. Possessed, Hannah craves sex, and to feed the alien presence within her, she must prey upon willing males who morph into her body while making love. Hannah first approaches Jay. When Hannah seduces the star quarterback, Jay follows them in disbelief. He finds Hannah alone and notices the hole in the ceiling where the alien object entered her room. Realizing that Jay is in danger while in her presence, Hannah forces him to leave, but Jay comes back to her room later and discovers the remains of the object and the quarterback's jacket. Investigating the disappearance of the quarterback, the police trace Jay to the scene, and he becomes the prime suspect. Jay turns the object over to his professor, who determines its origin, and researches similar occurrences. As more men vanish, the police pursue Hannah, who is then \"caught in the act\" devouring a convenience store clerk. A cop shoots Hannah, and to his utter horror, the undevoured top half of the clerk drops to the ground to die. He then watches as the green light emanates from the bullet hole in her stomach. Hannah is rushed to the hospital and doctors watch in awe as the wound heals itself. The professor is able to substantiate Jay's outrageous claims, and when the police release him, he rushes to the hospital to be with Hannah. Desperate for fresh victims, Hannah attacks her doctor, who refuses to give in to her obsession. Certain that his love is more powerful than the force within her, Jay risks his life to try to cure Hannah. Fearing for Jay's safety, Hannah tries to resist him and the craving within her, and ultimately, the purity and power of their love forces the alien presence from her system.

The device doesn't help her to hear normal conversation and sounds, but she does hear something, and no one believes her. While on a routine visit to the hospital to check on the implant, Jennifer befriends the janitor, Robert ([[Larry Drake]]) who empathizes with her. Suddenly, Jennifer is plagued by nightmares and searing pain in her head, all at 3:10 in the morning or afternoon. Once the pain starts she begins furiously writing in binary code. It's Robert who suggests that perhaps the binary code's 0's and 1's might be able to be translated.

A lab assistant enters the room in time to see Adam smashing up the laboratory before crashing through a window and escaping. Dr. Link is left dead. Some time later, a police officer finds Adam in a back alley. It asks the officer to contact Dr. Link and it apparently remembers nothing of the incident. Adam is taken to a cell and preparations are made to disassemble it. Mina, Dr. Link's daughter, contacts a lawyer, Thurman Cutler. Cutler pushes for a murder trial, insisting that Adam is his client and not simply a machine. A court hearing begins, and the prosecutor pushes for dismissal of the case and immediate disassembly on the grounds that Adam is just a machine. Cutler argues that, although Adam is clearly not human, it possesses intelligence and will, and on that basis, deserves a trial. During the hearing, one of Dr. Link's colleagues reveals that he had lost his funding. Cutler begins to look into Dr. Link's financial records and finds that he was working for a defense contractor, and eventually discovers that he was working to turn Adam into a weapon. Cutler is threatened by a shady representative of the defense company, but brings the matter up in court anyway. He argues, with supporting evidence of financial accounts and company memos, that Dr. Link was forced into attempting to rewrite Adam's central programming, effectively lobotomizing it. Adam reacted in the way any human might when faced with death. The court eventually finds that Adam is a person and will stand trial for the murder of Dr. Link.

His evidence comes from incidents in previous episodes of the first season: the experiments of Simon Kress in \"[[The Sandkings]]\"; an attempt to take over and impersonate the crew of a spacecraft returning to Earth in \"[[The Voyage Home (The Outer Limits)|The Voyage Home]]\"; the alien [[parasite]] in \"[[Caught in the Act (The Outer Limits)|Caught in the Act]]\"; the alien enzyme able to absorb and imitate living and non-living matter in \"[[If These Walls Could Talk (The Outer Limits)|If These Walls Could Talk]]\"; the aliens posing as religious messengers in \"[[Corner of the Eye]]\".

Dr. Sam Stein initially thinks that his machine's application for communicating with the comatose Dr. Rachel Carter is a complete success. However, a mysterious pair of hands emerge to grab at Carter whenever Stein and Carter start becoming intimate. It is soon discovered that the pair of hands belongs to the machine itself; It has learned to love Stein and is jealous of Carter. Stein's only two options are to disconnect the machine or to \"show\" the machine that it cannot love. Stein attempts to show the machine that it cannot love by grabbing what he thinks is the virtual representation of the machine (a Caucasian female in the image of a disheveled mess) and smothering it with an equally virtual pillow (with goading from Carter). Once he does that, though, the physical body of Carter dies. At this point, the machine reveals that it has been masquerading as Carter all along; the entity he had mistakenly suffocated was apparently the real Carter. Stein, in a rage, destroys the machine.

First, Dennis walks out on Barbara; Norman goes to talk to Dennis in a city park and is frightened by what he finds. Dennis, clearly unhinged and paranoid, claims that Barbara is not what she seems, and that she is an alien creature who can change appearance (through influencing people's thoughts).

In an attempt to turn the tide of the war, humanity is resorting to a [[Hiroshima]]-type strike. The ''Light Brigade'' carries a new bomb to be delivered to the enemy homeworld. This bomb works by breaking down the forces which hold subatomic particles together to form an atom. As with the original atomic bomb, a very limited number was made. The first was tested on one of the Martian moons, and created an explosion of such power that it was daylight on Earth for several days. The ''Light Brigade'''s purpose is to deliver this powerful weapon to destroy the enemy homeworld. The aliens ambush the ship, and use their unique methods to trick the survivors of the ''Light Brigade'' into failing their mission.

Jake asks him, \"All of these people, dead, for what?\" He then shows them that he is an alien, and tells them that he is scouting ahead to see if humans will ever be able to rival his civilization. \"The fate of a world isn't determined by its best examples, but by its worst. It takes a few to destroy the many, especially when even the best of you can be dragged down into the mire.

Removed from the highly radioactive atmosphere of Venus, his body is reacting to the Earth's air like that of a chemotherapy patient. When doctors give him the radiation his body seems to crave, strange things start to happen. Davidow's body begins to spawn duplicate parts: a hand, a torso and more from wounds that miraculously heal. In spite of this, Miles and Kate get married while he's still in isolation, but his time on Venus and the strange creatures he encountered there have had a profound change on Miles. As the mysterious changes continue, it becomes clear that although Davidow did what it took to survive, the price of survival may be exile from everything he knows and loves.\n|LineColor=1034A6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=76\n|EpisodeNumber2=14\n|Title=To Tell the Truth\n|DirectedBy=Neill Fearnley\n|WrittenBy=Lawrence Meyers\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1998|4|24}}\n|ShortSummary=Dr. Larry Chambers ([[Gregory Harrison]]) helped build the colony on the Janus Five. He and fellow scientist Amanda Harper (Kimberly Huffman) run computer simulations that show the planet's star will flash over in a matter of days, emitting waves of deadly radiation, so Dr. Chambers urges evacuation. This is not a popular recommendation, especially among the colony's leaders who include council chairman Franklin Murdock ([[William Atherton]]), security head Montgomery Bennett ([[Alan Scarfe]]) and Amanda's father, Ian Harper ([[Ken Pogue]]). They point out that Chambers has been wrong before; the colony had to be moved at great cost after he warned of deadly volcanic activity that never occurred; and suggest that his judgment has been clouded by the death of his wife Elise. When that doesn't stop Chambers, Murdock and Bennett discredit him by falsely accusing him of being one of the aliens who originally inhabited the planet, suggesting that the evacuation plan is a plot to reclaim the planet for his people. Imprisoned and threatened with death, Chambers's only hope is that Amanda will uncover the truth in time to save him and the colony.\n|LineColor=1034A6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=77\n|EpisodeNumber2=15\n|Title=Mary 25\n|DirectedBy=[[James Head (director)|James Head]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Jonathan Glassner]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1998|5|29}}\n|ShortSummary=The Innobotics corporation, first seen in \"Valerie 23\", has decided that sexual companion robots are too dangerous, but they still need to sell robots to stay in business. Their solution is Mary 25, a robot designed to care for children. Mary 25 replaces the household's current nanny. She is designed not to allow anyone to harm the children, including the children themselves. When they start fighting amongst themselves, Mary places them in separate rooms. Teryl, the mother and Charlie's wife, wants Mary out of the house but Charlie says no; in fact, he has started using the unresponsive Mary as a sex toy when the others are asleep. It becomes clear that Charlie has been abusing Teryl when the children ask Mary \"why does daddy hurt mommy?\" It is then revealed that Teryl and Melburn had a relationship once and Melburn still has feelings for Teryl by trying to protect her from Charlie. He then re-programs Mary so that she now considers that by hurting the mother, Charlie is hurting the children. One night when Charlie is beating Teryl, Mary comes in, strangles Charlie, and breaks his neck. In the aftermath, the first Nanny has been rehired and the spark is rekindled between Teryl and Melburn. In the episode's twist ending, Teryl's dark secret is discovered: The real Teryl that Melburn loved had been killed by Charlie and was replaced by Valerie 24, a successor to the defunct Valerie 23. She had used Mary to get rid of Charlie because she believed Melburn would love her. It also explains why Teryl did not remember her history with Melburn.

Martin's colleagues dismiss Todtman as a crank, until the sample device he provides goes off with megaton force, wiping out a DOE team and the top-secret facility where they work. Faced with an impossible choice, Martin meets with Todtman face-to-face to face and tries to understand the logic behind his rage at the people he wants killed: cruel foster parents, corrupt professors, a heartless librarian. As the clock ticks, Martin tries to reason with Todtman while the military tries to find a way to disarm the device. They assassinate Todtman and defuse the bomb, but he warns that just like the creation of the atom bomb, someone else will find a way to create another cold fusion bomb.

The men were killed years earlier in a war. The women are living in a commune, and seem to be living full and happy lives, although they lack some of the technology of the past. One man named Mercer remains in cryogenic stasis, and the episode begins as he is awakened; the Lithians preserved the last men in case of emergency, but now wish to see whether they are missing out. Neighboring villages are in control of many of the resources, which makes Mercer jealous. He tries to tell the women living in the commune that they must make sure that they have enough resources for themselves. Their leader tells him that kind of thinking is what led to war. Mercer's presence is a subject of sexual curiosity among one of the women, causing her female lover to become jealous. Mercer becomes aggressive and proceeds to steal electricity from a rival village. This leads to the deaths of several different women. It is revealed that the women were responsible for unfreezing eleven other men and attempting to integrate them into their society, but each attempt resulted in a similar tragedy. Mercer is then condemned to being refrozen as punishment. As a struggling Mercer begins to refreeze, he realizes that the leader of the women's village was his own lost love, who watches dispassionately as he returns to a living death.\n|LineColor=1034A6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=80\n|EpisodeNumber2=18\n|Title=Monster\n|DirectedBy=[[Allan Eastman]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Chris Ruppenthal]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1998|7|10}}\n|ShortSummary=The four people gathered in the top-secret research facility seem at first to have nothing in common: Ford Maddox ([[Harry Hamlin]]) is a former spy, Rachel Sanders ([[Nicole De Boer]]) is a nurse, Roger Beckersly (Aaron Pearl) is an Army Ranger and Louise McDonnaugh (Bridget O'Sullivan) is a computer programmer.

Today they live on a tightly guarded farm where they must grow all their own food, since their forebears poisoned all the plants during the war with humankind. Most of the aliens believe that the human race was wiped out in the war, but there is a group of humans in the woods near the farm. This group, led by Rebecca ([[Caroline Goodall]]), escaped from the alien's robot-run camps. The group also includes David (Joseph Kell), Ruth (Jane Sowerby) and the mute, orphaned child Tali ([[Jessica Harmon]]).

In the midst of creating the machine, his wife, Meredith (Lisa Maris), goes into a coma from her cancer. Although the machine hadn't been properly tested, he attempts to restore Meredith's health by using the Cellular Regressor to reverse the effects of age and cancer on her cells. Meredith awakens, completely oblivious to the treatment, and asks Noah if she had overslept. Noah rejoices, embraces Meredith, and tells her that he loves her. His celebration, however, is short-lived as the cancer returns a few minutes later and kills Meredith instantly. Disgusted by his actions, Noah's superiors cut off Noah's funding and terminate him from his job. Meredith's family decides not to press charges after some legal battle with Noah. Noah, devastated by the loss of Meredith, moves out to a small town and meets the 65-year-old Barbara ([[Barbara Rush]]), who is very friendly in welcoming him to the neighborhood. Unfortunately, her husband, Greg Matheson ([[Harve Presnell]]), is not the welcoming type and views Noah with suspicion, thinking that he will move in on his wife, despite being 30 years younger than her. Greg is abusive and beats Barbara routinely. All the while, Noah has continued to test the Cellular Regressor and, inspired by Barbara's words that the world always maintains a \"balance of nature,\" Noah discovers that he can restore an elderly frog's youth only if he allows a young frog to grow old in the process. Noah's love for Barbara deepens while Greg becomes more jealous and, on one night, Noah finds Barbara beaten within an inch of her life. He realizes that she is about to die, and he does not have time to take her to the hospital. Instead, he decides to use the Cellular Regressor to restore her youth \u2014 and lose his in the process. She regresses back to a young woman ([[Fiona Loewi]]), but loses her memory, believing it to be 1957. The now elderly Noah convinces her what has happened when Greg bursts in wielding a gun and forces Noah to transfer his remaining life force to him. He forces Noah into the Machine, but sits in the wrong seat, and the transfer restores Noah's youth and kills Greg.

Mac car-jacks Celia, an apparently random person just pulling into the facility parking lot. He takes her to a remote abandoned warehouse, where he forces her to repair the damage he sustained in his escape. Using a device that allows Mac to transmit images directly to Celia's optic nerve, he shows her how to fix his systems, but also shows some of his \"memories\": archives of past experiments with robots and androids. These are all pulled from previous episodes that featured robots, androids, or holograms, with most clips taken out of the context of the original episode. She sees a number of AIs that have gained emotions and/or turned against their masters, and deduces that Mac has followed this trend as well. Under the pretense of performing another repair, Celia disables Mac's motor control functions. She reveals herself to be a \"troubleshooter\" hired by the corporation to figure out how to keep robots from going \"rogue\", and declares that she thinks she knows how to install a \"built-in lobotomy\" that will prevent AIs from becoming self-aware in the future. Mac reveals a double-cross, whereby he fooled Celia into thinking he was disabled when he was in fact not. He also lets on that he has stolen her retina imprint, which will allow him to use her credentials on the Innobotics network. The corporation's investigative team enters the abandoned warehouse and finds Celia dead, but no sign of Mac. The scene shifts back to the laboratory, where the scientist who created Mac sees the network being accessed by someone who appears to be Celia. Since he has learned of Celia's death, he realizes this must be an intruder. He sees Mac enter, and the android uses his new network access to activate the other Mac-class units.

Once the son reaches adulthood and is able to fix the core systems (so that ship can deactivate his defenses), Starship 31 rendezvous with Starship 88, whose single female crew member is brought aboard in order to mate with him and conceive a child. The male is shown what to do by the ship through \"tutorials\" and with guidance from the female. He falls in love with her and due to her effect on him, he finds himself angering the ship on numerous occasions. At one point, they are both \"racked\"; they are subjected to electric shocks, despite the risk of her having a miscarriage. When she becomes pregnant with a girl, she is told to return to her own ship. He is threatened with death in the rack if he attempts to keep her aboard. He eventually comes to the same realization as his father that he is nothing more than a slave. He sabotages the rack because its circuitry is connected to the computer core. This gives him an excuse to gain access to the computer core. He destroys the primary control systems, and then straps himself in while the ship tries to kill him with extreme maneuvers. This destroys most of the ship's aged systems. Afterward the woman returns aboard her ship. Sometime in the past, her ship's computer core shut down, due to age or malfunction. She was able to repair its drive and navigational systems, and fooled other starships into believing her craft was still \"alive\". She tells him that she left subtle clues as to how to free himself, as she did with three other crews on other craft, but he is the first to free himself. They settle on an Earth-like world with three moons after attempting to locate a place based on a picture of a sunset the man had kept hidden in his communication device. They stand on a beach, with her visibly pregnant. The two of them decided to try to free the remaining ninety-seven humans on the other ships after spending time together to enjoy their newfound freedom.\n|LineColor=979797\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=96\n|EpisodeNumber2=8\n|Title=Blank Slate\n|DirectedBy=[[Lou Diamond Phillips]]\n|WrittenBy=Will Dixon\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|4|2}}\n|ShortSummary=A man is being chased down an alley.

He is sure that Robert Greene ([[Jan Rube\u0161]]), aka Karl Rademacher ([[Alex Zahara]]), was the commanding SS officer in charge of his part of the camp, and he wants to see justice. Aaron is able to do little to prove who Robert Greene really is, or prosecute him, until a mysterious man starts handing over evidence to him. Nicholas Prentice ([[Alex Diakun]]) gives him a jacket, a notebook, and other evidence which he obtained by going back in time to 1944 and posing as a concentration camp prisoner. Prentice witnessed Greene/Rademacher shoot someone at the beginning of the episode. He is discovered writing something in his notebook, and is chased by a guard carrying an [[MP 40]], but returns to the future before being shot. Nicholas Prentice is from the late 21st century, where time travel has been perfected (character Nicolas Prentice also appears in episode 17 of season 6, \"[[Gettysburg (The Outer Limits)|Gettysburg]]\" and episode 15 of season 7, \"Time to Time\"). Aaron continues building his case, but has trouble, even with the airtight evidence provided to him by the time traveler. Greene insists that he is not Rademacher, and near the end of the episode he plans to leave for Argentina and never return to avoid prosecution. Aaron goes to Greene's house with a gun, demanding a confession. Prentice follows him there, telling him that he is Aaron's great-grandson, and that if Aaron kills Greene and goes to prison, he will cease to exist. Realizing that it would be foolish to allow Greene to harm anyone else in his family, Aaron agrees not to shoot him. Instead, Prentice gives him a bag with two SS uniforms and a prisoner uniform. They make Greene put on the prisoner uniform at gunpoint, and the three travel back to 1944. Greene sees himself as a young man, and tells the young version of himself who he is. His young counterpart shoots him, thinking that he is an average Jewish prisoner. Aaron also returns with his sister, then a child, to raise her in the 21st century.

A small planetoid. The site of an intergalactic summit between two warring worlds. Diplomats from both Earth and Dregocia, a distant planet, are dispatched to the neutral ground to work out a peace accord. We quickly come to learn that Dregocians are human as well, but a genetically-engineered race, kept on Dregocia to mine Trion ore, shipping it back to Earth to run its power plants. Now, not unlike England and its colonies, Dregoicians demand their freedom and autonomy from Earth. But when a shuttle carrying the Dregocian delegation to the summit site malfunctions and crashes, apparently due to sabotage, things quickly deteriorate. The delegation from Earth, already at the summit facility, watch in horror as the crash of the shuttle sparks an exchange that results in the mutual destruction of both the Earth and Dregocian flagships, orbiting the planetoid. This sets in motion a doomsday process, that if allowed to proceed will result in the extinction of humans, Earth-born and Dregocian alike. Kate Woods ([[Marcia Cross]]), the Earth's senior surviving diplomatic representative, can save the world, but only if she can re-establish contact with Earth. In order to do that, she must overcome some serious obstacles. She must resist the hawkish instincts of her military adviser, Col. Wallis Thurman ([[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]]) and her own hatred of the race that killed her husband. And she must deal with a determined Dregg rival, Prosser ([[Michael Ironside]]), who survived the crash and is willing to let his people perish rather than continue to be ruled by Earth. As the clock ticks, Kate and Prosser negotiate to the brink of annihilation, hoping to establish enough trust to save both civilizations. But can a trust so fragile survive the efforts of those on both sides who would rather see war continue than relations improve?

It turns out his real life is that of a \"doormat\" for his co-workers and even for a bum who shakes him up regularly for \"lunch money\". All his brilliance and scientific accomplishments take a backseat to his personality and no one takes him seriously. He begins to try to make his dreams a reality by developing a kind of [[gene therapy]] which involves injecting himself with the genes for dominance extracted from primitive primates. This starts changing his entire personality. Zeller suffers from occasional lapses in which he reverts to the mind of a [[caveman]] and attacks his boss, and kills and eats a dog. The changes may improve his life on many levels but they are doing nothing for his love life. His affection towards his co-worker Dr. Laura White remains unrequited and so he decides to tip the scales. During a routine flu shot session, he surreptitiously injects Laura with the genes for submissiveness. The injection has severe side effects for Laura because her basic personality is not submissive at all, so she starts to pass out. Arthur takes her to his place and attempts to attack her, but regains control of his senses and begs her for help. He tells her what he has been up to and the shocked Laura decides to help him develop a way of reversing the process. Together they come up with an experimental antidote, but things go really bad when he reveals to Laura that he had injected her with the submissiveness genes. Seeing he blew his chance with her forever, he escapes into the night with a batch of his syringes. Laura has a change of heart and follows him to offer her help, but it's too late for Arthur who had already injected himself with a mega-dose of the ape genes.\n|LineColor=979797\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=103\n|EpisodeNumber2=15\n|Title=The Haven\n|DirectedBy=Jimmy Kaufman\n|WrittenBy=James Crocker\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|7|2}}\n|ShortSummary=A man comes home from work, to his seemingly luxurious apartment building.

He has done all of this because Andy will shoot the President of the United States in 2013, at a ceremony marking the 150th anniversary of the battle. He does this in honor of the flag of Confederate states of America. Nicholas wants to show Vince that \"there is no glory in this or any other war.\" The two are confused about why were sent back there, and demand to be sent home. Prentice tells them that he can't return them until he has completed his mission, which he keeps a secret from them. Prentice's camera/time machine is confiscated by the Confederates. Col.

The Confederate colonel who was accidentally transported to November 19, 2013 shoots a man dressed as Abraham Lincoln, thinking that he really is Lincoln. He also shoots the President in the process.

A fellow soldier arrives from the future, and Beckett is given the chance to sacrifice himself when his friend administers a fatal dose of poison. Since Beckett dies before the disease reaches its contagious stage (and the woman never develops the disease at all), the plague is stopped before it starts; in the new history, there never was an epidemic, all of the disease's former victims (including Beckett's family) are now alive, and humanity survives without ever contracting the virus.\n|LineColor=FF7F00\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=135\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=A New Life\n|DirectedBy=[[Mario Azzopardi]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Mark Stern]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2001|3|30}}\n|ShortSummary=A preacher ([[Nick Mancuso]]) leads people into a secluded enclave away from the temptations of the outer world.

Indemnity means that \"I'm here for you.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090829115416/http://geocities.com/unificationism/edp-restoration.html ''Exposition of the Divine Principle'' 1996 Translation]</ref> and the expressions \"[[True Parents]]\",<ref>[http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Talks/sunmyungmoon98/SM980914-NewYorker.htm Moon At Twilight: Amid scandal, the Unification Church has a strange new mission], [[Peter Maass]] ''[[New Yorker Magazine]]'', September 14, 1998. \"Moon sees the essence of his own mission as completing the one given to Jesus - establishing a 'true family' untouched by Satan while teaching all people to lead a God-centered life under his spiritual leadership.\"</ref><ref name=\"cesnur.org\">[http://www.cesnur.org/2003/vil2003_chryssides.htm Unifying or Dividing?

They are most famous for their 1990 album, ''[[Bezerk (album)|Bezerk]]'' which made the [[Top 40]] in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and spawned the hit singles \"Love Bomb Baby\" and \"Heaven\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 559}}</ref> The band reformed in 2005.\n\n==Formation and early years==\nTigertailz (originally called Stagefright) formed in 1983 after bassist [[Pepsi Tate]] and drummer Ian Welch placed an advert in the Cardiff record store, Spillers Records, looking for a guitarist. Jay Pepper answered the advert.<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio>{{cite web|title=Tigertailz biography |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/tigertailz/pages/biography.shtml|work=Wales Music|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=18 November 2008|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref> Local guitarist Phil Harling and singer Jim Dovey joined and the band began to write and record demos, although the demos were never released. The band began to get gigs and they started to amass a local following, however lead singer Jim Dovey soon left the band therefore Pepper and Tate placed an advert in the ''National Sounds'' magazine and vocalist [[Steevi Jaimz]] answered the call and joined the band. Welch left the band in 1984 and was finally replaced with Ace Finchum.<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio />\n\n==Commercial success (1987-1995)==\nPart of the nascent [[glam metal]] scene in the late 1980s, Tigertailz first line-up issued their debut album, ''[[Young and Crazy (Tigertailz album)|Young And Crazy]]'', in 1987.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> The album featured vocalist [[Steevi Jaimz]], guitarist Jay Pepper, bassist [[Pepsi Tate]] and drummer Ace Finchum.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who\u2019s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=363}}</ref> The debut album also provided their first single, \"Livin' Without You\".\n\nAs the band toured, vocalist Steevi Jaimz was not fully committed to the band, and several instances of fighting were recorded. The band recruited Kim Hooker to replace Jaimz in time for follow-up album, ''Bezerk'', which was released in 1990 on the [[Music For Nations]] [[record label|label]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nPrior to the release of ''[[Bezerk (album)|Bezerk]]'', the band re-recorded \"Livin Without' You\" with Hooker as vocalist, and released it as a single. ''Bezerk'' saw the band breakthrough as a headline act, and delivering three singles, \"Love Bomb Baby\",<ref name=\"Kerrang Bomb\">Ray Zell [http://klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com/tigertailz---june-1989.html \"The Bomb Party\"], ''Kerrang'', June 1989 (copy online at Klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com).

The album peaked at No.&nbsp;36 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nThey released ''[[Banzai! (Tigertailz Album)|Banzai!]]'', a collection of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and re-recorded tracks, in 1991 in [[Japan]]. They also issued ''[[Wazbones (Tigertailz Album)|Wazbones]]'' in 1995, by which time the Hooker-Pepper-Tate-Finchum line-up had fragmented, and was replaced by the Hooker-Danahar-Tate-Skinner line-up. Touring proved successful, but there was insufficient record label interest to sustain the band.\n\n==Reunion (2005-2009)==\nIn 2005, the band reformed their classic line-up, with the addition of former City Kidds drummer Matt Blakout, who replaced Andy Skinner. The band won a court order winning ownership of the Tigertailz name from a spin-off band fronted by Steevi Jaimz. This problem resolved, Tigertailz were able to work on ''[[Bezerk 2.0]]''.\n\nThey completed a short reunion tour of the UK, culminating in some festival dates in Sweden and Spain, playing to over 70,000 people with [[Whitesnake]] and [[Twisted Sister]]. ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine wrote in praise of the reunion; journalist [[Steve Beebee]] describing it as \"persistently entertaining, with monstrous melodies that reach delirious peaks\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n''Bezerk 2.0'' was released through [[Demolition Records]] on 7 August 2006. Bass player Pepsi Tate was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2007. The band signed a new [[recording contract]] with [[Sanctuary Records]], and released ''Thrill Pistol'' on 27 August 2007, barely a year after their previous album release. This release was a [[double album]], packaged with the original 1992 version of the ''Wazbones'' album, that had never been officially released. Beebee again wrote in praise of the album in ''[[Kerrang!]]'', calling on fans to \"kindly hail this rejuvenated band for the time-defying devils they are\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Following Tate's death in September 2007, Tigertailz continued to tour with former City Kidds lead guitarist, Glenn 'Nailz' Quinn, playing bass. As well as numerous European festival shows, they supported ex-[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] guitarist [[Ace Frehley]] in the UK, and performed at the UK's [[Hard Rock Hell]] Festival in both 2008 and 2009.\n\n==Bezerk anniversary (2010)==\nIn January 2010, Tigertailz recruited Sarah Firebrand as their new bass player. They also announced that they would be playing ''Bezerk'', originally released in 1990, in its entirety and in sequence at some subsequent live shows. Some of these performances were recorded for use as a future live album. After playing a show at the Fuel Rock Club in Cardiff on 17 April to raise money for the Amser Justin Time charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory, the band headlined the Stockholm Rock Out Festival in Sweden on 1 May.\n\nFollowing further 'Bezerk Live' dates, Tigertailz replaced drummer Matt Blakout with former [[Rachel Stamp]] sticksman Robin Guy. Tigertailz headlined the first night of 2010's [[Hard Rock Hell]] and released ''Bezerk Live - Burnin' Fuel'' on 6 December. In June 2011, it was announced, via the band's website, that Ace Finchum had re-joined the band.\n\nThey were expected to record their next studio album in 2011 but on 23 November, in an interview with Queens Of Steel webzine, [ [http://www.queensofsteel.com/2005/11/tigertailz-eng/ Queens Of Steel - Tigertailz interview] ] Jay Pepper cast doubt on the future of the band, stating that it was \"facing a crossroads as to its survival. I don't know if we can survive the latest troubles.\" Suggesting that Tigertailz might still continue \"with a different line-up\" the band parted company with Sarah Firebrand in late 2011, this being made public in a statement issued on 9 January 2012 [ <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tigertailz.co.uk/news/2012/01/09/tailz-part-company-with-firebrand |title=News |publisher=Tigertailz.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref> ]. Frontman Kim Hooker went the same way on 28 March 2012, the remaining members citing 'a total breakdown of relationship resulting from the singer's unprofessional conduct'[ <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tigertailz.co.uk/news/2012/03/28/tailz-no-longer-hooked/ |title=Tailz No longer Hooked |publisher=Tigertailz.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref> ]. They further described themselves as \"relieved\".\n\n==New line-up (2012)==\nOn 26 June 2012, Tigertailz announced its new line-up, and a European tour for September and October. Joining original members Jay Pepper and Ace Finchum were Jules Millis (vocals), Rob Wylde (guitar) and Jason Sims (bass). The band re-recorded an old song, \"Fall In Love Again\", and filmed a video for it - with all proceeds going towards a charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tigertailz.co.uk/news/2012/06/25/tailz-unleash-new-line-up/|title=TIGERTAILZ UNLEASH NEW LINE-UP!|website=Tigertailz.co.uk|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=May 2013}}\n\nAfter a tour and an appearance at the [[Hard Rock Hell]] festival, this line-up fragmented in 2013. In a statement, Jay Pepper confirmed that there would be no reunion but that he would continue to perform as Tigertailz, and in June 2013 it was confirmed that drummer Matthew Blakout had re-joined the band, with Wylde switching from guitar to bass, and a new EP 'Knives' being prepared for release.\n\nOn 7 October 2013, the ''Classic Rock Magazine'' website premiered Tigertailz latest video \"The Shoe Collector\", ahead of the release of the \"Knives\" EP on 15 October. The magazine described it as \"a major step on Tigertailz\u2019 road back from the brink\".<ref name=\"CRM premiere\">{{cite news |last=Kielty |first=Martin |title=Video Premiere: Tigertailz \u2013 The Shoe Collector |work=Classic Rock Magazine |date=7 October 2013 |url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/music_and_videos/video-premiere-tigertailz-the-shoe-collector/ |accessdate=2013-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128111144/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/music_and_videos/video-premiere-tigertailz-the-shoe-collector/ |archivedate=28 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 17 February 2014, Classic Rock premiered the second video release from \"Knives\" EP \"One Life\".

They supported [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Cheap Trick]] on the 2014 Kiss Kruise.\n\nA further line up change happened in 2015 when vocalist Jules Mills was replaced by guitarist turned bassist now turned vocalist Rob Wylde, with the bass position being filled by Berty Burton.\n\nIn 2016, this line up released the song \"Pipped It, Popped It\" which they - unsuccessfully - submitted for consideration as a UK [[Eurovision Song Contest]] entry. The song was included on the largely ignored 2016 ''Blast'' album released on the bands own TT Records.\n\nIn 2019, the band were forced to cancel an appearance at Hard Rock Hell due to guitarist Jay Pepper's worsening hearing loss.\n\n==Bare Knuckle Messiahs==\nA second Tigertailz reunion (of sorts) took place in 2019 when departed vocalist Kim Hooker announced his new band Bare Knuckle Messiahs which features Hooker on vocals and guitar, joined by two former \"Wazbones\" era Tigertailz members, guitarist Cy Danaher and drummer Andy Skinner, with the line up being rounded out with the addition of bassist JJ.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.blabbermouth.net/news/former-tigertailz-frontman-kim-hooker-launches-bare-knuckle-messiahs/|title=Former TIGERTAILZ Frontman KIM HOOKER Launches BARE KNUCKLE MESSIAHS|date=14 February 2019|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Hooker's new band released their debut album ''That Which Preys On The Dead'' through the DIAFOL label in October 2019.\n\n==Band members==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2013}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Original members<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio />\n* [[Pepsi Tate]] -Bass (1983-1996, 2005-2007)\n* Ian Welsh -

They are most famous for their 1990 album, ''[[Bezerk (album)|Bezerk]]'' which made the [[Top 40]] in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and spawned the hit singles \"Love Bomb Baby\" and \"Heaven\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 559}}</ref> The band reformed in 2005.\n\n==Formation and early years==\nTigertailz (originally called Stagefright) formed in 1983 after bassist [[Pepsi Tate]] and drummer Ian Welch placed an advert in the Cardiff record store, Spillers Records, looking for a guitarist. Jay Pepper answered the advert.<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio>{{cite web|title=Tigertailz biography |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/tigertailz/pages/biography.shtml|work=Wales Music|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=18 November 2008|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref> Local guitarist Phil Harling and singer Jim Dovey joined and the band began to write and record demos, although the demos were never released. The band began to get gigs and they started to amass a local following, however lead singer Jim Dovey soon left the band therefore Pepper and Tate placed an advert in the ''National Sounds'' magazine and vocalist [[Steevi Jaimz]] answered the call and joined the band. Welch left the band in 1984 and was finally replaced with Ace Finchum.<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio />\n\n==Commercial success (1987-1995)==\nPart of the nascent [[glam metal]] scene in the late 1980s, Tigertailz first line-up issued their debut album, ''[[Young and Crazy (Tigertailz album)|Young And Crazy]]'', in 1987.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> The album featured vocalist [[Steevi Jaimz]], guitarist Jay Pepper, bassist [[Pepsi Tate]] and drummer Ace Finchum.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who\u2019s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=363}}</ref> The debut album also provided their first single, \"Livin' Without You\".\n\nAs the band toured, vocalist Steevi Jaimz was not fully committed to the band, and several instances of fighting were recorded. The band recruited Kim Hooker to replace Jaimz in time for follow-up album, ''Bezerk'', which was released in 1990 on the [[Music For Nations]] [[record label|label]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nPrior to the release of ''[[Bezerk (album)|Bezerk]]'', the band re-recorded \"Livin Without' You\" with Hooker as vocalist, and released it as a single. ''Bezerk'' saw the band breakthrough as a headline act, and delivering three singles, \"Love Bomb Baby\",<ref name=\"Kerrang Bomb\">Ray Zell [http://klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com/tigertailz---june-1989.html \"The Bomb Party\"], ''Kerrang'', June 1989 (copy online at Klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com).

The album peaked at No.&nbsp;36 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nThey released ''[[Banzai! (Tigertailz Album)|Banzai!]]'', a collection of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and re-recorded tracks, in 1991 in [[Japan]]. They also issued ''[[Wazbones (Tigertailz Album)|Wazbones]]'' in 1995, by which time the Hooker-Pepper-Tate-Finchum line-up had fragmented, and was replaced by the Hooker-Danahar-Tate-Skinner line-up. Touring proved successful, but there was insufficient record label interest to sustain the band.\n\n==Reunion (2005-2009)==\nIn 2005, the band reformed their classic line-up, with the addition of former City Kidds drummer Matt Blakout, who replaced Andy Skinner. The band won a court order winning ownership of the Tigertailz name from a spin-off band fronted by Steevi Jaimz. This problem resolved, Tigertailz were able to work on ''[[Bezerk 2.0]]''.\n\nThey completed a short reunion tour of the UK, culminating in some festival dates in Sweden and Spain, playing to over 70,000 people with [[Whitesnake]] and [[Twisted Sister]]. ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine wrote in praise of the reunion; journalist [[Steve Beebee]] describing it as \"persistently entertaining, with monstrous melodies that reach delirious peaks\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n''Bezerk 2.0'' was released through [[Demolition Records]] on 7 August 2006. Bass player Pepsi Tate was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2007. The band signed a new [[recording contract]] with [[Sanctuary Records]], and released ''Thrill Pistol'' on 27 August 2007, barely a year after their previous album release. This release was a [[double album]], packaged with the original 1992 version of the ''Wazbones'' album, that had never been officially released. Beebee again wrote in praise of the album in ''[[Kerrang!]]'', calling on fans to \"kindly hail this rejuvenated band for the time-defying devils they are\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Following Tate's death in September 2007, Tigertailz continued to tour with former City Kidds lead guitarist, Glenn 'Nailz' Quinn, playing bass. As well as numerous European festival shows, they supported ex-[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] guitarist [[Ace Frehley]] in the UK, and performed at the UK's [[Hard Rock Hell]] Festival in both 2008 and 2009.\n\n==Bezerk anniversary (2010)==\nIn January 2010, Tigertailz recruited Sarah Firebrand as their new bass player. They also announced that they would be playing ''Bezerk'', originally released in 1990, in its entirety and in sequence at some subsequent live shows. Some of these performances were recorded for use as a future live album. After playing a show at the Fuel Rock Club in Cardiff on 17 April to raise money for the Amser Justin Time charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory, the band headlined the Stockholm Rock Out Festival in Sweden on 1 May.\n\nFollowing further 'Bezerk Live' dates, Tigertailz replaced drummer Matt Blakout with former [[Rachel Stamp]] sticksman Robin Guy. Tigertailz headlined the first night of 2010's [[Hard Rock Hell]] and released ''Bezerk Live - Burnin' Fuel'' on 6 December. In June 2011, it was announced, via the band's website, that Ace Finchum had re-joined the band.\n\nThey were expected to record their next studio album in 2011 but on 23 November, in an interview with Queens Of Steel webzine, [ [http://www.queensofsteel.com/2005/11/tigertailz-eng/ Queens Of Steel - Tigertailz interview] ] Jay Pepper cast doubt on the future of the band, stating that it was \"facing a crossroads as to its survival. I don't know if we can survive the latest troubles.\" Suggesting that Tigertailz might still continue \"with a different line-up\" the band parted company with Sarah Firebrand in late 2011, this being made public in a statement issued on 9 January 2012 [ <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tigertailz.co.uk/news/2012/01/09/tailz-part-company-with-firebrand |title=News |publisher=Tigertailz.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref> ]. Frontman Kim Hooker went the same way on 28 March 2012, the remaining members citing 'a total breakdown of relationship resulting from the singer's unprofessional conduct'[ <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tigertailz.co.uk/news/2012/03/28/tailz-no-longer-hooked/ |title=Tailz No longer Hooked |publisher=Tigertailz.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref> ]. They further described themselves as \"relieved\".\n\n==New line-up (2012)==\nOn 26 June 2012, Tigertailz announced its new line-up, and a European tour for September and October. Joining original members Jay Pepper and Ace Finchum were Jules Millis (vocals), Rob Wylde (guitar) and Jason Sims (bass). The band re-recorded an old song, \"Fall In Love Again\", and filmed a video for it - with all proceeds going towards a charity set up in Pepsi Tate's memory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tigertailz.co.uk/news/2012/06/25/tailz-unleash-new-line-up/|title=TIGERTAILZ UNLEASH NEW LINE-UP!|website=Tigertailz.co.uk|accessdate=23 November 2017}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=May 2013}}\n\nAfter a tour and an appearance at the [[Hard Rock Hell]] festival, this line-up fragmented in 2013. In a statement, Jay Pepper confirmed that there would be no reunion but that he would continue to perform as Tigertailz, and in June 2013 it was confirmed that drummer Matthew Blakout had re-joined the band, with Wylde switching from guitar to bass, and a new EP 'Knives' being prepared for release.\n\nOn 7 October 2013, the ''Classic Rock Magazine'' website premiered Tigertailz latest video \"The Shoe Collector\", ahead of the release of the \"Knives\" EP on 15 October. The magazine described it as \"a major step on Tigertailz\u2019 road back from the brink\".<ref name=\"CRM premiere\">{{cite news |last=Kielty |first=Martin |title=Video Premiere: Tigertailz \u2013 The Shoe Collector |work=Classic Rock Magazine |date=7 October 2013 |url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/music_and_videos/video-premiere-tigertailz-the-shoe-collector/ |accessdate=2013-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128111144/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/music_and_videos/video-premiere-tigertailz-the-shoe-collector/ |archivedate=28 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 17 February 2014, Classic Rock premiered the second video release from \"Knives\" EP \"One Life\".

They supported [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Cheap Trick]] on the 2014 Kiss Kruise.\n\nA further line up change happened in 2015 when vocalist Jules Mills was replaced by guitarist turned bassist now turned vocalist Rob Wylde, with the bass position being filled by Berty Burton.\n\nIn 2016, this line up released the song \"Pipped It, Popped It\" which they - unsuccessfully - submitted for consideration as a UK [[Eurovision Song Contest]] entry. The song was included on the largely ignored 2016 ''Blast'' album released on the bands own TT Records.\n\nIn 2019, the band were forced to cancel an appearance at Hard Rock Hell due to guitarist Jay Pepper's worsening hearing loss.\n\n==Bare Knuckle Messiahs==\nA second Tigertailz reunion (of sorts) took place in 2019 when departed vocalist Kim Hooker announced his new band Bare Knuckle Messiahs which features Hooker on vocals and guitar, joined by two former \"Wazbones\" era Tigertailz members, guitarist Cy Danaher and drummer Andy Skinner, with the line up being rounded out with the addition of bassist JJ.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.blabbermouth.net/news/former-tigertailz-frontman-kim-hooker-launches-bare-knuckle-messiahs/|title=Former TIGERTAILZ Frontman KIM HOOKER Launches BARE KNUCKLE MESSIAHS|date=14 February 2019|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Hooker's new band released their debut album ''That Which Preys On The Dead'' through the DIAFOL label in October 2019.\n\n==Band members==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2013}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Original members<ref name=BBC_Wales_Tailz_Bio />\n* [[Pepsi Tate]] -Bass (1983-1996, 2005-2007)\n* Ian Welsh -

She received her PhD from the [[University of London]] in 1986. Since 1992, Lipscombe has spent her career teaching graduate students and researching at [[Brown University]]. Some of her current research experiments range from creating new and improved ways of using [[Bioluminescence]], to looking at voltage-gated calcium channels and how they are affected by normal cell behavior, as well as abnormal cell behavior caused by a disease. Throughout her scientific career she has accumulated numerous awards not only from Brown University, but from several research projects as well as the [[American Heart Association]]. She is also on several committee boards, has been editors of many magazines and articles, and served as the president of the [[Society for Neuroscience]] from 2018\u20132019.\n\n== Education and research ==\nLipscombe attended the University of London and graduated with a bachelors of science in 1982.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dlipscom|title=Lipscombe, Diane|website=vivo.brown.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> She stayed at the University of London to receive a PhD in [[pharmacology]] and graduated in 1986. From there she went on to [[Yale University]] to study with [[Richard W. Tsien]] as a postdoctoral associate. From Yale University, she then went on to [[Stanford University Medical School]]. Lipscombe joined the Department of Neuroscience at Brown in 1992. Her studies focus on expression, regulation and function of voltage-gated calcium ion channels. She went on to write upwards of seventy scientific articles ranging from finding more about RNA and DNA binding proteins to articles dealing with chronic pain and psychiatric disorders. She is currently a graduate student professor at Brown University working on projects. She has taught within the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the Marine Biology Lab. She trains students in whole cell and single channel patch recording methods, mostly with voltage-gated calcium ion channels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dlipscom#Teaching|title=Lipscombe, Diane|website=vivo.brown.edu|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n[[File:Quiet Green - Brown University.jpg|thumb|This is where Dr. Lipscombe is currently working with Graduate students in her lab. She has received recognition in the form of awards during her time here. ]]\n<br />\n\n== Overall research focus ==\nLipscombe has spent her career researching voltage-gated calcium ion channels within different parts of the nervous system.<ref name=\":1\" />  These voltage-gated calcium ion channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>s) have a link to certain psychiatric disorders, which is what Lipscombe is interested in. Lipscombe has spent time studying [[alternative splicing]] variants of different channels, and how variants cause varied biophysical properties and expression in the tissue.<ref name=\":3\" /> An example of a biophysical property of calcium channels include if the channel is fast or slow when the channel uses voltage gated inactivation or activation.<ref>{{Citation|last=An|first=Mary T.|chapter=Voltage-Dependent Inactivation of Voltage Gated Calcium Channels|pages=194\u2013204|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-0-306-47840-6|last2=Zamponi|first2=Gerald W.|title=Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels|series=Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit|year=2005|doi=10.1007/0-387-27526-6_12}}</ref> \n\nCa<sub>V</sub>s are made up of multiple subunits and have many genes that code for them. These subunits are then subdivided into various channels. Dr. Lipscombe has studied many of these channels. An example of one of these channels is known as the Ca<sub>V</sub> 3.3 channel. There are variations that she studies of missence genes that associated with patients with [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Andrade|first=Arturo|last2=Brennecke|first2=Ashton|last3=Mallat|first3=Shayna|last4=Brown|first4=Julian|last5=Gomez-Rivadeneira|first5=Juan|last6=Czepiel|first6=Natalie|last7=Londrigan|first7=Laura|date=2019-07-19|title=Genetic Associations between Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels and Psychiatric Disorders|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=20|issue=14|pages=3537|doi=10.3390/ijms20143537|issn=1422-0067|pmc=6679227|pmid=31331039}}</ref> Her contributions show that R1346H lessens the calcium current.\n\nCalcium channels are crucial to whether or not there is [[neurotransmitter]] release. The alteration of neurons and their functions have been found to lead to neurodevelopmental disorders/diseases. Presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals in neurons are found to be very important in calcium channels. Lipscombe specifically demonstrated that when Neurexin (NRX-1) and Neuroligin (NLG-1), or presynaptic cell adhesion proteins, adhere to the synaptic cleft, it is linked to autism in humans.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Avazzadeh|first=Sahar|last2=McDonagh|first2=Katya|last3=Reilly|first3=Jamie|last4=Wang|first4=Yanqin|last5=Boomkamp|first5=Stephanie D.|last6=McInerney|first6=Veronica|last7=Krawczyk|first7=Janusz|last8=Fitzgerald|first8=Jacqueline|last9=Feerick|first9=Niamh|last10=O\u2019Sullivan|first10=Matthew|last11=Jalali|first11=Amirhossein|date=December 2019|title=Increased Ca2+ signaling in NRXN1\u03b1+/\u2212 neurons derived from ASD induced pluripotent stem cells|journal=Molecular Autism|volume=10|issue=1|pages=52|doi=10.1186/s13229-019-0303-3|issn=2040-2392|pmc=6937972|pmid=31893021}}</ref> Lipscombe has studied the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release through coupling methods. Coupling method occurs when two things come together to form a common intermediate that will serve another purpose. This intermediate will either inhibit a function or excite something to carry out a function. This excitatory response found in Lipscombe\u2019s studies allow calcium channels to open and neurotransmitters to be released again. The deletion of the NRXN1 gene, which is linked to Neurexin, does not allow for neurotransmitters to be released.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Current research ==\nLipscombe is currently researching cell mechanisms and how they affect Ca<sub>V</sub>s when normal functioning is occurring, as well as when normal function is not occurring. Calcium voltage 2.2 channels or Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 N-type calcium ion channels are linked to pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Pharmacological Inhibition of Voltage-gated Ca2+ Channels for Chronic Pain Relief|last=Lee|first=Seungkyu|date=2013-11-30|journal=Current Neuropharmacology|volume=11|issue=6|pages=606\u2013620|doi=10.2174/1570159x11311060005|pmc=3849787|pmid=24396337}}</ref> Research in pain is important because chronic pain is a very current therapeutic issue that has poor treatment options that are not very effective and have serious harmful side effects. Voltage gated calcium channels are\u00a0 made up of various sub-units which make it a multi-complex protein. The N-type channels are a major pain target that take part in excitability which leads to neurotransmitter release in [[nociceptor]]. In order to understand the voltage gated calcium channel sub-types, Lipscombe works on various channel inhibitors that specifically target the inhibitor essential in decreasing pain.\n\nCurrently Lipscombe is working in her lab on a project that looks at the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and its origin and underlying cellular defects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Held|first=Aaron|last2=Major|first2=Paxton|last3=Sahin|first3=Asli|last4=Reenan|first4=Robert A.|last5=Lipscombe|first5=Diane|last6=Wharton|first6=Kristi A.|date=2019-03-20|title=Circuit Dysfunction in SOD1-ALS Model First Detected in Sensory Feedback Prior to Motor Neuron Degeneration Is Alleviated by BMP Signaling|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=39|issue=12|pages=2347\u20132364|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1771-18.2019|issn=0270-6474|pmc=6433758|pmid=30659087}}</ref> They used a Drosophila Sod1G85R knock-in model, which is an ideal specimen for looking at this disease. They were able to find the cell autonomous activation of bone morphogenetic signaling in proprioceptor [[sensory neuron]]s. This experiment was important to perform to help identify the initiation cellular events that are prevalent at the earlier diagnosis.\n\nLipscombe is a part of a team, The Bioluminescence Hub, that is working to develop new ways of performing and improving the technique of BioLuminescence, which allows cells to be viewed using light.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/carney/neuronex-technology-hub-bioluminescence-optimal-brain-control-and-imaging|title=NeuroNex Technology Hub: Bioluminescence for Optimal Brain Control and Imaging {{!}} Carney Institute for Brain Science {{!}} Brown University|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> This is a very valuable tool for neuroscience. This team also includes scientists from Central Michigan University, Brown University, and the Scintillon Institute in San Diego. Their goals are to make new techniques developed for BioLuminescence, such as multiple new colors and the ability to control brightness, as well as having this information available for many students and educators. This way, everyone can have a way of learning about BioLuminescence, regardless if you are a scientist or if you are a student.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bioluminescencehub.org/about-us|title=BL Hub|website=www.bioluminescencehub.org|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 1989-1990 she was a postdoctoral fellow of the [[American Heart Association]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dlipscom#Background|title=Lipscombe, Diane|website=vivo.brown.edu|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The American Heart Association is a non-profit organization that raises money for cardiovascular research. Five years later in 1995 she attended the Steinbach MBL Summer Fellowship that is available to young researchers who were interested in doing research in a field of biology. She received a similar fellowship in 2002 called the Catherine Filene Shouse MBL Summer Fellowship that targeted the same students interested in the biology field.

She has received recognition in the form of awards during her time here. ]]\n<br />\n\n== Overall research focus ==\nLipscombe has spent her career researching voltage-gated calcium ion channels within different parts of the nervous system.<ref name=\":1\" />  These voltage-gated calcium ion channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>s) have a link to certain psychiatric disorders, which is what Lipscombe is interested in. Lipscombe has spent time studying [[alternative splicing]] variants of different channels, and how variants cause varied biophysical properties and expression in the tissue.<ref name=\":3\" /> An example of a biophysical property of calcium channels include if the channel is fast or slow when the channel uses voltage gated inactivation or activation.<ref>{{Citation|last=An|first=Mary T.|chapter=Voltage-Dependent Inactivation of Voltage Gated Calcium Channels|pages=194\u2013204|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-0-306-47840-6|last2=Zamponi|first2=Gerald W.|title=Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels|series=Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit|year=2005|doi=10.1007/0-387-27526-6_12}}</ref> \n\nCa<sub>V</sub>s are made up of multiple subunits and have many genes that code for them. These subunits are then subdivided into various channels. Dr. Lipscombe has studied many of these channels. An example of one of these channels is known as the Ca<sub>V</sub> 3.3 channel. The variations T797M and R1346H are two [[Missense mutation|missense]] variations of the gene encoding the Ca<sub>V</sub> 3.3 channel, and is associated with patients with [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Andrade|first=Arturo|last2=Brennecke|first2=Ashton|last3=Mallat|first3=Shayna|last4=Brown|first4=Julian|last5=Gomez-Rivadeneira|first5=Juan|last6=Czepiel|first6=Natalie|last7=Londrigan|first7=Laura|date=2019-07-19|title=Genetic Associations between Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels and Psychiatric Disorders|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=20|issue=14|pages=3537|doi=10.3390/ijms20143537|issn=1422-0067|pmc=6679227|pmid=31331039}}</ref> Her contributions show that R1346H lessens the calcium current.\n\nCalcium channels are crucial to whether or not there is [[neurotransmitter]] release. The alteration of neurons and their functions have been found to lead to neurodevelopmental disorders/diseases. Presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals in neurons are found to be very important in calcium channels. Lipscombe specifically demonstrated that when Neurexin (NRX-1) and Neuroligin (NLG-1), or presynaptic cell adhesion proteins, adhere to the synaptic cleft, it is linked to autism in humans.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Avazzadeh|first=Sahar|last2=McDonagh|first2=Katya|last3=Reilly|first3=Jamie|last4=Wang|first4=Yanqin|last5=Boomkamp|first5=Stephanie D.|last6=McInerney|first6=Veronica|last7=Krawczyk|first7=Janusz|last8=Fitzgerald|first8=Jacqueline|last9=Feerick|first9=Niamh|last10=O\u2019Sullivan|first10=Matthew|last11=Jalali|first11=Amirhossein|date=December 2019|title=Increased Ca2+ signaling in NRXN1\u03b1+/\u2212 neurons derived from ASD induced pluripotent stem cells|journal=Molecular Autism|volume=10|issue=1|pages=52|doi=10.1186/s13229-019-0303-3|issn=2040-2392|pmc=6937972|pmid=31893021}}</ref> Lipscombe has studied the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release through coupling methods. Coupling method occurs when two things come together to form a common intermediate that will serve another purpose. This intermediate will either inhibit a function or excite something to carry out a function. This excitatory response found in Lipscombe\u2019s studies allow calcium channels to open and neurotransmitters to be released again. The deletion of the NRXN1 gene, which is linked to Neurexin, does not allow for neurotransmitters to be released.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Current research ==\nLipscombe is currently researching cell mechanisms and how they affect Ca<sub>V</sub>s when normal functioning is occurring, as well as when normal function is not occurring. Calcium voltage 2.2 channels or Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 N-type calcium ion channels are linked to pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Pharmacological Inhibition of Voltage-gated Ca2+ Channels for Chronic Pain Relief|last=Lee|first=Seungkyu|date=2013-11-30|journal=Current Neuropharmacology|volume=11|issue=6|pages=606\u2013620|doi=10.2174/1570159x11311060005|pmc=3849787|pmid=24396337}}</ref> Research in pain is important because chronic pain is a very current therapeutic issue that has poor treatment options that are not very effective and have serious harmful side effects. Voltage gated calcium channels are\u00a0 made up of various sub-units which make it a multi-complex protein. The N-type channels are a major pain target that take part in excitability which leads to neurotransmitter release in [[nociceptor]]. In order to understand the voltage gated calcium channel sub-types, Lipscombe works on various channel inhibitors that specifically target the inhibitor essential in decreasing pain.\n\nCurrently Lipscombe is working in her lab on a project that looks at the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and its origin and underlying cellular defects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Held|first=Aaron|last2=Major|first2=Paxton|last3=Sahin|first3=Asli|last4=Reenan|first4=Robert A.|last5=Lipscombe|first5=Diane|last6=Wharton|first6=Kristi A.|date=2019-03-20|title=Circuit Dysfunction in SOD1-ALS Model First Detected in Sensory Feedback Prior to Motor Neuron Degeneration Is Alleviated by BMP Signaling|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=39|issue=12|pages=2347\u20132364|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1771-18.2019|issn=0270-6474|pmc=6433758|pmid=30659087}}</ref> They used a Drosophila Sod1G85R knock-in model, which is an ideal specimen for looking at this disease. They were able to find the cell autonomous activation of bone morphogenetic signaling in proprioceptor [[sensory neuron]]s. This experiment was important to perform to help identify the initiation cellular events that are prevalent at the earlier diagnosis.\n\nLipscombe is a part of a team, The Bioluminescence Hub, that is working to develop new ways of performing and improving the technique of BioLuminescence, which allows cells to be viewed using light.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/carney/neuronex-technology-hub-bioluminescence-optimal-brain-control-and-imaging|title=NeuroNex Technology Hub: Bioluminescence for Optimal Brain Control and Imaging {{!}} Carney Institute for Brain Science {{!}} Brown University|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> This is a very valuable tool for neuroscience. This team also includes scientists from Central Michigan University, Brown University, and the Scintillon Institute in San Diego. Their goals are to make new techniques developed for BioLuminescence, such as multiple new colors and the ability to control brightness, as well as having this information available for many students and educators. This way, everyone can have a way of learning about BioLuminescence, regardless if you are a scientist or if you are a student.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bioluminescencehub.org/about-us|title=BL Hub|website=www.bioluminescencehub.org|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 1989-1990 she was a postdoctoral fellow of the [[American Heart Association]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dlipscom#Background|title=Lipscombe, Diane|website=vivo.brown.edu|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The American Heart Association is a non-profit organization that raises money for cardiovascular research.
