In first book of the Pentateuch, the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Israelites]] had come to live in Egypt in the [[Land of Goshen]] during a famine due to the fact that an Israelite, [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]], had become a high official in the court of the [[pharaoh]]. Exodus begins with the deaths of Joseph and the ascension of a new pharaoh \"who did not know Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8). The pharaoh becomes concerned by the number and strength of Israelites in Egypt and enslaves them, commanding them to build at two \"supply cities\" called [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Rameses]] (Exodus 1:11).{{efn|The [[Septuagint]] version includes a reference to a third \"supply city\": \" On,  which  is  [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]\" (LXX Exodus 1:11, trans. Larry J. Perkins).}} The pharaoh also orders the slaughter at birth of all male Hebrew children. One Hebrew child, however, is rescued by being placed in a basket on the [[Nile]]. He is found and adopted by [[Pharaoh's daughter (Exodus)|Pharaoh's daughter]], who names him [[Moses]]. Moses eventually kills an Egyptian he sees beating a Hebrew slave, and is forced to flee to [[Midian]], marrying a daughter of the Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. The old pharaoh dies and a new one ascends to the throne.\n\nMoses, in Midian, goes to [[Mount Horeb]], where [[Yahweh]] appears in a [[Burning Bush]] and commands him to go to Egypt to free the Hebrew slaves and bring them to the [[promised land]] in [[Canaan]]. Yahweh also speaks to Moses's brother [[Aaron]]; they both assemble the Israelites and perform signs so that they believe in Yahweh's promise. Moses and Aaron then go to the Pharaoh and ask him to let the Israelites go into the desert for a religious festival, but the Pharaoh refuses and commands the Israelites to make [[bricks without straw]] and increases their workload. Moses and Aaron return to the Pharaoh and this time ask him to free the Israelites. The Pharaoh demands for Moses to perform a [[miracle]], and Aaron throws down [[Staff of Moses|Moses' staff]], which turns into a snake; however, the Pharaoh's magicians{{efn|These magicians are referred to in the Hebrew text as {{lang|he|\u1e25artumm\u00eem|italics=yes}}, which derives from [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] {{lang|egy|\u1e25rj-tp|italic=yes}} ([[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] {{lang|egy|p-hritob|italics=yes}}, {{lang-akk|\u1e25ar-tibi|italic=yes}}) a title meaning \"chief\" and shortened from \"chief lector priest\".{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=139}} The Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate Moses and Aaron's actions until the third plague (gnats), when they are the first to recognize that a divine power is at work (Exodus 8:19). In plague four (festering boils), they themselves are afflicted and no longer contest with Moses and Aaron.{{sfn|Assmann|2018|pp=139-142}}}} are also able to do this, though Moses' staff devours the others. The Pharaoh then refuses to let the Israelites go.\n\n[[File:Israel's Escape from Egypt.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Exodus from Egypt by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]\nAfter this, Yahweh begins inflicting the [[Plagues of Egypt]] on the Egyptians for each time that Moses goes to Pharaoh and Pharaoh refuses to release the Israelites. Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate the first plagues, in which Yahweh turns the Nile to blood and produces a plague of frogs, but are unable to reproduce any plagues after the third, the plague of gnats. After each plague Pharaoh allows the Israelites to worship Yahweh to remove the plague, then refuses to free them. In the final plague, Yahweh kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, but the Israelites, who have been commanded to kill one lamb per family and smear its blood on their doorposts, are spared. Yahweh commands that the Israelites observe a festival as \"a perpetual ordinance\" to remember this event (Exodus 12:14). Pharaoh finally agrees to let the Israelites go after his firstborn son is killed. Yahweh leads the Israelites in the form of a [[pillar of cloud]] in the day and a [[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] at night. However, once the Israelites have already left, Pharaoh changes his mind and pursues the Israelites to the shore of the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses his staff to [[parting of the Red Sea|part the Red Sea]], and the Israelites cross on dry ground, but the sea closes down on the pursuing Egyptians, drowning them all.\n\nThe Israelites now begin to complain about Aaron and Moses, as Yahweh miraculously provided them first with water and food, eventually raining [[manna]] down for them to eat. [[Amalek]] attacks at [[Rephidim]] but is defeated in battle. Jethro comes to Moses with Moses's wife and sons; on Jethro's advice, Moses appoints judges for the tribes of Israel. The Israelites reach the [[Sinai Desert]] and Yahweh calls Moses to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], where [[Yahweh]] reveals himself to his people and establishes the [[Ten Commandments]] and [[Mosaic covenant]]: the Israelites are to keep his ''torah'' (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will give them the land of Canaan. Yahweh establishes the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] and various rules for ritual worship, among other laws. However, in Moses's absence the Israelites sin against Yahweh by creating the idol of a [[golden calf]], and as retaliation Yahweh has the [[Levites]] kill three thousand people (Exodus 32:28) and Yahweh sends a plague on the Israelites. The Israelites now accept the covenant, build a [[tabernacle]] for Yahweh, and receive their laws. Yahweh commands Moses to take a [[census]] of the Israelites and establishes the duties of the Levites. Then the Israelites depart from Mount Sinai.\n\nYahweh commands Moses to send [[The Twelve Spies|twelve spies]] ahead to Canaan to scout the land. The spies discover that the Canaanites are strong, and, believing that the Israelites cannot defeat them, the spies falsely report to the Israelites that Canaan is full of giants so that the Israelites will not invade (Numbers 13:31-33). The Israelites refuse to go to Canaan, so Yahweh manifests himself and declares that the generation that left Egypt will have to pass away before the Israelites can enter Canaan. The Israelites will have to remain in the wilderness for forty years, and Yahweh kills the spies through a plague except for the righteous [[Joshua]] and [[Caleb]], who will be allowed to enter the promised land. A group of Israelites led by [[Korah]], son of Izhar, rebels against Moses, but Yahweh opens the earth and sends them living to [[Sheol]].\n\nThe Israelites come to the oasis of [[Kadesh Barnea]], where [[Miriam]] dies. The people are without water, so Yahweh commands Moses to get water from a rock by speaking to it, but Moses strikes the rock with his staff instead, for which Yahweh forbids him from entering the promised land. Moses sends a messenger to the king of [[Edom]] requesting passage through his land to Canaan, but the king refuses. The Israelites then go to [[Mount Hor]], where Aaron dies. The Israelites try to go around Edom, but the Israelites complain about lack of bread and water, so Yahweh sends a plague of poisonous snakes to afflict them. After Moses prays for deliverance, Yahweh has him create the [[brazen serpent]], and the Israelites who look at it are cured. The Israelites are soon in conflict with various other kingdoms, and king [[Balak]] of [[Moab]] attempts to have the seer [[Balaam]] curse the Israelites, but Balaam blesses the Israelites instead. Some Israelites begin having sexual relations with Moabite women and [[Heresy of Peor|worshipping Moabite gods]], so Yahweh orders Moses to [[impalement|impale]] the idolators and sends a plague, but the full extent of Yahweh's wrath is averted when [[Phinehas]] impales an Israelite and a Midianite woman having intercourse (Numbers 25:7-9). Yahweh commands the Israelites to destroy the Midianites and Moses and Phinehas take another census. They then conquer the lands of [[Og]] and [[Sihon]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], settling the [[Gadites]], [[Reubenites]], and half the [[Tribe of Manasseh]] there.\n\nMoses then addresses the Israelites for a final time on the banks of the [[Jordan River]], reviewing their travels and giving them further laws. Yahweh tells Moses to summon Joshua, whom Yahweh commissions to lead the conquest of Canaan. Yahweh tells Moses to ascend [[Mount Nebo]], from where he sees the promised land and where he dies.\n\n===Covenant and law===\nThe climax of the Exodus is the covenant (binding legal agreement) between God and Israel mediated by Moses at Sinai: Yahweh will protect Israel as his chosen people for all time, and  Israel will keep Yahweh's laws and worship only him.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The covenant is described in stages: at Exodus 24:3\u20138 the Israelites agree to abide by the \"book of the covenant\" that Moses has just read to them; shortly afterwards God writes the \"words of the covenant\" \u2013 the [[Ten Commandments]] \u2013 on stone tablets; and finally, as the people gather in Moab to cross into Canaan, the land God has promised them, Moses makes a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel \"beside the covenant he made with them at Horeb\" (Deuteronomy 29:1).{{sfn|McKenzie|2000|p=4\u20135}} The laws are set out in a number of codes:{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=146}}\n* [[Ethical Decalogue]] (i.e., the Ten Commandments), Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5;\n* The [[Covenant Code|Book of the Covenant]], Exodus 20:22\u201323:3;\n* [[Ritual Decalogue]], Exodus 34;\n* The ritual laws of [[Leviticus]] 1\u20136 and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1\u201310;\n* The [[Holiness Code]], Leviticus 17\u201326;\n* Deuteronomic Code, [[Deuteronomy]] 12\u201326.\n\n==Development and final composition==\n[[File:109.Ezra Reads the Law to the People.jpg|thumb|''Ezra Reads the Law to the People'' ([[Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for ''La Grande Bible de Tours'']], 1866)]]\nThe earliest traces of the traditions behind the exodus appear in the northern prophets [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (possibly) and [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] (certainly), both active in the 8th century BCE in  northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], but their southern contemporaries [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and [[Book of Micah|Micah]] show no knowledge of an exodus.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}} (Micah 6:45 contains a reference to the exodus, which many scholars take to be an addition by a later editor.){{efn|Micah 6:45 (\"I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.

Weinberg and called the \"Citizen-Temple Community\", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=226\u2013227}} The books containing the Exodus story served as an \"identity card\" defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=225}}\n\n== Origins and historicity ==\n{{See also|Sources and parallels of the Exodus|Historicity of the Bible}}\nThere are two main positions on the historicity of the Exodus in modern scholarship.{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}} The majority position is that the biblical Exodus narrative has some ultimate historicity, although there is little of historical worth in the biblical narrative.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}}{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} The other main position, often associated with the school of [[Biblical minimalism]],{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=23-24}} is that the Exodus has no historical basis. Both positions are in agreement that the biblical Exodus narrative is best understood as a [[founding myth]] of the Jewish people, explaining their origins and providing an ideological foundation for their culture and institutions, not an accurate depiction of the history of the Israelites.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=46}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} A third position, that the biblical narrative is essentially correct (\"Biblical maximalism\"), is today held by \"few, if any [...] in mainstream scholarship, only on the more fundamentalist fringes.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}}\n\nMainstream scholarship no longer accepts the biblical Exodus account as accurate history for a number of reasons. No modern attempt to identify a historical Egyptian prototype for Moses has found wide acceptance, and no period in Egyptian history matches the Biblical accounts of the Exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=63-64}} Some elements of the story are clearly meant to be [[Miracle|miraculous]] and defy rational explanation, such as the [[Plagues of Egypt]] and the [[Crossing of the Red Sea]].{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=15-17}} Lester Grabbe argues that \"attempts to find naturalistic explanations [for these events] [...] miss the point: the aim of the narrative is to magnify the power of Yhwh and Moses.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=93}} The Bible also fails to mention the names of any of the Pharaohs involved in the Exodus narrative.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=69}} While [[ancientEgypt|ancient Egyptian]] texts from the [[New Kingdom]] mention \"Asiatics\" living in Egypt as slaves and workers, these people cannot be securely connected to the Israelites, and no contemporary Egyptian text mentions a large-scale exodus of slaves like that described in the Bible.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|pp=2-3}} The earliest surviving historical mention of the Israelites, the Egyptian [[Merneptah Stele]] (c. 1207 BC), appears to place them in or around Canaan and gives no indication of any exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=65-67}} The numbers of people involved in the Exodus as given in the Bible are fanciful, as the [[Sinai Desert]] could never have supported the 603,550 Israelites mentioned in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1:46.{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=18-19}} Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion \u2013 that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible \u2013 seems irrefutable [...] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence.\"{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=63}} Instead, modern archaeology suggests continuity between Canaanite and Israelite settlement, indicating a primarily Canaanite origin for Israel.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=4}}{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}}\n\nA majority of scholars nevertheless still believes that the Exodus has some historical basis,{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}} with Kenton Sparks referring to it as \"mythologized history.\"{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} Evidence in favor of historical traditions forming a background to the Exodus myth include the documented movements of small groups of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] into and out of Egypt during the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] and [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasties]], some elements of Egyptian [[folklore]] and culture in the Exodus narrative,{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=8-10}} and the names Moses, Aaron and Phinehas, which seem to have an Egyptian origin.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=65}} The expulsion of the [[Hyksos]], a Semitic group that had conquered much of Egypt, by the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt]] is frequently discussed as a potential historical parallel or origin for the story.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=78}}{{sfn|Redford|1992|pp=412\u2013413}} Avraham Faust and William Dever argue that a group of Egyptian origin, whom Dever cautiously identifies as \"the house of Joseph\",{{sfn|Dever|2003|p=231}} may have joined the Israelites after their initial [[ethnogenesis|formation]] in Canaan, and that their story could have become adopted as the national myth of the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=229\u2013231}}  It is also possible that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the late second millennium BC may have aided the adoption of the story of a small group of Egyptian refugees by the native Canaanites among the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}} Most proposals for a historical Exodus of any sort place it in the sixteenth, fifteenth, or thirteenth centuries BC.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=77}} Alternatively, Nadav Na'aman argues that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the Nineteenth and especially the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] may have inspired the Exodus narrative, forming a \"[[collective memory]]\" of Egyptian oppression that was transferred from Canaan to Egypt itself in the popular consciousness.{{sfn|Na'aman|2011|pp=62-69}}\n\nSome scholars, including the biblical minimalists, show more skepticism toward ascribing any [[historicity]] at all to the exodus,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=95}}\nwith some arguing that the myth has its origins in the [[Babylonian exile|exilic]] and post-exilic Jewish community and has little to no historical basis.{{sfn|Russell|2009|pp=11-14}} Lester Grabbe, for instance, argues that \"[t]here is no compelling reason that the exodus has to be rooted in history,\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=84}} and that the details of the story more closely fit the seventh through the fifth centuries BC than the traditional dating to the second millennium BC.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=85}} Rejecting the traditional view that the Exodus records pre-exilic traditions, Philip R. Davies suggests that the story may have been inspired by the return to Israel of Israelites and Judaeans who were placed in Egypt as garrison troops by the [[Assyria]]ns in the fifth and sixth centuries BC.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=105}} Historian Graham Davies has criticized minimalist scholars for relying too heavily on archaeology, stating \"a historian cannot simply ignore the textual evidence (both biblical and non-biblical) that is relevant to an issue, and in this case the textual evidence purports, at least, to give a different view from that which archaeologists now tend to favor (or most of them, anyway).\"{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=25}}\n\n==Cultural significance==\n[[File:A Seder table setting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Seder table setting, commemorating the Passover and Exodus]]\nThe Exodus is invoked daily in [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Jewish prayers]] and celebrated each year at the feasts of [[Pesach]] (Passover) and [[Shavuot]], the two being known respectively as \"the time of our freedom\" and \"the time our Torah was given\".{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The two are closely linked, with Pesach announcing that the freedom it introduces is only fully realised with the giving of the law (the Torah).{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} A third Jewish festival, [[Sukkot]], the Festival of Booths, is associated with the Israelites living in booths after they left their previous homes in Egypt.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The festivals now associated with the Exodus (Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot) began as agricultural and seasonal feasts but became completely subsumed into the central Exodus myth of Israel's deliverance from oppression at the hands of God.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The fringes worn at the corners of traditional Jewish prayer shawls are described as a physical reminder of the obligation to observe the laws given at the climax of Exodus: \"Look at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord\" (Numbers).{{sfn|Sarason|2015|p=53}}\n\nA number of historical events and situations have been compared to the Exodus. Many early American settlers interpreted their flight from Europe to a new life in America as a new exodus. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] recommended for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to depict Moses leading the Israelites across the Red Sea. African Americans suffering under slavery and racial oppression interpreted their situation in terms of the Exodus, making it a catalyst for social change.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=107}}{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=335}}{{sfn|Coomber|2012|p=123}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible|Judaism}}\n* [[Book of Joshua]], the continuation of the narrative in the conquest of Canaan\n* [[Ipuwer Papyrus]]\n* [[List of films based on the Bible#Moses (Exodus-Deuteronomy)|List of films related to the Exodus]]\n* [[Stations of the Exodus]]\n* [[Va'eira]], [[Bo (parsha)]], and [[Beshalach]]: [[parsha|Torah portions (''parashot'')]] telling the Exodus story\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last1          = Anderson\n| first1         = Bradford A.\n| last2          = Gooder\n| first2         = Paula\n| author-link2   = Paula Gooder\n| title          = An Introduction to the Study of the Pentateuch\n| year           = 2017\n| publisher      = Bloomsbury \n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=ebXFDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT135&dq=%22how+then+to+explain+the+emergence+of+the+exodus+tradition#v=onepage&q=%22how%20then%20to%20explain%20the%20emergence%20of%20the%20exodus%20tradition%3F%22&f=false\n| isbn           = 9780567656407\n| ref            = harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = The Invention of Religion: Faith and Covenant in the Book of Exodus\n| publisher      = Princeton University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=K7s7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| year           = 2018\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9781400889235\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt\n| publisher      = Harvard University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/books?id=IjUiie30Z9cC&pg=PA34\n| year           = 2009\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9780674020306\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|first=Jan \n|last=Assmann\n|title=From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsjmCwAAQBAJ\n|year=2014\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|isbn=978-977-416-631-0\n|ref=harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Bandstra\n| first          = Barry L.\n| title          = Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n| year           = 2008\n| publisher      = Cengage Learning\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn           = 978-0495391050\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Barmash\n| first          = Pamela\n| chapter        = Introduction: The Exodus: Central, Learning, and Generative\n| editor1-last   = Barmash\n| editor1-first  = Pamela\n| editor2-last   = Nelson\n| editor2-first  = W.

In first book of the Pentateuch, the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Israelites]] had come to live in Egypt in the [[Land of Goshen]] during a famine due to the fact that an Israelite, [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]], had become a high official in the court of the [[pharaoh]]. Exodus begins with the deaths of Joseph and the ascension of a new pharaoh \"who did not know Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8). The pharaoh becomes concerned by the number and strength of Israelites in Egypt and enslaves them, commanding them to build at two \"supply cities\" called [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Rameses]] (Exodus 1:11).{{efn|The [[Septuagint]] version includes a reference to a third \"supply city\": \" On,  which  is  [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]\" (LXX Exodus 1:11, trans. Larry J. Perkins).}} The pharaoh also orders the slaughter at birth of all male Hebrew children. One Hebrew child, however, is rescued by being placed in a basket on the [[Nile]]. He is found and adopted by [[Pharaoh's daughter (Exodus)|Pharaoh's daughter]], who names him [[Moses]]. Moses eventually kills an Egyptian he sees beating a Hebrew slave, and is forced to flee to [[Midian]], marrying a daughter of the Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. The old pharaoh dies and a new one ascends to the throne.\n\nMoses, in Midian, goes to [[Mount Horeb]], where [[Yahweh]] appears in a [[Burning Bush]] and commands him to go to Egypt to free the Hebrew slaves and bring them to the [[promised land]] in [[Canaan]]. Yahweh also speaks to Moses's brother [[Aaron]]; they both assemble the Israelites and perform signs so that they believe in Yahweh's promise. Moses and Aaron then go to the Pharaoh and ask him to let the Israelites go into the desert for a religious festival, but the Pharaoh refuses and commands the Israelites to make [[bricks without straw]] and increases their workload. Moses and Aaron return to the Pharaoh and this time ask him to free the Israelites. The Pharaoh demands for Moses to perform a [[miracle]], and Aaron throws down [[Staff of Moses|Moses' staff]], which turns into a snake; however, the Pharaoh's magicians{{efn|These magicians are referred to in the Hebrew text as {{lang|he|\u1e25artumm\u00eem|italics=yes}}, which derives from [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] {{lang|egy|\u1e25rj-tp|italic=yes}} ([[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] {{lang|egy|p-hritob|italics=yes}}, {{lang-akk|\u1e25ar-tibi|italic=yes}}) a title meaning \"chief\" and shortened from \"chief lector priest\".{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=139}} The Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate Moses and Aaron's actions until the third plague (gnats), when they are the first to recognize that a divine power is at work (Exodus 8:19). In plague four (festering boils), they themselves are afflicted and no longer contest with Moses and Aaron.{{sfn|Assmann|2018|pp=139-142}}}} are also able to do this, though Moses' staff devours the others. The Pharaoh then refuses to let the Israelites go.\n\n[[File:Israel's Escape from Egypt.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Exodus from Egypt by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]\nAfter this, Yahweh begins inflicting the [[Plagues of Egypt]] on the Egyptians for each time that Moses goes to Pharaoh and Pharaoh refuses to release the Israelites. Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate the first plagues, in which Yahweh turns the Nile to blood and produces a plague of frogs, but are unable to reproduce any plagues after the third, the plague of gnats. After each plague Pharaoh allows the Israelites to worship Yahweh to remove the plague, then refuses to free them. In the final plague, Yahweh kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, but the Israelites, who have been commanded to kill one lamb per family and smear its blood on their doorposts, are spared. Yahweh commands that the Israelites observe a festival as \"a perpetual ordinance\" to remember this event (Exodus 12:14). Pharaoh finally agrees to let the Israelites go after his firstborn son is killed. Yahweh leads the Israelites in the form of a [[pillar of cloud]] in the day and a [[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] at night. However, once the Israelites have already left, Pharaoh changes his mind and pursues the Israelites to the shore of the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses his staff to [[parting of the Red Sea|part the Red Sea]], and the Israelites cross on dry ground, but the sea closes down on the pursuing Egyptians, drowning them all.\n\nThe Israelites now begin to complain about Aaron and Moses, as Yahweh miraculously provided them first with water and food, eventually raining [[manna]] down for them to eat. [[Amalek]] attacks at [[Rephidim]] but is defeated in battle. Jethro comes to Moses with Moses's wife and sons; on Jethro's advice, Moses appoints judges for the tribes of Israel. The Israelites reach the [[Sinai Desert]] and Yahweh calls Moses to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], where [[Yahweh]] reveals himself to his people and establishes the [[Ten Commandments]] and [[Mosaic covenant]]: the Israelites are to keep his ''torah'' (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will give them the land of Canaan. Yahweh establishes the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] and various rules for ritual worship, among other laws. However, in Moses's absence the Israelites sin against Yahweh by creating the idol of a [[golden calf]], and as retaliation Yahweh has the [[Levites]] kill three thousand people (Exodus 32:28) and Yahweh sends a plague on the Israelites. The Israelites now accept the covenant, build a [[tabernacle]] for Yahweh, and receive their laws. Yahweh commands Moses to take a [[census]] of the Israelites and establishes the duties of the Levites. Then the Israelites depart from Mount Sinai.\n\nYahweh commands Moses to send [[The Twelve Spies|twelve spies]] ahead to Canaan to scout the land. The spies discover that the Canaanites are strong, and, believing that the Israelites cannot defeat them, the spies falsely report to the Israelites that Canaan is full of giants so that the Israelites will not invade (Numbers 13:31-33). The Israelites refuse to go to Canaan, so Yahweh manifests himself and declares that the generation that left Egypt will have to pass away before the Israelites can enter Canaan. The Israelites will have to remain in the wilderness for forty years, and Yahweh kills the spies through a plague except for the righteous [[Joshua]] and [[Caleb]], who will be allowed to enter the promised land. A group of Israelites led by [[Korah]], son of Izhar, rebels against Moses, but Yahweh opens the earth and sends them living to [[Sheol]].\n\nThe Israelites come to the oasis of [[Kadesh Barnea]], where [[Miriam]] dies. The people are without water, so Yahweh commands Moses to get water from a rock by speaking to it, but Moses strikes the rock with his staff instead, for which Yahweh forbids him from entering the promised land. Moses sends a messenger to the king of [[Edom]] requesting passage through his land to Canaan, but the king refuses. The Israelites then go to [[Mount Hor]], where Aaron dies. The Israelites try to go around Edom, but the Israelites complain about lack of bread and water, so Yahweh sends a plague of poisonous snakes to afflict them. After Moses prays for deliverance, Yahweh has him create the [[brazen serpent]], and the Israelites who look at it are cured. The Israelites are soon in conflict with various other kingdoms, and king [[Balak]] of [[Moab]] attempts to have the seer [[Balaam]] curse the Israelites, but Balaam blesses the Israelites instead. Some Israelites begin having sexual relations with Moabite women and [[Heresy of Peor|worshipping Moabite gods]], so Yahweh orders Moses to [[impalement|impale]] the idolators and sends a plague, but the full extent of Yahweh's wrath is averted when [[Phinehas]] impales an Israelite and a Midianite woman having intercourse (Numbers 25:7-9). Yahweh commands the Israelites to destroy the Midianites and Moses and Phinehas take another census. They then conquer the lands of [[Og]] and [[Sihon]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], settling the [[Gadites]], [[Reubenites]], and half the [[Tribe of Manasseh]] there.\n\nMoses then addresses the Israelites for a final time on the banks of the [[Jordan River]], reviewing their travels and giving them further laws. Yahweh tells Moses to summon Joshua, whom Yahweh commissions to lead the conquest of Canaan. Yahweh tells Moses to ascend [[Mount Nebo]], from where he sees the promised land and where he dies.\n\n===Covenant and law===\nThe climax of the Exodus is the covenant (binding legal agreement) between God and Israel mediated by Moses at Sinai: Yahweh will protect Israel as his chosen people for all time, and  Israel will keep Yahweh's laws and worship only him.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The covenant is described in stages: at Exodus 24:3\u20138 the Israelites agree to abide by the \"book of the covenant\" that Moses has just read to them; shortly afterwards God writes the \"words of the covenant\" \u2013 the [[Ten Commandments]] \u2013 on stone tablets; and finally, as the people gather in Moab to cross into Canaan, the land God has promised them, Moses makes a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel \"beside the covenant he made with them at Horeb\" (Deuteronomy 29:1).{{sfn|McKenzie|2000|p=4\u20135}} The laws are set out in a number of codes:{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=146}}\n* [[Ethical Decalogue]] (i.e., the Ten Commandments), Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5;\n* The [[Covenant Code|Book of the Covenant]], Exodus 20:22\u201323:3;\n* [[Ritual Decalogue]], Exodus 34;\n* The ritual laws of [[Leviticus]] 1\u20136 and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1\u201310;\n* The [[Holiness Code]], Leviticus 17\u201326;\n* Deuteronomic Code, [[Deuteronomy]] 12\u201326.\n\n==Development and final composition==\n[[File:109.Ezra Reads the Law to the People.jpg|thumb|''Ezra Reads the Law to the People'' ([[Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for ''La Grande Bible de Tours'']], 1866)]]\nThe earliest traces of the traditions behind the exodus appear in the northern prophets [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (possibly) and [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] (certainly), both active in the 8th century BCE in  northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], but their southern contemporaries [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and [[Book of Micah|Micah]] show no knowledge of an exodus.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}} (Micah 6:45 contains a reference to the exodus, which many scholars take to be an addition by a later editor.){{efn|Micah 6:45 (\"I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.

Weinberg and called the \"Citizen-Temple Community\", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=226\u2013227}} The books containing the Exodus story served as an \"identity card\" defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=225}}\n\n== Origins and historicity ==\n{{See also|Sources and parallels of the Exodus|Historicity of the Bible}}\nThere are two main positions on the historicity of the Exodus in modern scholarship.{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}} The majority position is that the biblical Exodus narrative has some ultimate historicity, although there is little of historical worth in the biblical narrative.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}}{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} The other main position, often associated with the school of [[Biblical minimalism]],{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=23-24}} is that the Exodus has no historical basis. Both positions are in agreement that the biblical Exodus narrative is best understood as a [[founding myth]] of the Jewish people, explaining their origins and providing an ideological foundation for their culture and institutions, not an accurate depiction of the history of the Israelites.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=46}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} A third position, that the biblical narrative is essentially correct (\"Biblical maximalism\"), is today held by \"few, if any [...] in mainstream scholarship, only on the more fundamentalist fringes.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}}\n\nMainstream scholarship no longer accepts the biblical Exodus account as accurate history for a number of reasons. No modern attempt to identify a historical Egyptian prototype for Moses has found wide acceptance, and no period in Egyptian history matches the Biblical accounts of the Exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=63-64}} Some elements of the story are clearly meant to be [[Miracle|miraculous]] and defy rational explanation, such as the [[Plagues of Egypt]] and the [[Crossing of the Red Sea]].{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=15-17}} Lester Grabbe argues that \"attempts to find naturalistic explanations [for these events] [...] miss the point: the aim of the narrative is to magnify the power of Yhwh and Moses.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=93}} The Bible also fails to mention the names of any of the Pharaohs involved in the Exodus narrative.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=69}} While [[ancientEgypt|ancient Egyptian]] texts from the [[New Kingdom]] mention \"Asiatics\" living in Egypt as slaves and workers, these people cannot be securely connected to the Israelites, and no contemporary Egyptian text mentions a large-scale exodus of slaves like that described in the Bible.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|pp=2-3}} The earliest surviving historical mention of the Israelites, the Egyptian [[Merneptah Stele]] (c. 1207 BCE), appears to place them in or around Canaan and gives no indication of any exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=65-67}} The numbers of people involved in the Exodus as given in the Bible are fanciful, as the [[Sinai Desert]] could never have supported the 603,550 Israelites mentioned in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1:46.{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=18-19}} Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion \u2013 that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible \u2013 seems irrefutable [...] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence.\"{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=63}} Instead, modern archaeology suggests continuity between Canaanite and Israelite settlement, indicating a primarily Canaanite origin for Israel.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=4}}{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}}\n\nA majority of scholars nevertheless still believes that the Exodus has some historical basis,{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}} with Kenton Sparks referring to it as \"mythologized history.\"{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} Evidence in favor of historical traditions forming a background to the Exodus myth include the documented movements of small groups of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] into and out of Egypt during the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] and [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasties]], some elements of Egyptian [[folklore]] and culture in the Exodus narrative,{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=8-10}} and the names Moses, Aaron and Phinehas, which seem to have an Egyptian origin.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=65}} The expulsion of the [[Hyksos]], a Semitic group that had conquered much of Egypt, by the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt]] is frequently discussed as a potential historical parallel or origin for the story.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=78}}{{sfn|Redford|1992|pp=412\u2013413}} Avraham Faust and William Dever argue that a group of Egyptian origin, whom Dever cautiously identifies as \"the house of Joseph\",{{sfn|Dever|2003|p=231}} may have joined the Israelites after their initial [[ethnogenesis|formation]] in Canaan, and that their story could have become adopted as the national myth of the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=229\u2013231}}  It is also possible that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the late second millennium BCE may have aided the adoption of the story of a small group of Egyptian refugees by the native Canaanites among the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}} Most proposals for a historical Exodus of any sort place it in the sixteenth, fifteenth, or thirteenth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=77}} Alternatively, Nadav Na'aman argues that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the Nineteenth and especially the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] may have inspired the Exodus narrative, forming a \"[[collective memory]]\" of Egyptian oppression that was transferred from Canaan to Egypt itself in the popular consciousness.{{sfn|Na'aman|2011|pp=62-69}}\n\nSome scholars, including the biblical minimalists, show more skepticism toward ascribing any [[historicity]] at all to the exodus,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=95}}\nwith some arguing that the myth has its origins in the [[Babylonian exile|exilic]] and post-exilic Jewish community and has little to no historical basis.{{sfn|Russell|2009|pp=11-14}} Lester Grabbe, for instance, argues that \"[t]here is no compelling reason that the exodus has to be rooted in history,\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=84}} and that the details of the story more closely fit the seventh through the fifth centuries BCE than the traditional dating to the second millennium BCE.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=85}} Rejecting the traditional view that the Exodus records pre-exilic traditions, Philip R. Davies suggests that the story may have been inspired by the return to Israel of Israelites and Judaeans who were placed in Egypt as garrison troops by the [[Assyria]]ns in the fifth and sixth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=105}} Historian Graham Davies has criticized minimalist scholars for relying too heavily on archaeology, stating \"a historian cannot simply ignore the textual evidence (both biblical and non-biblical) that is relevant to an issue, and in this case the textual evidence purports, at least, to give a different view from that which archaeologists now tend to favor (or most of them, anyway).\"{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=25}}\n\n==Cultural significance==\n[[File:A Seder table setting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Seder table setting, commemorating the Passover and Exodus]]\nThe Exodus is invoked daily in [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Jewish prayers]] and celebrated each year at the feasts of [[Pesach]] (Passover) and [[Shavuot]], the two being known respectively as \"the time of our freedom\" and \"the time our Torah was given\".{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The two are closely linked, with Pesach announcing that the freedom it introduces is only fully realised with the giving of the law (the Torah).{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} A third Jewish festival, [[Sukkot]], the Festival of Booths, is associated with the Israelites living in booths after they left their previous homes in Egypt.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The festivals now associated with the Exodus (Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot) began as agricultural and seasonal feasts but became completely subsumed into the central Exodus myth of Israel's deliverance from oppression at the hands of God.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The fringes worn at the corners of traditional Jewish prayer shawls are described as a physical reminder of the obligation to observe the laws given at the climax of Exodus: \"Look at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord\" (Numbers).{{sfn|Sarason|2015|p=53}}\n\nA number of historical events and situations have been compared to the Exodus. Many early American settlers interpreted their flight from Europe to a new life in America as a new exodus. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] recommended for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to depict Moses leading the Israelites across the Red Sea. African Americans suffering under slavery and racial oppression interpreted their situation in terms of the Exodus, making it a catalyst for social change.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=107}}{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=335}}{{sfn|Coomber|2012|p=123}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible|Judaism}}\n* [[Book of Joshua]], the continuation of the narrative in the conquest of Canaan\n* [[Ipuwer Papyrus]]\n* [[List of films based on the Bible#Moses (Exodus-Deuteronomy)|List of films related to the Exodus]]\n* [[Stations of the Exodus]]\n* [[Va'eira]], [[Bo (parsha)]], and [[Beshalach]]: [[parsha|Torah portions (''parashot'')]] telling the Exodus story\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last1          = Anderson\n| first1         = Bradford A.\n| last2          = Gooder\n| first2         = Paula\n| author-link2   = Paula Gooder\n| title          = An Introduction to the Study of the Pentateuch\n| year           = 2017\n| publisher      = Bloomsbury \n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=ebXFDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT135&dq=%22how+then+to+explain+the+emergence+of+the+exodus+tradition#v=onepage&q=%22how%20then%20to%20explain%20the%20emergence%20of%20the%20exodus%20tradition%3F%22&f=false\n| isbn           = 9780567656407\n| ref            = harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = The Invention of Religion: Faith and Covenant in the Book of Exodus\n| publisher      = Princeton University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=K7s7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| year           = 2018\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9781400889235\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt\n| publisher      = Harvard University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/books?id=IjUiie30Z9cC&pg=PA34\n| year           = 2009\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9780674020306\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|first=Jan \n|last=Assmann\n|title=From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsjmCwAAQBAJ\n|year=2014\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|isbn=978-977-416-631-0\n|ref=harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Bandstra\n| first          = Barry L.\n| title          = Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n| year           = 2008\n| publisher      = Cengage Learning\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn           = 978-0495391050\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Barmash\n| first          = Pamela\n| chapter        = Introduction: The Exodus: Central, Learning, and Generative\n| editor1-last   = Barmash\n| editor1-first  = Pamela\n| editor2-last   = Nelson\n| editor2-first  = W.
