The idea behind the collaboration was that [[Singapore]] being a tropical country, many Singaporeans have never had the opportunity to experience the cold climates and snow. With the set up of Snow City will give everybody a chance to learn more about snow, in a fun way.\n\n==Highlights==\nVisitors will first arrive at the ''[[airlock|Air Lock]]'', which is maintained at 10[[Celsius|\u00b0C]]. This \nallows visitors to become comfortable with the lower temperatures before they enter the chamber itself.\n\nThe major focus of Snow City is its ''Snow Chamber'', a 1200 sq-metre room covered with snow. The Snow Chamber is well maintained at -5[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] and snow level is kept constantly at 40CM in depth. Between 10 and 15 tons of snow is created each week in order to maintain this level. The snow is produced using a special '''Snow Gun''', which cools water using [[liquid nitrogen]].\n\nInside the Snow Chamber, is a 60 meter long high slope  which is about 3 storeys high. 'Snowtubing' is the main activity, where visitors will be sliding down the snow slope while sitting on an inflatable tube.\n\nThere is also a Snow-Play Area for the younger children.\n\nThere is a place for wine and dine on level 2, named ''Alphine Lodge''.\n\nSnow City's sound educational programmes and workshops are available to schools and interested groups.\n\n==Technology==\nA specially designed '''Snow Gun''' is used in the production of snow on site.\n\nFirstly, water is atomized using high-pressure compressed air. The water then arrives at the snow gun and is pushed out of the special nozzles at the end of the barrel. [[nitrogen|Liquid nitrogen]] at a temperature of approx. -196[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] is also passed through the snow gun at the same time. The extreme cold of the liquid nitrogen instantly freezes the atomized water into [[snowflake]]-like crystallites.\n\nThe simplified formula to produce snow is \n*One ton of liquid nitrogen + one ton of water = one ton of \"snow\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.snowcity.com.sg Snow City Singapore Website]\n\n{{Major Tourist Attractions in Singapore}}\n\n[[Category:Sports venues in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Jurong East]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Singapore]]\n[[Category:2000 establishments in Singapore]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Singapore's first indoor snow centre located within the Science Centre Singapore}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{advert|date=January 2018}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2018}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox building\n| name                = Snow City\n| native_name         = \n| native_name_lang    = \n| logo                = \n| logo_size           = \n| logo_alt            = \n| logo_caption        = \n| image               = \n| image_size          = \n| image_alt           = <!-- or | alt = -->\n| image_caption       = <!-- or | caption = -->\n| map_type            = Singapore\n| map_alt             = \n| map_caption         = \n| map_size            = \n| map_dot_label       = \n| map_dot_mark        = \n| relief              = \n| former_names        = \n| alternate_names     = \n| etymology           = \n| status              = Open\n| cancelled           = \n| topped_out          = \n| building_type       = \n| architectural_style = \n| classification      = \n| location            = [[Jurong East]], [[Singapore]]\n| address             = 21 Jurong Town Hall Road, Singapore 609433\n| location_city       = <!-- or | location_town       =  -->\n| location_country    = [[Singapore]]\n| coordinates         = {{Coord|1|20|06.6|N|103|44|06.7|E|display=title}}\n| altitude            = \n| current_tenants     = \n| namesake            = \n| groundbreaking_date = \n| start_date          = \n| stop_date           = \n| est_completion      = \n| topped_out_date     = \n| completion_date     = \n| opened_date         = {{Start date and age|df=yes|2000|06|03}}\n| inauguration_date   = \n| relocated_date      = \n| renovation_date     = 2007 <br> 2015\n| closing_date        = \n| demolition_date     = <!-- or | destruction_date    = -->\n| cost                = [[Singapore dollar|S]]$6 million\n| ren_cost            = \n| client              = \n| owner               = \n| landlord            = \n| affiliation         = [[Science Centre Singapore]]\n| height              = \n| architectural       = \n| tip                 = \n| antenna_spire       = \n| roof                = \n| top_floor           = \n| observatory         = \n| diameter            = \n| circumference       = \n| weight              = \n| other_dimensions    = \n| structural_system   = \n| material            = \n| size                = \n| floor_count         = 2\n| floor_area          = {{convert|3000|sqm|sqft}}\n| elevator_count      = \n| grounds_area        = \n| architect           = \n| architecture_firm   = \n| developer           = \n| engineer            = \n| structural_engineer = \n| services_engineer   = \n| civil_engineer      = \n| other_designers     = \n| quantity_surveyor   = \n| main_contractor     = \n| awards              = \n| designations        = \n| known_for           = Singapore's first indoor snow centre\n| ren_architect       = \n| ren_firm            = \n| ren_engineer        = \n| ren_str_engineer    = \n| ren_serv_engineer   = \n| ren_civ_engineer    = \n| ren_oth_designers   = \n| ren_qty_surveyor    = \n| ren_contractor      = \n| ren_awards          = \n| rooms               = <!-- or | unit_count          = -->\n| parking             =  \n| website             = {{URL|http://www.snowcity.com.sg}}\n| embed               = \n| embedded            = \n| references          = \n| footnotes           = \n}}\n\n'''Snow City''' is [[Singapore|Singapore's]] first indoor snow centre located within the [[Science Centre Singapore]] area beside the [[Omni-Theatre, Science Centre Singapore|Omni-Theatre]] in [[Jurong East]].\n\n==Background==\nThe 3,000 sq-metre centre Snow City was built at a cost of S$6 million and was officially opened on 3 June 2000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Opening of \"Snow City\"  |url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/css20000603e.pdf |website=NAS |accessdate=1 August 2019 |date=3 June 2000}}</ref> It was a joint venture by the [[Science Centre, Singapore]] and [[National Trades Union Congress|NTUC]] Income Co-operative Pte Ltd.

At present,{{When|date=October 2015}} H\u1ea1 Long is experiencing rapid growth not only in tourism sphere, but as a place upon the main road to southern China. In 2007 Vietnam-China Business Forum, a $400 million deal was signed to build a highway linking H\u1ea1 Long, [[M\u00f3ng C\u00e1i]] and [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh]].\n\nH\u1ea1 Long city is divided into two parts: East H\u1ea1 Long and West H\u1ea1 Long. The eastern part, H\u00f2n Gai, where most of the official buildings and industry are concentrated, is connected by bridge with the western part, [[B\u00e3i Ch\u00e1y]], considered to be more of a tourism attraction.\n\nThe biggest hotel in Vietnam is planned to be built on the bay, beginning from 2007.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''H\u1ea1 Long'' is derived from the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] [[wikt:\u4e0b|\u4e0b]][[wikt:\u9f8d|\u9f8d]], meaning \"descending dragon\". For more about the origin of this name, see [[H\u1ea1 Long Bay]].\n\n== Location ==\nBeing a coastal city, it has unique potentials of tourism and seaport due to its land lies along the shore of H\u1ea1 Long Bay of 50&nbsp;km, and is 160&nbsp;km to the north-east from [[Ha Noi]], 60&nbsp;km to the west from [[Hai Phong]], 180&nbsp;km to the east from [[M\u00f3ng C\u00e1i]] international border gate, and bounded by the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] to the south. H\u1ea1 Long has strategic location of economic development, security of the region and the country.\n\n== Culture and society ==\nIn the south of the city there is Bai Tho (\u2018Poem\u2019) Mountain with its almost vertical seaward face, which was widely used by some famous local poets. The limestone peak is rich in bio-diversity and offers attractive views of the bay. There are also such places of interest as Cua Van Fishing Village, Hoang Gia Park, H\u1ea1 Long Market, B\u00e3i Ch\u00e1y Trading Center, Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Museum, Vietnam-Japan Cultural House, Children's Cultural House.\n\nH\u1ea1 Long city has an active [[Roman Catholic]] church in its eastern part, H\u00f2n Gai, on the hill near the main [[post office]], which has Mass on Sunday evenings and on Christian holidays.\n\n== History == \nMan has been present on H\u1ea1 Long Bay for a long time. Over the years, archaeologists, researchers concluded that during the application process of history, there were three cultures which called Soi Nhu, H\u1ea1 Long and Cai Beo culture. It shows that the bay and surrounding areas were one of the cradles of mankind.\nHeartland of today's H\u1ea1 Long City, formerly just a fishing village, called the ''[[Oyster]] Coast''. By the beginning of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]], it was renamed to Mau Le. The current city was then part of [[Ho\u00e0nh B\u1ed3 District]].\n\nIn 1883, the French occupied the bay area, they carried out coal mining in the mines on the Gulf Coast. As on many islands there was lots of hemp so French called ''Ile des brouilles'' or a name translated from '''Hon Gai''' to Hon Gay, later renamed Hon Gai. According to the researchers, Hon Gai is calling deviation from the place of the French Red Sea at that time. The \"H\" in French is a silent sound. Be sure to read the later Hongay or Hon Gai. During this period, Hon Gai was an administrative unit of [[Qu\u1ea3ng Y\u00ean Province]].\n\nAfter the [[August Revolution]] in 1945, this township became the capital town of the huge Hong Gai mine area. Late in 1946, the French reconquest of Hon Gai. After [[Geneva Conference (1954)]], Hong Gai town was the capital of the Hong Quang special district. October 30, 1963, the government combined Hai Ninh province and Hong Quang special district to create [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Province]], Hong Gai which became the capital of Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh, while expanding town to the east and west. Hong Gai town center provided coal for all industrial zones of [[North Vietnam]]. It also was the gateway to connect with China so it was the focus of the U.S. raiding fierce in war. B\u00e3i Ch\u00e1y Ferry (decommissioned in 2007, this was replaced by the B\u00e3i Ch\u00e1y Bridge) was the most important transportation hub, with American bombs destroyed many times, awarded [[Hero of the People's Armed Forces]] 3 times.\n\nOn December 27, 1993, the government issued Decree No. 102/CP. Hong Gai town officially gained its city status and was renamed '''H\u1ea1 Long'''.\n\nOn December 17, 2019, the city annexed the district of [[Ho\u00e0nh B\u1ed3 District|Ho\u00e0nh B\u1ed3]].<ref>[http://vanban.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=2&_page=1&mode=detail&document_id=198702 Decree No. 837/NQ-UBTVQH14]</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThe city is subdivided to 33 [[Commune-level subdivisions (Vietnam)|commune-level subdivisions]], including 21 [[Ward (Vietnam)|wards]] and 12 [[Commune (Vietnam)|rural communes]]:\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"6\" width=\"100%\" align=\"center\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; margin-top: 16px\"\n!

The name H\u1ea1 Long means \"descending dragon\". The city was created in 1993, when the old capital, H\u00f2n Gai, was merged with [[B\u00e3i Ch\u00e1y]] \u2013 the main tourist area. The city mainly lies on [[H\u1ea1 Long Bay]]. It is located at about {{convert|178|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Hanoi]]. The population in 2013 was 227,000.<ref name=\"TN\">[http://www.thuvienphapluat.vn/archive/Nghi-quyet/Nghi-quyet-07-NQ-CP-thanh-lap-cac-phuong-thanh-pho-Ha-Long-Mong-Cai-tinh-Quang-Ninh-vb101222t13.aspx Ngh\u1ecb quy\u1ebft s\u1ed1 07/NQ-CP  ng\u00e0y 05 th\u00e1ng 02 n\u0103m 2010 c\u1ee7a Ch\u00ednh ph\u1ee7] v\u1ec1 vi\u1ec7c th\u00e0nh l\u1eadp c\u00e1c ph\u01b0\u1eddng thu\u1ed9c th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ea1 Long v\u00e0 th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 M\u00f3ng C\u00e1i, t\u1ec9nh Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh.</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe city's economy has recently{{When|date=October 2015}} switched from coal mining to tourism, due to the large number of visitors drawn by the H\u1ea1 Long Islets every year. At present,{{When|date=October 2015}} H\u1ea1 Long is experiencing rapid growth not only in tourism sphere, but as a place upon the main road to southern China. In 2007 Vietnam-China Business Forum, a $400 million deal was signed to build a highway linking H\u1ea1 Long, [[M\u00f3ng C\u00e1i]] and [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh]].\n\nH\u1ea1 Long city is divided into two parts: East H\u1ea1 Long and West H\u1ea1 Long. The eastern part, H\u00f2n Gai, where most of the official buildings and industry are concentrated, is connected by bridge with the western part, [[B\u00e3i Ch\u00e1y]], considered to be more of a tourism attraction.\n\nThe biggest hotel in Vietnam is planned to be built on the bay, beginning from 2007.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''H\u1ea1 Long'' is derived from the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] [[wikt:\u4e0b|\u4e0b]][[wikt:\u9f8d|\u9f8d]], meaning \"descending dragon\". For more about the origin of this name, see [[H\u1ea1 Long Bay]].\n\n== Location ==\nBeing a coastal city, it has unique potentials of tourism and seaport due to its land lies along the shore of H\u1ea1 Long Bay of 50&nbsp;km, and is 160&nbsp;km to the north-east from [[Ha Noi]], 60&nbsp;km to the west from [[Hai Phong]], 180&nbsp;km to the east from [[M\u00f3ng C\u00e1i]] international border gate, and bounded by the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] to the south. H\u1ea1 Long has strategic location of economic development, security of the region and the country.\n\n== Culture and society ==\nIn the south of the city there is Bai Tho (\u2018Poem\u2019) Mountain with its almost vertical seaward face, which was widely used by some famous local poets. The limestone peak is rich in bio-diversity and offers attractive views of the bay. There are also such places of interest as Cua Van Fishing Village, Hoang Gia Park, H\u1ea1 Long Market, B\u00e3i Ch\u00e1y Trading Center, Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Museum, Vietnam-Japan Cultural House, Children's Cultural House.\n\nH\u1ea1 Long city has an active [[Roman Catholic]] church in its eastern part, H\u00f2n Gai, on the hill near the main [[post office]], which has Mass on Sunday evenings and on Christian holidays.\n\n== History == \nMan has been present on H\u1ea1 Long Bay for a long time. Over the years, archaeologists, researchers concluded that during the application process of history, there were three cultures which called Soi Nhu, H\u1ea1 Long and Cai Beo culture. It shows that the bay and surrounding areas were one of the cradles of mankind.\nHeartland of today's H\u1ea1 Long City, formerly just a fishing village, called the ''[[Oyster]] Coast''. By the beginning of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]], it was renamed to Mau Le. The current city was then part of [[Ho\u00e0nh B\u1ed3 District]].\n\nIn 1883, the French occupied the bay area, they carried out coal mining in the mines on the Gulf Coast. As on many islands there was lots of hemp so French called ''Ile des brouilles'' or a name translated from '''Hon Gai''' to Hon Gay, later renamed Hon Gai. According to the researchers, Hon Gai is calling deviation from the place of the French Red Sea at that time. The \"H\" in French is a silent sound. Be sure to read the later Hongay or Hon Gai. During this period, Hon Gai was an administrative unit of [[Qu\u1ea3ng Y\u00ean Province]].\n\nAfter the [[August Revolution]] in 1945, this township became the capital town of the huge Hong Gai mine area. Late in 1946, the French reconquest of Hon Gai. After [[Geneva Conference (1954)]], Hong Gai town was the capital of the Hong Quang special district. October 30, 1963, the government combined Hai Ninh province and Hong Quang special district to create [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Province]], Hong Gai which became the capital of Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh, while expanding town to the east and west. Hong Gai town center provided coal for all industrial zones of [[North Vietnam]]. It also was the gateway to connect with China so it was the focus of the U.S. raiding fierce in war. B\u00e3i Ch\u00e1y Ferry (decommissioned in 2007, this was replaced by the B\u00e3i Ch\u00e1y Bridge) was the most important transportation hub, with American bombs destroyed many times, awarded [[Hero of the People's Armed Forces]] 3 times.\n\nOn December 27, 1993, the government issued Decree No. 102/CP. Hong Gai town officially gained its city status and was renamed '''H\u1ea1 Long'''.\n\nOn December 17, 2019, the city annexed the district of [[Ho\u00e0nh B\u1ed3 District|Ho\u00e0nh B\u1ed3]].<ref>[http://vanban.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=2&_page=1&mode=detail&document_id=198702 Decree No. 837/NQ-UBTVQH14]</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThe city is subdivided to 33 [[Commune-level subdivisions (Vietnam)|commune-level subdivisions]], including 21 [[Ward (Vietnam)|wards]] and 12 [[Commune (Vietnam)|rural communes]]:\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"6\" width=\"100%\" align=\"center\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; margin-top: 16px\"\n!

The interim term ''mez\u0151'', which also refers to the city's state as an ''oppidum'' \u2013 a city with certain rights given by its feudal ruler \u2013 was later added to the town and its name.<ref>Kiss Lajos: F\u00f6ldrajzi nevek etimol\u00f3giai sz\u00f3t\u00e1ra I.

Budapest: Akad\u00e9miai. 1988. 599. o. {{ISBN|963-05-4568-3}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory===\nThere is evidence of human habitation close to the modern town dating back 6,000 years, and [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence suggests that the area has been continuously inhabited since then by a variety of different cultures. [[Neolithic]] dwellings recessed into the ground stored domestic items such as plates, as well as the ''K\u00f6k\u00e9nydombi V\u00e9nusz'' fertility symbol. Remains have also been found from the [[Copper Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]] and the great migrations period. The town's archaeological treasures can now be seen at the permanent archaeological exhibition of the [[Tornyai J\u00e1nos Museum]].\n\n===Medieval period===\nAt the end of the 8th century, the settling [[Hungarians]] found mostly remnants of the [[nomadic people|nomadic]] population and of the agrarian and animal-breeding [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] who were escaping from the [[Bulgarians]].\n[[File:Hodmezovasarhely-MHB.JPG|thumb|right|300px|H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely Magyar bank]] \nBefore the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasion of Hungary, at least seven villages with churches existed in the area. After the devastation caused by the Mongols, more villages were established, but these later became victims of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] invasion. The territories of these villages were later absorbed by H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely as the town grew. Evidence of more than twenty villages and churches from the [[Middle Ages]] have been found.\n\nThe present town of H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely developed in the 15th century when H\u00f3d, V\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, Tarj\u00e1n, and \u00c1br\u00e1ny, once small villages, became joined and the market town was established. The town is known to have been called H\u00f3dv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely in 1437. The town's location next to the road leading from [[Csongr\u00e1d]] to [[Cenad|Csan\u00e1d]] was advantageous for the development of trade. In the Middle Ages markets, and particularly the trade in livestock, fuelled its growth.\n\nH\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely was part of [[Csongr\u00e1d (county)|Csongr\u00e1d]] [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus]]. Part of that county was under Turkish control after 1542. The region between the Tisza and the [[Danube]] belonged to the [[Ottoman Empire]], while the area to the east of the [[Tisza]], including H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, belonged to [[Transylvania]]. After the military expedition of 1552, the whole of Csongr\u00e1d county was taken by the Turks. The entire area was devastated by the Turkish offensive in 1566. The region was occupied by the Turks for the next 150 years.\n\n===Independence===\nAt the time of the [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] war of independence (1703\u20131711), the town was under the control of Count [[Mikl\u00f3s Bercs\u00e9nyi]]. The royal court confiscated the estate and gave it to imperial general [[Leopold Schlick]]. During the war of independence, [[Mikl\u00f3s Bercs\u00e9nyi]] seized the town back and gave it to the [[Kuruts]] general [[S\u00e1ndor K\u00e1rolyi]] for leasehold. The royal court in [[Vienna]] did not accept K\u00e1rolyi's claim to the territory after the peace of [[Szatm\u00e1r]] and he was only able to retrieve it by buying it back years later. From 1722 to 1818, when landowner jurisdiction was abolished, the K\u00e1rolyi family possessed the town.\n\nIn the 1848&ndash;49 fights for freedom, H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely played a significant part in national events. [[Lajos Kossuth]] reached the town on 3 October 1848 on his second recruiting trip. While there, he received the news that the Hungarian Army had been engaged in battle at [[P\u00e1kozd]], and patriotic fervour gripped the town. Troops from H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely took part in beating off the southern [[Serbia]]n attacks.\n\nAfter the [[Theiss River#Control of the Theiss|control of the Theiss]] in the 1860s, the surrounding lakes and brooks dried up. The inner areas were progressively filled and the town's population increased.\n\nH\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely seceded from the county in 1873 and received the independent municipals rights. The first signs of industrialisation were apparent from that time. In 1890 H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely was the fourth largest Hungarian town with 55,475 inhabitants.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Hodmezovasarhely-Town Hall.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The town hall]]\n[[File:Hodmezovasarhely city limit sign rovas script.jpg|thumb|right|300px|City limit sign written in [[Old Hungarian script]]]]\nThe modern picture of the town was established at the turn of the century. These decades were characterised by the construction of wells, dynamic building operations, and the construction of [[canal]]s. 70 per cent of the population, however, was engaged in farming and animal breeding.\n\nA typical system of settlement was established with a huge system of detached farms. Animal breeding still dominated the livelihood of the inhabitants. Rural animal breeding was characterised by economic efficiency. Quality [[horse]] breeding, which was partly an export product and partly demanded by the needs of agriculture, was profitable. [[Poultry]] and [[egg (food)|egg]] production for the markets also flourished. Animal breeding was gradually replaced by extensive growing of corn, which became the basis of the town's economy and employed large numbers of workers.\n\nThe [[World War I|First World War]] hindered the development of the town and its people suffered losses. The human costs of the war contributed to the [[civil disorder|social tension]] around this time which led to demonstrations in V\u00e1s\u00e1rhely.\n\nIn the first decade of the [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy|Horthy]] era, there was a fairly good market for the town's agricultural products. Although the war and the occupation debilitated the economy of the town, the possibilities for the sale of the high-quality corn increased. [[Pork]] breeding grew, as did the export of poultry. Dozens of medium-scale factories sprung up, but the great [[Great Depression|world economic crisis]] demolished this new-found prosperity. Unemployment increased, until a new economic boom in the late 1930s.\n\nThe [[Second World War]] interrupted the development again. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops reached the town on 25 September 1944. Most of the powerful and well-off citizens escaped from V\u00e1s\u00e1rhely. The war surged through the town on 8 October. The damage in human lives and buildings was not so huge as the damage to industrial equipment and infrastructure.\n\nAt the end of the 1960s giant factories were established. [[Full employment]] was realised but the town's industry proved inefficient. Political and economic bankruptcy, however, only emerged at the end of the 1980s.\n\nAfter the transition in 1990, H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely became a municipal town of county rank.

The interim term ''mez\u0151'', which also refers to the city's state as an ''oppidum'' \u2013 a city with certain rights given by its feudal ruler \u2013 was later added to the town and its name.<ref>Kiss Lajos: F\u00f6ldrajzi nevek etimol\u00f3giai sz\u00f3t\u00e1ra I.

Budapest: Akad\u00e9miai. 1988. 599. o. {{ISBN|963-05-4568-3}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory===\nThere is evidence of human habitation close to the modern town dating back 6,000 years, and [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence suggests that the area has been continuously inhabited since then by a variety of different cultures. [[Neolithic]] dwellings recessed into the ground stored domestic items such as plates, as well as the ''K\u00f6k\u00e9nydombi V\u00e9nusz'' fertility symbol. Remains have also been found from the [[Copper Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]] and the great migrations period. The town's archaeological treasures can now be seen at the permanent archaeological exhibition of the [[Tornyai J\u00e1nos Museum]].\n\n===Medieval period===\nAt the end of the 8th century, the settling [[Hungarians]] found mostly remnants of the [[nomadic people|nomadic]] population and of the agrarian and animal-breeding [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] who were escaping from the [[Bulgarians]].\n[[File:Hodmezovasarhely-MHB.JPG|thumb|right|300px|H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely Magyar bank]] \nBefore the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasion of Hungary, at least seven villages with churches existed in the area. After the devastation caused by the Mongols, more villages were established, but these later became victims of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] invasion. The territories of these villages were later absorbed by H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely as the town grew. Evidence of more than twenty villages and churches from the [[Middle Ages]] have been found.\n\nThe present town of H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely developed in the 15th century when H\u00f3d, V\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, Tarj\u00e1n, and \u00c1br\u00e1ny, once small villages, became joined and the market town was established. The town is known to have been called H\u00f3dv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely in 1437. The town's location next to the road leading from [[Csongr\u00e1d]] to [[Cenad|Csan\u00e1d]] was advantageous for the development of trade. In the Middle Ages markets, and particularly the trade in livestock, fuelled its growth.\n\nH\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely was part of [[Csongr\u00e1d (county)|Csongr\u00e1d]] [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus]]. Part of that county was under Turkish control after 1542. The region between the Tisza and the [[Danube]] belonged to the [[Ottoman Empire]], while the area to the east of the [[Tisza]], including H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, belonged to [[Transylvania]]. After the military expedition of 1552, the whole of Csongr\u00e1d county was taken by the Turks. The entire area was devastated by the Turkish offensive in 1566. The region was occupied by the Turks for the next 150 years.\n\n===Independence===\nAt the time of the [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] war of independence (1703\u20131711), the town was under the control of Count [[Mikl\u00f3s Bercs\u00e9nyi]]. The royal court confiscated the estate and gave it to imperial general [[Leopold Schlick]]. During the war of independence, [[Mikl\u00f3s Bercs\u00e9nyi]] seized the town back and gave it to the [[Kuruts]] general [[S\u00e1ndor K\u00e1rolyi]] for leasehold. The royal court in [[Vienna]] did not accept K\u00e1rolyi's claim to the territory after the peace of [[Szatm\u00e1r]] and he was only able to retrieve it by buying it back years later. From 1722 to 1818, when landowner jurisdiction was abolished, the K\u00e1rolyi family possessed the town.\n\nIn the 1848&ndash;49 fights for freedom, H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely played a significant part in national events. [[Lajos Kossuth]] reached the town on 3 October 1848 on his second recruiting trip. While there, he received the news that the Hungarian Army had been engaged in battle at [[P\u00e1kozd]], and patriotic fervour gripped the town. Troops from H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely took part in beating off the southern [[Serbia]]n attacks.\n\nAfter the [[Theiss River#Control of the Theiss|control of the Theiss]] in the 1860s, the surrounding lakes and brooks dried up. The inner areas were progressively filled and the town\u2019s population increased.\n\nH\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely seceded from the county in 1873 and received the independent municipals rights. The first signs of industrialisation were apparent from that time. In 1890 H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely was the fourth largest Hungarian town with 55,475 inhabitants.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Hodmezovasarhely-Town Hall.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The town hall]]\n[[File:Hodmezovasarhely city limit sign rovas script.jpg|thumb|right|300px|City limit sign written in [[Old Hungarian script]]]]\nThe modern picture of the town was established at the turn of the century. These decades were characterised by the construction of wells, dynamic building operations, and the construction of [[canal]]s. 70 per cent of the population, however, was engaged in farming and animal breeding.\n\nA typical system of settlement was established with a huge system of detached farms. Animal breeding still dominated the livelihood of the inhabitants. Rural animal breeding was characterised by economic efficiency. Quality [[horse]] breeding, which was partly an export product and partly demanded by the needs of agriculture, was profitable. [[Poultry]] and [[egg (food)|egg]] production for the markets also flourished. Animal breeding was gradually replaced by extensive growing of corn, which became the basis of the town\u2019s economy and employed large numbers of workers.\n\nThe [[World War I|First World War]] hindered the development of the town and its people suffered losses. The human costs of the war contributed to the [[civil disorder|social tension]] around this time which led to demonstrations in V\u00e1s\u00e1rhely.\n\nIn the first decade of the [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy|Horthy]] era, there was a fairly good market for the town\u2019s agricultural products. Although the war and the occupation debilitated the economy of the town, the possibilities for the sale of the high-quality corn increased. [[Pork]] breeding grew, as did the export of poultry. Dozens of medium-scale factories sprung up, but the great [[Great Depression|world economic crisis]] demolished this new-found prosperity. Unemployment increased, until a new economic boom in the late 1930s.\n\nThe [[Second World War]] interrupted the development again. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops reached the town on 25 September 1944. Most of the powerful and well-off citizens escaped from V\u00e1s\u00e1rhely. The war surged through the town on 8 October. The damage in human lives and buildings was not so huge as the damage to industrial equipment and infrastructure.\n\nAt the end of the 1960s giant factories were established. [[Full employment]] was realised but the town\u2019s industry proved inefficient. Political and economic bankruptcy, however, only emerged at the end of the 1980s.\n\nAfter the transition in 1990, H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely became a municipal town of county rank.  After the municipal elections, its government was established.\n\nThe town is now a destination for foreign and domestic [[tourism]]. Museums, churches, triumphal wells, statues, parks, and a thermal swimming hall are notable attractions.\n\n== Population ==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote =\n|1850 | 33325\n|1870 | 41018\n|1890 | 47891\n|1900 | 50673\n|1910 | 51920\n|1920 | 50949\n|1930 | 50583\n|1941 | 51159\n|1949 | 48982\n|1960 | 53492\n|1970 | 53715\n|1980 | 54486\n|1990 | 51180\n|2001 | 49382\n|2011 | 46047\n}}\n\n== Politics ==\nThe most recent mayor of H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely was [[Istv\u00e1n Alm\u00e1si]] (Fidesz-KDNP), but he died on 20 November 2017, leaving the position vacant.

These links were originally pre-recorded from a small London studio, up until 1987 when [[ITV Central|Central]] won the contract to produce live links from their Birmingham studios. In 2004, presentation of CITV was relocated to [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] in Manchester, which saw the demise of in-vision continuity. Nine years later, the operations moved to ITV Granada's [[MediaCityUK]] studios in Salford.\n\nIn 2006, CITV launched as a channel in its own right. The CITV channel averages around 100,000 viewers between 4pm-6pm every day. The CITV strand on the ITV network airs on weekend mornings from 6&nbsp;am to 9:25&nbsp;am, as part of the [[ITV Breakfast]] time slot. CITV has no HD or +1 simulcast, unlike the rest of ITV's portfolio of channels.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== ''Watch It!'' and ''Children's ITV'': Early years (1980\u20131989) ===\nBefore being known as ''Children's ITV'', the timeslot for children's programmes on the ITV Network was briefly branded as ''Watch It!''. The ''Watch It!'' brand started on 29 December 1980<ref>Television and Radio, The Times: Monday 29 December 1980</ref> and was presented live by the duty continuity announcer in each ITV region.\n\nThe notion of networking children's continuity was first suggested within ITV as far back as the early 1970s, but with fierce regional identities prevalent \u2013 including scheduling, presentation and programming \u2013 the idea stalled until the late 1970s, when the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]] began to express concern that most ITV shows for children were not consistent or fully networked. On Thursdays, the ITV regions were able to broadcast whatever programmes they wished; many non-children's programmes appeared, such as ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie ]]''. In December 1980, ITV announced its first concerted effort at a more coherent approach to children's output, with the introduction of ''Watch It!'' each weekday from 4.15&nbsp;pm to 5.15&nbsp;pm, after the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]] continued to emphasized issues.<ref>ITV denies profligacy in programme deals. By Kenneth Gosling. ''The Times'', Thursday, 11 December 1980; pg. 4;</ref>\n\n''Watch It!'' was conceived by the promotions department at ATV, with the implementation of the branding differed from region to region, thus it was always transmitted locally and never provided on a network basis. ATV provide different animations each season, to freshen up what was available to each company. Most regions, including Southern/TVS and Granada, would use their own station announcers during ''Watch It!'' airtime.\n\nShortly after the start of new franchises in 1982, some ITV stations raised concerns that ''Watch It!'' had not gone far enough to address previous concerns.<ref>Donald Duck faces the cold shoulder from TV. By Kenneth Gosling. ''The Times'' Thursday, 21 January 1982; pg. 12</ref> Central's Controller of Children's Programmes, Lewis Rudd, suggested a different approach to the presentation method. As a result, the Central promotions department came up with the initial concept for Children's ITV. The new look was devised, and links between programmes were pre-recorded using presenters drawn from the constituent programmes. The networking arrangements were similar to those already in place for the transmission of schools programmes \u2013 the links were played out from Central and the component programmes came from the supplying companies.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/greg.taylor1/watched_it/citv.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010408191056/http://freespace.virgin.net/greg.taylor1/watched_it/citv.html |archivedate=8 April 2001 |title=WATCHED IT! - Children's ITV Presentation |date= |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nChildren's ITV went to air on Monday 3 January 1983,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20780372 |title=CITV set for classic kids TV weekend |publisher=BBC News |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> between 4&nbsp;pm and 5.15&nbsp;pm each weekday afternoon, the extra fifteen minutes being filled by a repeat of one of the pre-school programmes shown at lunchtime the same day. Initially featuring a different presenter each month (usually from children's television), the links were pre-recorded in advance in a small studio at a London facility called Molinare, using a single locked-off camera. The first set design was a rocket ship and was used for the first few months. The concept was eventually retired, and the set and style of presentation used began to reflect the artist presenting that month or the programme that he/she fronted.\n\nBy 1984, the links were still being recorded, but using a common, stylized set known as Network Control, which allowed the presenter to be joined by guests in the studio for interviews. The exterior of this fictitious location also featured in the animations and stings. Technical considerations often left the system flawed. With each programme coming from a different playout source (usually from that of the originating ITV company), and each link being pre-recorded (played out by Central), things often went wrong on air: programmes would be rolled early and the links would be cut short. Programmes would also fail to appear and the presenter would be left on screen. Because each link was recorded for the slot available, the presenter would hold the final pose for a few moments so that the transmission controller at Central had something to leave on screen just in case. Pre-recording the links also meant that late schedule changes could not be easily referenced.\n\nIn September 1985, the BBC revamped their own children's presentation with the introduction of \"Children's BBC\". Using the BBC1 announcer booth at [[BBC Television Centre]], later dubbed \"The Broom Cupboard\", [[Phillip Schofield]] provided links between the programmes. This format of a small self-op continuity studio using one single presenter (and an occasional puppet) continued in largely the same format until 1993, but was broadcast live and allowed for a looser, more relaxed style of presentation than the rival ITV service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebroomcupboard.co.uk/page2.html |title=An Unofficial History of Children's BBC Presentation |publisher=Broom Cupboard |date= |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nChildren's ITV went live two years later. Using the small presentation studio at their [[ITV Central#Studios|Broad Street studios]] \u2013 which had become available since in-vision continuity for the Central region was dropped \u2013 former Central announcer [[Gary Terzza]] and Debbie Shore presented live links from a set built to look like a transmitting station. Although the studio space was small, the designers' use of a plate glass mirror gave the effect of a much larger set. The new live format gave brought a great deal of flexibility; timings could be altered, schedule changes reflected and breakdowns dealt with in a continuous manner. In 1988, the format was refreshed again with a new single presenter, Mark Granger, replacing Terzza and Shore, in a smaller, more basic studio set which included in-vision monitors showing the VT clock of the next scheduled item.\n\n=== The Stonewall Productions era (1989\u20131991) ===\nFrom 3 April 1989, the independent production company ''[[Stonewall Productions]]'' won the contract to produce ''Children's ITV'' presentation.  ''Stonewall Productions'' was headed up by Michael Jackson, a Central staffer who used his expertise to prepare a suitable application.\n\nWhereas Central had restricted links to the station's former in-vision presentation studio, Stonewall chose not to use a fixed set, but instead presented links from various areas of Central's headquarters at Broad Street in Birmingham, utilising a rotating team of presenters which included Clive Warren (now a DJ), Jeanne Downs (a singer), Jerry Foulkes (a producer who left Children's ITV on 22 December 1989) and a large puppet dog called Scally.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>\n\n=== Central regains control (1991\u20132000) ===\n[[File:CITV 90s logo.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|CITV logo (1998\u20132006)]]\nCentral won back the contract to produce the continuity links from 1 April 1991, choosing to revert links back to a small in-vision studio and using one regular presenter, Tommy Boyd. During the 1991\u201393 era, greater importance was being placed throughout television on promotions (trailers) as a way of effectively detailing areas of the schedule to viewers who might not know about them. The 1993 invitation to tender for the provision of the Children's ITV service specified a minimum number of high quality trailers that the successful applicant must produce over the term of the contract. With a large promotions department - and a strong, highly credible reputation for presentation within the ITV network - the contract remained with Central.\n\nIn February 1993, in-vision presentation was dropped by the first Network Centre controller of children's & daytime programming Dawn Airey (a former Central management trainee) with Steven Ryde providing live out-of-vision continuity links featuring a wide variety of animated characters. On 6 September 1993, CITV was extended to start at 3.30&nbsp;pm, when ITV network centre decided to move the pre-school children slot from 12.10&nbsp;pm, to be branded under the CITV in the afternoon slot. Around the same time, the ''Children's ITV'' name was changed to '''CITV''', having been used in some form or another since the previous year. However, the ''Children's'' was not removed from the logo until Monday 2 September 1996, the same month a [[digital on-screen graphic]] (DOG) was introduced.\n\nPresentation for the service was moved in 1997 when Central moved into new, smaller studios at [[Gas Street Studios]] in Birmingham, which continued until Monday 25 May 1998, when a new in-vision service was introduced by the new controller of ITV children's output, Nigel Pickard. Steven Ryde became a producer with Stephen Mulhern and Danielle Nicholls becoming the new presentation team. A new logo was introduced (with traces predecessors), and henceforth the service was referred to as '''CiTV''', until the 2006 re-brand, initially being broadcast from Studio B at Central's Gas Street Studios.\n\n[[ITV Central|Central]] retained the contact to produce CITV for a further two years, seeing off two rival bids from other ITV companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/carlton-regains-citv-job/1215790.article |title=Carlton regains CITV job |publisher=Broadcast |date=18 June 1999 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Shortly after launch, CITV started sharing studio space with the West Midlands edition of ''[[ITV News Central|Central News]]'' in September 1999, allowing room for a large stylised set created by a company called Dorans Propmakers.

Grace also sought support from the ITC for the creation of a separate CITV Ltd company which would allow more children's output to be made in-house - a proposal which ultimately fell apart due to the need for a change in the law and support from the [[Office of Fair Trading]]. A new strand was introduced from 3:25pm every afternoon and was put in place under the name \"CiTV's Telly Tots\". The in-house presentaion was dropped between 3:25 and 4pm and replaced with a CGI animated town using a plane, car and a post box as mascots. A child voiceover was used to introduce it's pre-school shows. Books and video tapes were introduced to tie-in with new strand. <ref>{{cite web|last=Brown |first=Maggie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/12/mondaymediasection |title=Suffer the children |publisher=The Guardian |date=12 November 2001 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Further cuts took place again during 2002 which brought the total cutback to 25% of the overall budget (\u00a330million less).<ref>{{cite web|last=Deans |first=Jason |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/20/ITV.bbc |title=BBC chief calls for strong CITV |publisher=The Guardian |date=20 November 2001 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite the cutbacks, the [[Independent Television Commission|ITC]] noted that CITV had a \"sustained an impressive schedule\", gave \"factual material a fresh look\" and \"continued to produce good dramas\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/itc_notes/view_note73.html |title=ITC Note: Children's Television |publisher=Ofcom |date= |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Just after CITV celebrated its 20th birthday in January 2003, Janie Grace resigned from the post, just before Nigel Pickard was named as ITV's new Director of Programmes.<ref name=\"broadcastnow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/childrens-tv-citv-winning-custody-of-the-children/1109395.article |title=Children's TV: CITV - Winning custody of the children |publisher=Broadcast |date=3 February 2003 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/archives/12597 |title=Granada Kids boss replaces Grace |publisher=C21Media |date=27 February 2003 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Pickard pledged to produce 80 more hours of children's programming in 2003, against a target of 520 hours in 2002 and extend the range of programmes to include more factual and topical programmes and more mixed entertainment and drama,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/itv-puts-colour-back-into-kids/1108923.article |title=ITV puts colour back into kids |publisher=Broadcast |date=29 January 2003 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Once again, concerns about CITV and its structure where highlighted by Angus Fletcher, president of Jim Henson Television Europe, and Anne Wood, founder of Ragdoll Productions, as it could only earn money from a then unreliable advertising market, unlike BBC Worldwide where the likes of [[Teletubbies]], [[Tweenies]] and [[Bob the Builder]] became key money earners for the Corporation.<ref name=\"broadcastnow\"/>\n\nSteven Andrew took over as ITV's controller of children and youth, overseeing the merger of Carlton and Granada's children's departments.

As a consequence, it moved to the multiplex space on Freeview originally held by [[ABC1 (UK)|ABC1]] from English and Scottish transmitters and [[S4C]] from Welsh transmitters, this meant that viewers of the latter were unable to receive the channel on Freeview unless they could receive transmissions from England. On 2 November 2009, the channel was relaunched, with a new logo and new branding to match [[ITV1]] as part of ITV plc's corporate look. The channel's pre-school strand was given a dramatic overhaul, and renamed ''Mini CITV''. Mini CITV is hosted by a group of spacemen-like beings called the Minis, who oversee presentation items on the channel. With the exception of weekends and holidays, ''Mini CITV'' took up the majority of output on the channel for a few years, though this was scaled back in 2012. On 9 January 2012, a change in the [[forward error correction]] mode on the multiplex allowed CITV to broadcast in Wales on Freeview. On 21 December 2012, the channel aired its first live programme since 2006, a 45-minute CITV special of ''[[Text Santa]]'', ITV's Christmas charity appeal. A year later a series of 10-minute programmes titled ''Help for Hattitude'' in aid of the above-mentioned appeal was produced for the channel - both programmes were produced in-house by [[ITV Studios]]. A new look was introduced on 14 January 2013 to coincide with ITV's corporate rebranding.

These links were originally pre-recorded from a small London studio, up until 1987 when [[ITV Central|Central]] won the contract to produce live links from their Birmingham studios. In 2004, presentation of CITV was relocated to [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] in Manchester, which saw the demise of in-vision continuity. Nine years later, the operations moved to ITV Granada's [[MediaCityUK]] studios in Salford.\n\nIn 2006, CITV launched as a channel in its own right. The CITV channel averages around 100,000 viewers between 4pm-6pm every day. The CITV strand on the ITV network airs on weekend mornings from 6&nbsp;am to 9:25&nbsp;am, as part of the [[ITV Breakfast]] time slot. CITV has no HD or +1 simulcast, unlike the rest of ITV's portfolio of channels.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== ''Watch It!'' and ''Children's ITV'': Early years (1980\u20131989) ===\nBefore being known as ''Children's ITV'', the timeslot for children's programmes on the ITV Network was briefly branded as ''Watch It!''. The ''Watch It!'' brand started on 29 December 1980<ref>Television and Radio, The Times: Monday 29 December 1980</ref> and was presented live by the duty continuity announcer in each ITV region.\n\nThe notion of networking children's continuity was first suggested within ITV as far back as the early 1970s, but with fierce regional identities prevalent \u2013 including scheduling, presentation and programming \u2013 the idea stalled until the late 1970s, when the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]] began to express concern that most ITV shows for children were not consistent or fully networked. On Thursdays, the ITV regions were able to broadcast whatever programmes they wished; many non-children's programmes appeared, such as ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie ]]''. In December 1980, ITV announced its first concerted effort at a more coherent approach to children's output, with the introduction of ''Watch It!'' each weekday from 4.15&nbsp;pm to 5.15&nbsp;pm, after the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]] continued to emphasized issues.<ref>ITV denies profligacy in programme deals. By Kenneth Gosling. ''The Times'', Thursday, 11 December 1980; pg. 4;</ref>\n\n''Watch It!'' was conceived by the promotions department at ATV, with the implementation of the branding differed from region to region, thus it was always transmitted locally and never provided on a network basis. ATV provide different animations each season, to freshen up what was available to each company. Most regions, including Southern/TVS and Granada, would use their own station announcers during ''Watch It!'' airtime.\n\nShortly after the start of new franchises in 1982, some ITV stations raised concerns that ''Watch It!'' had not gone far enough to address previous concerns.<ref>Donald Duck faces the cold shoulder from TV. By Kenneth Gosling. ''The Times'' Thursday, 21 January 1982; pg. 12</ref> Central's Controller of Children's Programmes, Lewis Rudd, suggested a different approach to the presentation method. As a result, the Central promotions department came up with the initial concept for Children's ITV. The new look was devised, and links between programmes were pre-recorded using presenters drawn from the constituent programmes. The networking arrangements were similar to those already in place for the transmission of schools programmes \u2013 the links were played out from Central and the component programmes came from the supplying companies.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/greg.taylor1/watched_it/citv.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010408191056/http://freespace.virgin.net/greg.taylor1/watched_it/citv.html |archivedate=8 April 2001 |title=WATCHED IT! - Children's ITV Presentation |date= |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nChildren's ITV went to air on Monday 3 January 1983,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20780372 |title=CITV set for classic kids TV weekend |publisher=BBC News |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> between 4&nbsp;pm and 5.15&nbsp;pm each weekday afternoon, the extra fifteen minutes being filled by a repeat of one of the pre-school programmes shown at lunchtime the same day. Initially featuring a different presenter each month (usually from children's television), the links were pre-recorded in advance in a small studio at a London facility called Molinare, using a single locked-off camera. The first set design was a rocket ship and was used for the first few months. The concept was eventually retired, and the set and style of presentation used began to reflect the artist presenting that month or the programme that he/she fronted.\n\nBy 1984, the links were still being recorded, but using a common, stylized set known as Network Control, which allowed the presenter to be joined by guests in the studio for interviews. The exterior of this fictitious location also featured in the animations and stings. Technical considerations often left the system flawed. With each programme coming from a different playout source (usually from that of the originating ITV company), and each link being pre-recorded (played out by Central), things often went wrong on air: programmes would be rolled early and the links would be cut short. Programmes would also fail to appear and the presenter would be left on screen. Because each link was recorded for the slot available, the presenter would hold the final pose for a few moments so that the transmission controller at Central had something to leave on screen just in case. Pre-recording the links also meant that late schedule changes could not be easily referenced.\n\nIn September 1985, the BBC revamped their own children's presentation with the introduction of \"Children's BBC\". Using the BBC1 announcer booth at [[BBC Television Centre]], later dubbed \"The Broom Cupboard\", [[Phillip Schofield]] provided links between the programmes. This format of a small self-op continuity studio using one single presenter (and an occasional puppet) continued in largely the same format until 1993, but was broadcast live and allowed for a looser, more relaxed style of presentation than the rival ITV service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebroomcupboard.co.uk/page2.html |title=An Unofficial History of Children's BBC Presentation |publisher=Broom Cupboard |date= |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nChildren's ITV went live two years later. Using the small presentation studio at their [[ITV Central#Studios|Broad Street studios]] \u2013 which had become available since in-vision continuity for the Central region was dropped \u2013 former Central announcer [[Gary Terzza]] and Debbie Shore presented live links from a set built to look like a transmitting station. Although the studio space was small, the designers' use of a plate glass mirror gave the effect of a much larger set. The new live format gave brought a great deal of flexibility; timings could be altered, schedule changes reflected and breakdowns dealt with in a continuous manner. In 1988, the format was refreshed again with a new single presenter, Mark Granger, replacing Terzza and Shore, in a smaller, more basic studio set which included in-vision monitors showing the VT clock of the next scheduled item.\n\n=== The Stonewall Productions era (1989\u20131991) ===\nFrom 3 April 1989, the independent production company ''[[Stonewall Productions]]'' won the contract to produce ''Children's ITV'' presentation.  ''Stonewall Productions'' was headed up by Michael Jackson, a Central staffer who used his expertise to prepare a suitable application.\n\nWhereas Central had restricted links to the station's former in-vision presentation studio, Stonewall chose not to use a fixed set, but instead presented links from various areas of Central's headquarters at Broad Street in Birmingham, utilising a rotating team of presenters which included Clive Warren (now a DJ), Jeanne Downs (a singer), Jerry Foulkes (a producer who left Children's ITV on 22 December 1989) and a large puppet dog called Scally.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/>\n\n=== Central regains control (1991\u20132000) ===\n[[File:CITV 90s logo.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|CITV logo (1998\u20132006)]]\nCentral won back the contract to produce the continuity links from 1 April 1991, choosing to revert links back to a small in-vision studio and using one regular presenter, Tommy Boyd. During the 1991\u201393 era, greater importance was being placed throughout television on promotions (trailers) as a way of effectively detailing areas of the schedule to viewers who might not know about them. The 1993 invitation to tender for the provision of the Children's ITV service specified a minimum number of high quality trailers that the successful applicant must produce over the term of the contract. With a large promotions department - and a strong, highly credible reputation for presentation within the ITV network - the contract remained with Central.\n\nIn February 1993, in-vision presentation was dropped by the first Network Centre controller of children's & daytime programming Dawn Airey (a former Central management trainee) with Steven Ryde providing live out-of-vision continuity links featuring a wide variety of animated characters. On 6 September 1993, CITV was extended to start at 3.30&nbsp;pm, when ITV network centre decided to move the pre-school children slot from 12.10&nbsp;pm, to be branded under the CITV in the afternoon slot. Around the same time, the ''Children's ITV'' name was changed to '''CITV''', having been used in some form or another since the previous year. However, the ''Children's'' was not removed from the logo until Monday 2 September 1996, the same month a [[digital on-screen graphic]] (DOG) was introduced.\n\nPresentation for the service was moved in 1997 when Central moved into new, smaller studios at [[Gas Street Studios]] in Birmingham, which continued until Monday 25 May 1998, when a new in-vision service was introduced by the new controller of ITV children's output, Nigel Pickard. Steven Ryde became a producer with Stephen Mulhern and Danielle Nicholls becoming the new presentation team. A new logo was introduced (with traces predecessors), and henceforth the service was referred to as '''CiTV''', until the 2006 re-brand, initially being broadcast from Studio B at Central's Gas Street Studios.\n\n[[ITV Central|Central]] retained the contact to produce CITV for a further two years, seeing off two rival bids from other ITV companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/multi-platform/news/carlton-regains-citv-job/1215790.article |title=Carlton regains CITV job |publisher=Broadcast |date=18 June 1999 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Shortly after launch, CITV started sharing studio space with the West Midlands edition of ''[[ITV News Central|Central News]]'' in September 1999, allowing room for a large stylised set created by a company called Dorans Propmakers. The main studio for ''Central News West'' had previously been used for live music performances during CITV.\n\n=== Cutbacks (2001\u20132008) ===\n[[File:CITV logo 2006.svg|thumbnail|right|First CITV channel logo (2006\u20132009)]]\nDuring 2001, CITV's budget was cut by 17% due to the advertising recession, leading to CITV's controller Janie Grace publicly criticising [[Carlton Television|Carlton]] and [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]], then the main controlling forces in the network, for underinvestment in ITV's children's service.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown |first=Maggie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/01/broadcasting4 |title=ITV kids' shows at risk |publisher=The Guardian |date=1 November 2001 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Grace went even further and complained to the regulator [[Independent Television Commission|ITC]], claiming CITV was unlikely to fulfil its range of programming commitments in the following year. Grace also sought support from the ITC for the creation of a separate CITV Ltd company which would allow more children's output to be made in-house - a proposal which ultimately fell apart due to the need for a change in the law and support from the [[Office of Fair Trading]]. A new strand was introduced from 3:25pm every afternoon and was put in place under the name \"CiTV's Telly Tots\". The in-house presentaion was dropped between 3:25 and 4pm and replaced with a CGI animated town using a plane, car and a post box as mascots. A child voiceover was used to introduce it's pre-school shows. Books and video tapes were introduced to tie-in with new strand. <ref>{{cite web|last=Brown |first=Maggie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/12/mondaymediasection |title=Suffer the children |publisher=The Guardian |date=12 November 2001 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Further cuts took place again during 2002 which brought the total cutback to 25% of the overall budget (\u00a330million less).<ref>{{cite web|last=Deans |first=Jason |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/20/ITV.bbc |title=BBC chief calls for strong CITV |publisher=The Guardian |date=20 November 2001 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite the cutbacks, the [[Independent Television Commission|ITC]] noted that CITV had a \"sustained an impressive schedule\", gave \"factual material a fresh look\" and \"continued to produce good dramas\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/itc_notes/view_note73.html |title=ITC Note: Children's Television |publisher=Ofcom |date= |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Just after CITV celebrated its 20th birthday in January 2003, Janie Grace resigned from the post, just before Nigel Pickard was named as ITV's new Director of Programmes.<ref name=\"broadcastnow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/childrens-tv-citv-winning-custody-of-the-children/1109395.article |title=Children's TV: CITV - Winning custody of the children |publisher=Broadcast |date=3 February 2003 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/archives/12597 |title=Granada Kids boss replaces Grace |publisher=C21Media |date=27 February 2003 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Pickard pledged to produce 80 more hours of children's programming in 2003, against a target of 520 hours in 2002 and extend the range of programmes to include more factual and topical programmes and more mixed entertainment and drama,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/itv-puts-colour-back-into-kids/1108923.article |title=ITV puts colour back into kids |publisher=Broadcast |date=29 January 2003 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> Once again, concerns about CITV and its structure where highlighted by Angus Fletcher, president of Jim Henson Television Europe, and Anne Wood, founder of Ragdoll Productions, as it could only earn money from a then unreliable advertising market, unlike BBC Worldwide where the likes of [[Teletubbies]], [[Tweenies]] and [[Bob the Builder]] became key money earners for the Corporation.<ref name=\"broadcastnow\"/>\n\nSteven Andrew took over as ITV's controller of children and youth, overseeing the merger of Carlton and Granada's children's departments. Andrew also began looking at the possibility of launching a CITV channel, which had previously been put on hold by budget cuts. On-screen, various changes to the continuity presenting team saw no less than eight additions and replacements in the space of four years. By 1 September 2004, all in-vision continuity was replaced by voice over, while [[ITV plc]] announced the closure of its presentation and transmission facilities in Birmingham, signalling the end of CITV continuity from [[ITV Central|Central]].

Additionally, the channel simulcasts CITV Breakfast (previously known as [[GMTV2]], which was originally broadcast on [[ITV2]], then [[ITV4]]) on weekdays between 6&nbsp;am and 9.25&nbsp;am.\n\n[[File:CITV logo.svg|150px|thumbnail|right|CITV logo from 2009\u20132013]]\nThe channel broadcasts daily from 6&nbsp;am to 6&nbsp;pm and previously time-shared with [[ITV4]] until 5 February 2008 when ITV4 expanded its broadcast hours to become a full 24-hour channel. As a consequence, it moved to the multiplex space on Freeview originally held by [[ABC1 (UK)|ABC1]] from English and Scottish transmitters and [[S4C]] from Welsh transmitters, this meant that viewers of the latter were unable to receive the channel on Freeview unless they could receive transmissions from England. On 2 November 2009, the channel was relaunched, with a new logo and new branding to match [[ITV1]] as part of ITV plc's corporate look. The channel's pre-school strand was given a dramatic overhaul, and renamed ''Mini CITV''. Mini CITV is hosted by a group of spacemen-like beings called the Minis, who oversee presentation items on the channel. With the exception of weekends and holidays, ''Mini CITV'' took up the majority of output on the channel for a few years, though this was scaled back in 2012. On 9 January 2012, a change in the [[forward error correction]] mode on the multiplex allowed CITV to broadcast in Wales on Freeview. On 21 December 2012, the channel aired its first live programme since 2006, a 45-minute CITV special of ''[[Text Santa]]'', ITV's Christmas charity appeal. A year later a series of 10-minute programmes titled ''Help for Hattitude'' in aid of the above-mentioned appeal was produced for the channel - both programmes were produced in-house by [[ITV Studios]]. A new look was introduced on 14 January 2013 to coincide with ITV's corporate rebranding. The channel adopted a \"yellowy-orange\" logo with playful idents that \"burp and fart, and do other things kids love\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a438502/itv1-to-become-itv-in-major-corporate-rebrand.html|title=ITV1 to become 'ITV' in major corporate rebrand|last=Laughlin|first=Andrew|publisher=Digital Spy|date=16 November 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> On the weekend of Saturday 5 and Sunday 6 January 2013, CITV celebrated its thirty years of service with a marathon of archive programming, officially known as the '''''Old Skool Weekend'''''.\n\nOn 22 February 2016, CITV extended its on-air hours, the channel now finishes at 21:00 rather than the earlier 18:00.\n\n== Programming ==\n{{main article|List of programmes broadcast by CITV}}\nProgramming between 6:00 and 9:25&nbsp;am is controlled by [[ITV Breakfast]] (previously [[GMTV]]), who, having rebranded the vast majority of their GMTV children's output as CITV, now use the space to simulcast their programming at weekends on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network and '''CITV Breakfast''' on weekdays.<ref name=\"GMTV's Overall Strategy and Major Themes of the Year\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gm.tv/index.cfm?articleid=18900|title=GMTV's Overall Strategy and Major Themes of the Year|accessdate=30 January 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923124406/http://www.gm.tv/index.cfm?articleid=18900|archivedate=23 September 2006}}</ref> [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] takes over at 9.25&nbsp;am, controlling the rest of the day's programming.

ITV broadcast Mini CITV on weekend mornings, there was also a block called The Fluffy Club between 2008 and 2010 on weekend mornings that housed preschool programmes and featured a [[puppet]] baby chick in between programmes. A series of little animated spaceman characters called the ''Minis'' were the mascots of the strand (similar to the yellow bugs of its rival [[CBeebies]]). \n\nOn 7 January 2013, the ''Mini CITV'' name and the ''Mini'' mascots were dropped from on-screen use and two years later, (7 January 2015) CITV withdrew all of its pre-school programmings from both its weekday and weekend schedules with the exception of ''[[Sooty]]'', which continued to air until 3 September 2018, after which it started airing on [[ITVBe]]'s new preschool block, [[LittleBe]].\n\n== Presenters ==\nPresenters and announcers on CITV over the years have included:\n\n=== In-vision presenters ===\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n* [[Tommy Boyd]] (July 1983, December 1984, April 1991 \u2013 December 1992)\n* [[Gary Terzza]] (July 1985 - September 1985 & September 1987 \u2013 August 1988)\n* Debbie Shore (July 1985 - September 1985 & September 1987 \u2013 August 1988)\n* [[Gareth Jones (presenter)|Gareth Jones]] (January\u2013April 1987)\n* [[Andi Peters]] (Summer 1988)\n* Nicky Brown (Summer 1988)\n* Mark Granger (September 1988 \u2013 March 1989)\n* [[Jerry Foulkes]] (April \u2013 December 1989)\n* [[Clive Warren]] (Summer mornings 1989 & 1990, Afternoons; Summer 1989 & 1990)\n* [[Jeanne Downs]] (Summer mornings 1989 & 1990, Afternoons; January 1990 \u2013 March 1991)\n* [[Scally the Dog]] ([[puppet]] [[dog]]) (January 1989 \u2013 March 1991)\n* [[Glenn Kinsey]] (Summer mornings 1991, Afternoons December 1991 & December 1992 \u2013 February 1993)\n* [[Stephen Mulhern]] (May 1998 \u2013 August 2002)\n\n{{col-2}}\n\n* [[Danielle Nicholls]] (May 1998 \u2013 December 2001)\n* [[Arthur Darvill|Thomas Darvill]] (December 1999 \u2013 December 2001)\n* [[Andrea Green]] (December 1999 \u2013 October 2000)\n* [[David Leon]] (September 2001 \u2013 December 2002)\n* Leigh Morrison (September 2001 \u2013 December 2002)\n* Leah Charles-King (September 2001 \u2013 December 2003)\n* [[Michael Underwood]] (August 2002 \u2013 December 2003)\n* [[Tim Dixon]] (January \u2013 March 2003)\n* [[Gail McKenna]] (Relief January 2003, October 2003)\n* Andy Jaye (January 2004 \u2013 August 2004)\n* Laura Jaye (January 2004 \u2013 August 2004)\n{{col-end}}\n\n=== Out-of-vision announcers ===\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Steve Ryde]] (February 1993 \u2013 February 1998)\n* Emily Morris (March-May 1998)\n* [[Sophie Aldred]] (As herself as well as Minnie The Magic Magician) (1999-2000) (as a guest)\n* [[Tim Dann]] (2004\u201313)\n{{col-end}}\n\n=== Monthly presenters ===\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Matthew Kelly]] (January 1983, December 1984, April and September-December 1986)\n* [[Isla St Clair]] (February 1983)\n* [[Derek Griffiths]] (March 1983 & January 1984)\n* [[Charlotte Coleman]] (as [[Marmalade Atkins]]) (April 1983)\n* [[Mick Robertson]] (May 1983)\n* [[Roland Rat]] (May 1983, March 1984, January 1985)\n* [[Bob Carolgees]] (June 1983 & June 1984)\n* [[Pat Coombs]] (July 1983)\n* [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]] (September 1983)\n* [[David Rappaport]] (October 1983)\n* [[Bill Oddie]] (November 1983)\n* [[The Krankies]] (December 1983)\n* The [[CBTV (Thames)|CBTV]] Team (February 1984)\n* [[Christopher Biggins]] (April 1984)\n* [[Stu Francis]] (April\u2013May 1984 & October 1985)\n* [[Sue Robbie]] (May 1984)\n* [[Sandi Toksvig]] (as 'Ethel' from ''[[No. 73]]'') (August 1984)\n* [[Andrea Arnold]] (as 'Dawn' from ''No. 73'') (August 1984, August 1985 & April 1987)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Neil Buchanan]] (as 'Neil' from ''No. 73'') (August 1984)\n* [[Rod Hull]] & [[Emu (puppet)|Emu]] (September 1984 & December 1985)\n* [[Terrahawks]] voice cast (October 1984)\n* [[Bonnie Langford]] (November 1984)\n* [[Cheryl Baker]] (February 1985)\n* [[Dave Goelz]] (as Travelling Matt from [[Fraggle Rock]]) (March 1985)\n* [[Ken Jones (actor)|Ken Jones]] (as Whistle Willie from ''Behind the Bike Sheds'' (April 1985)\n* [[Gudrun Ure]] (as [[Supergran]]) (May 1985)\n* [[Timmy Mallett]] (June 1985)\n* [[Jimmy Cricket]] (September 1985)\n* [[Gary Wilmot]] (November 1985)\n* [[Bernie Winters]] (January 1986)\n* [[Nino Firetto]] (February 1986)\n* [[David Jensen]] (March 1986)\n* [[Carol Lee Scott]] (as '[[Carol Lee Scott#Grotbags|Grotbags]]') (May 1986)\n* [[Wide Awake Club|James Baker]] (June 1986 & April\u2013June 1987)\n* [[Basil Brush]] (July 1986)\n* [[Elizabeth Estensen]] & [[John Hasler]] (as [[T-Bag]] & T-shirt) (August 1986)\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n=== Relief presenters ===\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* Bryn Musselwhite (November 1998)\n* [[Liana Bridges]] (November 1998)\n* Vanessa Bewley (November/December 1998, January 1999 & June 1999)\n* [[Fearne Cotton]] (December 1998 & December 2000)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Ben Jones (British actor)|Ben Jones]] (February 1999 & June 1999)\n* [[Kate McIntyre]] (July 2003)\n* [[Anna Williamson]] (August\u2013September 2003)\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Ratings ==\nThe CITV channel launched with a full-day average of 33,000 viewers and a 2.5% share of the child audience.
