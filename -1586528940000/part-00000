It was first published in English and French in the US by [[Reynal & Hitchcock]] in April 1943, and posthumously in France following the [[liberation of France]] as Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's works had been banned by the [[Vichy Regime]]. The story follows a young prince who visits various planets in space, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style as a children's book, ''The Little Prince'' makes poignant observations about life and human nature.<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\n''The Little Prince'' became Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's most successful work, selling an estimated 140 million copies worldwide, which makes it one of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling]] and [[List of literary works by number of translations|most translated books]] ever published.<ref name=\"TimesTribune-2012.05.03\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.05.09\" /><ref name=Goding-1972 />{{refn|The Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Foundation estimates an additional 80 million copies of the story in audio-video formats have been sold worldwide.<ref name=\"LittlePrince.com-a\" />|group=\"Note\"}}<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> It has been translated into 361 languages and dialects.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/the-little-prince-becomes-world-s-most-translated-book-excluding-religious-works-1.3358885 | title='The Little Prince' becomes world's most translated book, excluding religious works | date=7 April 2017 | publisher=CTV News | accessdate=30 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes-2005.04.03\" /><ref name=\"Peak-2011.03\" /> ''The Little Prince'' has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including audio recordings, radio plays, live stage, film, television, ballet, and opera.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2005.04.03\" /><ref name=\"Statesman-2010.01.14\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nThe narrator begins with a discussion on the nature of grown-ups and their inability to perceive especially important things. As a test to determine if a grown-up is enlightened and like a child, he shows them a picture that he drew at the age of 6 depicting a snake which has eaten an elephant. The grown-ups always reply that the picture depicts a hat, and so he knows to talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than fanciful.\n\nThe narrator becomes a [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]], and, one day, his plane crashes in the [[Sahara]], far from civilization. He has 8 days of water supply and must fix his airplane to be saved. \n\nIn the middle of the desert, the narrator is unexpectedly greeted by a young boy who is nicknamed as \"the little prince\". The prince has golden hair, a lovable laugh, and will repeat questions until they are answered.\n\nUpon encountering the narrator, the little prince asks him to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him his old picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator simply draws a box (crate), claiming that the sheep the prince wants is inside the box. Again, to the narrator's surprise, the prince exclaims that this was exactly the drawing he wanted.\n\nOver the course of eight days stranded in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the little prince recounts the story of his life.\n\nThe prince begins by describing life on his tiny home planet: in effect, a house-sized [[asteroid]] known as \"[[B 612 (The Little Prince)|B 612]]\" on Earth. The asteroid's most prominent features are three minuscule [[volcano]]es (two active, and one [[volcano#volcano activity|dormant or extinct]]) as well as a variety of plants.\n\nThe prince describes spending his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet's soil; in particular, pulling out [[baobab]] trees that are constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. If the baobabs are not rooted out the moment they are recognized, it may be put off until it is too late and the tree has grown too large to remove, its roots having a catastrophic effect on the tiny planet.\n\nThe prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.\n\nThe prince tells of his love for a vain and silly rose that began growing on the asteroid's surface some time ago. The rose is given to pretension, exaggerating ailments to gain attention and have the prince care for her. The prince says he nourished the rose and attended her, making a screen or glass globe to protect her from the cold wind, watering her, and keeping off the caterpillars.\n\nAlthough the prince fell in love with the rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon their goodbyes, the rose is serious and apologizes that she failed to show she loved him and that they'd both been silly. She wishes him well and turns down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she will protect herself.\n\nThe prince laments that he did not understand how to love his rose while he was with her and should have listened to her kind actions, rather than her vain words.\n\nThe prince has since visited six other [[planet]]s, each of which was inhabited by a single, irrational, narrow-minded adult, each meant to critique an element of society. They include:\n\n* A king with no subjects, who only issues orders that can be followed, such as commanding the sun to set at sunset.\n* A narcissistic man who only wants the praise which comes from admiration and being the most-admirable person on his otherwise uninhabited planet.\n* A drunkard who drinks to forget the shame of drinking.\n* A businessman who is blind to the beauty of the stars and instead endlessly counts and catalogues them in order to \"own\" them all (critiquing [[economic materialism|materialism]])\n* A lamplighter on a planet so small, a full day lasts a minute. He wastes his life blindly following [[Obedience (human behaviour)|orders]] to extinguish and relight the lamppost every 30 seconds to correspond with his planet's day and night.\n* An elderly [[geographer]] who has never been anywhere, or seen any of the things he records, providing a caricature of [[Interdisciplinarity|specialization]] in the contemporary world.\n \nIt is the [[geographer]] who tells the prince that his rose is an ''[[ephemeral]]'' being, which is not recorded, and recommends that the prince next visit the planet [[Earth]].\n\nThe visit to Earth begins with a deeply pessimistic appraisal of humanity.  The six absurd people the prince encountered earlier comprise, according to the narrator, just about the entire adult world.  On earth there were<blockquote>111 kings&nbsp;... 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men; that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.</blockquote>Since the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a yellow snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished to return. The prince next met a desert flower, who told him that she had only seen a handful of men in this part of the world and that they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of a boring person who only repeats what another says.\n\nThe prince encountered a whole row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his own rose was unique and that she had lied. He began to feel that he was not a great prince at all, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower that he now thought of as common. He lay down on the grass and wept, until a [[fennec fox|fox]] came along.\n\nThe fox desired to be tamed and teaches the prince how to tame him.\n\nBy being tamed, something goes from being ordinary and just like all the others, to be special and unique. There are drawbacks since the connection can lead to sadness and longing when apart.\n\nFrom the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed unique and special because she was the object of the prince's love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the roses he had seen in the garden.\n\nUpon their sad departing, the fox imparts a secret: important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.\n\nThe prince finally meets two people from Earth:\n\n* A railway switchman who told him how passengers constantly rushed from one place to another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. \n* A merchant who talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated the need to drink for a week, saving people 53 minutes.\n\nBack in the present moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince has become visibly morose and saddened over his recollections and longs to return home and see his flower.\n\nThe prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, whom he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.\n\nThe next morning, the narrator is unable to find the prince's body. He finally manages to repair his airplane and leave the desert. It is left up to the reader to determine if the prince returned home, or died.\n\nThe story ends with a drawing of the landscape where the prince and the narrator met and where the snake took the prince's corporeal life. The narrator requests to be immediately contacted by anyone in that area encountering a small person with golden curls who refuses to answer any questions.\n\n== Tone and writing style ==   <!--[ in work, assistance will be appreciated! ]-->\n\nThe story of ''The Little Prince'' is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, \"a memorial to the prince\u2014not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.\"<ref name=\"Shmoop.a\" /> ''The Little Prince'' was created when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was \"an expatriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> According to one analysis, \"the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements.... You can't ride a flock of birds to another planet... The fantasy of the Little Prince works because the logic of the story is based on the imagination of children, rather than the strict realism of adults.\"<ref name=\"Danuscript.a\" />\n\nAn exquisite literary perfectionist, akin to the 19th century French poet [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1955.07.10\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry produced draft pages \"covered with fine lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut[ing] for a page...\"<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> He worked \"long hours with great concentration.\" According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1941.01.19\" /> Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author's style: \"Behind Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts by as much as two-thirds.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" /> The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exup\u00e9ry related to his American English teacher, Ad\u00e8le Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt \"free\" and able to concentrate, \"writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy,\" until he instantaneously dozed off.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry stated it was the only way he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.<ref>Webster 1993, p. 246.</ref>\n\nThough the story is more or less understandable, the narrator made almost no connection from when the little prince traveled between planets, he purposefully did that so that the book felt like it was told from a secretive little boy. {{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAlthough Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was a master of the French language, he was never able to achieve anything more than haltingly poor English. Ad\u00e8le Breaux, his young [[Northport, New York|Northport]] English tutor to whom he later dedicated a writing (\"For Miss Ad\u00e8le Breaux, who so gently guided me in the mysteries of the English language\") related her experiences with her famous student as ''Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in America, 1942\u20131943: A Memoir'', published in 1971.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tu5cAAAAMAAJ|title=Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in America, 1942-1943: a memoir|last=Breaux|first=Ad\u00e8le|date=June 1971|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=9780838676103}}</ref>\n\n\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's prodigious writings and studies of literature sometimes gripped him, and on occasion he continued his readings of literary works until moments before takeoff on solitary military reconnaissance flights, as he was adept at both reading and writing while flying. Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his [[ground crew]] would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something 'very hard'. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry frequently flew with a lined ''carnet'' (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming 'enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable'.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006}}{{sfnp|Webster|1993|pp=251 & 260}}\n\n== Inspirations ==\n=== Events and characters ===\n[[File:Sahara Crash -1935- copyright free in Egypt 3634 StEx 1 -cropped.jpg|thumb| right |Saint-Exup\u00e9ry next to his downed Simoun (lacking an all-critical radio) after crashing into the Sahara about 3&nbsp;am during an air race to [[Saigon]], Vietnam.

The account clearly drew on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir ''[[Wind, Sand and Stars]]'' (original French: {{lang|fr|Terre des hommes}}).<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\nOn 30 December 1935, at 02:45&nbsp;am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, along with his copilot-navigator Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vot, crashed in the Sahara desert.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=258}} They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight in a then-popular type of air race called a ''raid'', that had a prize of 150,000&nbsp;[[francs]].<ref name=\"Schiff-1996a\" /> Their plane was a [[Caudron]] [[Caudron Simoun|C-630 Simoun]],{{refn|\n\nThe plane Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was flying when he crashed at high speed in the Sahara was a [[Caudron]] C-630 [[Caudron Simoun|Simoun]], Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY ('F' being the international designator for France, and the remainder chosen by the author to represent ANtoine de saint-exup\u00e9RY).\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} and the crash site is thought to have been near to the [[Wadi El Natrun|Wadi Natrun]] valley, close to the [[Nile Delta]].{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=263}}\n\nBoth miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat.<ref name=\"Science and Diplomacy.\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2015/international-atomic-energy-agency |journal=Science and Diplomacy|date=22 June 2015 |title=The International Atomic Energy Agency: Linking Nuclear Science and Diplomacy |first=John |last=Brittain}}</ref> Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see [[mirage]]s, which were quickly followed by more vivid [[hallucination]]s. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a [[Bedouin]] on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's and Pr\u00e9vot's lives.<ref name=\"Schiff-1996a\" />\n\nThe prince's home, \"Asteroid B-612\", was likely derived as a progression of one of the planes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry flew as an airmail pilot, which bore the serial number \"A-612\". During his service as a mail pilot in the Sahara, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had viewed a [[fennec fox|fennec]] (desert sand fox), which most likely inspired him to create the fox character in the book. In a letter written to his sister Didi from the Western Sahara's [[Cape Juby]], where he was the manager of an airmail stopover station in 1928, he tells of raising a fennec that he adored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the novella, the fox, believed to be modeled after the author's intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The novella's iconic phrase, \"One sees clearly only with the heart\" is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.\n\nThe fearsome, grasping [[baobab]] trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent [[Nazism]] attempting to destroy the planet.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The little prince's reassurance to the pilot that the prince's body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine's dying younger brother Fran\u00e7ois, who told the author, from his deathbed: \"Don't worry. I'm all right. I can't help it.

Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\nThis interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was \"the muse to whom Saint-Exup\u00e9ry poured out his soul in copious letters..... Consuelo was the rose in ''The Little Prince.'' \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words,\" says the prince. \"She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" />\n\n=== Prince ===\n[[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] may have drawn inspiration for the prince's character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him ''le Roi-Soleil'' (\"the Sun King\") because of his golden curly hair. The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in [[Quebec City]] in 1942, [[Thomas De Koninck]], the son of philosopher [[Charles De Koninck]].{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=378}}{{sfnp|Brown|2004|}}<ref name=\"La Presse-2013.09.13\" /> Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] Jr. and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], whom he met during an overnight stay at their [[Long Island]] home in 1939.{{sfnp|Dunning|1989}}<ref name=\"Hoffman\" />{{refn|\n\nAccording to Hoffman, \"Anne Morrow Lindbergh's fascination with Saint-Ex was transparent in all she wrote about him, as might be expected when one aviator-writer romantic is writing about another.\" Saint-Exup\u00e9ry visited with Anne for two days but spoke with Charles Lindbergh, who arrived home late, for an hour. Besides their vast differences on how [[Adolf Hitler]] and the European conflict should be treated, Charles did not speak French, and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not speak English well. Their discussions, passed through Anne's meager French, were somewhat muted. However, the excited conversation between Antoine and Anne soon blossomed \"like monster flowers\", with each finishing the other's sentences. Ironically, while Saint-Exup\u00e9ry would later campaign for an early US entry into the war, Lindbergh strongly opposed American involvement in the European war and wanted an arrangement with Hitler, like Stalin's. The meeting between the two future P-38 war pilots was termed \"less than a rousing success\". Moreover, Charles later became unhappy about his wife's vast esteem for the French adventurer.\"\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nSome have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and \"believes in a life after death\", subsequently returning to his personal heaven.<ref name=\"BestNotes.com-a\" /> When [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] photojournalist [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]] questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: \"I asked him who he was,\" he replied. \"I'm the Little Prince\" was the reply.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" />\n\nOne of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for ''[[Paris-Soir]],'' the author described traveling from France to the [[USSR]] by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry incorporated into various philosophical writings:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry-Sense.of.Life\" />\n\n{{quote|I sat down [facing a sleeping] couple.

He started his work on the novella shortly after returning to the United States (Quebec, 1942).]]\n\nUpon the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], a laureate of several of France's highest literary awards and a successful pioneering aviator prior to the war, he initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron as a reserve military pilot in the ''[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'' (French Air Force).<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" /> After France's defeat in 1940 and its [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice with Germany]], he and Consuelo fled Occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry first arriving by himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Axis forces]], and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the [[French Resistance]]. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" />\n\nAn earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in ''The Little Prince''.\n\nHe wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress, martial and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on the author's neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent [[Gaullism|French Gaullist]] and [[Vichy France]].<ref>Webster 1993, pp. 238\u2013242.</ref> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: \"He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.\"<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> However, the period was to be both a \"dark but productive time\" during which he created three important works.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal-2014.01.23\" />\n\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys lived in two penthouse apartments on [[Central Park South]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1989-05-12\" /> then the [[Delamater-Bevin Mansion|Bevin House]] mansion in [[Asharoken, New York]], and still later at a rented house on Beekman Place in New York City.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=380}}<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />\n\nThe couple also stayed in [[Quebec]] for five weeks during the late spring of 1942, where they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys resided.<ref name=\"Schiff-2006\" /><ref name=\"Hannibal\" /><ref name=\"Chesterton\" /><ref name=\"QuebecVille\" /> During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]].{{sfnp|Dunning|1989}}<ref name=\"Hoffman\" />\n\nAfter returning to the US from his Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was pressed to work on a children's book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, [[Reynal & Hitchcock]]. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exup\u00e9ry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children's story would help.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=278}}{{refn|\n \nAnother source states that it was co-publisher Curtice Hitchcock who viewed the author sketches and doodles at a supper party one evening and then suggested writing a children's book to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> An additional likely reason for the publisher's encouragement: [[P. L. Travers]], the author of the popular children's books series on ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'', was at that time working on her third installment that would be published by a Reynal & Hitchcock competitor in 1943, the same year as ''The Little Prince''. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's U.S. publisher pressed him to have a competing children's book on the market for Christmas 1942.\n\n|group=\"Note\"|}} The author wrote and illustrated ''The Little Prince'' at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of [[Asharoken, New York|Asharoken]] in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /><ref name=\"Schiff-2006\" /><ref name=\"Schiff-2006b\" />\n\n[[File:BevinFront.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bevin House]] on [[Long Island]], one of the locations in which ''The Little Prince'' was written during the summer and fall of 1942.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />]]\n\nAlthough the book was started in his [[59th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park South]] penthouse, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry soon found New York City's noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations. After spending some time at an unsuitable clapboard country house in [[Westport, Connecticut]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> they found Bevin House, a 22-room mansion in Asharoken that overlooked [[Long Island Sound]].

One of the visitors was his wife's Swiss writer paramour [[Denis de Rougemont]], who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /> De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, ''The Tale of the Rose'', as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\nWhile the author's personal life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Morgan Library and Museum]] which had obtained Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original manuscript in 1968, stated: \"On the one hand, he had a clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right\", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length.<ref name=\"Fast Company\" />  The story, the curator added, was created when he was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nThe large white [[Second French Empire]]-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book'', where the prince'' visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset \"is move your chair a few steps.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />{{refn|\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was 43 the year the fable was published, and 44 the year he died. He originally wrote the story with 43 sunsets, but posthumous editions often quote '44 sunsets', possibly in tribute.\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n=== Manuscript ===\n\nThe original 140-page [[manuscript|autograph manuscript]] of ''The Little Prince'', along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author's close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now [[The Morgan Library & Museum]]) in [[Manhattan]], New York City.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.05.09\" /><ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.05.17\" /> It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work.<ref name=\"Fine Books Magazine-2013.12.03\" /> The manuscript's pages include large amounts of the author's prose that was [[Strikethrough|struck-through]] and therefore not published as part of the first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several [[watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]] by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella's publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author's birth, with major exhibitions of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s literary works.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /> Physically, the manuscript's [[Onionskin|onion skin media]] has become brittle and subject to damage. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's handwriting is described as being doctor-like, verging on indecipherable.<ref name=\"La Presse-2014.01.27\" />\n\nThe story's keynote [[aphorism]], {{lang|fr|On ne voit bien qu'avec le c\u0153ur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux}} (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye\") was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing.  Saint-Exup\u00e9ry also used a [[Dictaphone]] recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /><ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /> His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" />\n\nMany pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story's theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the [[Rockefeller Center]] and [[Long Island]]. Other deleted pages described the prince's vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince's planetoid.  Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls.  Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page [[epilogue]] lamenting \"On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...\", with the story's pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: \"he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.\" The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella's printing.<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" />\n\n{{Further|#Morgan exhibitions {{!}} Morgan exhibitions}}\n\nIn April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text.<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an \"ambassador of the human spirit\".<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: \"I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling',\" he says. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be \"guerre\" (or \"war\"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.<ref name=\"Guardian-2012.05.04\"/><ref name=AssociatedPress-2012.05.03 />\n\n=== Dedication ===\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry met [[L\u00e9on Werth]] (1878\u20131955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery's closest friend outside of his [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|Aeropostale]] associates.  Werth was an anarchist, a leftist [[Bolshevik]] supporter [[Jew|of Jewish descent]], twenty-two years older than Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicated two books to him, ''{{interlanguage link|Lettre \u00e0 un otage|fr}}'' (''Letter to a Hostage'') and ''Le Petit Prince'' (''The Little Prince''), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing ''The Little Prince'', Saint-Exup\u00e9ry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in [[Saint-Amour, Jura|Saint-Amour]], his village in the [[Jura (department)|Jura]], a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was \"alone, cold and hungry\", a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicates the book to him:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.a\" />{{quote|\n\nTo Leon Werth\n\nI ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up.  I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world.  I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children.  I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold.  He needs to be comforted.  If all these excuses are not enough then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was.  All grown-ups were children first. (But few of them remember it.)  So I correct my dedication:\n\nTo Leon Werth,<br />\nWhen he was a little boy|}}\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend's disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of ''The Little Prince,'' in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him.<ref>Heur\u00e9 (2006), p. 272.</ref> At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not live to see, Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exup\u00e9ry) isn't entirely peace.\" Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend's death, when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's French publisher, [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.\n\n=== Illustrations ===\n\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant [[Watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]], which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist \u2013 which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used, his medium of choice.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /> As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew.{{refn|\n\nOn one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's flights his aircraft engine started failing. His aircraft mechanic onboard later recalled that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was completely calm, \"Saint-Ex simply started doodling cartoons which he handed back to me with a big grin.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" />\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} Two or three original ''Little Prince'' drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker [[Joseph Cornell]].<ref name=\"Life-1967.12.15\" /> One rare original ''Little Prince'' watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.<ref name=\"Globe&Mail-2006-04-07\" /><ref name=\"CBC-2007.04.07\" />\n\nAn unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in [[Robert Crumb]]'s later famous [[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']] of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /> Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as \"...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exup\u00e9ry came to think of as \"the little prince,\" and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source.  One \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's editing process.<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nTo mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of ''The Little Prince's'' publication, the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Morgan Library and Museum]] mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a [[Free French Air Force]] pilot.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /><ref name=\"Telegraph-2014.01.24\" /> Hamilton's black [[poodle]], Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince's sheep, with a [[Raggedy Ann]] type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince.<ref name=\"Fine Books Magazine-2013.12.03\" /> Additionally, a pet [[Boxer (dog)|boxer]], Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story's desert fox and its tiger.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal-2014.01.23\" /> A museum representative stated that the novella's final drawings were lost.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" />\n\nSeven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"[t]he image evokes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> Another reviewer noted that the author \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry chose in every case to obfuscate.\"<ref name=\"EphemeralPursuits\" /> Not a single drawing of the story's narrator\u2013pilot survived the author's editing process; \"he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story\".<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nIn 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exup\u00e9ry painted for ''Le Petit Prince'' deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]], plus the star [[Aldebaran]], arranged as an [[Scalene triangle|isosceles triangle]], a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000.<ref name=\"Shimbun\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master [[Celestial navigation|celestial navigator]], a vocation he had studied at [[Salon-de-Provence Air Base|Salon-de-Provence]] with the [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']] (French Air Force).\n\n=== Post-publication ===\n\n[[Stacy Schiff]], one of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, \"rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his Little Prince\", and remarking of their dual fates, \"the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" /> Another noted that the novella's mystique was \"enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-2004.04.11\" />\n\nOnly weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the [[Free French Forces]]. He would remain immensely proud of ''The Little Prince'', and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" />\n\n{{Further|Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry#Disappearance {{!}} Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry \u2013 Disappearance}}\n\nAs part of a 32 ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying.{{refn|\n\nFollowing one of his crashes in a sophisticated single-pilot spy aircraft that resulted in him being grounded, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry spared no effort in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]], a fluently bilingual ''[[Life Magazine]]'' correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry committed to \"write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006|p=421}} Phillips later met with a high-level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the ''Life Magazine'' request to General Eaker. Eaker's approval for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's return to flying status would be made \"not through favoritism, but through exception.\" The brutalized French, it was noted, would cut a German's throat \"probably with more relish than anybody.\"\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} He had previously escaped death by the barest of margins a number of times, but was then [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry#Disappearance|lost in action]] during a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of [[Corsica]] to [[Continental Europe|the continent]] in preparation for the [[Operation Dragoon|Allied invasion of occupied France]], only three weeks before the [[Liberation of Paris]].<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" />{{refn|\n\nVarious sources state that his final flight was either his seventh, eight, ninth, or even his tenth covert reconnaissance mission. He volunteered for almost every such proposed mission submitted to his squadron, and protested fiercely after being grounded following his second sortie which ended with a demolished P-38. His connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with ''[[Life Magazine]]'', were instrumental in having the grounding order against him lifted.<ref name=\"Eyheramonno\" /> For some time Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's friends, colleagues, and compatriots were actively working to keep the aging, accident-prone author grounded, out of harm's way.\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n=== Reception ===\n\nMany of the book's initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable's multi-layered story line and its morals,<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" /> perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France's leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children's nor adult's literature classification. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote shortly before its publication \"What makes a good children's book?....  ...''The Little Prince'', which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10. [It] may very well be a book on the order of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', something that exists on two levels\"; \"Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10-year olds?\"  Notwithstanding the story's duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still \"capture the imagination of any child.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1943.04.06\" /> Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, [[Reynal & Hitchcock]] promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned \"it's the new book by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\", adding to its dustcover \"There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.\"<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" />\n\nOthers were not shy in offering their praise. Austin Stevens, also of ''The New York Times'', stated that the story possessed \"...large portions of the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry philosophy and poetic spirit. In a way it's a sort of [[credo]].\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> [[P. L. Travers|P.L.

As a test to determine if a grown-up is enlightened and like a child, he shows them a picture that he drew at the age of 6 depicting a snake which has eaten an elephant. The grown-ups always reply that the picture depicts a hat, and so he knows to talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than fanciful.\n\nThe narrator becomes a [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]], and, one day, his plane crashes in the [[Sahara]], far from civilization. He has 8 days of water supply and must fix his airplane to be saved. \n\nIn the middle of the desert, the narrator is unexpectedly greeted by a young boy who is nicknamed as \"the little prince\". The prince has golden hair, a lovable laugh, and will repeat questions until they are answered.\n\nUpon encountering the narrator, the little prince asks him to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him his old picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator simply draws a box (crate), claiming that the sheep the prince wants is inside the box. Again, to the narrator's surprise, the prince exclaims that this was exactly the drawing he wanted.\n\nOver the course of eight days stranded in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the little prince recounts the story of his life.\n\nThe prince begins by describing life on his tiny home planet: in effect, a house-sized [[asteroid]] known as \"[[B 612 (The Little Prince)|B 612]]\" on Earth. The asteroid's most prominent features are three minuscule [[volcano]]es (two active, and one [[volcano#volcano activity|dormant or extinct]]) as well as a variety of plants.\n\nThe prince describes spending his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet's soil; in particular, pulling out [[baobab]] trees that are constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. If the baobabs are not rooted out the moment they are recognized, it may be put off until it is too late and the tree has grown too large to remove, its roots having a catastrophic effect on the tiny planet.\n\nThe prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.\n\nThe prince tells of his love for a vain and silly rose that began growing on the asteroid's surface some time ago. The rose is given to pretension, exaggerating ailments to gain attention and have the prince care for her. The prince says he nourished the rose and attended her, making a screen or glass globe to protect her from the cold wind, watering her, and keeping off the caterpillars.\n\nAlthough the prince fell in love with the rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon their goodbyes, the rose is serious and apologizes that she failed to show she loved him and that they'd both been silly. She wishes him well and turns down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she will protect herself.\n\nThe prince laments that he did not understand how to love his rose while he was with her and should have listened to her kind actions, rather than her vain words.\n\nThe prince has since visited six other [[planet]]s, each of which was inhabited by a single, irrational, narrow-minded adult, each meant to critique an element of society. They include:\n\n* A king with no subjects, who only issues orders that can be followed, such as commanding the sun to set at sunset.\n* A narcissistic man who only wants the praise which comes from admiration and being the most-admirable person on his otherwise uninhabited planet.\n* A drunkard who drinks to forget the shame of drinking.\n* A businessman who is blind to the beauty of the stars and instead endlessly counts and catalogues them in order to \"own\" them all (critiquing [[economic materialism|materialism]])\n* A lamplighter on a planet so small, a full day lasts a minute. He wastes his life blindly following [[Obedience (human behaviour)|orders]] to extinguish and relight the lamppost every 30 seconds to correspond with his planet's day and night.\n* An elderly [[geographer]] who has never been anywhere, or seen any of the things he records, providing a caricature of [[Interdisciplinarity|specialization]] in the contemporary world.\n \nIt is the [[geographer]] who tells the prince that his rose is an ''[[ephemeral]]'' being, which is not recorded, and recommends that the prince next visit the planet [[Earth]].\n\nThe visit to Earth begins with a deeply pessimistic appraisal of humanity.  The six absurd people the prince encountered earlier comprise, according to the narrator, just about the entire adult world.  On earth there were<blockquote>111 kings&nbsp;... 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men; that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.</blockquote>Since the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a yellow snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished to return. The prince next met a desert flower, who told him that she had only seen a handful of men in this part of the world and that they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of a boring person who only repeats what another says.\n\nThe prince encountered a whole row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his own rose was unique and that she had lied. He began to feel that he was not a great prince at all, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower that he now thought of as common. He lay down on the grass and wept, until a [[fennec fox|fox]] came along.\n\nThe fox desired to be tamed and teaches the prince how to tame him.\n\nBy being tamed, something goes from being ordinary and just like all the others, to be special and unique. There are drawbacks since the connection can lead to sadness and longing when apart.\n\nFrom the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed unique and special because she was the object of the prince's love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the roses he had seen in the garden.\n\nUpon their sad departing, the fox imparts a secret: important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.\n\nThe prince finally meets two people from Earth:\n\n* A railway switchman who told him how passengers constantly rushed from one place to another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. \n* A merchant who talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated the need to drink for a week, saving people 53 minutes.\n\nBack in the present moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince has become visibly morose and saddened over his recollections and longs to return home and see his flower.\n\nThe prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, whom he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.\n\nThe next morning, the narrator is unable to find the prince's body. He finally manages to repair his airplane and leave the desert. It is left up to the reader to determine if the prince returned home, or died.\n\nThe story ends with a drawing of the landscape where the prince and the narrator met and where the snake took the prince's corporeal life. The narrator requests to be immediately contacted by anyone in that area encountering a small person with golden curls who refuses to answer any questions.\n\n== Tone and writing style ==   <!--[ in work, assistance will be appreciated! ]-->\n\nThe story of ''The Little Prince'' is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, \"a memorial to the prince\u2014not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.\"<ref name=\"Shmoop.a\" /> ''The Little Prince'' was created when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was \"an expatriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> According to one analysis, \"the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements.... You can't ride a flock of birds to another planet... The fantasy of the Little Prince works because the logic of the story is based on the imagination of children, rather than the strict realism of adults.\"<ref name=\"Danuscript.a\" />\n\nAn exquisite literary perfectionist, akin to the 19th century French poet [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1955.07.10\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry produced draft pages \"covered with fine lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut[ing] for a page...\"<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> He worked \"long hours with great concentration.\" According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1941.01.19\" /> Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author's style: \"Behind Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts by as much as two-thirds.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" /> The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exup\u00e9ry related to his American English teacher, Ad\u00e8le Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt \"free\" and able to concentrate, \"writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy,\" until he instantaneously dozed off.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry stated it was the only way he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.<ref>Webster 1993, p. 246.</ref>\n\nThough the story is more or less understandable, the narrator made almost no connection from when the little prince traveled between planets, he purposefully did that so that the book felt like it was told from a secretive little boy. {{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nAlthough Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was a master of the French language, he was never able to achieve anything more than haltingly poor English. Ad\u00e8le Breaux, his young [[Northport, New York|Northport]] English tutor to whom he later dedicated a writing (\"For Miss Ad\u00e8le Breaux, who so gently guided me in the mysteries of the English language\") related her experiences with her famous student as ''Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in America, 1942\u20131943: A Memoir'', published in 1971.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tu5cAAAAMAAJ|title=Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in America, 1942-1943: a memoir|last=Breaux|first=Ad\u00e8le|date=June 1971|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=9780838676103}}</ref>\n\n\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's prodigious writings and studies of literature sometimes gripped him, and on occasion he continued his readings of literary works until moments before takeoff on solitary military reconnaissance flights, as he was adept at both reading and writing while flying. Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his [[ground crew]] would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something 'very hard'. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry frequently flew with a lined ''carnet'' (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming 'enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable'.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006}}{{sfnp|Webster|1993|pp=251 & 260}}\n\n== Inspirations ==\n=== Events and characters ===\n[[File:Sahara Crash -1935- copyright free in Egypt 3634 StEx 1 -cropped.jpg|thumb| right |Saint-Exup\u00e9ry next to his downed Simoun (lacking an all-critical radio) after crashing into the Sahara about 3&nbsp;am during an air race to [[Saigon]], Vietnam.

The account clearly drew on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir ''[[Wind, Sand and Stars]]'' (original French: {{lang|fr|Terre des hommes}}).<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\nOn 30 December 1935, at 02:45&nbsp;am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, along with his copilot-navigator Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vot, crashed in the Sahara desert.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=258}} They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight in a then-popular type of air race called a ''raid'', that had a prize of 150,000&nbsp;[[francs]].<ref name=\"Schiff-1996a\" /> Their plane was a [[Caudron]] [[Caudron Simoun|C-630 Simoun]],{{refn|\n\nThe plane Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was flying when he crashed at high speed in the Sahara was a [[Caudron]] C-630 [[Caudron Simoun|Simoun]], Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY ('F' being the international designator for France, and the remainder chosen by the author to represent ANtoine de saint-exup\u00e9RY).\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} and the crash site is thought to have been near to the [[Wadi El Natrun|Wadi Natrun]] valley, close to the [[Nile Delta]].{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=263}}\n\nBoth miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat.<ref name=\"Science and Diplomacy.\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2015/international-atomic-energy-agency |journal=Science and Diplomacy|date=22 June 2015 |title=The International Atomic Energy Agency: Linking Nuclear Science and Diplomacy |first=John |last=Brittain}}</ref> Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see [[mirage]]s, which were quickly followed by more vivid [[hallucination]]s. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a [[Bedouin]] on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's and Pr\u00e9vot's lives.<ref name=\"Schiff-1996a\" />\n\nThe prince's home, \"Asteroid B-612\", was likely derived as a progression of one of the planes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry flew as an airmail pilot, which bore the serial number \"A-612\". During his service as a mail pilot in the Sahara, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had viewed a [[fennec fox|fennec]] (desert sand fox), which most likely inspired him to create the fox character in the book. In a letter written to his sister Didi from the Western Sahara's [[Cape Juby]], where he was the manager of an airmail stopover station in 1928, he tells of raising a fennec that he adored.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the novella, the fox, believed to be modeled after the author's intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The novella's iconic phrase, \"One sees clearly only with the heart\" is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.\n\nThe fearsome, grasping [[baobab]] trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent [[Nazism]] attempting to destroy the planet.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> The little prince's reassurance to the pilot that the prince's body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine's dying younger brother Fran\u00e7ois, who told the author, from his deathbed: \"Don't worry. I'm all right. I can't help it. It's my body\".<ref name=\"AirmansOdyssey\" />\n\n=== Rose ===\n[[File:Consuelo en 1942 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.jpg|thumb|right| 200px |The Rose in ''The Little Prince'' was likely inspired by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Salvadoran wife, Consuelo (Montreal, 1942).]]\nMany researchers believe that the prince's kindhearted but petulant and vain rose was inspired by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's [[Salvadoran]] wife [[Consuelo de Saint Exup\u00e9ry]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" />{{sfnp|Webster|1993|pp=248\u2013251}} with the small home planet being inspired by her small native country, [[El Salvador]], also known as \"The Land of Volcanoes.\"{{sfnp|Saint Exup\u00e9ry, Consuelo de|2003}} Despite a tumultuous marriage, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry kept Consuelo close to his heart and portrayed her as the prince's rose, whom he tenderly protects with a wind screen and places under a glass dome on his tiny planet. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" />\n\nThis interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was \"the muse to whom Saint-Exup\u00e9ry poured out his soul in copious letters..... Consuelo was the rose in ''The Little Prince.'' \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words,\" says the prince. \"She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" />\n\n=== Prince ===\n[[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] may have drawn inspiration for the prince's character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him ''le Roi-Soleil'' (\"the Sun King\") because of his golden curly hair. The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in [[Quebec City]] in 1942, [[Thomas De Koninck]], the son of philosopher [[Charles De Koninck]].{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=378}}{{sfnp|Brown|2004|}}<ref name=\"La Presse-2013.09.13\" /> Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] Jr. and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], whom he met during an overnight stay at their [[Long Island]] home in 1939.{{sfnp|Dunning|1989}}<ref name=\"Hoffman\" />{{refn|\n\nAccording to Hoffman, \"Anne Morrow Lindbergh's fascination with Saint-Ex was transparent in all she wrote about him, as might be expected when one aviator-writer romantic is writing about another.\" Saint-Exup\u00e9ry visited with Anne for two days but spoke with Charles Lindbergh, who arrived home late, for an hour. Besides their vast differences on how [[Adolf Hitler]] and the European conflict should be treated, Charles did not speak French, and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not speak English well. Their discussions, passed through Anne's meager French, were somewhat muted. However, the excited conversation between Antoine and Anne soon blossomed \"like monster flowers\", with each finishing the other's sentences. Ironically, while Saint-Exup\u00e9ry would later campaign for an early US entry into the war, Lindbergh strongly opposed American involvement in the European war and wanted an arrangement with Hitler, like Stalin's. The meeting between the two future P-38 war pilots was termed \"less than a rousing success\". Moreover, Charles later became unhappy about his wife's vast esteem for the French adventurer.\"\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nSome have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and \"believes in a life after death\", subsequently returning to his personal heaven.<ref name=\"BestNotes.com-a\" /> When [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] photojournalist [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]] questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: \"I asked him who he was,\" he replied. \"I'm the Little Prince\" was the reply.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" />\n\nOne of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for ''[[Paris-Soir]],'' the author described traveling from France to the [[USSR]] by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry incorporated into various philosophical writings:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry-Sense.of.Life\" />\n\n{{quote|I sat down [facing a sleeping] couple.

He started his work on the novella shortly after returning to the United States (Quebec, 1942).]]\n\nUpon the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], a laureate of several of France's highest literary awards and a successful pioneering aviator prior to the war, he initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron as a reserve military pilot in the ''[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'' (French Air Force).<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" /> After France's defeat in 1940 and its [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice with Germany]], he and Consuelo fled Occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry first arriving by himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Axis forces]], and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the [[French Resistance]]. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" />\n\nAn earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in ''The Little Prince''.\n\nHe wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress, martial and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on the author's neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent [[Gaullism|French Gaullist]] and [[Vichy France]].<ref>Webster 1993, pp. 238\u2013242.</ref> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: \"He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.\"<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> However, the period was to be both a \"dark but productive time\" during which he created three important works.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal-2014.01.23\" />\n\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys lived in two penthouse apartments on [[Central Park South]],<ref name=\"NYTimes-1989-05-12\" /> then the [[Delamater-Bevin Mansion|Bevin House]] mansion in [[Asharoken, New York]], and still later at a rented house on Beekman Place in New York City.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=380}}<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />\n\nThe couple also stayed in [[Quebec]] for five weeks during the late spring of 1942, where they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys resided.<ref name=\"Schiff-2006\" /><ref name=\"Hannibal\" /><ref name=\"Chesterton\" /><ref name=\"QuebecVille\" /> During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]].{{sfnp|Dunning|1989}}<ref name=\"Hoffman\" />\n\nAfter returning to the US from his Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was pressed to work on a children's book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, [[Reynal & Hitchcock]]. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exup\u00e9ry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children's story would help.{{sfnp|Schiff|1996|p=278}}{{refn|\n \nAnother source states that it was co-publisher Curtice Hitchcock who viewed the author sketches and doodles at a supper party one evening and then suggested writing a children's book to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> An additional likely reason for the publisher's encouragement: [[P. L. Travers]], the author of the popular children's books series on ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'', was at that time working on her third installment that would be published by a Reynal & Hitchcock competitor in 1943, the same year as ''The Little Prince''. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's U.S. publisher pressed him to have a competing children's book on the market for Christmas 1942.\n\n|group=\"Note\"|}} The author wrote and illustrated ''The Little Prince'' at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of [[Asharoken, New York|Asharoken]] in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /><ref name=\"Schiff-2006\" /><ref name=\"Schiff-2006b\" />\n\n[[File:BevinFront.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bevin House]] on [[Long Island]], one of the locations in which ''The Little Prince'' was written during the summer and fall of 1942.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />]]\n\nAlthough the book was started in his [[59th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park South]] penthouse, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry soon found New York City's noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations.

One of the visitors was his wife's Swiss writer paramour [[Denis de Rougemont]], who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /> De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, ''The Tale of the Rose'', as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\nWhile the author's personal life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Morgan Library and Museum]] which had obtained Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original manuscript in 1968, stated: \"On the one hand, he had a clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right\", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length.<ref name=\"Fast Company\" />  The story, the curator added, was created when he was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nThe large white [[Second French Empire]]-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /> It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book'', where the prince'' visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset \"is move your chair a few steps.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" />{{refn|\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was 43 the year the fable was published, and 44 the year he died.

In addition to the manuscript, several [[watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]] by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella's publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author's birth, with major exhibitions of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s literary works.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /> Physically, the manuscript's [[Onionskin|onion skin media]] has become brittle and subject to damage.

L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux}} (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye\") was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing.  Saint-Exup\u00e9ry also used a [[Dictaphone]] recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" /><ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /> His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.<ref name=\"Atlantic Monthly-1947.04\" />\n\nMany pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story's theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the [[Rockefeller Center]] and [[Long Island]]. Other deleted pages described the prince's vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince's planetoid.  Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls.  Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page [[epilogue]] lamenting \"On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...\", with the story's pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: \"he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.\" The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella's printing.<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" />\n\n{{Further|#Morgan exhibitions {{!}} Morgan exhibitions}}\n\nIn April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text.<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an \"ambassador of the human spirit\".<ref name=TimesTribune-2012.05.03 /><ref name=Guardian-2012.05.04 /> The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: \"I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling',\" he says. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be \"guerre\" (or \"war\"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.<ref name=\"Guardian-2012.05.04\"/><ref name=AssociatedPress-2012.05.03 />\n\n=== Dedication ===\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry met [[L\u00e9on Werth]] (1878\u20131955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery's closest friend outside of his [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|Aeropostale]] associates.  Werth was an anarchist, a leftist [[Bolshevik]] supporter [[Jew|of Jewish descent]], twenty-two years older than Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicated two books to him, ''{{interlanguage link|Lettre \u00e0 un otage|fr}}'' (''Letter to a Hostage'') and ''Le Petit Prince'' (''The Little Prince''), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing ''The Little Prince'', Saint-Exup\u00e9ry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in [[Saint-Amour, Jura|Saint-Amour]], his village in the [[Jura (department)|Jura]], a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was \"alone, cold and hungry\", a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicates the book to him:<ref name=\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.a\" />{{quote|\n\nTo Leon Werth\n\nI ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up.  I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world.  I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children.  I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold.  He needs to be comforted.  If all these excuses are not enough then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was.  All grown-ups were children first. (But few of them remember it.)  So I correct my dedication:\n\nTo Leon Werth,<br />\nWhen he was a little boy|}}\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend's disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of ''The Little Prince,'' in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him.<ref>Heur\u00e9 (2006), p. 272.</ref> At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not live to see, Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exup\u00e9ry) isn't entirely peace.\" Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend's death, when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's French publisher, [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard|Gallimard]], sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.\n\n=== Illustrations ===\n\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant [[Watercolor painting|watercolour illustrations]], which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist \u2013 which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used, his medium of choice.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.09.10\" /> As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew.{{refn|\n\nOn one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's flights his aircraft engine started failing. His aircraft mechanic onboard later recalled that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was completely calm, \"Saint-Ex simply started doodling cartoons which he handed back to me with a big grin.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.10.28\" />\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} Two or three original ''Little Prince'' drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker [[Joseph Cornell]].<ref name=\"Life-1967.12.15\" /> One rare original ''Little Prince'' watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.<ref name=\"Globe&Mail-2006-04-07\" /><ref name=\"CBC-2007.04.07\" />\n\nAn unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in [[Robert Crumb]]'s later famous [[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']] of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /> Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as \"...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exup\u00e9ry came to think of as \"the little prince,\" and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source.  One \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's editing process.<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nTo mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of ''The Little Prince's'' publication, the [[Morgan Library & Museum|Morgan Library and Museum]] mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a [[Free French Air Force]] pilot.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.a\" /><ref name=\"Telegraph-2014.01.24\" /> Hamilton's black [[poodle]], Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince's sheep, with a [[Raggedy Ann]] type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince.<ref name=\"Fine Books Magazine-2013.12.03\" /> Additionally, a pet [[Boxer (dog)|boxer]], Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story's desert fox and its tiger.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal-2014.01.23\" /> A museum representative stated that the novella's final drawings were lost.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" />\n\nSeven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff.<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.09.19\" /> According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"[t]he image evokes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince.\"<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" /> Another reviewer noted that the author \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry chose in every case to obfuscate.\"<ref name=\"EphemeralPursuits\" /> Not a single drawing of the story's narrator\u2013pilot survived the author's editing process; \"he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story\".<ref name=\"Fast Company-2014.01.31\" />\n\nIn 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exup\u00e9ry painted for ''Le Petit Prince'' deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]], plus the star [[Aldebaran]], arranged as an [[Scalene triangle|isosceles triangle]], a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000.<ref name=\"Shimbun\" /> Saint-Exup\u00e9ry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master [[Celestial navigation|celestial navigator]], a vocation he had studied at [[Salon-de-Provence Air Base|Salon-de-Provence]] with the [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']] (French Air Force).\n\n=== Post-publication ===\n\n[[Stacy Schiff]], one of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry|Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, \"rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his Little Prince\", and remarking of their dual fates, \"the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky\".<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" /> Another noted that the novella's mystique was \"enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-2004.04.11\" />\n\nOnly weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the [[Free French Forces]]. He would remain immensely proud of ''The Little Prince'', and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.<ref name=\"NYTimes-2000.06.25\" />\n\n{{Further|Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry#Disappearance {{!}} Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry \u2013 Disappearance}}\n\nAs part of a 32 ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying.{{refn|\n\nFollowing one of his crashes in a sophisticated single-pilot spy aircraft that resulted in him being grounded, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry spared no effort in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to [[John Phillips (photographer)|John Phillips]], a fluently bilingual ''[[Life Magazine]]'' correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry committed to \"write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"{{sfnp|Schiff|2006|p=421}} Phillips later met with a high-level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the ''Life Magazine'' request to General Eaker. Eaker's approval for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's return to flying status would be made \"not through favoritism, but through exception.\" The brutalized French, it was noted, would cut a German's throat \"probably with more relish than anybody.\"\n\n|group=\"Note\"}} He had previously escaped death by the barest of margins a number of times, but was then [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry#Disappearance|lost in action]] during a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of [[Corsica]] to [[Continental Europe|the continent]] in preparation for the [[Operation Dragoon|Allied invasion of occupied France]], only three weeks before the [[Liberation of Paris]].<ref name=\"NYTimes-1993.05.30\" />{{refn|\n\nVarious sources state that his final flight was either his seventh, eight, ninth, or even his tenth covert reconnaissance mission. He volunteered for almost every such proposed mission submitted to his squadron, and protested fiercely after being grounded following his second sortie which ended with a demolished P-38. His connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with ''[[Life Magazine]]'', were instrumental in having the grounding order against him lifted.<ref name=\"Eyheramonno\" /> For some time Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's friends, colleagues, and compatriots were actively working to keep the aging, accident-prone author grounded, out of harm's way.\n\n|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n=== Reception ===\n\nMany of the book's initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable's multi-layered story line and its morals,<ref name=\"New Yorker-2014.04.29\" /> perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France's leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children's nor adult's literature classification. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote shortly before its publication \"What makes a good children's book?....  ...''The Little Prince'', which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10. [It] may very well be a book on the order of ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', something that exists on two levels\"; \"Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10-year olds?\"  Notwithstanding the story's duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still \"capture the imagination of any child.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1943.04.06\" /> Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, [[Reynal & Hitchcock]] promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned \"it's the new book by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\", adding to its dustcover \"There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.\"<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" />\n\nOthers were not shy in offering their praise. Austin Stevens, also of ''The New York Times'', stated that the story possessed \"...large portions of the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry philosophy and poetic spirit. In a way it's a sort of [[credo]].\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-1942.12.06\" /> [[P. L. Travers|P.L. Travers]], author of the [[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]] series of children books, wrote in a ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' review: \"''The Little Prince'' will shine upon children with a sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there until the time comes for them to comprehend it.\"<ref name=\"ThreeTomatoes\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes-2014.01.23.b\" />\n\nBritish journalist Neil Clark, in ''[[The American Conservative]]'' in 2009, offered an expansive view of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's overall work by commenting that it provides a \"\u2026bird's eye view of humanity [and] contains some of the most profound observations on the human condition ever written\", and that the author's novella \"doesn't merely express his contempt for selfishness and materialism [but] shows how life should be lived.\"<ref name=\"American Conservative-2009.10\" />\n\nThe book enjoyed modest initial success, residing on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for only two weeks,<ref name=\"La Presse-2014.01.27\" /> as opposed to his earlier 1939 English translation, ''[[Wind, Sand and Stars]]'' which remained on the same list for nearly five months.<ref name=\"BrainPickings\" /> As a cultural icon, the novella regularly draws new readers and reviewers, selling almost two million copies annually and also spawning [[List of The Little Prince adaptations|numerous adaptations]].

It is also often used as an introduction into endangered varieties with very few speakers like [[Mayan languages|Maya]] (2001), [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] (2006) or [[Banat Bulgarian dialect|Banat Bulgarian]] (2017). It is one of the few modern books to have been translated into [[Latin]], as ''Regulus, vel Pueri soli sapiunt''<ref name=\"Hinke-Quand\" /><ref name=\"LA Times-1993.09.29\" /> in 1961 by Auguste Haury (1910\u20132002) and as ''Regulus'' in 2010 by Alexander Winkler. In 2005, the book was also translated into [[Toba Qom language|Toba Qom]], an indigenous language of northern [[Argentina]], as ''So Shiyaxauolec Nta'a''. It was the first book translated into that language since the [[New Testament]]. It was also translated to a northern Italian dialect, [[Vogherese]]. Anthropologist Florence Tola, commenting on the suitability of the work for Toban translation, said there is \"nothing strange [when] the Little Prince speaks with a snake or a fox and travels among the stars, it fits perfectly into the Toba mythology\".<ref name=\"Le Monde-2005.04.06\" />\n\n[[Linguist]]s have compared the many translations and even editions of the same translation for style, composition, titles, wordings and genealogy.

The timber spans on the Prince Alfred Bridge have deteriorated to such an extent that the 1896 side ramp has had to be reinstated, so that most of the northern approach is disused, and has deteriorated to the point where it is closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrians.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe bridge was named for the then reigning [[Queen Victoria]]'s son, Prince [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], and was built to carry the Great Southern Road (now the Hume Highway) across the Murrumbidgee. It has existed in three forms, with only the main spans across the river itself being common to all three.\n\n== History == \n\nThe site was historically known as the \"crossing place\" and is where [[Charles Sturt]] first crossed the Murrumbidgee. It became known in the mid-19th century as the safest location to cross the river. Periodic flooding of the Murrumbidgee had already had detrimental effects on the pioneering settlement of Gundagai, situated on the floodplain. In 1852 almost 100 people were drowned in a severe flood. By 1853 a new town site had been chosen on the high ground north of the floodplain and its main street, Sheridan Street, became part of the [[Great South Road (New South Wales)|Great South Road]], subsequently the original Hume Highway until it was bypassed in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nOn 30 January 1861 ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|NSW Legislative Assembly]] had rejected a motion for a road bridge at Gundagai due to lack of funds and lack of evidence of a need. A public meeting was held in September at the Gundagai Court House and resolutions from the meeting together with a subsequent petition from the district were forwarded to [[Sydney]] for consideration by the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]].<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe river crossing had become a major obstacle for travellers and teams following the [[Hamilton Hume|Hume]] and [[William Hovell|Hovell]] route to the [[Riverina]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and there had been regular petitions and deputations to the Colonial Government for a bridge. Successive governments deferred on the grounds of low traffic flows and the high cost of any bridge project to cross the half-mile flood plain, but political and commercial factors forced the Government's hand. The merchants at [[Wagga Wagga]] favoured trade with Victoria since that colony's railway had reached [[Echuca]] in 1864, and they accused the distant Sydney-based Government of neglect. They formed a joint-stock company and built a substantial three span timber bridge over the [[Murrumbidgee River]] in order to direct traffic from the surrounding districts through the town. It was reported that as a financial speculation the bridge has proved successful. A similar bridge had been erected over the [[Murray River]] at [[Albury]]. The NSW Government was forced to act in order to turn the flow of wealth towards Sydney. Not only was a bridge planned, but an expensive iron structure was approved as a clear indication to the south-western districts of the Government's legitimate interests in those regions.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn late 1861, the Government placed [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]24,000 in the estimates for a modest scheme with a short viaduct, which would have left the floodplain impassable during a flood. However, in 1864 the estimate was increased to A\u00a337,000 for the whole river flat to be bridged. The Prince Alfred Bridge over the Murrumbidgee River was opened on 24 October 1867 and named after [[Queen Victoria]]'s second son who was touring Australia that year. It was the first metal truss bridge to be built in NSW. A short sloping viaduct descended to join the road over the river flats until the long timber viaduct was complete in 1869.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn England in 1848, [[James Warren (engineer)|James Warren]] and [[Willoughby Monzani]] had obtained a British [[patent]] for a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles that could support a road on either its top or bottom chord. [[Warren truss|Warren's name became synonymous]] with this form. The first major spans using this configuration were built in England, and English construction firms built prefabricated versions for use in the British colonies, especially India. Thomas Kennard then applied a more detailed analysis of the stress distribution, allowing further economy in the use of iron by varying the cross-sectional area of the top and bottom chords without adversely affecting strength. Kennard patented his invention in 1853, and it was the Warren and Kennard patent that was used by Bennett in his design of the Prince Alfred Bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nAccording to Bennett, the Warren girder had been adopted, because it required the least workmanship on the ground, and because of the rapidity with which it could be erected, incurring least risk from the violent floods of the Murrumbidgee during construction. However, Bennett, along with many other engineers of his day, considered the lattice truss superior. The main objection to the Warren truss was that all the strains are taken by a single pin, whereas in the lattice system the strain is divided amongst a number of rivets instead. Francis Bell, the contractor, also preferred the wrought iron lattice, which, he said, could be imported from England and launched into position very economically. For these (among other) reasons, very few Warren truss bridges were constructed during this period.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> The iron for the superstructure was furnished by Messrs Lloyds, Fosters, and Company's Wednesbury, Old Park Ironworks in Staffordshire, and was inspected by eminent engineer Mr. Fowler. Testing of the wrought iron was conducted, and the strength was found to be much in excess of the specification. The testing in England of the first span for the bridge was also reported as very satisfactory; the deflection with a load did not exceed an inch.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn 1848, three Sydney businessmen had joined a local man in an attempt to exploit the iron resources of the [[Nattai, New South Wales|Nattai]] district, which became the Fitzroy Ironworks. The Fitzroy Ironworks were the first ironworks in Australia, but their story is one of persistent failure over half a century despite numerous and repeated ambitious, entrepreneurial and optimistic attempts. For finished products (cast or rolled), land or water transport to an English port plus sea freight to Sydney were less than the cost of cartage between [[Mittagong]] and Sydney. Pig iron, also, could not compete against British iron, mostly brought out as ballast in wool ships.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge, with the [[Denison Bridge]] at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], has the distinction of being one of only two early Australian bridges that contained Australian iron. While the iron for the piers of Denison Bridge at Bathurst was cast at P. N. Russell & Co's Foundry in Sydney from pig iron obtained from the Fitzroy Ironworks, the cast iron piers at Gundagai were cast by the Fitzroy Ironworks from largely local iron. The piers are therefore a rare example of a substantial finished product produced completely by the Fitzroy Ironworks at Mittagong.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe four pairs of cast iron cylindrical columns for the piers were made at the [[Fitzroy Iron Works]] in 56 sections. Each was {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} long, {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} in diameter, with a {{convert|1.125|inch|mm|0|order=flip|adj=on}} wall thickness and each weighed approximately {{convert|2|ST|t LT|spell=on|order=flip}}. They were delivered by [[Ox|bullock]] drays, although delays occurred in carting the cylinders to Gundagai because scarcity of feed and water between [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] and Gundagai deterred carriers from undertaking the work.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nWhen a {{convert|6|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} section of cylinder was placed in its required position, the material inside and under the cutting edge was excavated by hand, causing the cylinder to sink under its own weight. As the cylinder descended, additional lengths were added with internal bolted connections until the necessary depth or foundation had been reached. The hollow cylinder was then filled with rubble consisting of red sandy soil with the odd stone. An immense amount of difficulty was at first experienced in reaching the necessary depth; borings to a great depth had to be made, through huge masses of timber brought down by floods in bygone ages, but the indomitable energy of the superintending engineer, Frederick Augustus Franklin, overcame every obstacle. Franklin, who worked for Francis Bell, was well regarded and gained the cordial good wishes and esteem of the people of Gundagai by his work.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe design for the three iron truss spans of the Prince Alfred Bridge are based on the British pin-jointed Warren and Kennard trusses, and have the unique feature of the trusses being suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord, supported on roller bearings on vertical posts at each pier. The end roller detail has five rollers placed between the extended upper chord and a pillar which rises from the pier top. A similar detail is provided at the central pier, where each upper chord is continued from one span to the next across a nest of rollers. The Warren truss, as originally patented, consisted of a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles but the Prince Alfred Bridge has additional verticals at each cross girder location, designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. It and the railway truss downstream (constructed more than 30 years later) are two of only three pin-jointed metal trusses remaining in NSW - the other is the Whipple truss road bridge at [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]].<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe deck on the truss spans originally consisted of two {{convert|2|inch|cm|0|adj=on|order=flip}} thick layers of diagonal decking, the upper layer being approximately at right angles to the lower layer. The deck was finished with a light curved iron kerb, similar to the kerb which still exists on Denison Bridge (see photo). This arrangement of deck for the truss spans was retained when [[Percy Allan]] designed the new northern viaduct which was constructed in 1898, but by 1932, there was just a single layer of transverse decking on the truss spans similar to the viaduct approaches, and a timber kerb rather than the original iron kerb.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nBy 1932, it was thought that, \"the iron spans, then being sixty-five years old, could hardly be relied upon for a further period of service much in excess of thirty years (the average expected life of a timber girder span as used on viaducts), which would bring them to an age of practically 100 years. Apart from not being heavy enough to carry the present-day standard bridge loading, old age had probably affected the iron and caused some loss of strength.\" However, after considering a number of options for a new bridge it was admitted that, 'It was plain that the existing iron trusses, though light and of unusual design, viewed from the aspect of modern structural practice, were in good order and were capable of rendering efficient service for the life of at least one more timber approach.'<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nSince that time, the timber deck has changed arrangement a number of times, and the ironwork has been painted with a number of different systems (originally white, now grey). In the early 1960s a footway was added to one side of the bridge, which remains today. Good design and quality construction have given a durable bridge able to carry much heavier loads that originally intended or foreseen, and for much longer than had been imagined.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nLocated on the main Sydney to [[Melbourne]] route, the Prince Alfred Bridge carried huge volumes of traffic in its lifetime until 1977 when the Hume Highway was realigned to bypass Gundagai with the construction of Sheahan Bridge. The Prince Alfred Bridge continued to carry local traffic over the Murrumbidgee River between North and South Gundagai;<ref name=nswshr-2022/> until it was declared unsafe for vehicular and pedestrian traffic.\n\n== Description == \nThe Prince Alfred Bridge over the Murrumbidgee River is a three [[Span (architecture)|span]], [[wrought iron]], pin jointed Warren [[truss]] on cast iron cylindrical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. A Warren truss, as originally patented, consists of a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles that support a road on either the top or bottom chord. The [[trusses]] of the Prince Alfred Bridge have additional verticals at each cross girder location, designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. The trusses are suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord, supported on a nest of five rollers located on vertical pillars attached to the top of each pier. The four cylindrical cast iron piers are filled with soil and stones. The trusses support a timber deck, which carries two lanes of traffic. Longitudinal timber sheeting was added to the deck in 1959, and a footway was added on the outside of the truss in the early 1960s.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nAs opened in 1867 the bridge had a total length of {{Convert|1030|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, consisting of three wrought iron truss spans each of {{Convert|103|ft|m|0|order=flip}} across the river, two timber southern approach spans each of {{Convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, and twenty-three timber northern approach spans each of {{Convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, rising on a gradient of 1 in 30 from the level of the floodplain.<ref name=mr>{{cite journal|title=The Murrumbidgee River Bridge at Gundagai, 1865-1932|url=https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/publications/15912|website=Open Gov NSW|publisher=Dept of Main Roads|volume=3|issue=6|pages=86\u201389|date=February 1932}}</ref><!-- math doesn't work on those sums --><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60819964 |title=NEW BRIDGE OVER THE MURRUMBIDGEE, AT GUNDAGAI, NEW SOUTH WALES. |newspaper=[[The Illustrated Australian News|Illustrated Australian News for Home Readers]] |issue=125 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=26 November 1867 |page=12 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref>\n\nIt was the first iron truss bridge to be built in New South Wales,<ref name=\"RTAPrinceAlfredBridge\"/> The pin-jointed [[Warren truss]] section is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia.

There is minor section loss due to corrosion, but the loss is not substantially affecting the load carrying capacity of the bridge. A few of the iron castings supporting the cross girders are broken. The portions of the cast iron piers which are below water have been subject to graphitisation (a form of corrosion leading to loss of strength), as is common in cast iron river piers. This does affect capacity, but is not yet causing signs of distress for this bridge. Archaeological potential is low.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n=== Further information === \n\nThe integrity of the Prince Alfred Bridges is excellent. The original cast iron piers and wrought iron trusses are clearly visible. Although the arrangement of the deck has changed over the years, it is still timber as it was originally.

Timber deck changes throughout the life of the bridge (both fabric and form), addition of footway in early 1960s, repainting throughout the life of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2022/>\n\n== Heritage listing == \n\nAs at 13 April 2016, the Prince Alfred Bridge is of State heritage significance for its historical values as the first iron truss bridge to be built in New South Wales and the second-oldest metal truss bridge remaining in Australia. In addition it is of significance for its rarity as it is one of only three pin jointed metal trusses remaining in New South Wales. Its historical values include the fact that the cast iron piers were cast in at the Fitzroy Iron Works, the first ironworks in Australia, chiefly from local ores. The Bridge and the piers therefore provides an irreplaceable source of information on the quality and techniques used by Australia's first ironworks and demonstrate the technical achievements of the colony of NSW in producing its own iron. The construction of the bridge was a significant development in the history and development of NSW as it provided easy access to Sydney therefore channeling the resources and wealth of the Riverena district north to Sydney to the benefit of New South Wales rather than south to Melbourne and Victoria<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe state level heritage significance of the Prince Alfred Bridge is enhanced through its important association with inland road transport and communications between Sydney and Melbourne. The bridge is also associated with a visit to Australia by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1867 afterwhom the bridge was named. In addition the bridge is associated with two eminent engineers, William Christopher Bennett the designer and Francis Bell the Contractor.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nTechnically the bridge is of state heritage significance as it demonstrates some unique engineering elements such as the support arrangements, consisting of vertical pillars at each pier, having the trusses suspended from the top chords, resting on a nest of roller bearings. The Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its landmark qualities as an integral part of the overall historic vista which includes the iron bridge, the long timber viaduct and adjacent rail bridge. These are a widely recognisable part of the built environment in Gundagai and have a place in the experience and memories of travellers between Sydney and Melbourne from its opening in 1867 until its closure in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its special value to the engineering profession, particularly for the history of metal bridge design and construction in New South Wales.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nPrince Alfred Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 5 July 2019 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.''' \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge - iron road bridge is lof state heritage significance as it is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia and the oldest in NSW. It formed part of the longest bridge in New South Wales ({{convert|3025|ft|m|0|order=flip}}) until the completion of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932. The Prince Alfred Bridge is important in the history of the development of inland road transport and provides evidence of significant early engineering activity in the Riverina. It also demonstrates the early importance of the Sydney to Melbourne route.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.''' \n\nThe state heritage significance of the bridge is enhanced through its associated with two eminent engineers William Christopher Bennet and Francis Bell.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nWilliam Christopher Bennett, Irish born engineer, designed the iron bridge. After arriving in Australia Bennett quickly rose to the position of Commissioner and Chief Engineer in the Roads Department (appointed in 1860), a position he retained until 1889. Bennett and his Department constructed 16,000km of road and 64 km of bridges. In addition to his prodigious work on roads and bridges in New South Wales, Bennett also made a significant contribution to navigation, water supply and sewerage works.In 1872 Sir [[Henry Parkes]] commended Bennett and his work with the department sayying he was \"one of the ablest officers in the government service\"<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nFrancis Bell was another engineer who was born in Ireland By 1853 Bell had migrated to Australia, and was first involved in a number of significant engineering projects in Victoria. His expertise was such that he was often requested to give evidence to the Victorian Royal Commissions on the River and Harbour Trust, to Select Committees on the Railway Department and the [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central Railway Terminus]]. He was involved in constructing a number of iron truss bridges including the earliest substantial metal truss bridge in Australia, the Hawthorne Bridge over the [[Yarra River|Yarra]] in Melbourne. Bell was City Engineer for the [[City of Sydney]] from 1871 to 1879, and was a member of the Sewerage and Health Board.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.''' \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance as is an important work of a prominent designer, William Christopher Bennett, who made use of the design technology that was patented in England less than 15 years before the opening of the bridge (1853 the Warren and Kennard patent). Bennett's innovations include the support arrangements for the trusses, consisting of vertical pillars at each pier to support the trusses from the top chord, and the introduction of additional vertical elements designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. The Prince Alfred Bridge also demonstrates the technical achievements of the colony of New South Wales in discovering, mining, smelting and manufacturing the cast iron piers.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its landmark qualities as an integral part of the overall historic vista which includes the iron bridge, the long timber viaduct and adjacent rail bridge. These are a widely recognisable part of the built environment in Gundagai and have a place in the experience and memories of travellers between Sydney and Melbourne from its opening in 1867 until its closure in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.''' \n\nThe item is of state heritage significance as it has special value to the engineering profession throughout the state, as demonstrated by the Engineers Australia Historic Engineering Marker. It also has a special association with travellers between Sydney and Melbourne, having carried Hume Highway traffic for over 100 years. Since the realignment of the Highway in 1977, the historic features of the bridge with its viaduct have been successfully promoted such that it, along with the rail bridge and its viaduct, is a prominent tourist attraction.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nIt meets this criterion of State significance because the cast iron cylinders for the piers were made with the earliest Australian iron, cast in The Fitzroy Ironworks which were the first ironworks in Australia. The pier cylinders are therefore an irreplaceable source of information on the quality and techniques of Australia's first ironworks.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nThe bridge is of state heritage significance as it is one of only two early Australian bridges built with Australian iron (Denison Bridge at Bathurst is the other). It is also one of only three pin jointed metal trusses still extant in NSW (the others being the Whipple truss road bridge at Nowra and the Gundagai rail bridge, no longer in use). It is a British pin-jointed truss of a type that did not appear in the USA until the 1880s, and has the unique feature of the trusses being suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord member, supported on roller bearings on vertical pillars at each pier.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.''' \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridgeis of state heritage significance as it is representative of the engineering excellence of the designer William Christopher Bennett, and of the contractor Francis Bell. While William Christopher Bennett was responsible for the design of many hundreds of bridges in the mid to late 1800s, only very few remain. The bridge is an outstanding example of the designs of William Christopher Bennett, demonstrating his ability in sound structural analysis as well as his willingness to make use of relatively new methods and practices in bridge design.<ref name=nswshr-2022/>\n\n== See also == \n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|Engineering}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n\n==Gallery==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Gallery\n|title=|footer=\n|File:Gundagai Bridge 1867.jpg|Etching of the new bridge, 1867.\n|file:Gundagai bridge 1885.jpg|The Prince Alfred bridge crosses the Murrumbidgee River at Gundagai, photographed {{circa|1885}}.\n|file:Prince Alfred Bridge.jpg|Prince Alfred Bridge, former [[Hume Highway]].\n}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Riverina}}\n\n[[Category:1867 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1867]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Crossings of the Murrumbidgee River]]\n[[Category:Gundagai]]\n[[Category:Truss bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]  \n\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Wooden bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges in the Riverina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=January 2018}}\n<!-- [[WP:Units]] -->\n{{Infobox bridge |\n| bridge_name    = Prince Alfred Bridge\n| image          = OldHumeHighway,GundagaiWoodenBridge.jpg\n| image_size = 270px\n| caption = \n| location = Middleton Drive, [[Gundagai, New South Wales|Gundagai]], [[Cootamundra-Gundagai Regional Council]], [[New South Wales]], Australia\n| coordinates    = {{coord|-35.0744|148.1069|region:AU-NSW_type:landmark|display=inline,title|format=dms}}\n| carries        = \n| closed = n.d.

The timber spans on the Prince Alfred Bridge have deteriorated to such an extent that the 1896 side ramp has had to be reinstated, so that most of the northern approach is disused, and has deteriorated to the point where it is closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrians.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe bridge was named for the then reigning [[Queen Victoria]]'s son, Prince [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], and was built to carry the Great Southern Road (now the Hume Highway) across the Murrumbidgee. It has existed in three forms, with only the main spans across the river itself being common to all three.\n\n== History == \n\nThe site was historically known as the \"crossing place\" and is where [[Charles Sturt]] first crossed the Murrumbidgee. It became known in the mid-19th century as the safest location to cross the river. Periodic flooding of the Murrumbidgee had already had detrimental effects on the pioneering settlement of Gundagai, situated on the floodplain. In 1852 almost 100 people were drowned in a severe flood. By 1853 a new town site had been chosen on the high ground north of the floodplain and its main street, Sheridan Street, became part of the [[Great South Road (New South Wales)|Great South Road]], subsequently the original Hume Highway until it was bypassed in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nOn 30 January 1861 ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|NSW Legislative Assembly]] had rejected a motion for a road bridge at Gundagai due to lack of funds and lack of evidence of a need. A public meeting was held in September at the Gundagai Court House and resolutions from the meeting together with a subsequent petition from the district were forwarded to [[Sydney]] for consideration by the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]].<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe river crossing had become a major obstacle for travellers and teams following the [[Hamilton Hume|Hume]] and [[William Hovell|Hovell]] route to the [[Riverina]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and there had been regular petitions and deputations to the Colonial Government for a bridge. Successive governments deferred on the grounds of low traffic flows and the high cost of any bridge project to cross the half-mile flood plain, but political and commercial factors forced the Government's hand. The merchants at [[Wagga Wagga]] favoured trade with Victoria since that colony's railway had reached [[Echuca]] in 1864, and they accused the distant Sydney-based Government of neglect. They formed a joint-stock company and built a substantial three span timber bridge over the [[Murrumbidgee River]] in order to direct traffic from the surrounding districts through the town. It was reported that as a financial speculation the bridge has proved successful. A similar bridge had been erected over the [[Murray River]] at [[Albury]]. The NSW Government was forced to act in order to turn the flow of wealth towards Sydney. Not only was a bridge planned, but an expensive iron structure was approved as a clear indication to the south-western districts of the Government's legitimate interests in those regions.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn late 1861, the Government placed [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]24,000 in the estimates for a modest scheme with a short viaduct, which would have left the floodplain impassable during a flood. However, in 1864 the estimate was increased to A\u00a337,000 for the whole river flat to be bridged. The Prince Alfred Bridge over the Murrumbidgee River was opened on 24 October 1867 and named after [[Queen Victoria]]'s second son who was touring Australia that year. It was the first metal truss bridge to be built in NSW. A short sloping viaduct descended to join the road over the river flats until the long timber viaduct was complete in 1869.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn England in 1848, [[James Warren (engineer)|James Warren]] and [[Willoughby Monzani]] had obtained a British [[patent]] for a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles that could support a road on either its top or bottom chord. [[Warren truss|Warren's name became synonymous]] with this form. The first major spans using this configuration were built in England, and English construction firms built prefabricated versions for use in the British colonies, especially India. Thomas Kennard then applied a more detailed analysis of the stress distribution, allowing further economy in the use of iron by varying the cross-sectional area of the top and bottom chords without adversely affecting strength. Kennard patented his invention in 1853, and it was the Warren and Kennard patent that was used by Bennett in his design of the Prince Alfred Bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nAccording to Bennett, the Warren girder had been adopted, because it required the least workmanship on the ground, and because of the rapidity with which it could be erected, incurring least risk from the violent floods of the Murrumbidgee during construction. However, Bennett, along with many other engineers of his day, considered the lattice truss superior. The main objection to the Warren truss was that all the strains are taken by a single pin, whereas in the lattice system the strain is divided amongst a number of rivets instead. Francis Bell, the contractor, also preferred the wrought iron lattice, which, he said, could be imported from England and launched into position very economically. For these (among other) reasons, very few Warren truss bridges were constructed during this period.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> The iron for the superstructure was furnished by Messrs Lloyds, Fosters, and Company's Wednesbury, Old Park Ironworks in Staffordshire, and was inspected by eminent engineer Mr. Fowler. Testing of the wrought iron was conducted, and the strength was found to be much in excess of the specification. The testing in England of the first span for the bridge was also reported as very satisfactory; the deflection with a load did not exceed an inch.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nIn 1848, three Sydney businessmen had joined a local man in an attempt to exploit the iron resources of the [[Nattai, New South Wales|Nattai]] district, which became the Fitzroy Ironworks. The Fitzroy Ironworks were the first ironworks in Australia, but their story is one of persistent failure over half a century despite numerous and repeated ambitious, entrepreneurial and optimistic attempts. For finished products (cast or rolled), land or water transport to an English port plus sea freight to Sydney were less than the cost of cartage between [[Mittagong]] and Sydney. Pig iron, also, could not compete against British iron, mostly brought out as ballast in wool ships.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge, with the [[Denison Bridge]] at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], has the distinction of being one of only two early Australian bridges that contained Australian iron. While the iron for the piers of Denison Bridge at Bathurst was cast at P. N. Russell & Co's Foundry in Sydney from pig iron obtained from the Fitzroy Ironworks, the cast iron piers at Gundagai were cast by the Fitzroy Ironworks from largely local iron. The piers are therefore a rare example of a substantial finished product produced completely by the Fitzroy Ironworks at Mittagong.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe four pairs of cast iron cylindrical columns for the piers were made at the [[Fitzroy Iron Works]] in 56 sections. Each was {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} long, {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} in diameter, with a {{convert|1.125|inch|mm|0|order=flip|adj=on}} wall thickness and each weighed approximately {{convert|2|ST|t LT|spell=on|order=flip}}. They were delivered by [[Ox|bullock]] drays, although delays occurred in carting the cylinders to Gundagai because scarcity of feed and water between [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] and Gundagai deterred carriers from undertaking the work.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nWhen a {{convert|6|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} section of cylinder was placed in its required position, the material inside and under the cutting edge was excavated by hand, causing the cylinder to sink under its own weight. As the cylinder descended, additional lengths were added with internal bolted connections until the necessary depth or foundation had been reached. The hollow cylinder was then filled with rubble consisting of red sandy soil with the odd stone. An immense amount of difficulty was at first experienced in reaching the necessary depth; borings to a great depth had to be made, through huge masses of timber brought down by floods in bygone ages, but the indomitable energy of the superintending engineer, Frederick Augustus Franklin, overcame every obstacle. Franklin, who worked for Francis Bell, was well regarded and gained the cordial good wishes and esteem of the people of Gundagai by his work.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe design for the three iron truss spans of the Prince Alfred Bridge are based on the British pin-jointed Warren and Kennard trusses, and have the unique feature of the trusses being suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord, supported on roller bearings on vertical posts at each pier. The end roller detail has five rollers placed between the extended upper chord and a pillar which rises from the pier top. A similar detail is provided at the central pier, where each upper chord is continued from one span to the next across a nest of rollers. The Warren truss, as originally patented, consisted of a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles but the Prince Alfred Bridge has additional verticals at each cross girder location, designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. It and the railway truss downstream (constructed more than 30 years later) are two of only three pin-jointed metal trusses remaining in NSW - the other is the Whipple truss road bridge at [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]].<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe deck on the truss spans originally consisted of two {{convert|2|inch|cm|0|adj=on|order=flip}} thick layers of diagonal decking, the upper layer being approximately at right angles to the lower layer. The deck was finished with a light curved iron kerb, similar to the kerb which still exists on Denison Bridge (see photo). This arrangement of deck for the truss spans was retained when [[Percy Allan]] designed the new northern viaduct which was constructed in 1898, but by 1932, there was just a single layer of transverse decking on the truss spans similar to the viaduct approaches, and a timber kerb rather than the original iron kerb.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nBy 1932, it was thought that, \"the iron spans, then being sixty-five years old, could hardly be relied upon for a further period of service much in excess of thirty years (the average expected life of a timber girder span as used on viaducts), which would bring them to an age of practically 100 years. Apart from not being heavy enough to carry the present-day standard bridge loading, old age had probably affected the iron and caused some loss of strength.\" However, after considering a number of options for a new bridge it was admitted that, 'It was plain that the existing iron trusses, though light and of unusual design, viewed from the aspect of modern structural practice, were in good order and were capable of rendering efficient service for the life of at least one more timber approach.'<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nSince that time, the timber deck has changed arrangement a number of times, and the ironwork has been painted with a number of different systems (originally white, now grey). In the early 1960s a footway was added to one side of the bridge, which remains today. Good design and quality construction have given a durable bridge able to carry much heavier loads that originally intended or foreseen, and for much longer than had been imagined.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nLocated on the main Sydney to [[Melbourne]] route, the Prince Alfred Bridge carried huge volumes of traffic in its lifetime until 1977 when the Hume Highway was realigned to bypass Gundagai with the construction of Sheahan Bridge. The Prince Alfred Bridge continued to carry local traffic over the Murrumbidgee River between North and South Gundagai;<ref name=nswshr-2022/> until it was declared unsafe for vehicular and pedestrian traffic.\n\n== Description == \nThe Prince Alfred Bridge over the Murrumbidgee River is a three [[Span (architecture)|span]], [[wrought iron]], pin jointed Warren [[truss]] on cast iron cylindrical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. A Warren truss, as originally patented, consists of a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles that support a road on either the top or bottom chord. The [[trusses]] of the Prince Alfred Bridge have additional verticals at each cross girder location, designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. The trusses are suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord, supported on a nest of five rollers located on vertical pillars attached to the top of each pier. The four cylindrical cast iron piers are filled with soil and stones. The trusses support a timber deck, which carries two lanes of traffic. Longitudinal timber sheeting was added to the deck in 1959, and a footway was added on the outside of the truss in the early 1960s.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nAs opened in 1867 the bridge had a total length of {{Convert|1030|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, consisting of three wrought iron truss spans each of {{Convert|103|ft|m|0|order=flip}} across the river, two timber southern approach spans each of {{Convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, and twenty-three timber northern approach spans each of {{Convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, rising on a gradient of 1 in 30 from the level of the floodplain.<ref name=mr>{{cite journal|title=The Murrumbidgee River Bridge at Gundagai, 1865-1932|url=https://www.opengov.nsw.gov.au/publications/15912|website=Open Gov NSW|publisher=Dept of Main Roads|volume=3|issue=6|pages=86\u201389|date=February 1932}}</ref><!-- math doesn't work on those sums --><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60819964 |title=NEW BRIDGE OVER THE MURRUMBIDGEE, AT GUNDAGAI, NEW SOUTH WALES. |newspaper=[[The Illustrated Australian News|Illustrated Australian News for Home Readers]] |issue=125 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=26 November 1867 |page=12 |via=Trove, [[National Library of Australia]] }}</ref>\n\nIt was the first iron truss bridge to be built in New South Wales,<ref name=\"RTAPrinceAlfredBridge\"/> The pin-jointed [[Warren truss]] section is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia.

There is minor section loss due to corrosion, but the loss is not substantially affecting the load carrying capacity of the bridge. A few of the iron castings supporting the cross girders are broken. The portions of the cast iron piers which are below water have been subject to graphitisation (a form of corrosion leading to loss of strength), as is common in cast iron river piers. This does affect capacity, but is not yet causing signs of distress for this bridge. Archaeological potential is low.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n=== Further information === \n\nThe integrity of the Prince Alfred Bridges is excellent. The original cast iron piers and wrought iron trusses are clearly visible. Although the arrangement of the deck has changed over the years, it is still timber as it was originally. The footway added in the 1960s restricts views to the trusses from some viewing angles. Timber deck changes throughout the life of the bridge (both fabric and form), addition of footway in early 1960s, repainting throughout the life of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2022/>\n\n== Heritage listing == \n\nAs at 13 April 2016, the Prince Alfred Bridge is of State heritage significance for its historical values as the first iron truss bridge to be built in New South Wales and the second-oldest metal truss bridge remaining in Australia. In addition it is of significance for its rarity as it is one of only three pin jointed metal trusses remaining in New South Wales. Its historical values include the fact that the cast iron piers were cast in at the Fitzroy Iron Works, the first ironworks in Australia, chiefly from local ores. The Bridge and the piers therefore provides an irreplaceable source of information on the quality and techniques used by Australia's first ironworks and demonstrate the technical achievements of the colony of NSW in producing its own iron. The construction of the bridge was a significant development in the history and development of NSW as it provided easy access to Sydney therefore channeling the resources and wealth of the Riverena district north to Sydney to the benefit of New South Wales rather than south to Melbourne and Victoria<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe state level heritage significance of the Prince Alfred Bridge is enhanced through its important association with inland road transport and communications between Sydney and Melbourne. The bridge is also associated with a visit to Australia by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1867 afterwhom the bridge was named. In addition the bridge is associated with two eminent engineers, William Christopher Bennett the designer and Francis Bell the Contractor.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nTechnically the bridge is of state heritage significance as it demonstrates some unique engineering elements such as the support arrangements, consisting of vertical pillars at each pier, having the trusses suspended from the top chords, resting on a nest of roller bearings. The Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its landmark qualities as an integral part of the overall historic vista which includes the iron bridge, the long timber viaduct and adjacent rail bridge. These are a widely recognisable part of the built environment in Gundagai and have a place in the experience and memories of travellers between Sydney and Melbourne from its opening in 1867 until its closure in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its special value to the engineering profession, particularly for the history of metal bridge design and construction in New South Wales.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nPrince Alfred Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 5 July 2019 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.''' \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge - iron road bridge is lof state heritage significance as it is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia and the oldest in NSW. It formed part of the longest bridge in New South Wales ({{convert|3025|ft|m|0|order=flip}}) until the completion of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932. The Prince Alfred Bridge is important in the history of the development of inland road transport and provides evidence of significant early engineering activity in the Riverina. It also demonstrates the early importance of the Sydney to Melbourne route.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.''' \n\nThe state heritage significance of the bridge is enhanced through its associated with two eminent engineers William Christopher Bennet and Francis Bell.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nWilliam Christopher Bennett, Irish born engineer, designed the iron bridge. After arriving in Australia Bennett quickly rose to the position of Commissioner and Chief Engineer in the Roads Department (appointed in 1860), a position he retained until 1889. Bennett and his Department constructed 16,000km of road and 64 km of bridges. In addition to his prodigious work on roads and bridges in New South Wales, Bennett also made a significant contribution to navigation, water supply and sewerage works.In 1872 Sir [[Henry Parkes]] commended Bennett and his work with the department sayying he was \"one of the ablest officers in the government service\"<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nFrancis Bell was another engineer who was born in Ireland By 1853 Bell had migrated to Australia, and was first involved in a number of significant engineering projects in Victoria. His expertise was such that he was often requested to give evidence to the Victorian Royal Commissions on the River and Harbour Trust, to Select Committees on the Railway Department and the [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central Railway Terminus]]. He was involved in constructing a number of iron truss bridges including the earliest substantial metal truss bridge in Australia, the Hawthorne Bridge over the [[Yarra River|Yarra]] in Melbourne. Bell was City Engineer for the [[City of Sydney]] from 1871 to 1879, and was a member of the Sewerage and Health Board.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.''' \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance as is an important work of a prominent designer, William Christopher Bennett, who made use of the design technology that was patented in England less than 15 years before the opening of the bridge (1853 the Warren and Kennard patent). Bennett's innovations include the support arrangements for the trusses, consisting of vertical pillars at each pier to support the trusses from the top chord, and the introduction of additional vertical elements designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. The Prince Alfred Bridge also demonstrates the technical achievements of the colony of New South Wales in discovering, mining, smelting and manufacturing the cast iron piers.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its landmark qualities as an integral part of the overall historic vista which includes the iron bridge, the long timber viaduct and adjacent rail bridge. These are a widely recognisable part of the built environment in Gundagai and have a place in the experience and memories of travellers between Sydney and Melbourne from its opening in 1867 until its closure in 1977.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.''' \n\nThe item is of state heritage significance as it has special value to the engineering profession throughout the state, as demonstrated by the Engineers Australia Historic Engineering Marker. It also has a special association with travellers between Sydney and Melbourne, having carried Hume Highway traffic for over 100 years. Since the realignment of the Highway in 1977, the historic features of the bridge with its viaduct have been successfully promoted such that it, along with the rail bridge and its viaduct, is a prominent tourist attraction.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nIt meets this criterion of State significance because the cast iron cylinders for the piers were made with the earliest Australian iron, cast in The Fitzroy Ironworks which were the first ironworks in Australia. The pier cylinders are therefore an irreplaceable source of information on the quality and techniques of Australia's first ironworks.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.''' \n\nThe bridge is of state heritage significance as it is one of only two early Australian bridges built with Australian iron (Denison Bridge at Bathurst is the other). It is also one of only three pin jointed metal trusses still extant in NSW (the others being the Whipple truss road bridge at Nowra and the Gundagai rail bridge, no longer in use). It is a British pin-jointed truss of a type that did not appear in the USA until the 1880s, and has the unique feature of the trusses being suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord member, supported on roller bearings on vertical pillars at each pier.<ref name=nswshr-2022/> \n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.''' \n\nThe Prince Alfred Bridgeis of state heritage significance as it is representative of the engineering excellence of the designer William Christopher Bennett, and of the contractor Francis Bell. While William Christopher Bennett was responsible for the design of many hundreds of bridges in the mid to late 1800s, only very few remain. The bridge is an outstanding example of the designs of William Christopher Bennett, demonstrating his ability in sound structural analysis as well as his willingness to make use of relatively new methods and practices in bridge design.<ref name=nswshr-2022/>\n\n== See also == \n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|Engineering}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n\n==Gallery==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Gallery\n|title=|footer=\n|File:Gundagai Bridge 1867.jpg|Etching of the new bridge, 1867.\n|file:Gundagai bridge 1885.jpg|The Prince Alfred bridge crosses the Murrumbidgee River at Gundagai, photographed {{circa|1885}}.\n|file:Prince Alfred Bridge.jpg|Prince Alfred Bridge, former [[Hume Highway]].\n}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Riverina}}\n\n[[Category:1867 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1867]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Crossings of the Murrumbidgee River]]\n[[Category:Gundagai]]\n[[Category:Truss bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]  \n\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Wooden bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges in the Riverina]]\n[[Category:Monuments and memorials to Albert, Prince Consort]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "removedCategory:Monuments and memorials to Albert, Prince ConsortusingHotCatwrong prince", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Alfred_Bridge"}

Its neighbouring communities within the borough of M\u00f6nchengladbach are Hardt to the north, Rheydt to the east and Wickrath to the south. The centre of Rheindahlen is about 7.5 kilometres southwest of the city centre of M\u00f6nchengladbach.\n\n=== Landscape and geology ===\nAround Rheindahlen, the landscape is dominated by the western foothills of [[J\u00fclich-Z\u00fclpich B\u00f6rde]]. It is situated on the southern edge of the [[Lower Rhine Plain]] on the [[Schwalm (Meuse)|Schwalm]]-[[Nette (Niers)|Nette]] Plateau which, in the western part of the borough is characterised by wetlands and woods. To the south is the source region of the [[Niers]]. The Rheindahlen landscape lies on the southern edge of the M\u00f6nchengladbach Loam Plain and rises towards the south. Its lowest point measures {{H\u00f6he|65|DE-NN}}, its highest point is {{H\u00f6he|80|DE-NN}}. The village itself is 70\u2013{{H\u00f6he|73|DE-NN}}.\n\nGeologically, the area belongs to the [[Lower Rhine Bay]] on whose western edge it lies.<ref>{{citation|surname1=Michael Walter|editor-surname1= Zukunft Rheindahlen e.&nbsp;V.|title=Blickpunkte: Rheindahlener Geschichte|publisher=Eigenverlag|location=M\u00f6nchengladbach|page=9|contribution=Seit 65 Millionen Jahren \u2013 Entstehung unserer Landschaft|date=2004|language=German\n}}</ref> Its topmost soil layer consists mainly of [[loess]] which is highly suitable for agriculture and which was deposited during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] in a layer up to 10 metres thick on the gravels and sands of the Rhine. Beneath this upper layer are gravels, sands, clays, and brown coal strata of the [[Tertiary]]. The [[brown coal]] seams of the Lower Rhine Bay are very thick in places and are mined in large [[open-cast pit]]s (in the area of Rheindalen in the [[Garzweiler Mine]]); The brown coal seam of ''Morken'' has, for example, a [[thickness (geology)|thickness]] of around 150 metres. In permeable, beds such as gravel and sands, [[groundwater]] is present on several superimposed levels. These levels are separated by relatively impermeable layers of silt and clay.\n\nThe groundwater is pumped out by wells and drainage measures around the opencast mine of Garzweiler. This extraction of the groundwater results in widespread mining damage as a result of subsidence. In some cases, the drainage even causes movements on the otherwise inactive geological faults which subdivide the Lower Rhine Bay. The \"Rheindahlen Fault\", which runs an east-west direction, has moved as a result of the drainage measures. It runs from the direction of the former British base of [[JHQ Rheindahlen]] to the district [[Rheydt]] and is responsible for mining damage due to lowering of the groundwater and the resulting sedimentary movements along the Rheydt and G\u00fcnhoven [[fault block]]s on the territory of Monchengladbach.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe [[climate]] of Rheindahlen is influenced in particular by the Atlantic [[Gulf Stream]] and its location within the transition between the maritime and continental climatic zones. Precipitation occurs in all seasons and the prevailing wind comes from the south-west. Annual rainfall is around 730 millimetres, with July being the most precipitous and September being the least precipitous month. Summers are usually warm and winters, due to maritime climate, mild. In July, the mean temperature is 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, in January it is 0.5&nbsp;\u00b0C. The duration of the cold period with minimum temperatures below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C is on average less than 60 days, the number of summer days with temperatures above 25&nbsp;\u00b0C is 30 days, with an additional eight \"tropical\" days with daytime temperatures of more than 30&nbsp;\u00b0C and night temperatures above 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, and a total of 20 days can be expected with thunderstorms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nvv-ag.de/new_service/index.htm|title=NiederrheinWasser GmbH \u2013 MDO \u2013 Meteorologische Messdaten|publisher=NiederrheinWasser GmbH|accessdate=2010-10-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819101059/http://www.nvv-ag.de/new_service/index.htm|archivedate=2010-08-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe former borough of ''Rheindahlen'' (since 2009 [[M\u00f6nchengladbach West]]) consists of the nine districts of Wickrath-Mitte, Wickrath-West, Wickrathberg, Wanlo, [[Hehn (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Hehn]], [[Holt (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Holt]], [[JHQ Rheindahlen|Hauptquartier]], [[Rheindahlen-Land]] and Rheindahlen-Mitte.\n\nWhilst ''Rheindahlen-Mitte'' is limited to the town intself and the surrounding streets and residential areas that grew up after the [[Second World War]], ''Rheindahlen-Land'' covers 36 so-called ''[[Honnschaft|Honschaften]]'' around the centre of Rheindahlen, as follows:\n\n{| class=\"nowraplinks\" style=\"border: 2px #D3D3D3 solid; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #E0E0E0; padding: 2px 0 2px 5px; text-align: left;\"| '''Honschaften, [[Rheindahlen-Land]]'''<br /><span style=\"font-size:0.9em;\">M\u00f6nchengladbach, [[M\u00f6nchengladbach West|Stadtbezirk West]]</span>\n|-\n| rowspan=15 style=\"text-align: center; padding: 5px;\"| [[File:MG-Rheindahlen-Land.svg|300px]]\n<span style=\"font-size:0.9em;\">Overview map of ''Rheindahlen-Land''<br />in the Monchengladbach borough</span>\n|-\n| [[Bau (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Bau]]\n| [[Gerkerathwinkel (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Gerkerathwinkel]]\n| [[Merreter (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Merreter]]\n|-\n| [[Baum (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Baum]]\n| [[Griesbarth (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Griesbarth]]\n| [[Peel (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Peel]]\n|-\n| [[Broich (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Broich]]\n| [[Grotherath (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Grotherath]]\n| [[Saas (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Saas]]\n|-\n| [[Dorthausen]]\n| [[G\u00fcnhoven (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|G\u00fcnhoven]]\n| [[Schriefers (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Schriefers]]\n|-\n| [[Eickelnberg (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Eickelnberg]]\n| [[Herdt (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Herdt]]\n| [[Schriefersm\u00fchle (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Schriefersm\u00fchle]]\n|-\n| [[Gatzweiler (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Gatzweiler]]\n| [[Hilderath (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Hilderath]]\n| [[Sittard (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Sittard]]\n|-\n| [[Genhausen (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Genhausen]]\n| [[Knoor (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Knoor]]\n| [[Sittardheide (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Sittardheide]]\n|-\n| [[Genhodder (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Genhodder]]\n| [[Koch (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Koch]]\n| [[Viehstra\u00dfe (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Viehstra\u00dfe]]\n|-\n| [[Genholland (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Genholland]]\n| [[Kothausen (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Kothausen]]\n| [[Voosen (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Voosen]]\n|-\n| [[Genh\u00fclsen (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Genh\u00fclsen]]\n| [[Mennrath (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Mennrath]]\n| [[Wolfsittard (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Wolfsittard]]\n|-\n| [[Gerkerath (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Gerkerath]]\n| [[Mennrathheide (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Mennrathheide]]\n| [[Woof (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Woof]]\n|-\n| [[Gerkerathm\u00fchle (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Gerkerathm\u00fchle]]\n| [[Mennrathschmidt (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Mennrathschmidt]]\n| [[Wyenh\u00fctte (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Wyenh\u00fctte]]\n|-\n|<br /><br />\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" style=\" background-color: #E0E0E0; text-align: center; padding: 5px;\"| [http://www.moenchengladbach.de/index.php?id=stadtbezirke&L=0 Information about Monchengladbach's boroughs and districts]\n|}\n\nIn 1833 the following ''Honschaften'' were part of the mayoralty of Rheindahlen:<ref name=\"rheinprovinz107\">{{citation|title=Die Rheinprovinz der preussischen Monarchie, oder Beschreibung der systematischen Eintheilung in Regierungsbezirke, Kreise, B\u00fcrgermeistereien und Honnschaften, so wie der St\u00e4dte, Flecken, D\u00f6rfer, einzelner Etablissements, mit Angabe der Einwohnerzahl, Gewerbe, Merkw\u00fcrdigkeiten, Anstalten u. s. w.: Ein historisch=geographisch=statistisches Handbuch zum Gebrauch aller St\u00e4nde.

Due to the number of places with the name ''Dahl'', ''Dalheim'', ''Dalem'' and ''Dalhem'' it became increasingly difficult for postal services, which began around 1870, to distinguish between the individual settlements. Because of the location of Dahlen in the Rhine Province of Prussia, it was decided to rename the town ''Rheindahlen''. This was authorised by an act by the Prussian king, William I dated 24 December 1877. The act was published in the Prussian Ministerial Record on 15 February 1878.<ref>{{citation|surname1=Robert Jeuckens|editor-surname1= Bisch\u00f6fliches Di\u00f6zesanarchiv Aachen|title=Geschichte von Stadt und Pfarre Rheindahlen|volume=20|location=Aachen|page=45|date=1954|language=German\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century the municipal authorities of the town of Rheindahlen advised that Rheindahlen should be incorporated into the town of Gladbach.

This happened on 18 July 1921 and thus Rheindahlen lost its independence and from then on was called M.Gladbach-Rheindahlen.

Since the reorganisation of Monchengladbach's boroughs (''Stadtbezirke'') on 22 October 2009 Rheindahlen has been part of M\u00f6nchengladbach West. From the granting of [[Nideggen]] town rights in 1354 until the incorporation of the mayoralty of Rheindahlen into M.-Gladbach on 30 June 1921, the place was an independent town.\n\nIn 1878, the town was renamed from ''Dahlen'' to ''Rheindahlen'' in the [[Prussia]]n [[D\u00fcsseldorf (region)|Province of D\u00fcsseldorf]] by order of Emperor [[William I (German Emperor)|William I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.nrw.de/Kommunalarchive/KommunalarchiveM-P/M/Moenchengladbach/InformationenUndService/AllgemeineInformationen/Verwaltungszugehoerigkeit.html|title=Verwaltungszugeh\u00f6rigkeit|publisher=Landesarchiv Nordrhein-Westfalen|accessdate=2011-01-01}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Its renaming was primarily for postal reasons in order to avoid confusing the Dahlen in the [[Rhine Province]] with the municipality of [[Dahlen (Saxony)|Dahlen in Saxony]] within the North German Postal Zone. Its old name linguistically meant ''Delle'' or \"hollow\", which refers to the location of the village in a depression.\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Location and surrounding area ===\nRheindahlen is located in M\u00f6nchengladbach West, the largest urban district in the city of M\u00f6nchengladbach. It lies to the south-west of the main urban area and borders on the municipality of [[Schwalmtal (Lower Rhine)|Schwalmtal]] to the west and the county of [[Kreis Heinsberg|Heinsberg]] to the southwest. Its neighbouring communities within the borough of M\u00f6nchengladbach are Hardt to the north, Rheydt to the east and Wickrath to the south. The centre of Rheindahlen is about 7.5 kilometres southwest of the city centre of M\u00f6nchengladbach.\n\n=== Landscape and geology ===\nAround Rheindahlen, the landscape is dominated by the western foothills of [[J\u00fclich-Z\u00fclpich B\u00f6rde]]. It is situated on the southern edge of the [[Lower Rhine Plain]] on the [[Schwalm (Meuse)|Schwalm]]-[[Nette (Niers)|Nette]] Plateau which, in the western part of the borough is characterised by wetlands and woods. To the south is the source region of the [[Niers]]. The Rheindahlen landscape lies on the southern edge of the M\u00f6nchengladbach Loam Plain and rises towards the south. Its lowest point measures {{H\u00f6he|65|DE-NN}}, its highest point is {{H\u00f6he|80|DE-NN}}. The village itself is 70\u2013{{H\u00f6he|73|DE-NN}}.\n\nGeologically, the area belongs to the [[Lower Rhine Bay]] on whose western edge it lies.<ref>{{citation|surname1=Michael Walter|editor-surname1= Zukunft Rheindahlen e.&nbsp;V.|title=Blickpunkte: Rheindahlener Geschichte|publisher=Eigenverlag|location=M\u00f6nchengladbach|page=9|contribution=Seit 65 Millionen Jahren \u2013 Entstehung unserer Landschaft|date=2004|language=German\n}}</ref> Its topmost soil layer consists mainly of [[loess]] which is highly suitable for agriculture and which was deposited during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] in a layer up to 10 metres thick on the gravels and sands of the Rhine. Beneath this upper layer are gravels, sands, clays, and brown coal strata of the [[Tertiary]]. The [[brown coal]] seams of the Lower Rhine Bay are very thick in places and are mined in large [[open-cast pit]]s (in the area of Rheindalen in the [[Garzweiler Mine]]); The brown coal seam of ''Morken'' has, for example, a [[thickness (geology)|thickness]] of around 150 metres. In permeable, beds such as gravel and sands, [[groundwater]] is present on several superimposed levels. These levels are separated by relatively impermeable layers of silt and clay.\n\nThe groundwater is pumped out by wells and drainage measures around the opencast mine of Garzweiler. This extraction of the groundwater results in widespread mining damage as a result of subsidence. In some cases, the drainage even causes movements on the otherwise inactive geological faults which subdivide the Lower Rhine Bay. The \"Rheindahlen Fault\", which runs an east-west direction, has moved as a result of the drainage measures. It runs from the direction of the former British base of [[JHQ Rheindahlen]] to the district [[Rheydt]] and is responsible for mining damage due to lowering of the groundwater and the resulting sedimentary movements along the Rheydt and G\u00fcnhoven [[fault block]]s on the territory of Monchengladbach.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe [[climate]] of Rheindahlen is influenced in particular by the Atlantic [[Gulf Stream]] and its location within the transition between the maritime and continental climatic zones. Precipitation occurs in all seasons and the prevailing wind comes from the south-west. Annual rainfall is around 730 millimetres, with July being the most precipitous and September being the least precipitous month. Summers are usually warm and winters, due to maritime climate, mild. In July, the mean temperature is 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, in January it is 0.5&nbsp;\u00b0C. The duration of the cold period with minimum temperatures below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C is on average less than 60 days, the number of summer days with temperatures above 25&nbsp;\u00b0C is 30 days, with an additional eight \"tropical\" days with daytime temperatures of more than 30&nbsp;\u00b0C and night temperatures above 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, and a total of 20 days can be expected with thunderstorms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nvv-ag.de/new_service/index.htm|title=NiederrheinWasser GmbH \u2013 MDO \u2013 Meteorologische Messdaten|publisher=NiederrheinWasser GmbH|accessdate=2010-10-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819101059/http://www.nvv-ag.de/new_service/index.htm|archivedate=2010-08-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\nThe former borough of ''Rheindahlen'' (since 2009 [[M\u00f6nchengladbach West]]) consists of the nine districts of Wickrath-Mitte, Wickrath-West, Wickrathberg, Wanlo, [[Hehn (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Hehn]], [[Holt (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Holt]], [[JHQ Rheindahlen|Hauptquartier]], [[Rheindahlen-Land]] and Rheindahlen-Mitte.\n\nWhilst ''Rheindahlen-Mitte'' is limited to the town intself and the surrounding streets and residential areas that grew up after the [[Second World War]], ''Rheindahlen-Land'' covers 36 so-called ''[[Honnschaft|Honschaften]]'' around the centre of Rheindahlen, as follows:\n\n{| class=\"nowraplinks\" style=\"border: 2px #D3D3D3 solid; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #E0E0E0; padding: 2px 0 2px 5px; text-align: left;\"| '''Honschaften, [[Rheindahlen-Land]]'''<br /><span style=\"font-size:0.9em;\">M\u00f6nchengladbach, [[M\u00f6nchengladbach West|Stadtbezirk West]]</span>\n|-\n| rowspan=15 style=\"text-align: center; padding: 5px;\"| [[File:MG-Rheindahlen-Land.svg|300px]]\n<span style=\"font-size:0.9em;\">Overview map of ''Rheindahlen-Land''<br />in the Monchengladbach borough</span>\n|-\n| [[Bau (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Bau]]\n| [[Gerkerathwinkel (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Gerkerathwinkel]]\n| [[Merreter (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Merreter]]\n|-\n| [[Baum (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Baum]]\n| [[Griesbarth (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Griesbarth]]\n| [[Peel (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Peel]]\n|-\n| [[Broich (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Broich]]\n| [[Grotherath (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Grotherath]]\n| [[Saas (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Saas]]\n|-\n| [[Dorthausen]]\n| [[G\u00fcnhoven (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|G\u00fcnhoven]]\n| [[Schriefers (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Schriefers]]\n|-\n| [[Eickelnberg (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Eickelnberg]]\n| [[Herdt (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Herdt]]\n| [[Schriefersm\u00fchle (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Schriefersm\u00fchle]]\n|-\n| [[Gatzweiler (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Gatzweiler]]\n| [[Hilderath (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Hilderath]]\n| [[Sittard (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Sittard]]\n|-\n| [[Genhausen (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Genhausen]]\n| [[Knoor (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Knoor]]\n| [[Sittardheide (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Sittardheide]]\n|-\n| [[Genhodder (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Genhodder]]\n| [[Koch (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Koch]]\n| [[Viehstra\u00dfe (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Viehstra\u00dfe]]\n|-\n| [[Genholland (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Genholland]]\n| [[Kothausen (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Kothausen]]\n| [[Voosen (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Voosen]]\n|-\n| [[Genh\u00fclsen (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Genh\u00fclsen]]\n| [[Mennrath (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Mennrath]]\n| [[Wolfsittard (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Wolfsittard]]\n|-\n| [[Gerkerath (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Gerkerath]]\n| [[Mennrathheide (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Mennrathheide]]\n| [[Woof (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Woof]]\n|-\n| [[Gerkerathm\u00fchle (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Gerkerathm\u00fchle]]\n| [[Mennrathschmidt (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Mennrathschmidt]]\n| [[Wyenh\u00fctte (M\u00f6nchengladbach)|Wyenh\u00fctte]]\n|-\n|<br /><br />\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" style=\" background-color: #E0E0E0; text-align: center; padding: 5px;\"| [http://www.moenchengladbach.de/index.php?id=stadtbezirke&L=0 Information about Monchengladbach's boroughs and districts]\n|}\n\nIn 1833 the following ''Honschaften'' were part of the mayoralty of Rheindahlen:<ref name=\"rheinprovinz107\">{{citation|title=Die Rheinprovinz der preussischen Monarchie, oder Beschreibung der systematischen Eintheilung in Regierungsbezirke, Kreise, B\u00fcrgermeistereien und Honnschaften, so wie der St\u00e4dte, Flecken, D\u00f6rfer, einzelner Etablissements, mit Angabe der Einwohnerzahl, Gewerbe, Merkw\u00fcrdigkeiten, Anstalten u. s. w.: Ein historisch=geographisch=statistisches Handbuch zum Gebrauch aller St\u00e4nde.

Due to the number of places with the name ''Dahl'', ''Dalheim'', ''Dalem'' and ''Dalhem'' it became increasingly difficult for postal services, which began around 1870, to distinguish between the individual settlements. Because of the location of Dahlen in the Rhine Province of Prussia, it was decided to rename the town ''Rheindahlen''. This was authorised by an act by the Prussian king, William I dated 24 December 1877. The act was published in the Prussian Ministerial Record on 15 February 1878.<ref>{{citation|surname1=Robert Jeuckens|editor-surname1= Bisch\u00f6fliches Di\u00f6zesanarchiv Aachen|title=Geschichte von Stadt und Pfarre Rheindahlen|volume=20|location=Aachen|page=45|date=1954|language=German\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century the municipal authorities of the town of Rheindahlen advised that Rheindahlen should be incorporated into the town of Gladbach.

As the daughter of [[missionaries]], Buck spent most of her life before 1934 in [[Zhenjiang]], [[China]].

Buck, ''My Several Worlds: A Personal Record'' (New York: John Day, 1954) p. 10.</ref> The [[Boxer Uprising]] greatly affected the family; their Chinese friends deserted them, and Western visitors decreased. Her father, convinced that no Chinese could wish him harm, stayed behind as the rest of the family went to Shanghai for safety. A few years later, Pearl was enrolled in Miss Jewell's School there, and was dismayed at the racist attitudes of the other students, few of whom could speak any Chinese. Both of her parents felt strongly that Chinese were their equals (they forbade the use of the word ''heathen''), and she was raised in a bilingual environment: tutored in English by her mother, in the local dialect by her Chinese playmates, and in classical Chinese by a Chinese scholar named Mr. Kung. She also read voraciously, especially, in spite of her father's disapproval, the novels of [[Charles Dickens]], which she later said she read through once a year for the rest of her life.<ref>Peter Conn, ''Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography'', Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1996) 9, 19\u201323 {{ISBN|0521560802}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1911, Pearl left China to attend [[Randolph-Macon Woman's College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], [[Virginia]], graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1914 and a member of [[Kappa Delta]] Sorority. Although she had not intended to return to China, much less become a missionary, she quickly applied to the Presbyterian Board when her father wrote that her mother was seriously ill. From 1914 to 1932, she served as a Presbyterian missionary, but her views later became highly controversial during the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist controversy]], leading to her resignation.<ref name=\"Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 70\u201382\">Conn, ''Pearl S. Buck'', 70\u201382.</ref>\n\n==Career in China==\n\nIn 1914, Pearl returned to China. She married an agricultural economist missionary, [[John Lossing Buck]], on May 30, 1917, and they moved to [[Suzhou, Anhui|Suzhou, Anhui Province]], a small town on the [[Huai River]] (not to be confused with the better-known Suzhou in Jiangsu Province). This region she describes in her books ''The Good Earth'' and ''Sons''.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1933, the Bucks made their home in Nanjing, on the campus of the [[University of Nanking]], where they both had teaching positions. She taught [[English literature]] at the private, church-run University of Nanking,<ref>{{cite book|author=Gould Hunter Thomas|\ntitle=''An American in China, 1936-1939: A Memoir''| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fL9PAAACAAJ|date=1 January 2004| chapter=Nanking | chapterurl=http://www.willysthomas.net/Nanking.htm | publisher=Greatrix Press|isbn=978-0-9758800-0-5}}</ref> [[Ginling College]] and at the [[Nanjing University|National Central University]]. In 1920, the Bucks had a daughter, Carol, afflicted with [[phenylketonuria]]. In 1921, Buck's mother died of a tropical disease, [[Tropical sprue|sprue]], and shortly afterward her father moved in. In 1924, they left China for John Buck's year of sabbatical and returned to the United States for a short time, during which Pearl Buck earned her [[Master of Arts|master's]] degree from [[Cornell University]]. In 1925, the Bucks adopted Janice (later surnamed Walsh). That autumn, they returned to China.<ref name=\"Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 70\u201382\"/>\n\nThe tragedies and dislocations that Buck suffered in the 1920s reached a climax in March 1927, during the \"[[Nanking incident of 1927|Nanking Incident]]\". In a confused battle involving elements of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s Nationalist troops, Communist forces, and assorted warlords, several Westerners were murdered. Since her father Absalom insisted, as he had in 1900 in the face of the Boxers, the family decided to stay in Nanjing until the battle reached the city. When violence broke out, a poor Chinese family invited them to hide in their hut while the family house was looted. The family spent a day terrified and in hiding, after which they were rescued by American gunboats. They traveled to Shanghai and then sailed to Japan, where they stayed for a year, after which they moved back to Nanjing. Buck later said that this year in Japan showed her that not all Japanese were militarists. When she returned from Japan in late 1927, Buck devoted herself in earnest to the vocation of writing. Friendly relations with prominent Chinese writers of the time, such as [[Xu Zhimo]] and [[Lin Yutang]], encouraged her to think of herself as a professional writer. She wanted to fulfill the ambitions denied to her mother, but she also needed money to support herself if she left her marriage, which had become increasingly lonely, and since the mission board could not provide it, she also needed money for Carol's specialized care. Buck went once more to the States in 1929 to find long-term care for Carol, and while there, [[Richard J. Walsh]], editor at [[John Day Company|John Day publishers]] in New York, accepted her novel ''[[East Wind: West Wind]]''. She and Walsh began a relationship that would result in marriage and many years of professional teamwork. Back in Nanking, she retreated every morning to the attic of her university bungalow and within the year completed the manuscript for ''[[The Good Earth]]''.<ref name=\"Conn, Pearl S.

Her talk was titled \"Is There a Case for the Foreign Missionary?\" and her answer was a barely qualified \"no\". She told her American audience that she welcomed Chinese to share her Christian faith, but argued that China did not need an institutional church dominated by missionaries who were too often ignorant of China and arrogant in their attempts to control it.

If they are reading their magazines by the million, then I want my stories there rather than in magazines read only by a few.\"<ref>Nobel Lecture (1938) [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1938/buck-lecture.html# The Chinese Novel]</ref>\n\n==Humanitarian efforts and later life==\n\n\nBuck was highly committed to a range of issues that were largely ignored by her generation.

As the daughter of [[missionaries]], Buck spent most of her life before 1934 in [[Zhenjiang]], [[China]]. Her novel ''[[The Good Earth]]'' was the best-selling fiction book in the United States in 1931 and 1932 and won the [[Pulitzer Prize for the Novel|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1932.

Buck, ''My Several Worlds: A Personal Record'' (New York: John Day, 1954) p. 10.</ref> The [[Boxer Uprising]] greatly affected the family; their Chinese friends deserted them, and Western visitors decreased. Her father, convinced that no Chinese could wish him harm, stayed behind as the rest of the family went to Shanghai for safety. A few years later, Pearl was enrolled in Miss Jewell's School there, and was dismayed at the racist attitudes of the other students, few of whom could speak any Chinese. Both of her parents felt strongly that Chinese were their equals (they forbade the use of the word ''heathen''), and she was raised in a bilingual environment: tutored in English by her mother, in the local dialect by her Chinese playmates, and in classical Chinese by a Chinese scholar named Mr. Kung. She also read voraciously, especially, in spite of her father's disapproval, the novels of [[Charles Dickens]], which she later said she read through once a year for the rest of her life.<ref>Peter Conn, ''Pearl S.

Although she had not intended to return to China, much less become a missionary, she quickly applied to the Presbyterian Board when her father wrote that her mother was seriously ill. From 1914 to 1932, she served as a Presbyterian missionary, but her views later became highly controversial during the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist controversy]], leading to her resignation.<ref name=\"Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 70\u201382\">Conn, ''Pearl S. Buck'', 70\u201382.</ref>\n\n==Career in China==\n\nIn 1914, Pearl returned to China. She married an agricultural economist missionary, [[John Lossing Buck]], on May 30, 1917, and they moved to [[Suzhou, Anhui|Suzhou, Anhui Province]], a small town on the [[Huai River]] (not to be confused with the better-known Suzhou in Jiangsu Province). This region she describes in her books ''The Good Earth'' and ''Sons''.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1933, the Bucks made their home in Nanjing, on the campus of the [[University of Nanking]], where they both had teaching positions. She taught [[English literature]] at the private, church-run University of Nanking,<ref>{{cite book|author=Gould Hunter Thomas|\ntitle=''An American in China, 1936-1939: A Memoir''| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fL9PAAACAAJ|date=1 January 2004| chapter=Nanking | chapterurl=http://www.willysthomas.net/Nanking.htm | publisher=Greatrix Press|isbn=978-0-9758800-0-5}}</ref> [[Ginling College]] and at the [[Nanjing University|National Central University]]. In 1920, the Bucks had a daughter, Carol, afflicted with [[phenylketonuria]]. In 1921, Buck's mother died of a tropical disease, [[Tropical sprue|sprue]], and shortly afterward her father moved in. In 1924, they left China for John Buck's year of sabbatical and returned to the United States for a short time, during which Pearl Buck earned her [[Master of Arts|master's]] degree from [[Cornell University]]. In 1925, the Bucks adopted Janice (later surnamed Walsh). That autumn, they returned to China.<ref name=\"Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 70\u201382\"/>\n\nThe tragedies and dislocations that Buck suffered in the 1920s reached a climax in March 1927, during the \"[[Nanking incident of 1927|Nanking Incident]]\". In a confused battle involving elements of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s Nationalist troops, Communist forces, and assorted warlords, several Westerners were murdered. Since her father Absalom insisted, as he had in 1900 in the face of the Boxers, the family decided to stay in Nanjing until the battle reached the city. When violence broke out, a poor Chinese family invited them to hide in their hut while the family house was looted. The family spent a day terrified and in hiding, after which they were rescued by American gunboats. They traveled to Shanghai and then sailed to Japan, where they stayed for a year, after which they moved back to Nanjing. Buck later said that this year in Japan showed her that not all Japanese were militarists. When she returned from Japan in late 1927, Buck devoted herself in earnest to the vocation of writing. Friendly relations with prominent Chinese writers of the time, such as [[Xu Zhimo]] and [[Lin Yutang]], encouraged her to think of herself as a professional writer. She wanted to fulfill the ambitions denied to her mother, but she also needed money to support herself if she left her marriage, which had become increasingly lonely, and since the mission board could not provide it, she also needed money for Carol's specialized care. Buck went once more to the States in 1929 to find long-term care for Carol, and while there, [[Richard J. Walsh]], editor at [[John Day Company|John Day publishers]] in New York, accepted her novel ''[[East Wind: West Wind]]''. She and Walsh began a relationship that would result in marriage and many years of professional teamwork. Back in Nanking, she retreated every morning to the attic of her university bungalow and within the year completed the manuscript for ''[[The Good Earth]]''.<ref name=\"Conn, Pearl S.

Her talk was titled \"Is There a Case for the Foreign Missionary?\" and her answer was a barely qualified \"no\". She told her American audience that she welcomed Chinese to share her Christian faith, but argued that China did not need an institutional church dominated by missionaries who were too often ignorant of China and arrogant in their attempts to control it.

She wrote on diverse subjects, including [[women's rights]], Asian cultures, [[immigration]], adoption, missionary work, war, the atomic bomb (''Command the Morning''), and violence.\n[[File:Pearl Buck and Swedish King.gif|thumb|Pearl S.

After the Golden Horde fell in 1480, the area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]]. On their border since the 14th century the vast steppe of the Don region was populated by those people who were not satisfied with the existing social order, by those who did not recognize the power of the land-owners, by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom. In the course of time they turned into a united community and were called \"the Cossacks\". At first the main occupation of these small armed detachments was hunting and fishing\u2014as well as the constant struggle against the Turks and the Tatars who attacked them. Only later they began to settle and work on the land.\n\n====16th century====\nThe first records relating to the Cossack villages: the \"stanitsa\", date back to 1549. In the year 1552 Don Cossacks under the command of Ataman [[Susar Fedorov]] joined the Army of [[Ivan the Terrible]] during the [[Siege of Kazan]] in 1552. On 2 June 1556 the Cossack regiment of Ataman [[Lyapun Filimonov]], together with the Army of Moscovits comprising [[strelets]], conquered and annexed the [[Astrakhan Khanate]].\n\nDuring the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]] (Ivan IV), the ataman [[Yermak Timofeyevich]] went on an expedition to conquer [[Siberia]]. After defeating Khan Kuchum in the fall of 1582 and occupying [[Qashliq|Isker]]: the capital of the [[Siberian Khanate]], Yermak sent a force of cossacks down the [[Irtysh]] in the winter of 1583. The detachment led by Bogdan Bryazga (according to other sources, the Cossack chieftain Nikita Pan); passed through the lands of the Konda-Pelym [[Mansi people|Vogul]]s and reached the walls of the town of Samarovo. Taken by surprise by the cossack attack, the [[Khanty people|Ostyaks]] surrendered. In fall 1585, shortly after Yermak's death, Cossacks led by voevoda (army commander) Ivan Mansurov founded the first Russian fortified town in Siberia, [[Obskoy]], at the mouth of the Irtysh river on the right bank of the [[Ob River|Ob]] river. The Mansi and Khanty lands thus became part of the Russian state, finally secured by the founding of the cities of [[Pelym]] and [[Berezov]] in 1592 and [[Surgut]] in 1594. As a result of Yermak's expedition, Russia was able to annex Siberia.\n\n====17th century====\nDuring the [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u201318)]], the Polish\u2013Lithuanian noble [[Aleksander J\u00f3zef Lisowski]] founded a cavalry mercenary group (named [[Lisowczycy]] after his death) from various outlaws, partly Don Cossacks. This group served under the Polish Crown; after the war with Muscovites Lisowczycy took part in the [[Moldavian Magnate Wars]] ([[Battle of Humenn\u00e9]] in 23 November 1619) at [[Upper Hungary]], (now eastern [[Slovakia]]), later they plundered [[Silesia]] and [[Moravia]] as allies of [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg armies]] in the [[Bohemian Revolt]] \u2013 first phase of [[Thirty Years' War]]. This phase culminated in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 8 November 1620 (near [[Prague]], the capital of the [[Crown of Bohemia]], now the [[Czech Republic]]), where the Lisowczycy were sent by [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]] against [[Hungarian cavalry]]. They were victorious, capturing twenty standards. After the battle, they terrorised village people around Prague and other cities,<ref>[http://fpavelka.com/2010_05.pdf], pp. 8\u20139</ref> so they were expeditiously paid and released from service in 7 May 1621. Some returned to Poland, others served under Habsburg [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria]].\n\n[[File:Russian cossacks in Paris streets in 1814.JPG|thumb|right|Don cossacks in Paris in 1814]]\nUnder [[Peter the Great]] and subsequent rulers, the Don Cossacks participated in numerous military campaigns, which resulted in the expansion of the Russian Empire from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Baltic Sea]]. For years, the Cossacks waged war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]]. In 1637 the Don Cossacks, joined by the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], captured the strategic Ottoman fortress of [[Azov]], which guarded the Don.<ref>Brian L. Davies, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=i5-CAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA89 Warfare, State and Society on the Black Sea Steppe]'', 2007, page 89-90</ref> The defense of the [[Azov Fortress]] in 1641 was one of the key actions in Don Cossack history. After total taking of the Free Territories of Don Cossacks under the Moscovits control, Don Cossack history is totally intertwined with the history of the rest of Russia. In exchange for protection of the Southern borders of medieval Russia, the Don Cossacks were given the privilege of not paying taxes and the tsar's authority in Cossack lands was not as absolute as in other parts of Russia.\n\nDuring this period, three of Russia's most notorious rebels, [[Stenka Razin]], [[Kondraty Bulavin]] and [[Emelian Pugachev]], were Don Cossacks.\n\n===18th\u201319th centuries===\n[[File:Stanley Wood CossackCourage.jpg|right|thumb|1915 drawing from ''[[The War Illustrated]]'' showing a charging Don Cossack. The figure is portrayed in peacetime dress uniform]]\n\nAfter 1786, the territory of the Don Cossacks was officially called Don Voisko Lands, and was renamed [[Don Voisko Province]] (''Oblast\u2019 Voyska Donskogo'') in 1870 (presently part of the [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]], [[Volgograd]], and [[Voronezh]] regions of the [[Russian Federation]] as well as part of the [[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]] region of [[Ukraine]]).\n\nIn 1805 the Don Cossack capital was shifted from Cherkassk to Novocherkassk (New Cherkassk).<ref>Paul Heineman, \"In Defense of an Anachronism: the Cossack Question on the Don, 1861-1914.\" PhD Dissertation, Georgetown University, 2000.</ref>\n\nDon Cossacks are credited with playing a significant part in repelling [[Napoleon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|Invasion of Russia]]. Under the command of Count [[Matvey Ivanovich Platov]], the Don Cossacks fought in a number of battles against the [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]. In the [[Battle of Borodino]], Don Cossacks made raids to the rear of the French Army. Platov commanded all the Cossack troops and successfully covered the retreat of the Russian Army to Moscow. The Don Cossacks distinguished themselves in subsequent campaigns, and took part in the [[Battle of Paris (1814)|capture of Paris]]. Napoleon is credited with declaring, \"Cossacks are the finest light troops among all that exist. If I had them in my army, I would go through all the world with them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/talkofnapoleonat007678mbp|title=Talk Of Napoleon At St. Helena|work=Internet Archive|accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the general census of 1884, the male population of the Don Cossacks was reported to number 425,000. The Don Cossacks were the largest of the ten cossack hosts then in existence, providing over a third of total cossack manpower available for military service.\n\n===20th century===\n\n====World War I====\nOn the eve of World War I, the Don Cossack Host comprised 17 regular regiments plus 6 detached sotnias (squadrons). In addition two regiments of the Imperial Guard were recruited from the Don territory. By 1916 the Don Host had expanded to 58 line regiments and 100 detached sotnias. The central location of the Don territories meant that these units were employed extensively on both the German and Austro-Hungarian fronts, though less so against the Ottoman Turks to the south. The continued value of the Don and other Cossacks as mounted troops was illustrated by the decision taken in 1916 to dismount about a third of the regular Russian cavalry, but to retain the cossack regiments in their traditional role.<ref>{{cite book|first=Vladimir|last=Littauer|page=220|title=Russian Hussar|isbn=1-59048-256-5}}</ref>\n\n====February 1917 Revolution====\nAt the outbreak of the February 1917 Revolution, three regiments of Don Cossacks (the 1st, 4th and 14th) formed part of the garrison of St. Petersburg. Consisting partly of new recruits from the poorer regions of the Host territory, these units were influenced by the general disillusionment with the Tsar's government. Accordingly, they did not act effectively when ordered to disperse the growing demonstrations in the city. Reports that the historically loyal Don Cossacks could no longer be relied on were a significant factor in the sudden collapse of the Tsarist regime.<ref>Albert Seaton, page 27 \"The Cossacks\", SBN 85045 116 7</ref>\n\n====Bolshevik persecution====\n{{see also|Red Terror}}\nThe Don Cossack Host was disbanded on Russian soil in 1918, after the [[Russian Revolution]], but the Don Cossacks in the [[White Army]] and those who emigrated abroad, continued to preserve the traditions, musical and otherwise, of their host. Many found employment as [[Trick riding|trick riders]] in various [[circus]]es throughout Europe and the United States. Admiral [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Aleksandr Vasiliyevich Kolchak]], one of the leaders of the [[White movement]] during the [[Russian Civil War]], was of Don Cossack descent.\nFollowing the defeat of the White Army in the [[Russian Civil War]], a policy of [[decossackization]] (\"Raskazachivaniye\") took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands, since they were viewed as a threat to the new Soviet regime.<ref>{{cite web|first=W.V.|last=Chereshneff|url=http://www.armymuseum.ru/kaz1_e.html|title=The History of Cossacks: The Cossackdom|publisher=Russian Imperial/Red/Soviet Army Museum|date=1952|accessdate=23 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718120913/http://www.armymuseum.ru/kaz1_e.html|archivedate=18 July 2014|df=dmy}}</ref>\n[[File:Ukraine famine map.png|thumb|right|Percentage of depopulation during the Soviet famine of 1932-33.

According to historian Michael Kort, \"During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 1.5 million Don Cossacks, the [[Bolshevik]] regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000\".<ref>Kort, Michael (2001).

In Russian: \"To the sons of glory and freedom\"]]\n\n====Don Cossacks in World War II====\nOn 20 April 1936 the previous ban on Cossacks serving in the [[Red Army]] was lifted. Later the same year two existing Red Army cavalry divisions were re-designated as Don Cossacks. By 1939 a number of these regiments had been issued with traditional Cossack uniforms in ceremonial and field service versions. The dress of the Don Cossack units included the broad red stripes on dark-blue breeches, which had been their distinguishing feature prior to the Revolution. The Don Cossack Cavalry Corps saw extensive active service until 1943, after which its role diminished (as did that of the other remaining horse-mounted units in the Red Army).<ref>Albert Seaton, pages 31-32 ''The Cossacks'', SBN 85045 116 7</ref> However Don Cossack cavalry was still in existence in 1945 and participated in the Victory Parade in [[Moscow]].\n\nDuring World War II, the Don Cossacks mustered the largest single concentration of Cossacks within the German Army, the [[XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps]]. A great part of the Cossacks were former Russian citizens who elected to fight not so much for Germany as against the Soviet Union. The XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps included the [[1st Cossack Division]] and the [[2nd Cossack Division]].\n\n===21st century===\n\n====Modern Don Cossacks====\nToday the Russian state is very different. Between 1917 and 1941, more than half of the Don Cossacks population were killed or deported. The heirs of those deported during the Soviet Terror cannot return to their homeland. This is because the law of [[Restitution]] does not recognize them as victims of communism.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe pro-governmental Host divided in two different organisations. The Don Cossacks were revived in the early 1990s and were officially recognised by the Russian Federation Government in 1997, its Ataman holding the rank, insignia and uniform of a full Marshal.\n\nIn 1992 they joined the separatists forces during the [[Transnistria War]].<ref>Hughes, James and Sasse, Gwendolyn: ''Ethnicity and territory in the former Soviet Union: regions in conflict.''

The assembly elected temporary authorities \u2014 [[ataman]]s.\n\nDon Cossacks were skilled horsemen and experienced warriors, due to their long conflict with the [[Crimean Khanate]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They sold their military services to different powers in Eastern Europe. Together with the Polish King, they raided Moscow during the [[Time of Troubles]] (\u0421\u043c\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f) and, under Russian authority, carried out raids and expeditions against [[Ottoman Turkey]] and [[Qajar Persia]].\n\nIsolated between Russian and Muslim territory, the Don Cossacks developed a distinct culture and language which fused Ukrainian, Russian, Kalmyk, and Tatar elements.<ref>Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: D-K, By James Minahan. page 540</ref>\n\nThe Don Cossacks have a tradition of [[choral singing]] and many of their songs, such as ''Chyorny Voron'' (Black Raven) and ''Lyubo, Bratsi, Lyubo'' (It's good, brothers, good) became popular throughout the rest of Russia. Many of the songs are about death in war.\n\nUp to the 18th century marriages and divorces were held in the Common Assembly (\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0443\u0433). If a Cossack wanted to marry a woman he was expected to bring her to the Common Assembly for presentation. If the Common Assembly gave approval, the marriage followed. The same procedure took place if there was a divorce. [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] banned these practices in the Common Assembly, requiring Cossacks to marry only in church.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nA Cossack marriage is a complex ritual, accompanied by songs, dances and performances. A bridegroom arrives on horseback and takes his bride to the church, followed by a marriage train. After the wedding all present would adjourn to the bridegroom's house. There, the parents would bless the couple, break a loaf of bread above their heads, and sprinkle them with wheat, nuts, sweets and hops. The bride's hair would then be unbraided according to traditional rites.\n\nWhen a son was born to a Cossack family, his relatives presented him with an arrow, a bow, a cartridge, a bullet and a gun. All of these items were hung on the wall, over the boy's bed. At the age of three, the boy began to ride a horse. At the age of 7 to 8 he was allowed to ride in the street, to go fishing and hunt with adults.\n\nHorse racing was a popular pastime with Don Cossacks. Riders competed to hit a target, firing weapons from horseback. The most dexterous were able to do this standing on the horses back. It was traditional practice for Cossack families to provide a young Cossack with two horses, a uniform and weapons.\n\nCossack leave-taking was always festive. All departing Cossacks would gather in the church, then hang a small bag around their necks containing a pinch of their native soil before setting off singing. Having left their [[stanitsa]], they drank a cup of vodka and said good-bye to their native land.\n\n[[File:Military by Lev Kiel 06.jpg|thumb|250px|General of Don Cossack in the early 1800s]]\n\n===Don Cossack Choir Serge Jaroff===\n{{Main|Don Cossack Choir Serge Jaroff}}\nThe [[Don Cossack Choir Serge Jaroff]] was a group of former officers of the [[Russian Imperial Army]] who were discovered singing in \u00c7ilingir (near Constantinople), where they had fled after the defeat of their army in the [[Crimea]].

After the Golden Horde fell in 1480, the area around the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] was divided between the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean west side]] and the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai east side]]. On their border since the 14th century the vast steppe of the Don region was populated by those people who were not satisfied with the existing social order, by those who did not recognize the power of the land-owners, by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom. In the course of time they turned into a united community and were called \"the Cossacks\". At first the main occupation of these small armed detachments was hunting and fishing\u2014as well as the constant struggle against the Turks and the Tatars who attacked them. Only later they began to settle and work on the land.\n\n====16th century====\nThe first records relating to the Cossack villages: the \"stanitsa\", date back to 1549. In the year 1552 Don Cossacks under the command of Ataman [[Susar Fedorov]] joined the Army of [[Ivan the Terrible]] during the [[Siege of Kazan]] in 1552. On 2 June 1556 the Cossack regiment of Ataman [[Lyapun Filimonov]], together with the Army of Moscovits comprising [[strelets]], conquered and annexed the [[Astrakhan Khanate]].\n\nDuring the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]] (Ivan IV), the ataman [[Yermak Timofeyevich]] went on an expedition to conquer [[Siberia]]. After defeating Khan Kuchum in the fall of 1582 and occupying [[Qashliq|Isker]]: the capital of the [[Siberian Khanate]], Yermak sent a force of cossacks down the [[Irtysh]] in the winter of 1583. The detachment led by Bogdan Bryazga (according to other sources, the Cossack chieftain Nikita Pan); passed through the lands of the Konda-Pelym [[Mansi people|Vogul]]s and reached the walls of the town of Samarovo. Taken by surprise by the cossack attack, the [[Khanty people|Ostyaks]] surrendered. In fall 1585, shortly after Yermak's death, Cossacks led by voevoda (army commander) Ivan Mansurov founded the first Russian fortified town in Siberia, [[Obskoy]], at the mouth of the Irtysh river on the right bank of the [[Ob River|Ob]] river. The Mansi and Khanty lands thus became part of the Russian state, finally secured by the founding of the cities of [[Pelym]] and [[Berezov]] in 1592 and [[Surgut]] in 1594. As a result of Yermak's expedition, Russia was able to annex Siberia.\n\n====17th century====\nDuring the [[Polish\u2013Muscovite War (1605\u201318)]], the Polish\u2013Lithuanian noble [[Aleksander J\u00f3zef Lisowski]] founded a cavalry mercenary group (named [[Lisowczycy]] after his death) from various outlaws, partly Don Cossacks. This group served under the Polish Crown; after the war with Muscovites Lisowczycy took part in the [[Moldavian Magnate Wars]] ([[Battle of Humenn\u00e9]] in 23 November 1619) at [[Upper Hungary]], (now eastern [[Slovakia]]), later they plundered [[Silesia]] and [[Moravia]] as allies of [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg armies]] in the [[Bohemian Revolt]] \u2013 first phase of [[Thirty Years' War]]. This phase culminated in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 8 November 1620 (near [[Prague]], the capital of the [[Crown of Bohemia]], now the [[Czech Republic]]), where the Lisowczycy were sent by [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]] against [[Hungarian cavalry]]. They were victorious, capturing twenty standards. After the battle, they terrorised village people around Prague and other cities,<ref>[http://fpavelka.com/2010_05.pdf], pp. 8\u20139</ref> so they were expeditiously paid and released from service in 7 May 1621. Some returned to Poland, others served under Habsburg [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria]].\n\n[[File:Russian cossacks in Paris streets in 1814.JPG|thumb|right|Don cossacks in Paris in 1814]]\nUnder [[Peter the Great]] and subsequent rulers, the Don Cossacks participated in numerous military campaigns, which resulted in the expansion of the Russian Empire from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Baltic Sea]]. For years, the Cossacks waged war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]]. In 1637 the Don Cossacks, joined by the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], captured the strategic Ottoman fortress of [[Azov]], which guarded the Don.<ref>Brian L. Davies, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=i5-CAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA89 Warfare, State and Society on the Black Sea Steppe]'', 2007, page 89-90</ref> The defense of the [[Azov Fortress]] in 1641 was one of the key actions in Don Cossack history. After total taking of the Free Territories of Don Cossacks under the Moscovits control, Don Cossack history is totally intertwined with the history of the rest of Russia. In exchange for protection of the Southern borders of medieval Russia, the Don Cossacks were given the privilege of not paying taxes and the tsar's authority in Cossack lands was not as absolute as in other parts of Russia.\n\nDuring this period, three of Russia's most notorious rebels, [[Stenka Razin]], [[Kondraty Bulavin]] and [[Emelian Pugachev]], were Don Cossacks.\n\n===18th\u201319th centuries===\n[[File:Stanley Wood CossackCourage.jpg|right|thumb|1915 drawing from ''[[The War Illustrated]]'' showing a charging Don Cossack.

Under the command of Count [[Matvey Ivanovich Platov]], the Don Cossacks fought in a number of battles against the [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]. In the [[Battle of Borodino]], Don Cossacks made raids to the rear of the French Army. Platov commanded all the Cossack troops and successfully covered the retreat of the Russian Army to Moscow. The Don Cossacks distinguished themselves in subsequent campaigns, and took part in the [[Battle of Paris (1814)|capture of Paris]]. Napoleon is credited with declaring, \"Cossacks are the finest light troops among all that exist. If I had them in my army, I would go through all the world with them.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/talkofnapoleonat007678mbp|title=Talk Of Napoleon At St. Helena|work=Internet Archive|accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the general census of 1884, the male population of the Don Cossacks was reported to number 425,000. The Don Cossacks were the largest of the ten cossack hosts then in existence, providing over a third of total cossack manpower available for military service.\n\n===20th century===\n\n====World War I====\nOn the eve of World War I, the Don Cossack Host comprised 17 regular regiments plus 6 detached sotnias (squadrons). In addition two regiments of the Imperial Guard were recruited from the Don territory. By 1916 the Don Host had expanded to 58 line regiments and 100 detached sotnias. The central location of the Don territories meant that these units were employed extensively on both the German and Austro-Hungarian fronts, though less so against the Ottoman Turks to the south. The continued value of the Don and other Cossacks as mounted troops was illustrated by the decision taken in 1916 to dismount about a third of the regular Russian cavalry, but to retain the cossack regiments in their traditional role.<ref>{{cite book|first=Vladimir|last=Littauer|page=220|title=Russian Hussar|isbn=1-59048-256-5}}</ref>\n\n====February 1917 Revolution====\nAt the outbreak of the February 1917 Revolution, three regiments of Don Cossacks (the 1st, 4th and 14th) formed part of the garrison of St. Petersburg. Consisting partly of new recruits from the poorer regions of the Host territory, these units were influenced by the general disillusionment with the Tsar's government. Accordingly, they did not act effectively when ordered to disperse the growing demonstrations in the city. Reports that the historically loyal Don Cossacks could no longer be relied on were a significant factor in the sudden collapse of the Tsarist regime.<ref>Albert Seaton, page 27 \"The Cossacks\", SBN 85045 116 7</ref>\n\n====Bolshevik persecution====\n{{see also|Red Terror}}\nThe Don Cossack Host was disbanded on Russian soil in 1918, after the [[Russian Revolution]], but the Don Cossacks in the [[White Army]] and those who emigrated abroad, continued to preserve the traditions, musical and otherwise, of their host. Many found employment as [[Trick riding|trick riders]] in various [[circus]]es throughout Europe and the United States. Admiral [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Aleksandr Vasiliyevich Kolchak]], one of the leaders of the [[White movement]] during the [[Russian Civil War]], was of Don Cossack descent.\nFollowing the defeat of the White Army in the [[Russian Civil War]], a policy of [[decossackization]] (\"Raskazachivaniye\") took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands, since they were viewed as a threat to the new Soviet regime.<ref>{{cite web|first=W.V.|last=Chereshneff|url=http://www.armymuseum.ru/kaz1_e.html|title=The History of Cossacks: The Cossackdom|publisher=Russian Imperial/Red/Soviet Army Museum|date=1952|accessdate=23 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718120913/http://www.armymuseum.ru/kaz1_e.html|archivedate=18 July 2014|df=dmy}}</ref>\n[[File:Ukraine famine map.png|thumb|right|Percentage of depopulation during the Soviet famine of 1932-33.

Later the same year two existing Red Army cavalry divisions were re-designated as Don Cossacks. By 1939 a number of these regiments had been issued with traditional Cossack uniforms in ceremonial and field service versions. The dress of the Don Cossack units included the broad red stripes on dark-blue breeches, which had been their distinguishing feature prior to the Revolution. The Don Cossack Cavalry Corps saw extensive active service until 1943, after which its role diminished (as did that of the other remaining horse-mounted units in the Red Army).<ref>Albert Seaton, pages 31-32 ''The Cossacks'', SBN 85045 116 7</ref> However Don Cossack cavalry was still in existence in 1945 and participated in the Victory Parade in [[Moscow]].\n\nDuring World War II, the Don Cossacks mustered the largest single concentration of Cossacks within the German Army, the [[XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps]]. A great part of the Cossacks were former Russian citizens who elected to fight not so much for Germany as against the Soviet Union.

Between 1917 and 1941, more than half of the Don Cossacks population were killed or deported. The heirs of those deported during the Soviet Terror cannot return to their homeland. This is because the law of [[Restitution]] does not recognize them as victims of communism.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe pro-governmental Host divided in two different organisations. The Don Cossacks were revived in the early 1990s and were officially recognised by the Russian Federation Government in 1997, its Ataman holding the rank, insignia and uniform of a full Marshal.\n\nIn 1992 they joined the separatists forces during the [[Transnistria War]].<ref>Hughes, James and Sasse, Gwendolyn: ''Ethnicity and territory in the former Soviet Union: regions in conflict.''

The flag has three colours: blue, yellow, and red. The flag is similar to that of the [[Ukrainian State]], also established in 1918, which the Don Republic bordered to its west.\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe Don Cossacks Coat of Arms was known from the 17th century. It was adopted as a symbol of the [[Don Republic]] on 15 September 1918.\n[[File:Cort of arms of Vsevelikoe Voisko Donskoe.png|thumb|Coat of Arms of Don Cossacks]]\n\n===Uniform===\nUntil 1914 the distinguishing colour of the Don Cossack Host was red: worn on the cap bands and wide trouser stripes of a dark blue uniform of the loose-fitting cut common to the Steppe Cossacks. Tall lambskin hats were worn on occasion, with red cloth tops. Shoulder-straps were the same dark blue as the caftan (coat).<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Kenny|page=88|title=Uniforms of Imperial & Soviet Russia in Color|isbn=0-7643-1320-7}}</ref> A whip was used instead of spurs.<ref>page 591 of volume 27, The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition</ref> Prior to 1908, individual cossacks from all Hosts were required to provide their own uniforms (together with horses and harness). However the size and relative affluence of the Don Cossack Host permitted the setting up of communally owned clothing factories.\n\nA khaki field tunic was adopted in 1908, replacing the dark blue coats or white (summer) blouses previously worn for ordinary duties. However the blue riding breeches with broad red stripes long characteristic of the Don Host, continued to be worn even on active service during both World Wars.<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Kenny|pages=186\u2013187|title=Uniforms of Imperial & Soviet Russia in Color|isbn=0-7643-1320-7}}</ref>\n\n===Anthem of Don Cossacks===\n''\u0412\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b\u0445\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f, \u0432\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0422\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u043e\u043d'' written by Fedor Anisimov in 1853.<ref>http://a-pesni.org/grvojna/bel/vskol1918.php Anthem of [[Don Republic|Don Cossacks]] in [[Russian Civil War]].</ref> {{in lang|ru}}\n\n==Religion==\nMost Don Cossacks are [[Russian Orthodox]], who consider themselves guardians of the faith.

An illustration from [[Fyodor Solntsev]], 1869]]\n\nThe Cossacks had a democratic society where the most important decisions were made during a '''Common Assembly''' (\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0443\u0433). The assembly elected temporary authorities \u2014 [[ataman]]s.\n\nDon Cossacks were skilled horsemen and experienced warriors, due to their long conflict with the [[Crimean Khanate]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They sold their military services to different powers in Eastern Europe. Together with the Polish King, they raided Moscow during the [[Time of Troubles]] (\u0421\u043c\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f) and, under Russian authority, carried out raids and expeditions against [[Ottoman Turkey]] and [[Qajar Persia]].\n\nIsolated between Russian and Muslim territory, the Don Cossacks developed a distinct culture and language which fused Ukrainian, Russian, Kalmyk, and Tatar elements.<ref>Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: D-K, By James Minahan. page 540</ref>\n\nThe Don Cossacks have a tradition of [[choral singing]] and many of their songs, such as ''Chyorny Voron'' (Black Raven) and ''Lyubo, Bratsi, Lyubo'' (It's good, brothers, good) became popular throughout the rest of Russia. Many of the songs are about death in war.\n\nUp to the 18th century marriages and divorces were held in the Common Assembly (\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u0440\u0443\u0433). If a Cossack wanted to marry a woman he was expected to bring her to the Common Assembly for presentation. If the Common Assembly gave approval, the marriage followed. The same procedure took place if there was a divorce. [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] banned these practices in the Common Assembly, requiring Cossacks to marry only in church.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nA Cossack marriage is a complex ritual, accompanied by songs, dances and performances. A bridegroom arrives on horseback and takes his bride to the church, followed by a marriage train. After the wedding all present would adjourn to the bridegroom's house. There, the parents would bless the couple, break a loaf of bread above their heads, and sprinkle them with wheat, nuts, sweets and hops. The bride's hair would then be unbraided according to traditional rites.\n\nWhen a son was born to a Cossack family, his relatives presented him with an arrow, a bow, a cartridge, a bullet and a gun. All of these items were hung on the wall, over the boy's bed. At the age of three, the boy began to ride a horse. At the age of 7 to 8 he was allowed to ride in the street, to go fishing and hunt with adults.\n\nHorse racing was a popular pastime with Don Cossacks. Riders competed to hit a target, firing weapons from horseback. The most dexterous were able to do this standing on the horses back. It was traditional practice for Cossack families to provide a young Cossack with two horses, a uniform and weapons.\n\nCossack leave-taking was always festive. All departing Cossacks would gather in the church, then hang a small bag around their necks containing a pinch of their native soil before setting off singing. Having left their [[stanitsa]], they drank a cup of vodka and said good-bye to their native land.\n\n[[File:Military by Lev Kiel 06.jpg|thumb|250px|General of Don Cossack in the early 1800s]]\n\n===Don Cossack Choir Serge Jaroff===\n{{Main|Don Cossack Choir Serge Jaroff}}\nThe [[Don Cossack Choir Serge Jaroff]] was a group of former officers of the [[Russian Imperial Army]] who were discovered singing in \u00c7ilingir (near Constantinople), where they had fled after the defeat of their army in the [[Crimea]]. They made their formal concert debut in [[Vienna]] in 1923, led by their founder, conductor and composer, [[Serge Jaroff]].\n\nThe choir became popular in America, Japan and Europe, touring the world in the 1930s, 40s and 50s, till today. The men, dressed as Cossacks, sang [[a cappella]] in a repertory of Russian sacred and secular music, army, folk and art songs. Cossack dancing was eventually added to their programme.\n\n===In popular culture===\n[[Mikhail Sholokhov]]'s monumental work, ''\"[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]\"'', deals sympathetically with the Don Cossacks and depicts the destruction of their way of life as a result of World War I and the [[Russian Civil War]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Azov Sea Region Museum of Cossacks]]\n\n=== Notable Don Cossacks ===\n* [[Don Cossacks noble families]]\n* [[Kondraty Bulavin]]\n* [[Alexei Kaledin]]\n* [[Pyotr Krasnov]]\n* [[Matvei Platov]]\n* [[Emilian Pugachev]]\n* [[Stepan Razin]][[File:01\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0430.jpg|thumb|260px|Stepan Razin, Don Cossack leader who led a major uprising]]\n* [[Yermak Timofeyevich]]\n* [[Ivan Turchaninov]] \u2014 ''Union army brigadier general in the [[American Civil War]]''.\n* [[Aleksandr Khanzhonkov]]\n\n=== Don Cossacks government and policy ===\n* [[Don Republic]]\n* [[Don Army]]\n* [[Cossacks in Turkey]]\n* [[List of Imperial Russian Army Don Cossack regiments]]\n\n=== Don Cossack books ===\n* ''\"[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]\"''\n\n=== Genocide and Don Cossacks ===\n* [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]]\n* [[Kiev pogroms of 1919]] ''\"Carried by Don Cossacks\"''.\n* [[Decossackization]]\n* [[Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II]] \u2014 ''\"betrayal of the Cossacks\"''.\n** ''\"[[Victims of Yalta]]\"'' \u2014 ''1977 book''.\n* [[Ethnic Cleansing of Circassians]]\n* [[Genocides in history]]\n* [[Human rights in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Peter Holquist, \"'Conduct Merciless Mass Terror': Decossackization on the Don, 1919,\" ''Cahiers du Monde russe,'' vol. 38, no. 1/2(Jan.-June 1997), pp.&nbsp;127\u2013162.

It became the foundation of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] after the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Meiji Emperor|Meiji]] assumed all the powers of state during the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The Imperial Guard, which consisted of 12,000 men organized and trained along French Military lines, first saw action in the [[Satsuma Rebellion]]. It was organized into the 1st Guards Infantry [[Brigade]] which had the 1st and 2nd Regiments. The 3rd and 4th Regiments belonged to the 2nd Guards infantry Brigade.\n\nBy 1885 the Imperial Japanese Army consisted of seven divisions, one of which was the [[Imperial Guard]]. A division consisted of four regiments containing two battalions each. The Imperial Guard division was based in [[Tokyo]] and recruited nationally.\n\nAfter the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905, a second Guard Brigade was formed from [[Taiwanese aboriginals|indigenous Formosans]].  In 1920 the Guards Cavalry Regiment, Guards Field Artillery Regiment, Guards Engineer Battalion, Guards Transport Battalion, plus other Guards service units were added.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1939 the Guards Engineer Battalion was expanded into a regiment as was the Guards Transport Battalion.\n\n===Pacific War===\nIn September 1939, the division was split into the 1st and 2nd Guards Brigades.\n\nThe 1st Guards Brigade, which contained the 1st and 2nd Guards Infantry Regiments, the cavalry regiment, and half of the support units, was transferred to [[Northern and southern China|South China]]. Here it became known as the [[Guards Mixed Brigade|Mixed Guards Brigade]]. In October 1940, it joined other Japanese units occupying [[French Indo-China]].  In April 1941 the Mixed Guards Brigade returned to Tokyo but it did not rejoin the Imperial Guards Division.\n\nThe 2nd Guards Brigade, which contained 3rd and 4th Guards Regiments, also went to China. In 1940, it went to [[Shanghai]] before being posted to [[Hainan]] Island. In June 1941, the 5th Guards Infantry Regiment joined the 2nd Guards Brigade becoming the Imperial Guard Division again. It later saw action in the [[Battle of Malaya|Battles of Malaya]] and  [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]] with [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]]'s 25th Army.\n\nIn May 1943, all designated Imperial Guard units were renamed again. The Mixed Guards Brigade in [[Tokyo]] became the [[1st Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|1st Guards Division]] (which now consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 6th Guard Regiments) and the Imperial Guard Division became the [[2nd Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Guards Division]]. The [[3rd Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|3rd Guards Division]], which never left Japan, was formed in 1944.  It consisted of the 8th, 9th and 10th Guards Regiments. Sources do not agree if there ever was a 7th Guard Regiment.\n\nAll military Imperial Guard Divisions were dissolved at the end of [[World War II]].\n\n===War crimes===\nIn [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Singapore]], the Guard Division was involved in several notorious [[Japanese war crimes]] such as the [[Parit Sulong Massacre]] and the [[Sook Ching massacre]]. [[Lieutenant General|Lt Gen.]] [[Takuma Nishimura]], who was sentenced to life imprisonment by a British military court in relation to the Sook Ching killings, was later convicted of war crimes by an Australian Military Court in relation to the Parit Sulong massacre.

It became the foundation of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] after the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Meiji Emperor|Meiji]] assumed all the powers of state during the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The Imperial Guard, which consisted of 12,000 men organized and trained along French Military lines, first saw action in the [[Satsuma Rebellion]]. It was organized into the 1st Guards Infantry [[Brigade]] which had the 1st and 2nd Regiments. The 3rd and 4th Regiments belonged to the 2nd Guards infantry Brigade.\n\nBy 1885 the Imperial Japanese Army consisted of seven divisions, one of which was the [[Imperial Guard]]. A division consisted of four regiments containing two battalions each. The Imperial Guard division was based in [[Tokyo]] and recruited nationally.\n\nAfter the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905, a second Guard Brigade was formed from [[Taiwanese aboriginals|indigenous Formosans]].  In 1920 the Guards Cavalry Regiment, Guards Field Artillery Regiment, Guards Engineer Battalion, Guards Transport Battalion, plus other Guards service units were added.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1939 the Guards Engineer Battalion was expanded into a regiment as was the Guards Transport Battalion.\n\n===Pacific War===\nIn September 1939, the division was split into the 1st and 2nd Guards Brigades.\n\nThe 1st Guards Brigade, which contained the 1st and 2nd Guards Infantry Regiments, the cavalry regiment, and half of the support units, was transferred to [[Northern and southern China|South China]]. Here it became known as the [[Guards Mixed Brigade|Mixed Guards Brigade]]. In October 1940, it joined other Japanese units occupying [[French Indo-China]].  In April 1941 the Mixed Guards Brigade returned to Tokyo but it did not rejoin the Imperial Guards Division.\n\nThe 2nd Guards Brigade, which contained 3rd and 4th Guards Regiments, also went to China. In 1940, it went to [[Shanghai]] before being posted to [[Hainan]] Island. In June 1941, the 5th Guards Infantry Regiment joined the 2nd Guards Brigade becoming the Imperial Guard Division again. It later saw action in the [[Battle of Malaya|Battles of Malaya]] and  [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]] with [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]]'s 25th Army.\n\nIn May 1943, all designated Imperial Guard units were renamed again. The Mixed Guards Brigade in [[Tokyo]] became the [[1st Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|1st Guards Division]] (which now consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 6th Guard Regiments) and the Imperial Guard Division became the [[2nd Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Guards Division]]. The [[3rd Guards Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|3rd Guards Division]], which never left Japan, was formed in 1944.  It consisted of the 8th, 9th and 10th Guards Regiments.
