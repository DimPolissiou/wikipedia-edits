Since sustainable liquid water is thought to be essential to support complex life, most estimates, therefore, are inferred from the effect that a repositioned orbit would have on the habitability of Earth or Venus as their surface gravity allows sufficient atmosphere to be retained for several billion years.\n\nAccording to extended habitable zone concept, planetary-mass objects with atmospheres capable of inducing sufficient radiative forcing could possess liquid water farther out from the Sun. Such objects could include those whose atmospheres contain a high component of greenhouse gas and terrestrial planets much more massive than Earth ([[super-Earth]] class planets), that have retained atmospheres with surface pressures of up to 100 kbar. There are no examples of such objects in the Solar System to study; not enough is known about the nature of atmospheres of these kinds of extrasolar objects, and their position in the habitable zone cannot determine the net temperature effect of such atmospheres including induced [[albedo]], anti-greenhouse or other possible heat sources.\n\nFor reference, the average distance from the Sun of some significant bodies within the various estimates of the habitable zone is: Mercury, 0.39 AU; Venus, 0.72 AU; Earth, 1.00 AU; Mars, 1.52 AU; Vesta, 2.36 AU; Ceres, 2.77 AU; Jupiter, 5.20 AU; Saturn, 9.58 AU.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; align:center; background:#90b0f0;\"\n|+ Estimates of the circumstellar habitable zone boundaries of the Solar System\n!

Once the stratosphere becomes wet, water vapour photolysis releases hydrogen into space. At this point cloud feedback cooling does not increase significantly with further warming. The \"maximum greenhouse\" limit, at the outer edge, is where a {{CO2}} dominated atmosphere, of around 8 bars, has produced the maximum amount of greenhouse warming, and further increases in {{CO2}} will not create enough warming to prevent {{CO2}} catastrophically freezing out of the atmosphere.

For example, although the Solar System has a circumstellar habitable zone centered at 1.34 AU from the Sun,<ref name=\"kopparapu-2013\" /> a star with 0.25 times the luminosity of the Sun would have a habitable zone centered at <math>\\sqrt{0.25}</math>, or 0.5, the distance from the star, corresponding to a distance of 0.67 AU.

An upper limit of 1.5 Earth radii is also considered, given that above {{Earth radius|1.5|link=y}} the average planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating these planets have a significant fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core.<ref>Lauren M.

Since sustainable liquid water is thought to be essential to support complex life, most estimates, therefore, are inferred from the effect that a repositioned orbit would have on the habitability of Earth or Venus as their surface gravity allows sufficient atmosphere to be retained for several billion years.\n\nAccording to extended habitable zone concept, planetary mass objects with atmospheres capable of inducing sufficient radiative forcing could possess liquid water farther out from the Sun. Such objects could include those whose atmospheres contain a high component of greenhouse gas and terrestrial planets much more massive than Earth ([[super-Earth]] class planets), that have retained atmospheres with surface pressures of up to 100 kbar. There are no examples of such objects in the Solar System to study; not enough is known about the nature of atmospheres of these kinds of extrasolar objects, and the net temperature effect of such atmospheres including induced [[albedo]], anti-greenhouse or other possible heat sources cannot be determined by their position in the habitable zone.\n\nFor reference, the average distance from the Sun of some major bodies within the various estimates of the habitable zone are: Mercury, 0.39 AU; Venus, 0.72 AU; Earth, 1.00 AU; Mars, 1.52 AU; Vesta, 2.36 AU; Ceres, 2.77 AU; Jupiter, 5.20 AU; Saturn, 9.58 AU.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; align:center; background:#90b0f0;\"\n|+ Estimates of the circumstellar habitable zone boundaries of the Solar System\n!

Once the stratosphere becomes wet, water vapour photolysis releases hydrogen into space. At this point cloud feedback cooling does not increase significantly with further warming. The \"maximum greenhouse\" limit, at the outer edge, is where a {{CO2}} dominated atmosphere, of around 8 bars, has produced the maximum amount of greenhouse warming, and further increases in {{CO2}} will not create enough warming to prevent {{CO2}} catastrophically freezing out of the atmosphere.

For example, although the Solar System has a circumstellar habitable zone centered at 1.34 AU from the Sun,<ref name=\"kopparapu-2013\" /> a star with 0.25 times the luminosity of the Sun would have a habitable zone centered at <math>\\sqrt{0.25}</math>, or 0.5, the distance from the star, corresponding to a distance of 0.67 AU.

An upper limit of 1.5 Earth radii is also considered, given that above {{Earth radius|1.5|link=y}} the average planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating these planets have a large fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core.<ref>Lauren M.

The bakes are critically examined by the judges who will then choose a \"Baker of the week\" and a baker that is eliminated from the competition. Ten contestants were chosen for the first season.\n\n::'''Signature Challenge:''' This challenge is for the amateur bakers to show off their tried-and-tested recipes that are rustic and altogether home-made-looking.\n::'''Technical Challenge:''' This challenge shows who can follow instructions, but who also has the technical knowledge and experience to produce the finished product. The bakers are all given the same recipe and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished product is ranked from worst to best, with the judges not knowing who produced which.\n::'''Showstopper Challenge:''' This challenge is for the bakers to show off their skills and talent. The judges are looking for a bake that is both of a professional appearance but also in taste.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8em;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Hosts/Judges\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"5\"| Season\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 1)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 2)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 3)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 4)|4]] \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 5)|5]] \n|- style=\"border-top:3px solid #aaa;\"\n! colspan=\"7\"| Current\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Claire Hooper]]<ref>{{Cite web|title =The Great Australian Bake Off: Contestants.|url =https://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/lifestyle/food/the-great-australian-bake-off/season-1-contestants.html|accessdate = November 8, 2017|publisher = Foxtel.|date =2015}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"1\" {{N/a|}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|Host}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Mel Buttle]]<ref>{{Cite web|title =The Great Australian Bake Off: Contestants.|url =https://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/lifestyle/food/the-great-australian-bake-off/season-1-contestants.html|accessdate = November 8, 2017|publisher = Foxtel.|date =2015}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"1\" {{N/a|}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|Host}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Maggie Beer]]<ref>{{Cite web|title =The Great Australian Bake Off: Production commences for third season.|url =https://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/lifestyle/food/the-great-australian-bake-off/season-3.html|accessdate = November 8, 2017|publisher = Foxtel.|date =2017}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"1\" {{N/a|}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|Judge}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Matt Moran]]<ref>{{Cite web|title =The Great Australian Bake Off: Contestants.|url =https://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/lifestyle/food/the-great-australian-bake-off/season-1-contestants.html|accessdate = November 8, 2017|publisher = Foxtel.|date =2015}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"1\" {{N/a|}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|Judge}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"| Former\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Shane Jacobson]]\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|Host}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Anna Gare]]\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|Host}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Dan Lepard]]\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|Judge}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Kerry Vincent]]\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|Judge}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/a|}}\n|}\n\n==Season overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Network\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Originally Aired\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Runners-up\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Winner\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Prize\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 1)|One]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Nine Network]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 9 July 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 27 August 2013\n| Jonathan Gurfinkel\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Nancy Ho\n| Kitchen Renovation\n|-\n| Maria Vella\n| Retreat Holiday\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 2)|Two]]\n| rowspan=\"4\"| [[LifeStyle Food]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 13 October 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 15 December 2015\n| Jasmin Hartley\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Sian Redgrave\n| rowspan=\"6\" {{n/a|None}}\n|-\n| Susie\nStefanidis\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 3)|Three]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 11 October 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 14 December 2016\n| Monica Cavallaro\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Olivia McMahon\n|-\n| Antonio Marcora\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 4)|Four]]\n| rowspan=4  | [[LifeStyle]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 18 January 2018\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 22 March 2018\n| Barb Dunn\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Claudia Anton\n|-\n| Dave Yan\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 5)|Five]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 3 October 2019\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 5 December 2019\n| David Hills\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Sunny Nasir Ahmad\n| rowspan=\"2\"| TBA\n|-\n| Dan Pasquali\n|}\n\n===Season 1 (2013)===\n{{main|The Great Australian Bake Off (season 1)}}\nSeason 1 of ''The Great Australian Bake Off'' saw ten home bakers take part in a bake-off to test their baking skills as they battled to be crowned The Great Australian Bake Off's best amateur baker.

episode the bakers are tasked with 3 different challenges; a signature bake, a technical bake and a show-stopper. The bakes are critically examined by the judges who will then choose a \"Baker of the week\" and a baker that is eliminated from the competition. Ten contestants were chosen for the first season.\n\n::'''Signature Challenge:''' This challenge is for the amateur bakers to show off their tried-and-tested recipes that are rustic and altogether home-made-looking.\n::'''Technical Challenge:''' This challenge shows who can follow instructions, but who also has the technical knowledge and experience to produce the finished product. The bakers are all given the same recipe and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished product is ranked from worst to best, with the judges not knowing who produced which.\n::'''Showstopper Challenge:''' This challenge is for the bakers to show off their skills and talent. The judges are looking for a bake that is both of a professional appearance but also in taste.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8em;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Hosts/Judges\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"5\"| Season\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 1)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 2)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 3)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 4)|4]] \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 5)|5]] \n|- style=\"border-top:3px solid #aaa;\"\n! colspan=\"7\"| Current\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Claire Hooper]]<ref>{{Cite web|title =The Great Australian Bake Off: Contestants.|url =https://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/lifestyle/food/the-great-australian-bake-off/season-1-contestants.html|accessdate = November 8, 2017|publisher = Foxtel.|date =2015}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"1\" {{N/a|}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|Host}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Mel Buttle]]<ref>{{Cite web|title =The Great Australian Bake Off: Contestants.|url =https://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/lifestyle/food/the-great-australian-bake-off/season-1-contestants.html|accessdate = November 8, 2017|publisher = Foxtel.|date =2015}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"1\" {{N/a|}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|Host}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Maggie Beer]]<ref>{{Cite web|title =The Great Australian Bake Off: Production commences for third season.|url =https://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/lifestyle/food/the-great-australian-bake-off/season-3.html|accessdate = November 8, 2017|publisher = Foxtel.|date =2017}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"1\" {{N/a|}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|Judge}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Matt Moran]]<ref>{{Cite web|title =The Great Australian Bake Off: Contestants.|url =https://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/lifestyle/food/the-great-australian-bake-off/season-1-contestants.html|accessdate = November 8, 2017|publisher = Foxtel.|date =2015}}</ref>\n| colspan=\"1\" {{N/a|}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|Judge}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"| Former\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Shane Jacobson]]\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|Host}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Anna Gare]]\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|Host}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Dan Lepard]]\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|Judge}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Kerry Vincent]]\n| colspan=\"1\" {{yes2|Judge}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/a|}}\n|}\n\n==Season overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Network\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Originally Aired\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Runners-up\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Winner\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Prize\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 1)|One]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Nine Network]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 9 July 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 27 August 2013\n| Jonathan Gurfinkel\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Nancy Ho\n| Kitchen Renovation\n|-\n| Maria Vella\n| Retreat Holiday\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 2)|Two]]\n| rowspan=\"4\"| [[LifeStyle Food]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 13 October 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 15 December 2015\n| Jasmin Hartley\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Sian Redgrave\n| rowspan=\"6\" {{n/a|None}}\n|-\n| Suzy Stefanidis\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 3)|Three]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 11 October 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 14 December 2016\n| Monica Cavallaro\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Olivia McMahon\n|-\n| Antonio Marcona\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 4)|Four]]\n| rowspan=4  | [[LifeStyle]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 18 January 2018\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 22 March 2018\n| Barb Dunn\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Claudia Anton\n|-\n| Dave Yan\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[The Great Australian Bake Off (season 5)|Five]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 3 October 2019\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 5 December 2019\n| David Hills\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Sunny Nasir Ahmad\n| rowspan=\"2\"| TBA\n|-\n| Dan Pasquali\n|}\n\n===Season 1 (2013)===\n{{main|The Great Australian Bake Off (season 1)}}\nSeason 1 of ''The Great Australian Bake Off'' saw ten home bakers take part in a bake-off to test their baking skills as they battled to be crowned The Great Australian Bake Off's best amateur baker.

The name is derived from the historic [[Kentucky colonel]]s.  The Colonels won the most games and had the highest winning percentage of any franchise in the league's history, but the team did not join the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] in the 1976 [[ABA\u2013NBA merger]].   The downtown [[Louisville Gardens|Louisville Convention Center]] (now known as The Gardens) was the Colonels' original venue for the first three seasons before moving to [[Freedom Hall]] for the remaining seasons, beginning with the 1970\u201371 schedule.\n\nThe Kentucky Colonels were only one of two ABA teams, along with the [[Indiana Pacers]], to play for the entire duration of the league without relocating, changing its team name, or folding.  The Colonels were also the only major league franchise in Kentucky since the [[Louisville Breckenridges]] left the [[National Football League]] in 1923.\n\n==Overview and background==\nThe [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]-based Colonels started their time in the ABA as a colorful franchise, and not just because of their bright chartreuse green uniforms. Among the things they were known for was their \"[[mascot]]\" Ziggy, a prize-winning [[Brussels Griffon]] dog that was owned by original team owners Joe and Mamie Gregory.\n\nThey were equally famous for publicity stunts, their most famous coming in 1968 when [[Penny Ann Early]], the first licensed female [[horse racing]] [[jockey]], was signed to appear in an ABA game (albeit for a few seconds).\n\nThe early color of their franchise began to wane during the 1970\u201371 season, when they signed another Wildcat star in [[All-America]]n [[Dan Issel]]. They also dropped the chartreuse green uniforms in favor of a blue and white scheme similar to that of the Wildcats. Another abnormality to the Colonels uniform change was that the players' last names on the back had only the first letter capitalized, as opposed to all capital letters, which are almost universally featured on the back of nearly every professional or collegiate basketball uniform which names on the back of jerseys are featured. Issel's signing helped the Colonels become well known as a legitimate basketball team. Despite an average record in the regular season, they made a serious run at the [[1971 ABA Playoffs|1971 ABA championship]]. They fell just short, however, and lost to the [[Utah Stars]] in seven games.\n\nThey proved to be even better in 1971, with the signing of [[Artis Gilmore]]. Gilmore's signing would help make the Colonels a legitimate powerhouse for years to come. The Colonels won 68 games in his rookie campaign under coach [[Joe Mullaney]]; their record turned out to be best in the league's entire history. Yet, in the playoffs, they were upset by the [[New York Nets]] in the first round. Kentucky recovered and made another championship run during the [[1973 ABA Playoffs|1972\u201373 playoffs]], but lost a physical series to the [[Indiana Pacers]] in 7 games, 4 games to 3.\n\nAfter the season, the franchise was nearly moved out-of-state to [[Cincinnati]], but was purchased by [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]], a future Kentucky governor who owned [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] for years. Brown helped increase interest in the team, and looked to improve its on-court performance by hiring popular ABA coach [[Babe McCarthy]]. But after they were swept in the second round of the playoffs by the Nets, Brown gave McCarthy his walking papers.\n\nFor the 1974\u201375 season, Brown hired [[Hubie Brown]] (no relation), a former NBA assistant coach, to give them that championship. Unlike the past year, the Colonels would not be denied. After a torrid finish to the regular season, which saw them win 23 of 26 games, they ripped through the playoffs, and beat their nemesis, the [[Indiana Pacers]], in a dominant 4 games to 1 victory to win the [[1975 ABA Playoffs|1975 ABA championship]]. Gilmore scored 28 points and grabbed an amazing 31 rebounds in the final game. That same season the [[Golden State Warriors]] won the NBA Title. Colonels owner, John Y. Brown, offered the NBA Champs a million dollars to play a one-game world championship. The Warriors and the NBA refused.\n\nThe celebration of the 1975 season ended when John Y. Brown, Jr. dealt Dan Issel to the ABA's new [[Baltimore Claws]] franchise (which folded after a few preseason exhibition games, never taking the floor in the regular season) for financial reasons. They acquired all-star [[Caldwell Jones]] to replace him, but he never gelled with the team. Jones was dealt mid-season for young [[Maurice Lucas]]. Hubie managed to make the team competitive, but they lost in the postseason to the [[Denver Nuggets]] in 7 games.\n[[Image:KentuckyColonelslogo.jpg|left|thumb]]\nKentucky was one of the league's most talented teams, and had one of its best fan bases, but during the ABA's talks of merging with the NBA, the Colonels were not a favorite to change leagues. As a result, John Y. Brown, Jr. was forced to fold the Colonels. Brown would indeed get an NBA franchise: he purchased the [[Buffalo Braves]] in 1976, then traded it for the [[Boston Celtics]] two years later.\n\nColonels players were distributed to other teams in a dispersal draft, with [[Artis Gilmore]] being drafted first by the [[Chicago Bulls]]. Maurice Lucas went on to be an all-star for the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and [[Louie Dampier]], who ended up being the all-time leader in points and assists, ended his career as a sixth man for the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. Coach Hubie Brown went on to coach the [[Atlanta Hawks]] for five seasons after the merger before being fired.\n\nThe Colonels won 448 games in the ABA, more than any other team or franchise. The Colonels' overall regular season record was 448\u2013296; their .602 winning percentage is better than that of any ABA franchise except for the [[Minnesota Muskies]] who only played one season. (If the [[Utah Stars]]' statistics are counted on their own, excluding their seasons as the [[Anaheim Amigos]] and the Los Angeles Stars, that team's winning percentage, .608, is slightly better than the Colonels'.)\n\nThe Colonels' playoff record was 55\u201346 (.545). Only the [[Indiana Pacers]] won more ABA playoff games (69).\n\n==Year-by-year results==\n\n===1967\u20131968===\nOn March 6, 1967, the American Basketball Association awarded the franchise that became the Kentucky Colonels to Don Regan for $30,000. Later that year the franchise was bought by Joseph Gregory, Mamie Gregory and William C. Boone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/TeamMaterial/KentuckyMaterial/ColonelsRosters2.html|title=Remember the ABA: Kentucky Colonels Year-to-Year Rosters|author=|date=|website=www.RememberTheABA.com|access-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJohn Givens was named as the first coach of the Colonels.\n\nThe Colonels draft picks were used on [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|UK]] standout [[Louie Dampier]], who signed with the Colonels; [[Western Kentucky University]] standout [[Clem Haskins]], who signed with the NBA's [[Chicago Bulls]]; [[Bob Verga]], who signed with Dallas, and [[Randy Mahaffey]], who signed with the Colonels. The team also signed [[Darel Carrier]] (WKU) and [[Jim Ligon|Jim \"Goose\" Ligon]] (from [[Kokomo, Indiana]]). The Colonels' 1967\u201368 roster was rounded out with Kendall Rhine ([[Rice University]]), Stew Johnson ([[Murray State University|Murray State]]), Rubin Russell, Bill Bradley (Tennessee Tech), [[Cotton Nash]] (UK), Bobby Rascoe (WKU), Howard Bayne ([[Tennessee Volunteers basketball|Tennessee]]), Orbie Bowling (Tennessee) and Tommy Woods.\n\nThe Colonels played their home games at the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center (Freedom Hall) and at the [[Louisville Gardens|Louisville Convention Center]] (now Louisville Gardens). The team only won 5 of their first 17 games, leading to Givens being fired as coach. He was replaced by [[Gene Rhodes]]. In November, Stew Johnson was traded to the [[New Jersey Americans]] for Jim Caldwell. Darel Carrier, Randy Mahaffey and Louie Dampier played in the ABA All Star game but the team finished with a record of 36 wins and 42 losses, tying New Jersey for fourth place in the Eastern Division. For the season the Colonels averaged 3,225 fans per game.\n\nThe Colonels and Americans scheduled a [[One-game playoff#National Basketball Association|one-game playoff]] game to determine who would get the playoff bid slated for the Eastern Division's fourth place team. The game was scheduled at the [[Long Island Arena]], as New Jersey's [[Teaneck Armory]] was unavailable, but the facility was in such poor condition that the game could not be played, and the Colonels won by forfeit. The Colonels then advanced to the Eastern Division semifinals where they lost to the [[Minnesota Muskies]] 3 games to 2.\n\n===1968\u20131969===\nAmong the Colonels' draft picks was [[University of Louisville]] star [[Wes Unseld]], who opted to take a higher paying deal with the NBA's Baltimore franchise. The Colonels also drafted [[Manny Leaks]] and [[Gene Moore (basketball)|Gene Moore]], who signed with the team. [[Sam Smith (basketball, born 1944)|Sam Smith]] was acquired from Minnesota and then Randy Mahaffey and Manny Leaks were traded to the [[New York Nets]] for [[Oliver Darden]] and [[Andy Anderson (basketball)|Andy Anderson]].\n\nThe Colonels hosted the [[1969 ABA All-Star Game]] in Louisville. Kentucky coach Gene Rhodes was the head coach for the East team, which lost to the West 133\u2013127. Darel Carrier and Louie Dampier repeated as ABA All Stars and were joined by Kentucky's Jim \"Goose\" Ligon.\n\nDuring this season the Colonels fielded the first ever female professional basketball player when jockey [[Penny Ann Early]] joined the team for pregame warmups and appeared briefly during a game.\n\nThe Colonels finished in third place in the Eastern Division with a 42\u201336 record. Their average home attendance was 4,157.\n\nIn the Eastern Division semifinals the Colonels lost a tight series to their rival the [[Indiana Pacers]], 4 games to 3.\n\n===1969\u20131970===\nThe Colonels used their draft picks to select [[Bob Dandridge]], who joined the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] of the NBA and [[Herm Gilliam]], who signed with the NBA's Cincinnati franchise. Bud Olsen, former [[Kentucky Wesleyan College]] star [[George Tinsley]], future Kentucky Wesleyan coach [[Wayne Chapman]] and former University of Kentucky star [[Tommy Kron]] were added to the roster.\n\nIn April 1969 the Colonels were bought by a group of Louisville investors that included [[H. Wendell Cherry]], Bill DeWitt, [[J. David Grissom]], Stuart P. Jay, [[David A. Jones]], [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] and [[Mike Storen]]. Storen had previously been the president and general manager of the Indiana Pacers. The group then hired former University of Kentucky star [[Alex Groza]] as the team's business manager.\n\nDarel Carrier and Louie Dampier again appeared in the ABA All Star Game and were joined by Gene Moore.\n\nThe Colonels finished the season with a record of 45-39 which was good for second place in the Eastern Division.\n\nThe Colonels defeated the [[New York Nets]] 4 games to 3 in the Eastern Division semifinals but lost in the Eastern Division finals to the Indiana Pacers, 4 games to 1.\n\n===1970\u20131971===\n[[File:Dan Issel (3).jpeg|150px|thumb|left|In his rookie season, [[Dan Issel]] led the ABA in scoring with 29.9 points per game, and also averaged 13.2 rebounds per game.]]\nIn July the Colonels traded Jim \"Goose\" Ligon, Gene Moore and Bud Olsen to Dallas for [[Cincy Powell]]. They also signed University of Kentucky star [[Dan Issel]]. Issel was given a 10-year contract worth $1.4 million. The Colonels also traded a draft pick to the New York Nets for [[Walt Simon]]. Mike Pratt joined the Colonels' roster for the season.\n\nThe Colonels began the regular season with a 10\u20135 record, resulting in coach Gene Rhodes being fired. Rhodes was briefly replaced by Alex Groza, who won both games he coached. Groza was quickly replaced as coach by [[Frank Ramsey (basketball)|Frank Ramsey]], the former star for the University of Kentucky and the [[Boston Celtics]].\n\nKentucky's Dan Issel and Cincy Powell played in the ABA All-Star Game. Issel was named Co-Rookie of the Year, along with [[Charlie Scott]] of the [[Virginia Squires]].\n\nThe Colonels finished the regular season with a record of 44-40 and in second place in the Eastern Division. Their average home attendance for the season was 7,375. Beginning with this season the Colonels moved their home games from the Louisville Convention Center (now [[Louisville Gardens]]) to [[Freedom Hall]].\n\nThe Colonels defeated [[The Floridians]] 4 games to 2 in the Eastern Division semifinals and defeated the [[Virginia Squires]] 4 games to 2 in the Eastern Division finals. Facing the [[Utah Stars]] in the ABA championship, the Colonels and Stars each won three games before Utah pulled out Game 7 at home in front of an ABA record crowd. The Colonels finished as the league's runner up.\n\n===1971\u20131972===\nThe Colonels' draft picks included [[Artis Gilmore]], [[John Roche (basketball)|John Roche]] and [[Mike Gale]], who all signed with Kentucky, and [[Fred Brown (basketball)|Fred Brown]] and [[Larry Steele]], who signed with the Seattle SuperSonics and [[Portland Trail Blazers]] of the NBA, respectively. The Colonels then sold Roche to the New York Nets. Gilmore, like Issel, signed a contract for 10 years and $1.5 million. [[Joe Mullaney]] was named coach of the Colonels.\n\nOn September 22, 1971, the Colonels played in the second ever ABA vs. NBA preseason exhibition game.  13,821 fans watched the Colonels defeat the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]] 111\u201385 in [[Freedom Hall]]. It was the ABA's first win against the NBA, as the ABA's [[Dallas Chaparrals]] had lost to the NBA's [[Milwaukee Bucks]] 106-103 the night before in the first ever matchup between the two leagues.\n\nOn October 8, 1971, the Colonels hosted the Milwaukee Bucks and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] at Freedom Hall in front of over 18,000 fans. Dan Issel scored 34 points and Artis Gilmore posted 18 points, 16 rebounds and 5 blocked shots. However, Abdul-Jabbar had 30 points, 20 rebounds and 3 blocked shots and the Bucks edged the Colonels, 99\u201393. The very next night the Colonels hosted the New York Knicks in Freedom Hall. The Knicks won, 112\u2013100, before 12,238 fans.\n\nThe Colonels had a terrific regular season. Mullaney coached in the ABA All Star Game, heading up the East team which won 142\u2013115. Dan Issel, Louie Dampier and Artis Gilmore each played in the All Star Game for the East team; Issel was the game's Most Valuable Player. Gilmore ended up as the league's Most Valuable Player at the end of the season and was also the league's Rookie of the Year. Gilmore's impressive statistics included leading the league with 3,666 minutes in play, a field goal percentage of 59.8% and an average of 17.8 rebounds per game. Gilmore and Issel were both on the All-ABA First Team.\n\nKentucky finished the season with the best record ever posted in ABA play,<ref name=encyc240>{{cite book | title = The Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia | publisher = Villard Books | year = 1994 | page = 240 | isbn = 0-679-43293-0}}</ref> with 68 wins and 16 losses, a winning percentage of .810. This secured the Colonels' first ever first-place finish in the Eastern Division. The Colonels' average home attendance was 8,811.\n\nKentucky's remarkable season came to a surprising end when the Colonels lost in the Eastern Division semifinals to the New York Nets, 4 games to 2.\n\n===1972\u20131973===\nPrior to the season the Colonels traded Cincy Powell to the Utah Stars for a draft pick and cash, and bought [[Rick Mount]] from the Indiana Pacers for $250,000. [[Wendell Ladner]] joined the Colonels' roster for the season.\n\nIn preseason play, on September 23, 1972, the Colonels hosted the NBA's [[Atlanta Hawks]] for an exhibition game in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]]. [[Julius Erving]] played for the Hawks, posting 28 points and 18 rebounds in 42 minutes. The Hawks prevailed, 112\u201399. On September 30, 1972 the Colonels traveled to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] for an exhibition game against the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The Colonels won, 120\u2013118. On October 1, 1972 the Milwaukee Bucks returned to Freedom Hall. Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar each scored 20 points as the Bucks beat the Colonels 131\u2013100. On October 6, 1972 the Phoenix Suns played the Colonels at Freedom Hall. The Suns won, 103\u201391. The next night the Colonels lost a close game to the Baltimore Bullets, 95\u201393.\n\nLouie Dampier, Dan Issel and Artis Gilmore returned to the ABA All-Star Game. Gilmore was again First Team All-ABA and posted a 55.9% field goal percentage and averaged 17.6 rebounds per game. Issel led the league in minutes played with 3,531.\n\nThe Colonels finished in second place in the Eastern Division with a record of 56 wins and 28 losses. Their average home attendance was 7,113.\n\nThe Colonels beat the Virginia Squires 4 games to 1 in the Eastern Division Semifinals and beat the [[Carolina Cougars]] 4 games to 3 in the Eastern Division finals. The Colonels then lost a very close ABA Championship Series to the Indiana Pacers, 4 games to 3.\n\n===1973\u20131974===\nPrior to the [[Colonels' 1973\u201374 season]] the Colonels drafted [[M.L. Carr]] and [[Ron Behagen]]; Carr stayed in college and Behagen signed with the NBA's [[Kansas City-Omaha Kings]]. The Colonels also selected [[Ernie DiGregorio]] in a special circumstance draft but he signed with the NBA's [[Buffalo Braves]].\n\nIn July 1973 the franchise was bought by a group headed by [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] and his wife Ellie Brown. Ellie Brown was later named Chairman of the Board of the team; the board itself was made up of ten women. Legendary former University of Kentucky head coach [[Adolph Rupp]] was named as Vice President of the Board. Mike Storen left the team; he later surfaced with the ABA's Memphis franchise. Former head coach Gene Rhodes became general manager of the team.\n\nHead coach Joe Mullaney departed to become head coach of the Utah Stars. Mullaney was succeeded by [[Babe McCarthy]].\n\nIn preseason play against the NBA the Colonels defeated the Houston Rockets 110\u2013102 at Freedom Hall on September 21, 1973 and defeated the Kansas City-Omaha Kings 110-99 the following night.\n\nIn January 1974 the Colonels traded [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1949)|Jim O'Brien]] and a first round draft pick to the [[San Diego Conquistadors]] for [[Red Robbins]] and [[Chuck Williams (basketball)|Chuck Williams]]. That same month Kentucky dealt Rick Mount to the Utah Stars for a draft pick and cash, and then sent Mike Gale and [[Wendell Ladner]] to the New York Nets for former Colonel John Roche.\n\nLouie Dampier, Dan Issel and Artis Gilmore again played in the ABA All-Star Game, and Babe McCarthy coached the East team. Gilmore was again named the game's Most Valuable Player. Gilmore again posted remarkable statistics including 3,502 minutes played (tops in the league) and 18.3 rebounds per game (Gilmore grabbed 40 rebounds in one game against the New York Nets that season). Louie Dampier posted a league high 38.7% percentage in three-point shots. Babe McCarthy and his Colonels predecessor Joe Mullaney were named ABA Co-Coaches of the Year.\n\nThe Colonels posted a regular season record of 53 wins and 31 losses, clinching second place in the Eastern Division. Kentucky's average home attendance for the season was 8,201.\n\nIn the playoffs Kentucky defeated the [[Carolina Cougars]] 4 games to none in the Eastern Division semifinals but then lost the Eastern Division finals to the New York Nets 4 games to none. Despite being named ABA Coach of the Year, Babe McCarthy was fired at the end of the season.\n\n===1974\u20131975===\nThe Colonels took Jim Price, Greg Smith, Rowland Garrett, [[Herm Gilliam]] and Larry Steele in a draft of NBA players, bought [[Ted McClain]] from the Carolina Cougars, signed [[Wil Jones]], and traded a draft pick and cash to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for [[Bird Averitt]]. The Colonels also sent [[Al Eberhard]] to the [[Denver Nuggets]] in exchange for [[Marv Roberts]] and sent Red Robbins to the Virginia Squires for cash. John Roche was sold to the Utah Stars in the midst of the season. Gene Littles was added to the Colonels roster for the season.\n\n[[Hubie Brown]] was named the new head coach of the Colonels.\n\nIn preseason play against the NBA the Colonels lost a game in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] to the Kansas City-Omaha Kings 102\u201391 on September 29, 1974; beat the Washington Bullets 118\u201395 at Freedom Hall on October 1, 1974; lost by one point on the road to the Houston Rockets on October 5, 1974, 96\u201395; beat the [[Detroit Pistons]] 109\u2013100 at Freedom Hall on October 8, 1974 and on October 12, 1974 defeated the Chicago Bulls at Freedom Hall 93\u201375.\n\nLouie Dampier, Dan Issel and Artis Gilmore again played in the ABA All Star Game. Gilmore again was First Team All ABA and led the league with 3,493 minutes played.\n\nThe Colonels claimed first place in the Eastern Division with a record of 58 wins and 26 losses, but tied with the New York Nets for the division crown. The Colonels' average home attendance was 8,727.\n\nThe Colonels began the playoffs with a one-game matchup against the New York Nets to determine who would be first place in the Eastern Division. The Colonels won that game in Louisville 108\u201399. The Colonels then defeated the [[Memphis Sounds]] 4 games to 1 in the Eastern Division semifinals and defeated the [[Spirits of St. Louis]] 4 games to 1 in the Eastern Division finals. The Colonels met their rivals the Indiana Pacers for the ABA Championship and the Colonels prevailed, 4 games to 1, winning their first ABA Championship.\n\nColonels owner John Y. Brown offered $1 million to the NBA Champion Golden State Warriors to play a world title game.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The NBA and Golden State refused.

Brown, Jr. dealt star Dan Issel to the [[Baltimore Claws]] prior to the season for $500,000; the cash was not forthcoming from the struggling Baltimore franchise and Issel ended up with the Denver Nuggets shortly before the Claws were shut down by the league.\n\nGene Rhodes was named vice president of operations and David Vance was named general manager for the team.\n\nIn preseason play the Colonels defeated the Chicago Bulls, 95\u201386, at [[U.S. Bank Arena|Riverfront Coliseum]] in [[Cincinnati]] on October 1, 1975; lost to the New York Knicks in [[Landover, Maryland]] at the [[Capital Centre (Landover, Maryland)|Capital Centre]], 107\u2013102, on October 4, 1975; defeated the Detroit Pistons 114\u2013113 on October 5, 1975 in Cincinnati; defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 96\u201391 in Freedom Hall on October 10, 1975; lost an overtime game to the Detroit Pistons in Detroit on October 12, 1975, 115\u2013107; defeated the Buffalo Braves, 120\u2013116, in Freedom Hall on October 14, 1975; defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] 112\u2013110 in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 17, 1975; and won another ABA vs. NBA exhibition on October 19, 1975 with a 121\u2013111 victory over the Washington Bullets in Lexington, Kentucky. The game against the Bullets was the penultimate ABA vs. NBA contest; two nights later in the final ABA vs. NBA matchup the Utah Stars defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 106\u2013101.\n\nThe prior year, the NBA declined the ABA champion Colonels' challenge against the NBA champion Golden State Warriors for a $1 million payout. However, the two teams met on October 8, 1975, at Freedom Hall. The Colonels won the matchup of the league champions, 93\u201390.\n\nThe Colonels finished the 1975\u201376 preseason with a record of 7\u20132 against NBA teams. The Colonels, like the ABA as a whole, had a winning overall record against the NBA over the course of their existence.\n\nShortly after the regular season began the [[San Diego Sails]] folded and the Colonels picked up [[Caldwell Jones]] from their roster. Kentucky then traded Jones to the Spirits of St. Louis for [[Maurice Lucas]]. The Colonels also traded Marv Roberts to the Virginia Squires during the season in exchange for [[Johnny Neumann]] and [[Jan van Breda Kolff]]. Another move in the middle of the season sent [[Ted McClain]] to the New York Nets in exchange for $150,000. Allen Murphy, Jimmy Dan Connor, [[Johnny Neumann]], Jimmy Baker, Kevin Joyce and [[Jim McDaniels]] joined the Colonels' roster for the 1975\u201376 season.\n\nArtis Gilmore returned to the ABA All-Star Game and once again was named First Team All ABA. Dampier, after eight straight appearances in that game, was not chosen.\n\nThe Colonels finished in fourth place in the Eastern Division with a record of 46\u201338. Their average home attendance was 6,935.\n\nThe Colonels defeated their rivals, the Indiana Pacers, 2 games to 1 in the first round of the playoffs. In the league semifinals, the Colonels and the Denver Nuggets each won three games apiece before Denver claimed Game 7 133\u2013110 at Denver on April 28, 1976. It was the Kentucky Colonels' final game.\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe ABA had entered the 1975\u20131976 preseason with ten teams. After three preseason games, the [[Baltimore Claws]] were shut down by the league due to financial problems and unpaid bills. The [[San Diego Sails]] and the [[Utah Stars]] each folded shortly after the season began, the Sails after 11 games and the Stars after 16. The ABA was reduced to seven teams for the remainder of the season. Shortly after the regular season ended, the Virginia Squires were forced to fold because they could not meet a league-mandated financial assessment. The six remaining ABA teams began negotiations for the eventual [[ABA\u2013NBA merger]]. In the end, the NBA agreed to take in four teams\u2014but the Colonels weren't among them.\n\nOn July 17, 1976 the Kentucky Colonels ceased to exist as John Y. Brown, Jr. agreed to fold the Colonels in exchange for $3 million. Brown used the money to purchase the [[Buffalo Braves]] of the NBA, bringing Colonels head coach [[Joe Mullaney]] and point guard [[Bird Averitt]] with him to Buffalo. The Braves are now known as the [[Los Angeles Clippers]].\n\nThe Colonels players were put into a dispersal draft. The [[Chicago Bulls]] took Artis Gilmore for $1.1 million. The [[Portland Trail Blazers]] took Maurice Lucas for $300,000. The Buffalo Braves took Bird Averitt for $125,000. The Indiana Pacers took Wil Jones for $50,000. The New York Nets took Jan Van Breda Kolff for $60,000. The San Antonio Spurs took Louie Dampier for $20,000.\n\nIn contrast to Brown receiving $3 million in cash for the Colonels, the Spirits of St. Louis' owners received $2.2 million in cash along with a 1/7 share of each of the four remaining teams' television income in perpetuity.

The name is derived from the historic [[Kentucky colonel]]s.  The Colonels won the most games and had the highest winning percentage of any franchise in the league's history, but the team did not join the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] in the 1976 [[ABA\u2013NBA merger]].   The downtown [[Louisville Gardens|Louisville Convention Center]] (now known as The Gardens) was the Colonels' original venue for the first three seasons before moving to [[Freedom Hall]] for the remaining seasons, beginning with the 1970\u201371 schedule.\n\nThe Kentucky Colonels were only one of two ABA teams, along with the [[Indiana Pacers]], to play for the entire duration of the league without relocating, changing its team name, or folding.  The Colonels were also the only major league franchise in Kentucky since the [[Louisville Breckenridges]] left the [[National Football League]] in 1923.\n\n==Overview and background==\nThe [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]-based Colonels started their time in the ABA as a colorful franchise, and not just because of their bright chartreuse green uniforms. Among the things they were known for was their \"[[mascot]]\" Ziggy, a prize-winning [[Brussels Griffon]] dog that was owned by original team owners Joe and Mamie Gregory.\n\nThey were equally famous for publicity stunts, their most famous coming in 1968 when [[Penny Ann Early]], the first licensed female [[horse racing]] [[jockey]], was signed to appear in an ABA game (albeit for a few seconds).\n\nThe early color of their franchise began to wane during the 1970\u201371 season, when they signed another Wildcat star in [[All-America]]n [[Dan Issel]]. They also dropped the chartreuse green uniforms in favor of a blue and white scheme similar to that of the Wildcats. Another abnormality to the Colonels uniform change was that the players' last names on the back had only the first letter capitalized, as opposed to all capital letters, which are almost universally featured on the back of nearly every professional or collegiate basketball uniform which names on the back of jerseys are featured. Issel's signing helped the Colonels become well known as a legitimate basketball team. Despite an average record in the regular season, they made a serious run at the [[1971 ABA Playoffs|1971 ABA championship]]. They fell just short, however, and lost to the [[Utah Stars]] in seven games.\n\nThey proved to be even better in 1971, with the signing of [[Artis Gilmore]]. Gilmore's signing would help make the Colonels a legitimate powerhouse for years to come. The Colonels won 68 games in his rookie campaign under coach [[Joe Mullaney]]; their record turned out to be best in the league's entire history. Yet, in the playoffs, they were upset by the [[New York Nets]] in the first round. Kentucky recovered and made another championship run during the [[1973 ABA Playoffs|1972\u201373 playoffs]], but lost a physical series to the [[Indiana Pacers]] in 7 games, 4 games to 3.\n\nAfter the season, the franchise was nearly moved out-of-state to [[Cincinnati]], but was purchased by [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]], a future Kentucky governor who owned [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] for years. Brown helped increase interest in the team, and looked to improve its on-court performance by hiring popular ABA coach [[Babe McCarthy]]. But after they were swept in the second round of the playoffs by the Nets, Brown gave McCarthy his walking papers.\n\nFor the 1974\u201375 season, Brown hired [[Hubie Brown]] (no relation), a former NBA assistant coach, to give them that championship. Unlike the past year, the Colonels would not be denied. After a torrid finish to the regular season, which saw them win 23 of 26 games, they ripped through the playoffs, and beat their nemesis, the [[Indiana Pacers]], in a dominant 4 games to 1 victory to win the [[1975 ABA Playoffs|1975 ABA championship]]. Gilmore scored 28 points and grabbed an amazing 31 rebounds in the final game. That same season the [[Golden State Warriors]] won the NBA Title. Colonels owner, John Y. Brown, offered the NBA Champs a million dollars to play a one-game world championship. The Warriors and the NBA refused.\n\nThe celebration of the 1975 season ended when John Y. Brown, Jr. dealt Dan Issel to the ABA's new [[Baltimore Claws]] franchise (which folded after a few preseason exhibition games, never taking the floor in the regular season) for financial reasons. They acquired all-star [[Caldwell Jones]] to replace him, but he never gelled with the team. Jones was dealt mid-season for young [[Maurice Lucas]]. Hubie managed to make the team competitive, but they lost in the postseason to the [[Denver Nuggets]] in 7 games.\n[[Image:KentuckyColonelslogo.jpg|left|thumb]]\nKentucky was one of the league's most talented teams, and had one of its best fan bases, but during the ABA's talks of merging with the NBA, the Colonels were not a favorite to change leagues. As a result, John Y. Brown, Jr. was forced to fold the Colonels. Brown would indeed get an NBA franchise: he purchased the [[Buffalo Braves]] in 1976, then traded it for the [[Boston Celtics]] two years later.\n\nColonels players were distributed to other teams in a dispersal draft, with [[Artis Gilmore]] being drafted first by the [[Chicago Bulls]]. Maurice Lucas went on to be an all-star for the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and [[Louie Dampier]], who ended up being the all-time leader in points and assists, ended his career as a sixth man for the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. Coach Hubie Brown went on to coach the [[Atlanta Hawks]] for five seasons after the merger before being fired.\n\nThe Colonels won 448 games in the ABA, more than any other team or franchise. The Colonels' overall regular season record was 448\u2013296; their .602 winning percentage is better than that of any ABA franchise except for the [[Minnesota Muskies]] who only played one season. (If the [[Utah Stars]]' statistics are counted on their own, excluding their seasons as the [[Anaheim Amigos]] and the Los Angeles Stars, that team's winning percentage, .608, is slightly better than the Colonels'.)\n\nThe Colonels' playoff record was 55\u201346 (.545). Only the [[Indiana Pacers]] won more ABA playoff games (69).\n\n==Year-by-year results==\n\n===1967\u20131968===\nOn March 6, 1967, the American Basketball Association awarded the franchise that became the Kentucky Colonels to Don Regan for $30,000. Later that year the franchise was bought by Joseph Gregory, Mamie Gregory and William C. Boone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/TeamMaterial/KentuckyMaterial/ColonelsRosters2.html|title=Remember the ABA: Kentucky Colonels Year-to-Year Rosters|author=|date=|website=www.RememberTheABA.com|access-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJohn Givens was named as the first coach of the Colonels.\n\nThe Colonels draft picks were used on [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|UK]] standout [[Louie Dampier]], who signed with the Colonels; [[Western Kentucky University]] standout [[Clem Haskins]], who signed with the NBA's [[Chicago Bulls]]; [[Bob Verga]], who signed with Dallas, and [[Randy Mahaffey]], who signed with the Colonels. The team also signed [[Darel Carrier]] (WKU) and [[Jim Ligon|Jim \"Goose\" Ligon]] (from [[Kokomo, Indiana]]). The Colonels' 1967\u201368 roster was rounded out with Kendall Rhine ([[Rice University]]), Stew Johnson ([[Murray State University|Murray State]]), Rubin Russell, Bill Bradley (Tennessee Tech), [[Cotton Nash]] (UK), Bobby Rascoe (WKU), Howard Bayne ([[Tennessee Volunteers basketball|Tennessee]]), Orbie Bowling (Tennessee) and Tommy Woods.\n\nThe Colonels played their home games at the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center (Freedom Hall) and at the [[Louisville Gardens|Louisville Convention Center]] (now Louisville Gardens). The team only won 5 of their first 17 games, leading to Givens being fired as coach. He was replaced by [[Gene Rhodes]]. In November, Stew Johnson was traded to the [[New Jersey Americans]] for Jim Caldwell. Darel Carrier, Randy Mahaffey and Louie Dampier played in the ABA All Star game but the team finished with a record of 36 wins and 42 losses, tying New Jersey for fourth place in the Eastern Division. For the season the Colonels averaged 3,225 fans per game.\n\nThe Colonels and Americans scheduled a [[One-game playoff#National Basketball Association|one-game playoff]] game to determine who would get the playoff bid slated for the Eastern Division's fourth place team. The game was scheduled at the [[Long Island Arena]], as New Jersey's [[Teaneck Armory]] was unavailable, but the facility was in such poor condition that the game could not be played, and the Colonels won by forfeit. The Colonels then advanced to the Eastern Division semifinals where they lost to the [[Minnesota Muskies]] 3 games to 2.\n\n===1968\u20131969===\nAmong the Colonels' draft picks was [[University of Louisville]] star [[Wes Unseld]], who opted to take a higher paying deal with the NBA's Baltimore franchise. The Colonels also drafted [[Manny Leaks]] and [[Gene Moore (basketball)|Gene Moore]], who signed with the team. [[Sam Smith (basketball, born 1944)|Sam Smith]] was acquired from Minnesota and then Randy Mahaffey and Manny Leaks were traded to the [[New York Nets]] for [[Oliver Darden]] and [[Andy Anderson (basketball)|Andy Anderson]].\n\nThe Colonels hosted the [[1969 ABA All-Star Game]] in Louisville. Kentucky coach Gene Rhodes was the head coach for the East team, which lost to the West 133\u2013127. Darel Carrier and Louie Dampier repeated as ABA All Stars and were joined by Kentucky's Jim \"Goose\" Ligon.\n\nDuring this season the Colonels fielded the first ever female professional basketball player when jockey [[Penny Ann Early]] joined the team for pregame warmups and appeared briefly during a game.\n\nThe Colonels finished in third place in the Eastern Division with a 42\u201336 record. Their average home attendance was 4,157.\n\nIn the Eastern Division semifinals the Colonels lost a tight series to their rival the [[Indiana Pacers]], 4 games to 3.\n\n===1969\u20131970===\nThe Colonels used their draft picks to select [[Bob Dandridge]], who joined the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] of the NBA and [[Herm Gilliam]], who signed with the NBA's Cincinnati franchise. Bud Olsen, former [[Kentucky Wesleyan College]] star [[George Tinsley]], future Kentucky Wesleyan coach [[Wayne Chapman]] and former University of Kentucky star [[Tommy Kron]] were added to the roster.\n\nIn April 1969 the Colonels were bought by a group of Louisville investors that included [[H. Wendell Cherry]], Bill DeWitt, [[J. David Grissom]], Stuart P. Jay, [[David A. Jones]], [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] and [[Mike Storen]]. Storen had previously been the president and general manager of the Indiana Pacers. The group then hired former University of Kentucky star [[Alex Groza]] as the team's business manager.\n\nDarel Carrier and Louie Dampier again appeared in the ABA All Star Game and were joined by Gene Moore.\n\nThe Colonels finished the season with a record of 45-39 which was good for second place in the Eastern Division.\n\nThe Colonels defeated the [[New York Nets]] 4 games to 3 in the Eastern Division semifinals but lost in the Eastern Division finals to the Indiana Pacers, 4 games to 1.\n\n===1970\u20131971===\n[[File:Dan Issel (3).jpeg|150px|thumb|left|In his rookie season, [[Dan Issel]] led the ABA in scoring with 29.9 points per game, and also averaged 13.2 rebounds per game.]]\nIn July the Colonels traded Jim \"Goose\" Ligon, Gene Moore and Bud Olsen to Dallas for [[Cincy Powell]]. They also signed University of Kentucky star [[Dan Issel]]. Issel was given a 10-year contract worth $1.4 million. The Colonels also traded a draft pick to the New York Nets for [[Walt Simon]]. Mike Pratt joined the Colonels' roster for the season.\n\nThe Colonels began the regular season with a 10\u20135 record, resulting in coach Gene Rhodes being fired. Rhodes was briefly replaced by Alex Groza, who won both games he coached. Groza was quickly replaced as coach by [[Frank Ramsey (basketball)|Frank Ramsey]], the former star for the University of Kentucky and the [[Boston Celtics]].\n\nKentucky's Dan Issel and Cincy Powell played in the ABA All-Star Game. Issel was named Co-Rookie of the Year, along with [[Charlie Scott]] of the [[Virginia Squires]].\n\nThe Colonels finished the regular season with a record of 44-40 and in second place in the Eastern Division. Their average home attendance for the season was 7,375. Beginning with this season the Colonels moved their home games from the Louisville Convention Center (now [[Louisville Gardens]]) to [[Freedom Hall]].\n\nThe Colonels defeated [[The Floridians]] 4 games to 2 in the Eastern Division semifinals and defeated the [[Virginia Squires]] 4 games to 2 in the Eastern Division finals. Facing the [[Utah Stars]] in the ABA championship, the Colonels and Stars each won three games before Utah pulled out Game 7 at home in front of an ABA record crowd. The Colonels finished as the league's runner up.\n\n===1971\u20131972===\nThe Colonels' draft picks included [[Artis Gilmore]], [[John Roche (basketball)|John Roche]] and [[Mike Gale]], who all signed with Kentucky, and [[Fred Brown (basketball)|Fred Brown]] and [[Larry Steele]], who signed with the Seattle SuperSonics and [[Portland Trail Blazers]] of the NBA, respectively. The Colonels then sold Roche to the New York Nets. Gilmore, like Issel, signed a contract for 10 years and $1.5 million. [[Joe Mullaney]] was named coach of the Colonels.\n\nOn September 22, 1971, the Colonels played in the second ever ABA vs. NBA preseason exhibition game.  13,821 fans watched the Colonels defeat the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]] 111\u201385 in [[Freedom Hall]]. It was the ABA's first win against the NBA, as the ABA's [[Dallas Chaparrals]] had lost to the NBA's [[Milwaukee Bucks]] 106-103 the night before in the first ever matchup between the two leagues.\n\nOn October 8, 1971, the Colonels hosted the Milwaukee Bucks and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] at Freedom Hall in front of over 18,000 fans. Dan Issel scored 34 points and Artis Gilmore posted 18 points, 16 rebounds and 5 blocked shots. However, Abdul-Jabbar had 30 points, 20 rebounds and 3 blocked shots and the Bucks edged the Colonels, 99\u201393. The very next night the Colonels hosted the New York Knicks in Freedom Hall. The Knicks won, 112\u2013100, before 12,238 fans.\n\nThe Colonels had a terrific regular season. Mullaney coached in the ABA All Star Game, heading up the East team which won 142\u2013115. Dan Issel, Louie Dampier and Artis Gilmore each played in the All Star Game for the East team; Issel was the game's Most Valuable Player. Gilmore ended up as the league's Most Valuable Player at the end of the season and was also the league's Rookie of the Year. Gilmore's impressive statistics included leading the league with 3,666 minutes in play, a field goal percentage of 59.8% and an average of 17.8 rebounds per game. Gilmore and Issel were both on the All-ABA First Team.\n\nKentucky finished the season with the best record ever posted in ABA play,<ref name=encyc240>{{cite book | title = The Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia | publisher = Villard Books | year = 1994 | page = 240 | isbn = 0-679-43293-0}}</ref> with 68 wins and 16 losses, a winning percentage of .810. This secured the Colonels' first ever first-place finish in the Eastern Division. The Colonels' average home attendance was 8,811.\n\nKentucky's remarkable season came to a surprising end when the Colonels lost in the Eastern Division semifinals to the New York Nets, 4 games to 2.\n\n===1972\u20131973===\nPrior to the season the Colonels traded Cincy Powell to the Utah Stars for a draft pick and cash, and bought [[Rick Mount]] from the Indiana Pacers for $250,000. [[Wendell Ladner]] joined the Colonels' roster for the season.\n\nIn preseason play, on September 23, 1972, the Colonels hosted the NBA's [[Atlanta Hawks]] for an exhibition game in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]]. [[Julius Erving]] played for the Hawks, posting 28 points and 18 rebounds in 42 minutes. The Hawks prevailed, 112\u201399. On September 30, 1972 the Colonels traveled to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] for an exhibition game against the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The Colonels won, 120\u2013118. On October 1, 1972 the Milwaukee Bucks returned to Freedom Hall. Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar each scored 20 points as the Bucks beat the Colonels 131\u2013100. On October 6, 1972 the Phoenix Suns played the Colonels at Freedom Hall. The Suns won, 103\u201391. The next night the Colonels lost a close game to the Baltimore Bullets, 95\u201393.\n\nLouie Dampier, Dan Issel and Artis Gilmore returned to the ABA All-Star Game. Gilmore was again First Team All-ABA and posted a 55.9% field goal percentage and averaged 17.6 rebounds per game. Issel led the league in minutes played with 3,531.\n\nThe Colonels finished in second place in the Eastern Division with a record of 56 wins and 28 losses. Their average home attendance was 7,113.\n\nThe Colonels beat the Virginia Squires 4 games to 1 in the Eastern Division Semifinals and beat the [[Carolina Cougars]] 4 games to 3 in the Eastern Division finals. The Colonels then lost a very close ABA Championship Series to the Indiana Pacers, 4 games to 3.\n\n===1973\u20131974===\nPrior to the [[Colonels' 1973\u201374 season]] the Colonels drafted [[M.L. Carr]] and [[Ron Behagen]]; Carr stayed in college and Behagen signed with the NBA's [[Kansas City-Omaha Kings]]. The Colonels also selected [[Ernie DiGregorio]] in a special circumstance draft but he signed with the NBA's [[Buffalo Braves]].\n\nIn July 1973 the franchise was bought by a group headed by [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] and his wife Ellie Brown. Ellie Brown was later named Chairman of the Board of the team; the board itself was made up of ten women. Legendary former University of Kentucky head coach [[Adolph Rupp]] was named as Vice President of the Board. Mike Storen left the team; he later surfaced with the ABA's Memphis franchise. Former head coach Gene Rhodes became general manager of the team.\n\nHead coach Joe Mullaney departed to become head coach of the Utah Stars. Mullaney was succeeded by [[Babe McCarthy]].\n\nIn preseason play against the NBA the Colonels defeated the Houston Rockets 110\u2013102 at Freedom Hall on September 21, 1973 and defeated the Kansas City-Omaha Kings 110-99 the following night.\n\nIn January 1974 the Colonels traded [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1949)|Jim O'Brien]] and a first round draft pick to the [[San Diego Conquistadors]] for [[Red Robbins]] and [[Chuck Williams (basketball)|Chuck Williams]]. That same month Kentucky dealt Rick Mount to the Utah Stars for a draft pick and cash, and then sent Mike Gale and [[Wendell Ladner]] to the New York Nets for former Colonel John Roche.\n\nLouie Dampier, Dan Issel and Artis Gilmore again played in the ABA All-Star Game, and Babe McCarthy coached the East team. Gilmore was again named the game's Most Valuable Player. Gilmore again posted remarkable statistics including 3,502 minutes played (tops in the league) and 18.3 rebounds per game (Gilmore grabbed 40 rebounds in one game against the New York Nets that season). Louie Dampier posted a league high 38.7% percentage in three-point shots. Babe McCarthy and his Colonels predecessor Joe Mullaney were named ABA Co-Coaches of the Year.\n\nThe Colonels posted a regular season record of 53 wins and 31 losses, clinching second place in the Eastern Division. Kentucky's average home attendance for the season was 8,201.\n\nIn the playoffs Kentucky defeated the [[Carolina Cougars]] 4 games to none in the Eastern Division semifinals but then lost the Eastern Division finals to the New York Nets 4 games to none. Despite being named ABA Coach of the Year, Babe McCarthy was fired at the end of the season.\n\n===1974\u20131975===\nThe Colonels took Jim Price, Greg Smith, Rowland Garrett, [[Herm Gilliam]] and Larry Steele in a draft of NBA players, bought [[Ted McClain]] from the Carolina Cougars, signed [[Wil Jones]], and traded a draft pick and cash to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for [[Bird Averitt]]. The Colonels also sent [[Al Eberhard]] to the [[Denver Nuggets]] in exchange for [[Marv Roberts]] and sent Red Robbins to the Virginia Squires for cash. John Roche was sold to the Utah Stars in the midst of the season. Gene Littles was added to the Colonels roster for the season.\n\n[[Hubie Brown]] was named the new head coach of the Colonels.\n\nIn preseason play against the NBA the Colonels lost a game in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] to the Kansas City-Omaha Kings 102\u201391 on September 29, 1974; beat the Washington Bullets 118\u201395 at Freedom Hall on October 1, 1974; lost by one point on the road to the Houston Rockets on October 5, 1974, 96\u201395; beat the [[Detroit Pistons]] 109\u2013100 at Freedom Hall on October 8, 1974 and on October 12, 1974 defeated the Chicago Bulls at Freedom Hall 93\u201375.\n\nLouie Dampier, Dan Issel and Artis Gilmore again played in the ABA All Star Game. Gilmore again was First Team All ABA and led the league with 3,493 minutes played.\n\nThe Colonels claimed first place in the Eastern Division with a record of 58 wins and 26 losses, but tied with the New York Nets for the division crown. The Colonels' average home attendance was 8,727.\n\nThe Colonels began the playoffs with a one-game matchup against the New York Nets to determine who would be first place in the Eastern Division. The Colonels won that game in Louisville 108\u201399. The Colonels then defeated the [[Memphis Sounds]] 4 games to 1 in the Eastern Division semifinals and defeated the [[Spirits of St. Louis]] 4 games to 1 in the Eastern Division finals. The Colonels met their rivals the Indiana Pacers for the ABA Championship and the Colonels prevailed, 4 games to 1, winning their first ABA Championship.\n\nColonels owner John Y. Brown offered $1 million to the NBA Champion Golden State Warriors to play a world title game.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The NBA and Golden State refused.

The NBA declined. Interest in ABA vs. NBA play extended beyond the two leagues' management. In 1976, [[CBS]] sought to establish a postseason playoff between the ABA and NBA, and to win the rights to broadcast those games.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-QCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=%22american+basketball+association%22&lr=&as_brr=0&as_pt=MAGAZINES|title=CBS's Super Ball|magazine=New York Magazine|date=May 3, 1976|access-date=October 21, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nTo the dismay of Colonels fans and players, owner John Y. Brown, Jr. dealt star Dan Issel to the [[Baltimore Claws]] prior to the season for $500,000; the cash was not forthcoming from the struggling Baltimore franchise and Issel ended up with the Denver Nuggets shortly before the Claws were shut down by the league.\n\nGene Rhodes was named vice president of operations and David Vance was named general manager for the team.\n\nIn preseason play the Colonels defeated the Chicago Bulls, 95\u201386, at [[U.S. Bank Arena|Riverfront Coliseum]] in [[Cincinnati]] on October 1, 1975; lost to the New York Knicks in [[Landover, Maryland]] at the [[Capital Centre (Landover, Maryland)|Capital Centre]], 107\u2013102, on October 4, 1975; defeated the Detroit Pistons 114\u2013113 on October 5, 1975 in Cincinnati; defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 96\u201391 in Freedom Hall on October 10, 1975; lost an overtime game to the Detroit Pistons in Detroit on October 12, 1975, 115\u2013107; defeated the Buffalo Braves, 120\u2013116, in Freedom Hall on October 14, 1975; defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] 112\u2013110 in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 17, 1975; and won another ABA vs. NBA exhibition on October 19, 1975 with a 121\u2013111 victory over the Washington Bullets in Lexington, Kentucky. The game against the Bullets was the penultimate ABA vs. NBA contest; two nights later in the final ABA vs. NBA matchup the Utah Stars defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 106\u2013101.\n\nThe prior year, the NBA declined the ABA champion Colonels' challenge against the NBA champion Golden State Warriors for a $1 million payout. However, the two teams met on October 8, 1975, at Freedom Hall. The Colonels won the matchup of the league champions, 93\u201390.\n\nThe Colonels finished the 1975\u201376 preseason with a record of 7\u20132 against NBA teams. The Colonels, like the ABA as a whole, had a winning overall record against the NBA over the course of their existence.\n\nShortly after the regular season began the [[San Diego Sails]] folded and the Colonels picked up [[Caldwell Jones]] from their roster. Kentucky then traded Jones to the Spirits of St. Louis for [[Maurice Lucas]]. The Colonels also traded Marv Roberts to the Virginia Squires during the season in exchange for [[Johnny Neumann]] and [[Jan van Breda Kolff]]. Another move in the middle of the season sent [[Ted McClain]] to the New York Nets in exchange for $150,000. Allen Murphy, Jimmy Dan Connor, [[Johnny Neumann]], Jimmy Baker, Kevin Joyce and [[Jim McDaniels]] joined the Colonels' roster for the 1975\u201376 season.\n\nArtis Gilmore returned to the ABA All-Star Game and once again was named First Team All ABA. Dampier, after eight straight appearances in that game, was not chosen.\n\nThe Colonels finished in fourth place in the Eastern Division with a record of 46\u201338. Their average home attendance was 6,935.\n\nThe Colonels defeated their rivals, the Indiana Pacers, 2 games to 1 in the first round of the playoffs. In the league semifinals, the Colonels and the Denver Nuggets each won three games apiece before Denver claimed Game 7 133\u2013110 at Denver on April 28, 1976. It was the Kentucky Colonels' final game.\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe ABA had entered the 1975\u20131976 preseason with ten teams. After three preseason games, the [[Baltimore Claws]] were shut down by the league due to financial problems and unpaid bills. The [[San Diego Sails]] and the [[Utah Stars]] each folded shortly after the season began, the Sails after 11 games and the Stars after 16. The ABA was reduced to seven teams for the remainder of the season. Shortly after the regular season ended, the Virginia Squires were forced to fold because they could not meet a league-mandated financial assessment. The six remaining ABA teams began negotiations for the eventual [[ABA\u2013NBA merger]]. In the end, the NBA agreed to take in four teams\u2014but the Colonels weren't among them.\n\nOn July 17, 1976 the Kentucky Colonels ceased to exist as John Y. Brown, Jr. agreed to fold the Colonels in exchange for $3 million. Brown used the money to purchase the [[Buffalo Braves]] of the NBA, bringing Colonels head coach [[Joe Mullaney]] and point guard [[Bird Averitt]] with him to Buffalo. The Braves are now known as the [[Los Angeles Clippers]].\n\nThe Colonels players were put into a dispersal draft. The [[Chicago Bulls]] took Artis Gilmore for $1.1 million. The [[Portland Trail Blazers]] took Maurice Lucas for $300,000. The Buffalo Braves took Bird Averitt for $125,000. The Indiana Pacers took Wil Jones for $50,000. The New York Nets took Jan Van Breda Kolff for $60,000. The San Antonio Spurs took Louie Dampier for $20,000.\n\nIn contrast to Brown receiving $3 million in cash for the Colonels, the Spirits of St. Louis' owners received $2.2 million in cash along with a 1/7 share of each of the four remaining teams' television income in perpetuity. That deal has been estimated to have generated over $250 million in the years since.\n\n==Basketball Hall of Famers==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#0E3386; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Kentucky Colonels Hall of Famers\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#CC3433; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Players\n|-\n!

The name is a combination of the founders' last names, [[Warren Fischer]] and [[Casey Spooner]]. \n\n==Career==\nOriginally a duo formed by classically trained musician Warren Fischer and video-artist and experimental theater performer Casey Spooner for an impromptu rendition of their makeshift track \"Indian Cab Driver\" at the [[Astor Place]] [[Starbucks]], the group grew to over 20 performers, most of whom are dancers and guest vocalists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/181-fischerspooner|title=Fischerspooner - Artist Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \"We started as a performance art piece about entertainment that ultimately became legitimate entertainment,\"<ref name=suicidegirls>{{cite web\n |url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Casey+Spooner%3A+Fischerspooner/\n |title = Casey Spooner: Fischerspooner\n |work = [[SuicideGirls]]\n |date = 27 April 2009\n |accessdate = 27 April 2009\n }}\n</ref> said Casey Spooner, when talking about the group's origins in an April 2009 interview.\n\n===''#1'' (2001)===\nTheir debut album, ''[[1 (Fischerspooner album)|#1]]'', has been released on several record labels, including [[International DJ Gigolo]], [[Ministry of Sound]] and [[Capitol Records]], and includes their hit singles \"Sweetness\", \"[[Emerge (song)|Emerge]]\", and a cover of [[Wire (band)|Wire]]'s \"[[the 15th]]\". In the final months of 2004, Fischerspooner opened up their FS Studios in [[New York City]] to the public for a few hours once a week, allowing people to meet the band and production team, as well as preview new video, music and dance projects that they were working on.\n\n===''Odyssey'' (2005)===\nIn 2005, ''[[Odyssey (Fischerspooner album)|Odyssey]]'', the band's second album, was released. The album featured songs that were more structured and more accurately described as [[electropop]] than [[electroclash]]. \"''Odyssey'' was really about being on [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], which was this icon of classic American music, trying to embrace that clich\u00e9 and find a way to embody it and infiltrate it and take it apart at the same time\",<ref name=suicidegirls /> says Spooner.\n\nThe lead single, \"Just Let Go\", featuring live drums and guitars, possessed a markedly different sound than those heard on their debut album. \"Just Let Go\" was featured on season 2, episode 15 of ''[[Nip/Tuck]]''; \"All We Are\" was also featured on the same TV series, in season 3, episode 1. The second single, \"Never Win\", went on to become the album's biggest hit, and was well received in both clubs and radio. Furthermore, it was also featured in the 2006 [[Happy Madison]] movie ''[[Grandma's Boy (2006 film)|Grandma's Boy]]''. \"A Kick in the Teeth\" was rumored to be the album's third, and possibly final, single but was only pressed on 12\" that included a remix by [[Tiefschwarz]]. This was followed after a duration of silence by a 12\" remix of \"We Need a War\" with a mix by DJ Hell. Other remixes believed to have been done are of \"All We Are\" and \"Get Confused\". \"All We Are\" was featured as the credits track in the first episode of season two of Sweetbitter.\n\nAfter the album's release, Fischerspooner toured a new, more elaborate show in Europe, but the band found themselves without the funds to tour the show fully in North America. \"I was incredibly frustrated because I had worked two years on this huge record and I was only able to perform for three months\",<ref name=suicidegirls /> recalls Spooner, who subsequently retreated to his theatrical roots, joining experimental New York performance ensemble [[The Wooster Group]]. During this period, it was unclear whether the band would record together again; and, in May 2007, the band was released from its [[Capitol Records]] recording contract.\n\n===''Entertainment'' (2009)===\nEarly European gig recordings of \"The Best Revenge\" surfaced on the internet during summer 2007. \"The Best Revenge\" was released on January 14, 2008 with French label [[Kitsune Music]]. The track includes a remix package from the likes of [[Autokratz]], [[Tocadisco]], Alex Gopher, The Passions and Tony Senghore.

The name is a combination of the founders' last names, [[Warren Fischer]] and [[Casey Spooner]]. \n\n==Career==\nOriginally a duo formed by classically trained musician Warren Fischer and video-artist and experimental theater performer Casey Spooner for an impromptu rendition of their makeshift track \"Indian Cab Driver\" at the [[Astor Place]] [[Starbucks]], the group grew to over 20 performers, most of whom are dancers and guest vocalists<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/181-fischerspooner|title=Fischerspooner - Artist Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \"We started as a performance art piece about entertainment that ultimately became legitimate entertainment,\"<ref name=suicidegirls>{{cite web\n |url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Casey+Spooner%3A+Fischerspooner/\n |title = Casey Spooner: Fischerspooner\n |work = [[SuicideGirls]]\n |date = 27 April 2009\n |accessdate = 27 April 2009\n }}\n</ref> said Casey Spooner, when talking about the group's origins in an April 2009 interview.\n\n===''#1'' (2001)===\nTheir debut album, ''[[1 (Fischerspooner album)|#1]]'', has been released on several record labels, including [[International DJ Gigolo]], [[Ministry of Sound]] and [[Capitol Records]], and includes their hit singles \"Sweetness\", \"[[Emerge (song)|Emerge]]\", and a cover of [[Wire (band)|Wire]]'s \"[[the 15th]]\". In the final months of 2004, Fischerspooner opened up their FS Studios in [[New York City]] to the public for a few hours once a week, allowing people to meet the band and production team, as well as preview new video, music and dance projects that they were working on.\n\n===''Odyssey'' (2005)===\nIn 2005, ''[[Odyssey (Fischerspooner album)|Odyssey]]'', the band's second album, was released. The album featured songs that were more structured and more accurately described as [[electropop]] than [[electroclash]]. \"''Odyssey'' was really about being on [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], which was this icon of classic American music, trying to embrace that clich\u00e9 and find a way to embody it and infiltrate it and take it apart at the same time\",<ref name=suicidegirls /> says Spooner.\n\nThe lead single, \"Just Let Go\", featuring live drums and guitars, possessed a markedly different sound than those heard on their debut album. \"Just Let Go\" was featured on season 2, episode 15 of ''[[Nip/Tuck]]''; \"All We Are\" was also featured on the same TV series, in season 3, episode 1. The second single, \"Never Win\", went on to become the album's biggest hit, and was well received in both clubs and radio. Furthermore, it was also featured in the 2006 [[Happy Madison]] movie ''[[Grandma's Boy (2006 film)|Grandma's Boy]]''. \"A Kick in the Teeth\" was rumored to be the album's third, and possibly final, single but was only pressed on 12\" that included a remix by [[Tiefschwarz]]. This was followed after a duration of silence by a 12\" remix of \"We Need a War\" with a mix by DJ Hell. Other remixes believed to have been done are of \"All We Are\" and \"Get Confused\". \"All We Are\" was featured as the credits track in the first episode of season two of Sweetbitter.\n\nAfter the album's release, Fischerspooner toured a new, more elaborate show in Europe, but the band found themselves without the funds to tour the show fully in North America. \"I was incredibly frustrated because I had worked two years on this huge record and I was only able to perform for three months\",<ref name=suicidegirls /> recalls Spooner, who subsequently retreated to his theatrical roots, joining experimental New York performance ensemble [[The Wooster Group]]. During this period, it was unclear whether the band would record together again; and, in May 2007, the band was released from its [[Capitol Records]] recording contract.\n\n===''Entertainment'' (2009)===\nEarly European gig recordings of \"The Best Revenge\" surfaced on the internet during summer 2007. \"The Best Revenge\" was released on January 14, 2008 with French label [[Kitsune Music]]. The track includes a remix package from the likes of [[Autokratz]], [[Tocadisco]], Alex Gopher, The Passions and Tony Senghore. Fischerspooner also released \"Danse en France\" as a single on the Kitsun\u00e9 label.\n\nWarren and Casey subsequently began to work on more material for a new album while Casey was performing the role of Ophelia's brother Laertes in The Wooster Group's production of Hamlet (Fischerspooner also contributed two original songs to the production).\nReleased in North America via the band's own label FS Studios on May 4, 2009, ''[[Entertainment (Fischerspooner album)|Entertainment]]'' is their third full-length album and was produced by Jeff Saltzman (The Killers, The Black Keys, The Sounds).\n\nThe album's cover was listed on Pitchfork's worst album covers of 2009.\n\n===''SIR'' (2018)===\nThe album ''SIR'', executive-produced and co-written by [[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M.]] and [[Boots (musician)|Boots]], was released on February 16, 2018 on Ultra <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.out.com/out-exclusives/2017/9/01/digital-butch-casey-spooners-aggressively-homosexual-pop-music|title=Digital Butch: Casey Spooner's 'Aggressively Homosexual' Pop Music|date=September 1, 2017|website=www.out.com|accessdate=November 22, 2019}}</ref>.

{"title_page": "Metric prefix", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\nA '''metric prefix''' is a [[unit prefix]] that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]] or [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] of the unit. While all metric prefixes in common use today are [[decimal|decadic]], historically there have been a number of [[binary number|binary]] metric prefixes as well.<ref name=\"fr\"/> Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol. The prefix ''[[kilo-]]'', for example, may be added to ''gram'' to indicate ''multiplication'' by one thousand: one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams. The prefix ''[[milli-]]'', likewise, may be added to ''metre'' to indicate ''division'' by one thousand; one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre.\n\nDecimal multiplicative prefixes have been a feature of all forms of the [[metric system]], with six of these dating back to the system's introduction in the 1790s. Metric prefixes have also been used with some non-metric units. The '''SI prefixes''' are metric prefixes that were standardized for use in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) in resolutions dating from 1960 to 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/prefixes.html |title=Four Resolutions |publisher=Bipm.org |access-date=1 March 2012}}</ref> Since 2009, they have formed part of the [[International System of Quantities]]. They are also used in the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]] (UCUM)\n\n==List of SI prefixes==\nThe BIPM specifies twenty prefixes for the International System of Units (SI).\n\n{{SI prefixes (infobox)}}\n\nEach prefix name has a symbol that is used in combination with the symbols for units of measure. For example, the symbol for ''kilo-'' is k, and is used to produce km, kg, and kW, which are the SI symbols for kilometre, kilogram, and kilowatt, respectively. Except for the early prefixes of ''kilo-'', ''hecto-'', and ''deca-'', the symbols for the multiplicative prefixes are uppercase letters, and those for the fractional prefixes are lowercase letters.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/metric-prefixes-and-si-units/all |title=Metric Prefixes and SI Units |website=learn.sparkfun.com |access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> There is a [[Unicode]] symbol for micro ''\u00b5'' for use if the Greek letter ''\u03bc'' is unavailable. When both are unavailable, the visually similar lowercase Latin letter ''u'' is commonly used instead. SI unit symbols are never in italics.\n\nPrefixes corresponding to an integer power of one thousand are generally preferred. Hence 100&nbsp;m is preferred over 1&nbsp;hm (hectometre) or 10&nbsp;dam (decametres). The prefixes ''hecto-'', ''deca-'', ''deci-'', and ''centi-'' are commonly used for everyday purposes, and the centimetre (cm) is especially common. However, some modern building codes require that the millimetre be used in preference to the centimetre, because \"use of centimetres leads to extensive usage of decimal points and confusion\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wbdg.org/ccb/GSAMAN/mdg.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215115519/http://wbdg.org/ccb/GSAMAN/mdg.pdf |archive-date=2011-12-15 |title=METRIC DESIGN GUIDE (PBS-PQ260) |author=Public Buildings Service, U.S. General Services Administration |date=September 1995 |website=National Institute of Building Sciences |accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nPrefixes may not be used in combination. This also applies to [[mass]], for which the [[SI base unit]] (kilogram) already contains a prefix. For example, milligram (mg) is used instead of microkilogram (\u03bckg).\n\nIn the arithmetic of measurements having units, the units are treated as multiplicative factors to values. If they have prefixes, all but one of the prefixes must be expanded to their numeric multiplier, except when combining values with identical units. Hence:\n* {{val|5|u=mV}} \u00d7 {{val|5|u=mA}} = {{val|5|e=-3|u=V}} \u00d7 {{val|5|e=-3|u=A}} = {{val|25|e=-6|u=V\u22c5A}} = {{val|25|u=uW}}.\n* {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|10|u=uV}} = {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|0.01|u=mV}} = {{val|5.01|u=mV}}.\n\nWhen [[Exponentiation|powers]] of units occur, for example, squared or cubed, the multiplicative prefix must be considered part of the unit, and thus included in the exponentiation:\n* 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> means one [[square kilometre]], or the [[area]] of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] of {{val|1000|u=m}} by {{val|1000|u=m}} and not {{val|1000}} [[square metre]]s.\n* 2&nbsp;Mm<sup>3</sup> means two cubic [[megametre]]s, or the [[volume]] of two [[cube]]s of {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} or {{val|2|e=18|u=m3}}, and not {{val|2000000}} [[cubic metre]]s ({{val|2|e=6|u=m3}}).\n\n;Examples\n* {{val|5|u=cm}} =&nbsp;{{val|5|e=-2|u=m}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|5 \u00d7 0.01 m}} =&nbsp;0.05&nbsp;m.\n* {{val|9|u=km2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup> m)<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 m<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{val|9|e=6|u=m2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 {{val|1000000|u=m2}}}} =&nbsp;{{val|9000000|u=m2}}.\n* 3&nbsp;MW =&nbsp;{{val|3|e=6|u=W}} =&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;{{val|1000000|u=W}} = {{val|3000000|u=W}}.\n\n== Application to units of measurement ==\nThe use of prefixes can be traced back to the introduction of the metric system in the 1790s, long before the 1960 introduction of the SI. The prefixes, including those introduced after 1960, are used with any metric unit, whether officially included in the SI or not (e.g., millidynes and milligauss). Metric prefixes may also be used with non-metric units.\n\nThe choice of prefixes with a given unit is usually dictated by convenience of use. Unit prefixes for amounts that are much larger or smaller than those actually encountered are seldom used.\n\n=== Metric units ===\n\n==== Mass ====\nThe units [[kilogram]], [[gram]], [[milligram]], microgram, and smaller are commonly used for measurement of [[mass]]. However, megagram, gigagram, and larger are rarely used; [[tonne]]s (and kilotonnes, megatonnes, etc.) or [[scientific notation]] are used instead. Megagram and teragram are occasionally used to disambiguate the metric tonne from other units with the name \"ton\".{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe kilogram is the only base unit of the [[International System of Units]] that includes a metric prefix.\n\n====Volume====\nThe [[litre]] (equal to a cubic decimetre), millilitre (equal to a cubic centimetre), microlitre, and smaller are common. In Europe, the centilitre is often used for packaged products such as wine and the decilitre is used less frequently.\n\nLarger volumes are usually denoted in kilolitres, megalitres or gigalitres, or else in cubic metres (1 cubic metre = 1 kilolitre) or cubic kilometres (1 cubic kilometre = 1 teralitre). For scientific purposes, the cubic metre is usually used.\n\n====Length====\nThe kilometre, metre, centimetre, millimetre, and smaller are common. (However, the decimetre is rarely used.) The micrometre is often referred to by the non-SI term ''[[Micrometre#SI standardization|micron]]''. In some fields, such as [[chemistry]], the [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]] (equal to 0.1&nbsp;nm) historically competed with the nanometre. The [[femtometre]], used mainly in particle physics, is sometimes called a [[fermi (unit)|fermi]]. For large scales, megametre, gigametre, and larger are rarely used. Instead, non-metric units are used, such as the [[solar radius]], [[astronomical unit]]s, [[light year]]s, and [[parsec]]s; the astronomical unit is mentioned in the SI standards as an accepted non-SI unit.\n\n====Time====\n{{see also|Metric time|Orders of magnitude (time)}}\nPrefixes for the SI standard unit [[second]] are most commonly encountered for quantities less than one second. For larger quantities, the system of [[minute]]s (60 seconds), [[hour]]s (60 minutes) and [[day]]s (24 hours) is [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|accepted for use with the SI]] and more commonly used. When speaking of spans of time, the length of the day is usually standardized to {{val|86,400}} seconds so as not to create issues with the irregular [[leap second]]. \n\nLarger multiples of the second such as kiloseconds and megaseconds are occasionally encountered in scientific contexts, but are seldom used in common parlance. For long-scale scientific work, particularly in [[astronomy]], the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] or ''annum'' is a standardized variant of the [[year]], equal to exactly {{val|31,557,600}} SI seconds (365 days, 6 hours). The unit is so named because it was the average length of a year in the  [[Julian calendar]]. Long time periods are then expressed by using metric prefixes with the annum, such as megaannum or gigaannum.\n\n====Angle====\nThe SI unit of angle is the [[radian]], but degrees, minutes, seconds and more rarely tierces see some scientific use.\n\n====Temperature====\nOfficial policy also varies from common practice for the degree Celsius (\u00b0C). NIST states:<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\"/> \"Prefix symbols may be used with the unit symbol \u00b0C and prefix names may be used with the unit name ''degree Celsius''. For example, 12&nbsp;m\u00b0C (12 millidegrees Celsius) is acceptable.\" In practice, it is more common for prefixes to be used with the [[kelvin]] when it is desirable to denote extremely large or small absolute temperatures or temperature differences. Thus, temperatures of star interiors may be given in units of MK (megakelvins), and molecular cooling may be described in mK (millikelvins).\n\n====Energy====\nIn use the [[joule]] and kilojoule are common, with larger multiples seen in limited contexts. In addition, the [[kilowatt hour]], a composite unit formed from the [[Watt#Kilowatt|kilowatt]] and hour, is often used for electrical energy; other multiples can be formed by modifying the prefix of watt (e.g. terawatt hour).\n\nThere exist a number of definitions for the non-SI unit, the [[calorie]]. There are gram calories and kilogram calories. One kilogram calorie, which equals one thousand gram calories, often appears capitalized and without a prefix (i.e. ''Cal'') when referring to \"[[Calorie|dietary calories]]\" in food.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/remarkablecalorie.html |title=Remarkable Calorie |last=Conn |first=Carole |author2=Len Kravitz |publisher=University of New Mexico |accessdate=22 May 2017}}</ref> It is common to apply metric prefixes to the gram calorie, but not to the kilogram calorie: thus, 1&nbsp;kcal = 1000&nbsp;cal = 1&nbsp;Cal.\n\n===Non-metric units===\nMetric prefixes are widely used outside the system of [[metric system|metric units]]. Common examples include the [[megabyte]] and the [[decibel]]. Metric prefixes rarely appear with [[imperial units|imperial]] or [[United States customary units|US]] units except in some special cases (e.g., microinch, kilofoot, [[kilopound]]). They are also used with other specialized units used in particular fields (e.g., [[megaelectronvolt]], [[gigaparsec]], [[millibarn]]). They are also occasionally used with currency units (e.g., gigadollar), mainly by people who are familiar with the prefixes from scientific usage.{{cn|date=October 2019}} In astronomy, geology, and paleontology, the [[Year#Symbols|year]], with symbol a (from the Latin ''annus''), is commonly used with metric prefixes: [[Kiloannus|ka]], Ma, and Ga.\n\nOfficial policies about the use of SI prefixes with non-SI units vary slightly between the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and the American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST). For instance, the NIST advises that 'to avoid confusion, prefix symbols (and prefix names) are not used with the time-related unit symbols (names) min (minute), h (hour), d (day); nor with the angle-related symbols (names) \u00b0&nbsp;(degree), \u2032&nbsp;(minute), and \u2033&nbsp;(second)',<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\">{{Citation|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec06.html|title=Special Publication 811|edition=2008|last1=Thompson|first1=Ambler|last2=Taylor|first2=Barry N.|date=March 2008|work=NIST|access-date=21 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> whereas the BIPM adds information about the use of prefixes with the symbol ''as'' for arcsecond when they state: 'However astronomers use milliarcsecond, which they denote mas, and microarcsecond, \u03bcas, which they use as units for measuring very small angles.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html |title=SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI) |publisher= International Bureau of Weights and Measures |access-date=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\n\n===Pronunciation===\nWhen a metric prefix is affixed to a root word, the prefix carries the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], while the root drops its stress but retains a full vowel in the syllable that is stressed when the root word stands alone.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} For example, ''[[kilobyte]]'' is {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u1d7b|l|\u0252|b|a\u026a|t}}, with stress on the first syllable. However, units in common use outside the scientific community may be stressed [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncratic_property|idiosyncratically]]. In English-speaking countries, ''kilometre'' is the most conspicuous example. It is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|\u1d7b|\u02c8|l|\u0252|m|\u1d7b|t|\u0259r}}, with [[reduced vowel]]s on both syllables of ''metre''. This stress is not applied to other multiples or sub-multiples of metre, or to other units prefixed with ''kilo-''.\n\nThe prefix ''giga'' is usually pronounced in English as {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0261|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259}}, with hard \u27e8g\u27e9 as in ''get'', but sometimes {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259}}, with soft \u27e8g\u27e9 as in ''gin''.\n\n===Typesetting===\nThe [[LaTeX]] typesetting system features an ''SIunitx'' package in which the units of measurement are spelled out, for example, <code>\\SI{3}{\\tera\\hertz}</code> formats as ''3 THz''.\n\n==Non-standard prefixes==\n[[File:Myriameterstein36R\u00fcdesheimRhein.JPG|thumb|Distance marker on the [[Rhine]]: 36 (XXXVI) myriametres from [[Basel]].

They are also used in the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]] (UCUM)\n\n==List of SI prefixes==\nThe BIPM specifies twenty prefixes for the International System of Units (SI).\n\n{{SI prefixes (infobox)}}\n\nEach prefix name has a symbol that is used in combination with the symbols for units of measure. For example, the symbol for ''kilo-'' is k, and is used to produce km, kg, and kW, which are the SI symbols for kilometre, kilogram, and kilowatt, respectively. Except for the early prefixes of ''kilo-'', ''hecto-'', and ''deca-'', the symbols for the multiplicative prefixes are uppercase letters, and those for the fractional prefixes are lowercase letters.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/metric-prefixes-and-si-units/all |title=Metric Prefixes and SI Units |website=learn.sparkfun.com |access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> There is a [[Unicode]] symbol for micro ''\u00b5'' for use if the Greek letter ''\u03bc'' is unavailable. When both are unavailable, the visually similar lowercase Latin letter ''u'' is commonly used instead. SI unit symbols are never in italics.\n\nPrefixes corresponding to an integer power of one thousand are generally preferred. Hence 100&nbsp;m is preferred over 1&nbsp;hm (hectometre) or 10&nbsp;dam (decametres). The prefixes ''hecto-'', ''deca-'', ''deci-'', and ''centi-'' are commonly used for everyday purposes, and the centimetre (cm) is especially common. However, some modern building codes require that the millimetre be used in preference to the centimetre, because \"use of centimetres leads to extensive usage of decimal points and confusion\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wbdg.org/ccb/GSAMAN/mdg.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215115519/http://wbdg.org/ccb/GSAMAN/mdg.pdf |archive-date=2011-12-15 |title=METRIC DESIGN GUIDE (PBS-PQ260) |author=Public Buildings Service, U.S. General Services Administration |date=September 1995 |website=National Institute of Building Sciences |accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nPrefixes may not be used in combination. This also applies to [[mass]], for which the [[SI base unit]] (kilogram) already contains a prefix. For example, milligram (mg) is used instead of microkilogram (\u03bckg).\n\nIn the arithmetic of measurements having units, the units are treated as multiplicative factors to values. If they have prefixes, all but one of the prefixes must be expanded to their numeric multiplier, except when combining values with identical units. Hence:\n* {{val|5|u=mV}} \u00d7 {{val|5|u=mA}} = {{val|5|e=-3|u=V}} \u00d7 {{val|5|e=-3|u=A}} = {{val|25|e=-6|u=V\u22c5A}} = {{val|25|u=uW}}.\n* {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|10|u=uV}} = {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|0.01|u=mV}} = {{val|5.01|u=mV}}.\n\nWhen [[Exponentiation|powers]] of units occur, for example, squared or cubed, the multiplicative prefix must be considered part of the unit, and thus included in the exponentiation:\n* 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> means one [[square kilometre]], or the [[area]] of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] of {{val|1000|u=m}} by {{val|1000|u=m}} and not {{val|1000}} [[square metre]]s.\n* 2&nbsp;Mm<sup>3</sup> means two cubic [[megametre]]s, or the [[volume]] of two [[cube]]s of {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} or {{val|2|e=18|u=m3}}, and not {{val|2000000}} [[cubic metre]]s ({{val|2|e=6|u=m3}}).\n\n;Examples\n* {{val|5|u=cm}} =&nbsp;{{val|5|e=-2|u=m}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|5 \u00d7 0.01 m}} =&nbsp;0.05&nbsp;m.\n* {{val|9|u=km2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup> m)<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 m<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{val|9|e=6|u=m2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 {{val|1000000|u=m2}}}} =&nbsp;{{val|9000000|u=m2}}.\n* 3&nbsp;MW =&nbsp;{{val|3|e=6|u=W}} =&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;{{val|1000000|u=W}} = {{val|3000000|u=W}}.\n\n== Application to units of measurement ==\nThe use of prefixes can be traced back to the introduction of the metric system in the 1790s, long before the 1960 introduction of the SI. The prefixes, including those introduced after 1960, are used with any metric unit, whether officially included in the SI or not (e.g., millidynes and milligauss). Metric prefixes may also be used with non-metric units.\n\nThe choice of prefixes with a given unit is usually dictated by convenience of use. Unit prefixes for amounts that are much larger or smaller than those actually encountered are seldom used.\n\n=== Metric units ===\n\n==== Mass ====\nThe units [[kilogram]], [[gram]], [[milligram]], microgram, and smaller are commonly used for measurement of [[mass]]. However, megagram, gigagram, and larger are rarely used; [[tonne]]s (and kilotonnes, megatonnes, etc.) or [[scientific notation]] are used instead. Megagram and teragram are occasionally used to disambiguate the metric tonne from other units with the name 'ton'.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe kilogram is the only base unit of the [[International System of Units]] that includes a metric prefix.\n\n====Volume====\nThe [[litre]] (equal to a cubic decimetre), millilitre (equal to a cubic centimetre), microlitre, and smaller are common. In Europe, the centilitre is often used for packaged products such as wine and the decilitre is used less frequently.\n\nLarger volumes are usually denoted in kilolitres, megalitres or gigalitres, or else in cubic metres (1 cubic metre = 1 kilolitre) or cubic kilometres (1 cubic kilometre = 1 teralitre). For scientific purposes, the cubic metre is usually used.\n\n====Length====\nThe kilometre, metre, centimetre, millimetre, and smaller are common. (However, the decimetre is rarely used.) The micrometre is often referred to by the non-SI term ''[[Micrometre#SI standardization|micron]]''. In some fields, such as [[chemistry]], the [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]] (equal to 0.1&nbsp;nm) historically competed with the nanometre. The [[femtometre]], used mainly in particle physics, is sometimes called a [[fermi (unit)|fermi]]. For large scales, megametre, gigametre, and larger are rarely used. Instead, non-metric units are used, such as the [[solar radius]], [[astronomical unit]]s, [[light year]]s, and [[parsec]]s; the astronomical unit is mentioned in the SI standards as an accepted non-SI unit.\n\n====Time====\n{{see also|Metric time|Orders of magnitude (time)}}\nPrefixes for the SI standard unit [[second]] are most commonly encountered for quantities less than one second. For larger quantities, the system of [[minute]]s (60 seconds), [[hour]]s (60 minutes) and [[day]]s (24 hours) is [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|accepted for use with the SI]] and more commonly used. When speaking of spans of time, the length of the day is usually standardized to 86,400 seconds so as not to create issues with the irregular [[leap second]]. \n\nLarger multiples of the second such as kiloseconds and megaseconds are occasionally encountered in scientific contexts, but are seldom used in common parlance. For long-scale scientific work, particularly in [[astronomy]], the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] or ''annum'' is a standardized variant of the [[year]], equal to exactly 31,557,600 SI seconds (365 days, 6 hours). The unit is so named because it was the average length of a year in the  [[Julian calendar]]. Long time periods are then expressed by using metric prefixes with the annum, such as megaannum or gigaannum.\n\n====Angle====\nThe SI unit of angle is the [[radian]], but degrees, minutes, seconds and more rarely tierces see some scientific use.\n\n====Temperature====\nOfficial policy also varies from common practice for the degree Celsius (\u00b0C). NIST states:<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\"/> 'Prefix symbols may be used with the unit symbol \u00b0C and prefix names may be used with the unit name ''degree Celsius''. For example, 12&nbsp;m\u00b0C (12 millidegrees Celsius) is acceptable.' In practice, it is more common for prefixes to be used with the [[kelvin]] when it is desirable to denote extremely large or small absolute temperatures or temperature differences. Thus, temperatures of star interiors may be given in units of MK (megakelvins), and molecular cooling may be described in mK (millikelvins).\n\n====Energy====\nIn use the [[joule]] and kilojoule are common, with larger multiples seen in limited contexts. In addition, the [[kilowatt hour]], a composite unit formed from the [[Watt#Kilowatt|kilowatt]] and hour, is often used for electrical energy; other multiples can be formed by modifying the prefix of watt (e.g. terawatt hour).\n\nThere exist a number of definitions for the non-SI unit, the [[calorie]]. There are gram calories and kilogram calories. One kilogram calorie, which equals one thousand gram calories, often appears capitalized and without a prefix (i.e. ''Cal'') when referring to '[[Calorie|dietary calories]]' in food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/remarkablecalorie.html|title=Remarkable Calorie|last=Conn |first=Carole |author2=Len Kravitz |publisher=University of New Mexico|accessdate=22 May 2017}}</ref> It is common to apply metric prefixes to the gram calorie, but not to the kilogram calorie: thus, 1&nbsp;kcal = 1,000&nbsp;cal = 1&nbsp;Cal.\n\n===Non-metric units===\nMetric prefixes are widely used outside the system of [[metric system|metric units]]. Common examples include the [[megabyte]] and the [[decibel]]. Metric prefixes rarely appear with [[imperial units|imperial]] or [[United States customary units|US]] units except in some special cases (e.g., microinch, kilofoot, [[kilopound]]). They are also used with other specialized units used in particular fields (e.g., [[megaelectronvolt]], [[gigaparsec]], [[millibarn]]). They are also occasionally used with currency units (e.g., gigadollar), mainly by people who are familiar with the prefixes from scientific usage.{{cn|date=October 2019}} In astronomy, geology, and paleontology, the [[Year#Symbols|year]], with symbol a (from the Latin ''annus''), is commonly used with metric prefixes: [[Kiloannus|ka]], Ma, and Ga.\n\nOfficial policies about the use of SI prefixes with non-SI units vary slightly between the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and the American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST). For instance, the NIST advises that 'to avoid confusion, prefix symbols (and prefix names) are not used with the time-related unit symbols (names) min (minute), h (hour), d (day); nor with the angle-related symbols (names) \u00b0&nbsp;(degree), \u2032&nbsp;(minute), and \u2033&nbsp;(second)',<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\">{{Citation|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec06.html|title=Special Publication 811|edition=2008|last1=Thompson|first1=Ambler|last2=Taylor|first2=Barry N.|date=March 2008|work=NIST|access-date=21 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> whereas the BIPM adds information about the use of prefixes with the symbol ''as'' for arcsecond when they state: 'However astronomers use milliarcsecond, which they denote mas, and microarcsecond, \u03bcas, which they use as units for measuring very small angles.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html |title=SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI) |publisher= International Bureau of Weights and Measures |access-date=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\n\n===Pronunciation===\nWhen a metric prefix is affixed to a root word, the prefix carries the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], while the root drops its stress but retains a full vowel in the syllable that is stressed when the root word stands alone.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} For example, ''[[kilobyte]]'' is {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u1d7b|l|\u0252|b|a\u026a|t}}, with stress on the first syllable. However, units in common use outside the scientific community may be stressed [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncratic_property|idiosyncratically]]. In English-speaking countries, ''kilometre'' is the most conspicuous example. It is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|\u1d7b|\u02c8|l|\u0252|m|\u1d7b|t|\u0259r}}, with [[reduced vowel]]s on both syllables of ''metre''. This stress is not applied to other multiples or sub-multiples of metre, or to other units prefixed with ''kilo-''.\n\nThe prefix ''giga'' is usually pronounced in English as {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0261|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259}}, with hard \u27e8g\u27e9 as in ''get'', but sometimes {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259}}, with soft \u27e8g\u27e9 as in ''gin''.\n\n===Typesetting===\nThe [[LaTeX]] typesetting system features an ''SIunitx'' package in which the units of measurement are spelled out, for example, <code>\\SI{3}{\\tera\\hertz}</code> formats as ''3 THz''.\n\n==Non-standard prefixes==\n[[File:Myriameterstein36R\u00fcdesheimRhein.JPG|thumb|Distance marker on the [[Rhine]]: 36 (XXXVI) myriametres from [[Basel]].

Internet service providers can be organized in various forms, such as commercial, [[community-owned]], [[non-profit]], or otherwise [[privately owned]].\n\nInternet services typically provided by ISPs include [[Internet access]], [[Transit (Internet)|Internet transit]], [[domain name]] registration, [[Web hosting service|web hosting]], [[Usenet]] service, and [[colocation centre|colocation]].\n\n[[File:Stealth Fiber Crew installing fiber cable underneath the streets of Manhattan.jpg|thumb|[[Stealth Communications|Local ISP]] in Manhattan installing fiber for provisioning Internet access]]\n\n==History==\nThe Internet (originally [[ARPAnet]]) was developed as a network between government research laboratories and participating departments of universities. Other companies and organizations joined by direct connection to the backbone, or by arrangements through other connected companies, sometimes using dialup tools such as [[UUCP]]. By the late 1980s, a process was set in place towards public, commercial use of the Internet. Some restrictions were removed by 1991,<ref>[https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/nsfoutreach/htm/n50_z2/pages_z3/28_pg.htm Outreach: The Internet], U.S. National Science Foundation, \"In March 1991, the NSFNET acceptable use policy was altered to allow commercial traffic.\"</ref> shortly after the introduction of the [[World Wide Web]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Web history timeline |url= http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/03/11/world-wide-web-timeline/ |accessdate=21 September 2015|date= 2014-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[online service providers]] such as [[CompuServe]] and [[America On Line]] (AOL) began to offer limited capabilities to access the Internet, such as e-mail interchange, but full access to the Internet was not readily available to the general public.\n\nIn 1989, the first Internet service providers, companies offering the public direct access to the Internet for a monthly fee, were established in Australia<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Roger|title=Origins and Nature of the Internet in Australia|url=http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/OzI04.html#CIAP|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref> and the United States. In Brookline, Massachusetts, [[The World (Internet service provider)|The World]] became the first commercial ISP in the US.

Zakon</ref> These companies generally offered [[dial-up]] connections, using the public telephone network to provide last-mile connections to their customers. The [[barriers to entry]] for dial-up ISPs were low and many providers emerged.\n\nHowever, cable television companies and the telephone carriers already had wired connections to their customers and could offer Internet connections at much higher speeds than dial-up using [[broadband]] technology such as [[cable modem]]s and [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL). As a result, these companies often became the dominant ISPs in their service areas, and what was once a highly competitive ISP market became effectively a monopoly or [[duopoly]] in countries with a commercial telecommunications market, such as the United States.\n\nIn 1995, [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET]] was decommissioned removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic and [[Network access point|network access points]] were created to allow peering arrangements between commercial ISPs.\n\n===Net neutrality===\n{{Main|Net neutrality in the United States}}\nOn 23 April 2014, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) was reported to be considering a new rule permitting ISPs to offer content providers a faster track to send content, thus reversing their earlier [[net neutrality]] position.<ref name=\"NYT-20140423\">{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Edward |title=F.C.C., in \u2018Net Neutrality\u2019 Turnaround, Plans to Allow Fast Lane |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/technology/fcc-new-net-neutrality-rules.html |date=23 April 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=23 April 2014  }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20140424a\">{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Creating a Two-Speed Internet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/opinion/creating-a-two-speed-internet.html |date=24 April 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=25 April 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20140511\">{{cite news |last=Carr |first=David |title=Warnings Along F.C.C.\u2019s Fast Lane |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/business/media/warnings-along-fccs-fast-lane.html |date=11 May 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=11 May 2014 }}</ref> A possible solution to net neutrality concerns may be [[municipal broadband]], according to [[Susan P.

An upstream ISP usually has a larger network than the contracting ISP or is able to provide the contracting ISP with access to parts of the Internet the contracting ISP by itself has no access to.<ref name=\"ssrn\">[http://ssrn.com/abstract=2128103 Gerson & Ryan A Primer on Internet Exchange Points for Policymakers and Non-Engineers] Working Paper, August 11, 2012</ref>\n\nIn the simplest case, a single connection is established to an upstream ISP and is used to transmit data to or from areas of the Internet beyond the home network; this mode of interconnection is often cascaded multiple times until reaching a [[tier 1 carrier]]. In reality, the situation is often more complex. ISPs with more than one [[point of presence]] (PoP) may have separate connections to an upstream ISP at multiple PoPs, or they may be customers of multiple upstream ISPs and may have connections to each one of them at one or more point of presence.<ref name=\"ssrn\" /> Transit ISPs provide large amounts of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] for connecting hosting ISPs and access ISPs.<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_configuration_example09186a008009456d.shtml#intro cisco.com Sample Configuration for BGP with Two Different Service Providers (Multihoming)] BGP article</ref>\n\n===Virtual ISPs===\nA [[virtual ISP]] (VISP) is an operation that purchases services from another ISP, sometimes called a ''wholesale ISP'' in this context,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cgi.amazing.com/isp/hooking-up.html |website=Amazing.com |title=Hooking up to the Internet |access-date=2008-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219110040/http://cgi.amazing.com/isp/hooking-up.html |archive-date=2008-12-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which allow the VISP's customers to access the Internet using services and infrastructure owned and operated by the wholesale ISP. VISPs resemble [[mobile virtual network operator]]s and [[competitive local exchange carrier]]s for voice communications.\n\n===Free ISPs ===\nFree ISPs are Internet service providers that provide service free of charge. Many free ISPs display advertisements while the user is connected; like commercial [[television]], in a sense they are selling the user's attention to the advertiser. Other free ISPs, sometimes called [[Wireless community network|freenets]], are run on a nonprofit basis, usually with volunteer staff.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Wireless ISP===\nA [[wireless Internet service provider]] (WISP) is an Internet service provider with a network based on wireless networking. Technology may include commonplace Wi-Fi wireless mesh networking, or proprietary equipment designed to operate over open 900&nbsp;MHz, 2.4&nbsp;GHz, 4.9, 5.2, 5.4, 5.7, and 5.8&nbsp;GHz bands or licensed frequencies such as 2.5&nbsp;GHz (EBS/BRS), 3.65&nbsp;GHz (NN) and in the UHF band (including the MMDS frequency band) and LMDS.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Peering==\nISPs may engage in [[peering]], where multiple ISPs interconnect at [[peering point]]s or [[Internet exchange point]]s (IXPs), allowing routing of data between each network, without charging one another for the data transmitted\u2014data that would otherwise have passed through a third upstream ISP, incurring charges from the upstream ISP.<ref name=\"ssrn\"/>\n\nISPs requiring no upstream and having only customers (end customers or peer ISPs) are called [[Tier 1 carrier|Tier 1 ISPs]].\n\nNetwork hardware, software and specifications, as well as the expertise of network management personnel are important in ensuring that data follows the most efficient route, and upstream connections work reliably. A tradeoff between cost and efficiency is possible.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Law enforcement and intelligence assistance==\nInternet service providers in many countries are legally required (e.g., via [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA) in the U.S.) to allow [[law enforcement]] agencies to monitor some or all of the information transmitted by the ISP, or even store the browsing history of users to allow government access if needed (e.g. via the [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016]] in the [[United Kingdom]]). Furthermore, in some countries ISPs are subject to monitoring by intelligence agencies. In the U.S., a controversial [[National Security Agency]] program known as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] provides for broad monitoring of Internet users traffic and has raised concerns about potential violation of the privacy protections in the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref>[http://www.informationweek.com/security/risk-management/nsa-prism-creates-stir-but-appears-legal/d/d-id/1110275 NSA PRISM Creates Stir, But Appears Legal].

Other companies and organizations joined by direct connection to the backbone, or by arrangements through other connected companies, sometimes using dialup tools such as [[UUCP]]. By the late 1980s, a process was set in place towards public, commercial use of the Internet. Some restrictions were removed by 1991,<ref>[https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/nsfoutreach/htm/n50_z2/pages_z3/28_pg.htm Outreach: The Internet], U.S. National Science Foundation, \"In March 1991, the NSFNET acceptable use policy was altered to allow commercial traffic.\"</ref> shortly after the introduction of the [[World Wide Web]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Web history timeline |url= http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/03/11/world-wide-web-timeline/ |accessdate=21 September 2015|date= 2014-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[online service providers]] such as [[CompuServe]] and [[America On Line]] (AOL) began to offer limited capabilities to access the Internet, such as e-mail interchange, but full access to the Internet was not readily available to the general public.\n\nIn 1989, the first Internet service providers, companies offering the public direct access to the Internet for a monthly fee, were established in Australia<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Roger|title=Origins and Nature of the Internet in Australia|url=http://www.rogerclarke.com/II/OzI04.html#CIAP|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref> and the United States. In Brookline, Massachusetts, [[The World (Internet service provider)|The World]] became the first commercial ISP in the US. Its first customer was served in November 1989.<ref>{{cite web | title=Hobbes' Internet Timeline v10.1 | author=Robert H'obbes' Zakon |url= http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/ |accessdate= 14 November 2011 }} Also published as Robert H. Zakon</ref> These companies generally offered [[dial-up]] connections, using the public telephone network to provide last-mile connections to their customers. The [[barriers to entry]] for dial-up ISPs were low and many providers emerged.\n\nHowever, cable television companies and the telephone carriers already had wired connections to their customers and could offer Internet connections at much higher speeds than dial-up using [[broadband]] technology such as [[cable modem]]s and [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL). As a result, these companies often became the dominant ISPs in their service areas, and what was once a highly competitive ISP market became effectively a monopoly or [[duopoly]] in countries with a commercial telecommunications market, such as the United States.\n\nIn 1995, [[National Science Foundation Network|NSFNET]] was decommissioned removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic and [[Network access point|network access points]] were created to allow peering arrangements between commercial ISPs.\n\n===Net neutrality===\n{{Main|Net neutrality in the United States}}\nOn 23 April 2014, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) was reported to be considering a new rule permitting ISPs to offer content providers a faster track to send content, thus reversing their earlier [[net neutrality]] position.<ref name=\"NYT-20140423\">{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Edward |title=F.C.C., in \u2018Net Neutrality\u2019 Turnaround, Plans to Allow Fast Lane |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/technology/fcc-new-net-neutrality-rules.html |date=23 April 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=23 April 2014  }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20140424a\">{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Creating a Two-Speed Internet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/opinion/creating-a-two-speed-internet.html |date=24 April 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=25 April 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20140511\">{{cite news |last=Carr |first=David |title=Warnings Along F.C.C.\u2019s Fast Lane |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/business/media/warnings-along-fccs-fast-lane.html |date=11 May 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=11 May 2014 }}</ref> A possible solution to net neutrality concerns may be [[municipal broadband]], according to [[Susan P.

Using [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic]]s to end users is called [[Fiber to the x|Fiber To The Home]] or similar names.<ref>{{cite web|title=FTTx: Fiber To The Home/Premises/Curb |url=http://www.thefoa.org/FTTX/ |publisher=[[The Fiber Optic Association (FOA)|The Fiber Optic Association]] |accessdate=June 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFor customers with more demanding requirements (such as medium-to-large businesses, or other ISPs) can use higher-speed DSL (such as [[single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line]]), [[Ethernet]], [[Metro Ethernet|metropolitan Ethernet]], [[gigabit Ethernet]], [[Frame Relay]], ISDN [[Primary Rate Interface]], [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)]] and [[synchronous optical networking]] (SONET).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://ciscoccna24.blogspot.com/2010/10/tdm-examples-isdn-and-sonet.html|title= CCNA|work= ciscoccna24.blogspot.com|accessdate= 2 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Wireless broadband|Wireless access]] is another option, including [[cellular network|cellular]] and [[satellite Internet access]].\n\n===Mailbox providers===\nA [[mailbox provider]] is an organization that provides services for hosting electronic mail domains with access to storage for mail boxes. It provides [[Message transfer agent|email servers]] to send, receive, accept, and store email for [[End-user (computer science)#End user|end users]] or other organizations.\n\nMany mailbox providers are also access providers,<ref>{{cite IETF |title=Complaint Feedback Loop Operational Recommendations |rfc=6449 |editor= J.D. Falk |date=November 2011 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate= 28 June 2012}}</ref> while others are not (e.g., [[Gmail]], [[Yahoo! Mail]], [[Outlook.com]], [[AOL Mail]], [[Po box]]). The definition given in RFC 6650 covers [[email hosting service]]s, as well as the relevant department of companies, universities, organizations, groups, and individuals that manage their mail servers themselves. The task is typically accomplished by implementing [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) and possibly providing access to messages through [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP), the [[Post Office Protocol]], [[Webmail]], or a proprietary protocol.<ref>{{cite IETF |title= Creation and Use of Email Feedback Reports: An Applicability Statement for the Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) |rfc= 6650 |editor= Murray Kucherawy |date=June 2012 |publisher= [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate= 28 June 2012 |quote= \"Mailbox Provider\" refers to an organization that accepts, stores, and offers access to RFC 5322 messages (\"email messages\") for end users.

Other services include [[Virtual private server|virtual server]], cloud services, or physical server operation.\n\n===Transit ISPs===\n[[File:Internet Connectivity Distribution & Core.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Tiers 1 and 2 ISP interconnections]]\nJust as their customers pay them for Internet access, ISPs themselves pay upstream ISPs for Internet access. An upstream ISP usually has a larger network than the contracting ISP or is able to provide the contracting ISP with access to parts of the Internet the contracting ISP by itself has no access to.<ref name=\"ssrn\">[http://ssrn.com/abstract=2128103 Gerson & Ryan A Primer on Internet Exchange Points for Policymakers and Non-Engineers] Working Paper, August 11, 2012</ref>\n\nIn the simplest case, a single connection is established to an upstream ISP and is used to transmit data to or from areas of the Internet beyond the home network; this mode of interconnection is often cascaded multiple times until reaching a [[tier 1 carrier]]. In reality, the situation is often more complex. ISPs with more than one [[point of presence]] (PoP) may have separate connections to an upstream ISP at multiple PoPs, or they may be customers of multiple upstream ISPs and may have connections to each one of them at one or more point of presence.<ref name=\"ssrn\" /> Transit ISPs provide large amounts of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] for connecting hosting ISPs and access ISPs.<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_configuration_example09186a008009456d.shtml#intro cisco.com Sample Configuration for BGP with Two Different Service Providers (Multihoming)] BGP article</ref>\n\n===Virtual ISPs===\nA [[virtual ISP]] (VISP) is an operation that purchases services from another ISP, sometimes called a ''wholesale ISP'' in this context,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cgi.amazing.com/isp/hooking-up.html |website=Amazing.com |title=Hooking up to the Internet |access-date=2008-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219110040/http://cgi.amazing.com/isp/hooking-up.html |archive-date=2008-12-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which allow the VISP's customers to access the Internet using services and infrastructure owned and operated by the wholesale ISP. VISPs resemble [[mobile virtual network operator]]s and [[competitive local exchange carrier]]s for voice communications.\n\n===Free ISPs ===\nFree ISPs are Internet service providers that provide service free of charge. Many free ISPs display advertisements while the user is connected; like commercial [[television]], in a sense they are selling the user's attention to the advertiser. Other free ISPs, sometimes called [[Wireless community network|freenets]], are run on a nonprofit basis, usually with volunteer staff.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Wireless ISP===\nA [[wireless Internet service provider]] (WISP) is an Internet service provider with a network based on wireless networking. Technology may include commonplace Wi-Fi wireless mesh networking, or proprietary equipment designed to operate over open 900&nbsp;MHz, 2.4&nbsp;GHz, 4.9, 5.2, 5.4, 5.7, and 5.8&nbsp;GHz bands or licensed frequencies such as 2.5&nbsp;GHz (EBS/BRS), 3.65&nbsp;GHz (NN) and in the UHF band (including the MMDS frequency band) and LMDS.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Peering==\nISPs may engage in [[peering]], where multiple ISPs interconnect at [[peering point]]s or [[Internet exchange point]]s (IXPs), allowing routing of data between each network, without charging one another for the data transmitted\u2014data that would otherwise have passed through a third upstream ISP, incurring charges from the upstream ISP.<ref name=\"ssrn\"/>\n\nISPs requiring no upstream and having only customers (end customers or peer ISPs) are called [[Tier 1 carrier|Tier 1 ISPs]].\n\nNetwork hardware, software and specifications, as well as the expertise of network management personnel are important in ensuring that data follows the most efficient route, and upstream connections work reliably. A tradeoff between cost and efficiency is possible.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Law enforcement and intelligence assistance==\nInternet service providers in many countries are legally required (e.g., via [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA) in the U.S.) to allow [[law enforcement]] agencies to monitor some or all of the information transmitted by the ISP, or even store the browsing history of users to allow government access if needed (e.g. via the [[Investigatory Powers Act 2016]] in the [[United Kingdom]]). Furthermore, in some countries ISPs are subject to monitoring by intelligence agencies. In the U.S., a controversial [[National Security Agency]] program known as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] provides for broad monitoring of Internet users traffic and has raised concerns about potential violation of the privacy protections in the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref>[http://www.informationweek.com/security/risk-management/nsa-prism-creates-stir-but-appears-legal/d/d-id/1110275 NSA PRISM Creates Stir, But Appears Legal].

Her mother tells her a tale of a person who wanted to see the ocean, but Radha says that she does not understand the moral of the story.\n\nThe film flashes forward to Sita, a newly married woman on honeymoon with her husband Jatin, who is distant and shows little interest in Sita. Jatin is in a typical joint-family arrangement - he lives with his older brother Ashok, his sister-in-law Radha, his paralysed mother Biji and the family servant Mundu. Ashok and Jatin run a small store that sells food and rents videotapes.\n\nJatin shows no care for Sita, and she learns that he only agreed to the arranged marriage in order to put an end to Ashok's nagging. Jatin continues to date his modern Chinese girlfriend, and Sita does not rebuke him. The rest of Jatin's home is not rosy either. Biji is immobile and speechless after a stroke, and Sita and Radha must constantly attend to her. Sita spends her days slaving in the hot kitchen, and finds herself lonely and frustrated at night because Jatin is out with his girlfriend. She yearns to break out of this stifling situation.\n\nIt is revealed that Radha faces a similar problem. Many years ago, Ashok had come under the influence of Swamiji, a local religious preacher, who teaches that desires are the cause of suffering and must be suppressed. Ashok is completely taken by these monastic teachings and suppresses all his desires. He also donates large sums from the meager store income to treat the Swamiji's [[hydrocele]] condition. The Swamiji teaches that sexual contact is permitted only as a means for procreation, and Radha is infertile. Accordingly, Ashok aims to stamp out all his desires and has not slept with Radha for the past thirteen years. He puts Radha through an excruciating ritual in which they lie motionless next to each other whenever he wants to test his resolve. Radha is racked with guilt over her inability to have children and driven to frustration by the ritual.\n\nWhile the older Radha remains bound by tradition and subdued into silence, the younger Sita refuses to accept her fate. Sita's attitude slowly spills over onto Radha, who becomes slightly more assertive. One evening, shunned by their husbands and driven to desperation by their unfulfilled longings, Radha and Sita seek solace in each other and become lovers. Overjoyed at finding satisfaction in this manner, they continue it in secret. They eventually realise their love for each other and start looking for ways to move out. The pair's daily antics and adventures are witnessed by Biji, who disapproves, but is unable to stop them. After some time, Mundu becomes aware of their relationship, and he causes Ashok to walk in on Radha and Sita.\n\nAshok is horrified. He is also shattered when he finds this incident has stoked his own long-dormant desire. Sita decides to pack her belongings and leave the house immediately, while Radha stays behind in order to talk to her husband. The women promise to meet each other later that night. Ashok confronts Radha, who overcomes her subservience and pours out her emotions. Amid this argument, Radha's sari catches fire, and Ashok angrily watches her burn without helping. Radha puts out the flames and recalls her mother's advice from when she was young - she can finally see her ocean.\n\nAn injured Radha leaves Ashok, moving out in order to join Sita.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Nandita Das]] as Sita\n* [[Shabana Azmi]] as Radha\n** Karishma Jhalani as young Radha\n* Ramanjit Kaur as Young Radha's mother\n* [[Dilip Mehta]] as Young Radha's father\n* [[Javed Jaffrey]] as Jatin\n* [[Vinay Pathak]] as Guide at Taj Mahal\n* Kushal Rekhi as Biji\n* [[Ranjit Chowdhry]] as Mundu\n* [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]] as Ashok\n* Alice Poon as Julie\n* [[Ram Gopal Bajaj]] as Swamiji\n* Ravinder Happy as Oily man in video shop\n* [[Devyani Saltzman]] as Girl in video shop\n* Sunil Chabra as Milkman on bicycle\n* [[Avijit Dutt]] as Julie's father\n* Shasea Bahadur as Julie's brother\n* Meher Chand as Goddess Sita\n* Bahadur Chand as God Ram\n* Puran, Sohan Lal, [[Sadhu Meher|Meher]], Amarjit Chand, and Karahm Chand as 'Ramayan' theatrical troupe members\n* [[Kabir Chowdhury]] as Boy in video shop\n* Laurence C\u00f4te as French tourist at the Taj Mahal\n{{colend}}\n\n==Controversies and reaction==\n''Fire'' was passed uncut by India's censor board (the [[Central Board of Film Certification]]) in May 1998 with a rating of ''Adult'', the only condition being that the character Sita's name be changed to Nita.<ref name=\"IndiaToday\" /> The board made their decision based on what it called the importance of the story for Indian women.<ref name=Ross>{{Cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Oliver|title=Same-Sex Desire in Indian Culture: Representations in Literature and Film, 1970-2015|year=2016|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=New York|page=44|isbn=978-1137570758}}</ref> The film was first screened on 13 November 1998 and ran to full houses in 42 theaters<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Dousing the Fire of Free Expression|last=Dhavan|first=Rajeev|date=December 9, 1998|work=The Times of India|access-date=}}</ref> in most metropolitan cities throughout India for almost three weeks.\n\nOn 2 December, more than 200 [[Shiv Sena|Shiv Sanaiks]] stormed a Cinemax theatre in suburban [[Goregaon]] in [[Mumbai]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=City Theatre Puts Lid on 'Fire' again|last=|first=|date=December 19, 1998|work=The Times of India|access-date=}}</ref> smashing glass panes, burning posters and shouting slogans.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bearak|first=Barry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/24/world/new-delhi-journal-a-lesbian-idyll-and-the-movie-theaters-surrender.html|title=New Delhi Journal; A Lesbian Idyll, and the Movie Theaters Surrender|date=1998-12-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Radical Hindu women attack film on lesbian in Bombay|last=|first=|date=December 2, 1998|work=Agence France Presse|access-date=}}</ref> They compelled managers to refund tickets to moviegoers.

John]] and [[Tejaswini Niranjana]] wrote in 1999 that ''Fire'' reduces [[patriarchy]] to the denial and control of female sexuality. The authors make the point that the film traps itself in its own rendering of patriarchy: \n<blockquote>\nControl of female sexuality is surely one of the ''ideological'' planks on which patriarchy rests. But by taking this idea literally, the film imprisons itself in the very ideology it seeks to fight, its own version of authentic reality being nothing but a mirror image of patriarchal discourse. 'Fire' ends up arguing that the successful assertion of sexual choice is not only a necessary but also a sufficient condition\u2014indeed, the sole criterion\u2014for the emancipation of women. Thus the patriarchal ideology of 'control' is first reduced to pure denial \u2013 as though such control did not also involve the production and amplification of sexuality \u2013 and is later simply inverted to produce the film's own vision of women's liberation as free sexual 'choice.' (1999:582)\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nWhatever subversive potential 'Fire' might have had (as a film that makes visible the 'naturalised' hegemony of [[heterosexuality]] in contemporary culture, for example) is nullified by its largely [[masculinist]] assumption that men should not neglect the sexual needs of their wives, lest they turn lesbian (1999:583).\n</blockquote>\nThe authors additionally argue that viewers must ask tough questions from films such as ''Fire'' that place themselves in the realm of \"alternative\" cinema and aim to occupy not only aesthetic, but also political space (Economic and Political Weekly, 6\u201313 March 1999).\n\n[[Madhu Kishwar]], then-editor of ''[[Manushi]]'', wrote a highly critical review of ''Fire'', finding fault with the depiction of the characters in the film as a \"mean spirited caricature of middle class family life among urban Indians\". She claimed that homosexuality was socially accepted in India as long as it remained a private affair, adding that [[Deepa Mehta|Mehta]] \"did a disservice to the cause of women... by crudely pushing the Radha-Sita relationship into the lesbian mould,\" as women would now be unable to form intimate relationships with other women without being branded as lesbians.<ref>Kishwar, Madhu.

Her mother tells her a tale of a person who wanted to see the ocean, but Radha says that she does not understand the moral of the story.\n\nThe film flashes forward to Sita, a newly married woman on honeymoon with her husband Jatin, who is distant and shows little interest in Sita. Jatin is in a typical joint-family arrangement - he lives with his older brother Ashok, his sister-in-law Radha, his paralysed mother Biji and the family servant Mundu. Ashok and Jatin run a small store that sells food and rents videotapes.\n\nJatin shows no care for Sita, and she learns that he only agreed to the arranged marriage in order to put an end to Ashok's nagging. Jatin continues to date his modern Chinese girlfriend, and Sita does not rebuke him. The rest of Jatin's home is not rosy either. Biji is immobile and speechless after a stroke, and Sita and Radha must constantly attend to her. Sita spends her days slaving in the hot kitchen, and finds herself lonely and frustrated at night because Jatin is out with his girlfriend. She yearns to break out of this stifling situation.\n\nIt is revealed that Radha faces a similar problem. Many years ago, Ashok had come under the influence of Swamiji, a local religious preacher, who teaches that desires are the cause of suffering and must be suppressed. Ashok is completely taken by these monastic teachings and suppresses all his desires. He also donates large sums from the meager store income to treat the Swamiji's [[hydrocele]] condition. The Swamiji teaches that sexual contact is permitted only as a means for procreation, and Radha is infertile. Accordingly, Ashok aims to stamp out all his desires and has not slept with Radha for the past thirteen years. He puts Radha through an excruciating ritual in which they lie motionless next to each other whenever he wants to test his resolve. Radha is racked with guilt over her inability to have children and driven to frustration by the ritual.\n\nWhile the older Radha remains bound by tradition and subdued into silence, the younger Sita refuses to accept her fate. Sita's attitude slowly spills over onto Radha, who becomes slightly more assertive. One evening, shunned by their husbands and driven to desperation by their unfulfilled longings, Radha and Sita seek solace in each other and become lovers. Overjoyed at finding satisfaction in this manner, they continue it in secret. They eventually realise their love for each other and start looking for ways to move out. The pair's daily antics and adventures are witnessed by Biji, who disapproves, but is unable to stop them. After some time, Mundu becomes aware of their relationship, and he causes Ashok to walk in on Radha and Sita.\n\nAshok is horrified. He is also shattered when he finds this incident has stoked his own long-dormant desire. Sita decides to pack her belongings and leave the house immediately, while Radha stays behind in order to talk to her husband. The women promise to meet each other later that night. Ashok confronts Radha, who overcomes her subservience and pours out her emotions. Amid this argument, Radha's sari catches fire, and Ashok angrily watches her burn without helping. Radha puts out the flames and recalls her mother's advice from when she was young - she can finally see her ocean.\n\nAn injured Radha leaves Ashok, moving out in order to join Sita.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Nandita Das]] as Sita\n* [[Shabana Azmi]] as Radha\n** Karishma Jhalani as young Radha\n* Ramanjit Kaur as Young Radha's mother\n* [[Dilip Mehta]] as Young Radha's father\n* [[Javed Jaffrey]] as Jatin\n* [[Vinay Pathak]] as Guide at Taj Mahal\n* Kushal Rekhi as Biji\n* [[Ranjit Chowdhry]] as Mundu\n* [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]] as Ashok\n* Alice Poon as Julie\n* [[Ram Gopal Bajaj]] as Swamiji\n* Ravinder Happy as Oily man in video shop\n* [[Devyani Saltzman]] as Girl in video shop\n* Sunil Chabra as Milkman on bicycle\n* [[Avijit Dutt]] as Julie's father\n* Shasea Bahadur as Julie's brother\n* Meher Chand as Goddess Sita\n* Bahadur Chand as God Ram\n* Puran, Sohan Lal, [[Sadhu Meher|Meher]], Amarjit Chand, and Karahm Chand as 'Ramayan' theatrical troupe members\n* [[Kabir Chowdhury]] as Boy in video shop\n* Laurence C\u00f4te as French tourist at the Taj Mahal\n{{colend}}\n\n==Controversies and reaction==\n''Fire'' was passed uncut by India's censor board (the [[Central Board of Film Certification]]) in May 1998 with a rating of ''Adult'', the only condition being that the character Sita's name be changed to Nita.<ref name=\"IndiaToday\" /> The board made their decision based on what it called the importance of the story for Indian women.<ref name=Ross>{{Cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Oliver|title=Same-Sex Desire in Indian Culture: Representations in Literature and Film, 1970-2015|year=2016|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|location=New York|page=44|isbn=978-1137570758}}</ref> The film was first screened on 13 November 1998 and ran to full houses in 42 theaters<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Dousing the Fire of Free Expression|last=Dhavan|first=Rajeev|date=December 9, 1998|work=The Times of India|access-date=}}</ref> in most metropolitan cities throughout India for almost three weeks.\n\nOn 2 December, more than 200 [[Shiv Sena|Shiv Sanaiks]] stormed a Cinemax theatre in suburban [[Goregaon]] in [[Mumbai]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=City Theatre Puts Lid on 'Fire' again|last=|first=|date=December 19, 1998|work=The Times of India|access-date=}}</ref> smashing glass panes, burning posters and shouting slogans.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bearak|first=Barry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/24/world/new-delhi-journal-a-lesbian-idyll-and-the-movie-theaters-surrender.html|title=New Delhi Journal; A Lesbian Idyll, and the Movie Theaters Surrender|date=1998-12-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Radical Hindu women attack film on lesbian in Bombay|last=|first=|date=December 2, 1998|work=Agence France Presse|access-date=}}</ref> They compelled managers to refund tickets to moviegoers.

John]] and [[Tejaswini Niranjana]] wrote in 1999 that ''Fire'' reduces [[patriarchy]] to the denial and control of female sexuality. The authors make the point that the film traps itself in its own rendering of patriarchy: \n<blockquote>\nControl of female sexuality is surely one of the ''ideological'' planks on which patriarchy rests. But by taking this idea literally, the film imprisons itself in the very ideology it seeks to fight, its own version of authentic reality being nothing but a mirror image of patriarchal discourse. 'Fire' ends up arguing that the successful assertion of sexual choice is not only a necessary but also a sufficient condition\u2014indeed, the sole criterion\u2014for the emancipation of women. Thus the patriarchal ideology of 'control' is first reduced to pure denial \u2013 as though such control did not also involve the production and amplification of sexuality \u2013 and is later simply inverted to produce the film's own vision of women's liberation as free sexual 'choice.' (1999:582)\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nWhatever subversive potential 'Fire' might have had (as a film that makes visible the 'naturalised' hegemony of [[heterosexuality]] in contemporary culture, for example) is nullified by its largely [[masculinist]] assumption that men should not neglect the sexual needs of their wives, lest they turn lesbian (1999:583).\n</blockquote>\nThe authors additionally argue that viewers must ask tough questions from films such as ''Fire'' that place themselves in the realm of \"alternative\" cinema and aim to occupy not only aesthetic, but also political space (Economic and Political Weekly, 6\u201313 March 1999).\n\n[[Madhu Kishwar]], then-editor of ''[[Manushi]]'', wrote a highly critical review of ''Fire'', finding fault with the depiction of the characters in the film as a \"mean spirited caricature of middle class family life among urban Indians\". She claimed that homosexuality was socially accepted in India as long as it remained a private affair, adding that [[Deepa Mehta|Mehta]] \"did a disservice to the cause of women... by crudely pushing the Radha-Sita relationship into the lesbian mould,\" as women would now be unable to form intimate relationships with other women without being branded as lesbians.<ref>Kishwar, Madhu.
