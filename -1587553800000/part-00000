He curdled half the milk and set it aside in [[wicker]] strainers.<ref>[[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler's]] translation.</ref>}}\n\nA letter of [[Epicurus]] to his patron requests a wheel of hard cheese so that he may make a feast whenever he wishes. Pliny recorded the Roman tradition that [[Zoroaster]] had lived on cheese.<ref>[[Pliny's Natural History]], iii .85.</ref>\n\nBy [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], cheese-making was a mature art and common food group. [[Columella]]'s ''De Re Rustica'' (circa 65 CE) details a cheese-making process involving rennet coagulation, pressing of the curd, salting, and aging. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']] (77 CE) devotes two chapters (XI, 96-97) to the diversity of cheeses enjoyed by Romans of the early [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. He stated that the best cheeses came from ''pagi'' near [[N\u00eemes]], and were identifiable as [[Loz\u00e8re]] and [[G\u00e9vaudan]] and had to be eaten fresh.\n\n== Post-Roman Europe ==\nMost cheeses were initially recorded in the late [[Middle Ages]]. [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] was recorded around 1500 CE, [[Parmesan cheese|Parmesan]] was founded in 1597, [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]] in 1697, and [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]] in 1791.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith, John H. | title=Cheesemaking in Scotland - A History | publisher=The Scottish Dairy Association | year=1995 | isbn=0-9525323-0-1}}</ref> Cheeses diversified in Europe with locales developing their own traditions and products when Romanized populations encountered unfamiliar neighbors with their own cheese-making traditions. As long-distance trade collapsed, only travelers encountered unfamiliar cheeses. [[Charlemagne]]'s first encounter with an edible rind white cheese forms one of the constructed anecdotes of [[Notker the Stammerer|Notker]]'s ''Life'' of the Emperor.<ref>Notker, \u00a715.</ref> Cheese-making in manor and monastery intensified local characteristics imparted by local bacterial flora while the identification of monks with cheese is sustained through modern marketing labels.<ref>Noted in passing by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat ''A History of Food'', 2nd ed. 2009:106.</ref> This also led to a diversity of cheese types.

[[Rubing]] in [[Yunnan]], China is similar to paneer. Mainstream Chinese culture is not dairy-centric, but some outlying regions of the country including Yunnan have strong cheese traditions. There are a variety of [[Tibetan cheese]]s.\n\n== Modern ==\n{{Further|Farmstead cheese|Artisan cheese}}\nUntil its modern spread along with European culture, cheese was most common by far in Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa. It was unheard of or far less common in sub-Saharan Africa, the rest of Asia, and pre-colonization Americas. Although cheese is still less prominent in local cuisines outside of Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas, most cheeses have become popular worldwide through the spread of European and Euro-American empires and culture.\n\n=== Mass production ===\nThe first factory for the industrial production of cheese opened in Switzerland in 1815. However, the large-scale production found real success in the United States. Credit goes to Jesse Williams, a dairy farmer from [[Rome, New York|Rome]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Williams began making cheese in an [[assembly line|assembly-line]] fashion using the milk from neighbouring farms in 1851. Within decades, hundreds of dairy associations existed.\n\nMass-produced rennet began in the 1860s. By the turn of the century, scientists were producing pure microbial cultures. Previously, bacteria in cheese was derived from the environment or from recycling an earlier batch's whey. Pure cultures meant a standardized cheese could be produced. The mass production of cheese made it readily available to the poorer classes. Therefore, simple cost-effective storage solutions for cheese gained popularity. Ceramic cheese dishes, or cheese bells, became one of the most common ways to prolong the life of cheese in the home. It remained popular in most households until the introduction of the home refrigerator in 1913.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barfly Retro Fridge History|url=http://www.barfly.ca/english/history.html|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nFactory-made cheese overtook traditional cheese-making during the [[World War II]] era. Since then, factories have been the source of most cheese in America and Europe.

[[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' (late 8th century BC) describes the [[Cyclops]] producing and storing sheep's and goat's milk and cheese: \n{{cquote|We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, so we went inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could hold...<br> \nWhen he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in due course, and then let each of them have her own young. He curdled half the milk and set it aside in [[wicker]] strainers.<ref>[[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler's]] translation.</ref>}}\n\nA letter of [[Epicurus]] to his patron requests a wheel of hard cheese so that he may make a feast whenever he wishes. Pliny recorded the Roman tradition that [[Zoroaster]] had lived on cheese.<ref>[[Pliny's Natural History]], iii .85.</ref>\n\nBy [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], cheese-making was a mature art and common food group. [[Columella]]'s ''De Re Rustica'' (circa 65 CE) details a cheese-making process involving rennet coagulation, pressing of the curd, salting, and aging. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']] (77 CE) devotes two chapters (XI, 96-97) to the diversity of cheeses enjoyed by Romans of the early [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. He stated that the best cheeses came from ''pagi'' near [[N\u00eemes]], and were identifiable as [[Loz\u00e8re]] and [[G\u00e9vaudan]] and had to be eaten fresh.\n\n== Post-Roman Europe ==\nMost cheeses were initially recorded in the late [[Middle Ages]]. [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] was recorded around 1500 CE, [[Parmesan cheese|Parmesan]] was founded in 1597, [[Gouda (cheese)|Gouda]] in 1697, and [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]] in 1791.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith, John H. | title=Cheesemaking in Scotland - A History | publisher=The Scottish Dairy Association | year=1995 | isbn=0-9525323-0-1}}</ref> Cheeses diversified in Europe with locales developing their own traditions and products when Romanized populations encountered unfamiliar neighbors with their own cheese-making traditions. As long-distance trade collapsed, only travelers encountered unfamiliar cheeses. [[Charlemagne]]'s first encounter with an edible rind white cheese forms one of the constructed anecdotes of [[Notker the Stammerer|Notker]]'s ''Life'' of the Emperor.<ref>Notker, \u00a715.</ref> Cheese-making in manor and monastery intensified local characteristics imparted by local bacterial flora while the identification of monks with cheese is sustained through modern marketing labels.<ref>Noted in passing by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat ''A History of Food'', 2nd ed. 2009:106.</ref> This also led to a diversity of cheese types.

Mass-produced cheese has become quite common, replacing hand-made and/or local cheeses even more in the United States than in Europe. Recently, more people in the US have been making [[Farmstead cheese|farmstead]] (or farmhouse) and [[artisan cheese]]s.<ref name=\"Paxson2013\">{{citation|author=Heather Paxson|title=The Life of Cheese Crafting Food and Value in America|date=2013|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-52-027018-3|pages=56\u201359}}</ref>\n\n== Asia ==\n\nPreserved cheese dating from 1615 BC was found in the Taklamakan Desert in [[Xinjiang]], [[China]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oldest Cheese Found|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/02/25/worlds-oldest-cheese/5776373/|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nLocal cheese today is commonly made or available in most of [[South Asia]] in the form of [[paneer]] and related cheeses. [[Rubing]] in [[Yunnan]], China is similar to paneer. Mainstream Chinese culture is not dairy-centric, but some outlying regions of the country including Yunnan have strong cheese traditions. There are a variety of [[Tibetan cheese]]s.\n\n== Modern ==\n{{Further|Farmstead cheese|Artisan cheese}}\nUntil its modern spread along with European culture, cheese was most common by far in Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa. It was unheard of or far less common in sub-Saharan Africa, the rest of Asia, and pre-colonization Americas. Although cheese is still less prominent in local cuisines outside of Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas, most cheeses have become popular worldwide through the spread of European and Euro-American empires and culture.\n\n=== Mass production ===\nThe first factory for the industrial production of cheese opened in Switzerland in 1815. However, the large-scale production found real success in the United States. Credit goes to Jesse Williams, a dairy farmer from [[Rome, New York|Rome]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Williams began making cheese in an [[assembly line|assembly-line]] fashion using the milk from neighbouring farms in 1851. Within decades, hundreds of dairy associations existed.\n\nMass-produced rennet began in the 1860s. By the turn of the century, scientists were producing pure microbial cultures. Previously, bacteria in cheese was derived from the environment or from recycling an earlier batch's whey. Pure cultures meant a standardized cheese could be produced. The mass production of cheese made it readily available to the poorer classes. Therefore, simple cost-effective storage solutions for cheese gained popularity. Ceramic cheese dishes, or cheese bells, became one of the most common ways to prolong the life of cheese in the home. It remained popular in most households until the introduction of the home refrigerator in 1913.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barfly Retro Fridge History|url=http://www.barfly.ca/english/history.html|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nFactory-made cheese overtook traditional cheese-making during the [[World War II]] era. Since then, factories have been the source of most cheese in America and Europe. Today, Americans buy more [[processed cheese]] than \"real\", factory-made cheese.<ref>{{cite book | author=McGee, Harold | title=On Food and Cooking (Revised Edition) | publisher=Scribner | year=2004 | isbn=0-684-80001-2 |page=54 |quote=In the United States, the market for process cheese [...] is now larger than the market for 'natural' cheese, which itself is almost exclusively factory-made.}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food|History}}\n* [[Food history]]\n* [[List of ancient dishes|List of ancient dishes and foods]]\n* [[List of cheeses]]\n* [[List of European cheeses with protected geographical status]]\n* [[Cheesemaking]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Cheese}}\n[[Category:Cheese]]\n[[Category:History of food and drink|Cheese]]\n", "name_user": "ZebraZero809Gamer", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEarliest origins)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cheese"}

October 1954) is an Australian former politician who was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|29th]] [[Prime Minister of Australia]] from 2015 to 2018. He served twice as [[Liberal Party of Australia|Leader of the Liberal Party]], from [[2008 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|2008]] to [[2009 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|2009]] when he was [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]], and from [[September_2015_Liberal_Party_of_Australia_leadership_spill|2015]] to [[2018_Liberal_Party_of_Australia_leadership_spills#Second_spill_(24_August)|2018]] when he was Prime Minister. He was the MP for [[Division of Wentworth|Wentworth]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from 2004 to 2018.\n\nTurnbull graduated from the [[University of Sydney]] with a Bachelor of Arts and a [[Bachelor of Laws]], before attending [[Brasenose College, Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]], earning a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]]. For over two decades prior to entering politics, he worked as a journalist, lawyer, [[merchant bank]]er, and [[venture capital]]ist. He served as Chair of the [[Australian Republic Movement|Australian Republican Movement]] from 1993 to 2000, and was one of the leaders of the unsuccessful \"Yes\" campaign in the [[1999 Australian republic referendum|1999 republic referendum]]. He was first elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] for the [[Division of Wentworth]] in [[New South Wales]] at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]], and was [[Minister of the Environment (Australia)|Minister for the Environment and Water]] from January 2007 until December 2007.\n\nAfter coming second in the [[2007 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election|2007 leadership election]], Turnbull [[2008 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|won the leadership]] of the Liberal Party in September 2008 and became [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]]. However, his support of the [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme]] proposed by the [[Rudd Government (2007\u20132010)|Rudd Government]] in December 2009 led to a [[2009 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|leadership challenge]] by [[Tony Abbott]], who defeated Turnbull by a single vote. Though initially planning to leave politics after this, Turnbull chose to stay and was later appointed [[Minister for Communications (Australia)|Minister for Communications]] in the [[Abbott Government]] following the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]].\n\nCiting consistently poor opinion polling for the government, Turnbull resigned from the Cabinet on 14 September 2015 and [[September 2015 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|challenged]] Abbott, reclaiming the leadership of the Liberal Party by ten votes. He was sworn in as [[Prime Minister of Australia]] the following day.
