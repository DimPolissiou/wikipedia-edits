Brown goods typically require high technical knowledge and skills (which get more complex with time, such as going from a [[soldering iron]] to a hot-air soldering station), while white goods may need more practical skills and force to manipulate the devices and heavy tools required to repair them.\n\n==Definition==\nGiven a broad usage, the domestic application attached to home appliance is tied to the definition of [[Appliance (disambiguation)|appliance]] as \"an instrument or device designed for a particular use or function\".<ref>{{cite dictionary | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/appliance | title=Appliance | dictionary=Merriam Webster | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> More specifically, [[Collins English Dictionary]] defines \"home appliance\" as: \"devices or machines, usually electrical, that are in your home and which you use to do jobs such as cleaning or cooking\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/household-appliances | title=Definition of household appliances | publisher=Collins Dictionary | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> The broad usage, afforded to the definition allows for nearly any device intended for domestic use to be a home appliance, including [[consumer electronics]] as well as [[stove]]s,<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> [[refrigerator]]s, [[toaster]]s<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> and [[air conditioner]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Toaster, Universal, Model E947, c. 1915, Landers, Frary and Clark, New Britain, Connecticut, Wolfsonian-FIU Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Early 20th century electric [[toaster]]]]\n<!-- The reference structure of this section seems to be \"refs at the end of each paragraph\". Feel free to reference however you like, though-->\nWhile many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. The development of these appliances is tied to the disappearance of full-time [[domestic servant]]s and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities in pursuit of more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included [[washing machine]]s, [[water heater]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, [[kettle]]s and [[sewing machine]]s. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric [[clothes iron]] in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry.<!--For this sentence only   <ref name=\"George2003\"/>  . Also, research \"Hotpoint Iron\". Also, linking to [[Earl Richardson]] will give the wrong person --> In the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]], the domestic use of [[dishwasher]]s, and [[clothes dryer]]s were part of a shift for convenience.

Throughout this period companies merged and acquired one another to reduce research and production costs and eliminate competitors, resulting in [[antitrust legislation]].\n\nThe [[United States Department of Energy]] reviews compliance with the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] of 1987, which required manufacturers to reduce the energy consumption of the appliances by 25% every five years.<ref name=\"eai\" />\n\nIn the 1990s, the appliance industry was very consolidated, with over 90% of the products being sold by just five companies. For example, in 1991, [[dishwasher]] manufacturing market share was split between [[General Electric]] with 40% market share, [[Whirlpool (company)|Whirlpool]] with 31% market share, [[Electrolux]] with 20% market share, [[Maytag]] with 7% market share and [[Thermador]] with just 2% of market share.<ref name=eai />\n\n==Major appliances==\n[[File:Wascator.jpg|thumb|upright|Swedish washing machine, 1950s]]\n{{main|Major appliance}}\nMajor appliances, also known as white goods, comprise major household appliances and may include: [[air conditioner]]s,<ref name=\"NRDC\"/> [[dishwasher]]s,<ref name=\"NRDC\"/> [[clothes dryer]]s, [[drying cabinet]]s, [[freezer]]s, [[refrigerator]]s,<ref name=\"NRDC\"/> [[kitchen stove]]s, [[water heater]]s,<ref name=\"NRDC\"/> [[washing machine]]s,<ref name=\"NRDC\"/> [[trash compactor]]s, [[microwave oven]]s, and [[induction cookers]].

Brown goods typically require high technical knowledge and skills (which get more complex with time, such as going from a [[soldering iron]] to a hot-air soldering station), while white goods may need more practical skills and force to manipulate the devices and heavy tools required to repair them.\n\n==Definition==\nGiven a broad usage, the domestic application attached to home appliance is tied to the definition of [[Appliance (disambiguation)|appliance]] as \"an instrument or device designed for a particular use or function\".<ref>{{cite dictionary | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/appliance | title=Appliance | dictionary=Merriam Webster | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> More specifically, [[Collins English Dictionary]] defines \"home appliance\" as: \"devices or machines, usually electrical, that are in your home and which you use to do jobs such as cleaning or cooking\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/household-appliances | title=Definition of household appliances | publisher=Collins Dictionary | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> The broad usage, afforded to the definition allows for nearly any device intended for domestic use to be a home appliance, including [[consumer electronics]] as well as [[stove]]s,<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> [[refrigerator]]s, [[toaster]]s<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> and [[air conditioner]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Toaster, Universal, Model E947, c. 1915, Landers, Frary and Clark, New Britain, Connecticut, Wolfsonian-FIU Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Early 20th century electric [[toaster]]]]\n<!-- The reference structure of this section seems to be \"refs at the end of each paragraph\". Feel free to reference however you like, though-->\nWhile many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. The development of these appliances is tied to the disappearance of full-time [[domestic servant]]s and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities in pursuit of more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included [[washing machine]]s, [[water heater]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, [[kettle]]s and [[sewing machine]]s. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric [[clothes iron]] in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry.<!--For this sentence only   <ref name=\"George2003\"/>  . Also, research \"Hotpoint Iron\". Also, linking to [[Earl Richardson]] will give the wrong person --> In the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]], the domestic use of [[dishwasher]]s, and [[clothes dryer]]s were part of a shift for convenience.

Throughout this period companies merged and acquired one another to reduce research and production costs and eliminate competitors, resulting in [[antitrust legislation]].\n\nThe [[United States Department of Energy]] reviews compliance with the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] of 1987, which required manufacturers to reduce the energy consumption of the appliances by 25% every five years.<ref name=\"eai\" />\n\nIn the 1990s, the appliance industry was very consolidated, with over 90% of the products being sold by just five companies.
