{"title_page": "Ubu and the Truth Commission", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Ubu and the Truth Commission''''' is a South African play by [[Jane Taylor (South Africa)|Jane Taylor]] first performed under the directorship of [[William Kentridge]] at The Laboratory in [[Johannesburg]]'s [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theatre]]<ref>Before the end of 1998, the Market Theatre had already staged three plays on the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]].  The first of the other two, ''[[The Dead Wait]]'', is a fictitious but conventional tale from the [[South African Border War|Angolan war]] which details a soldier's return to South Africa and his confession of a crime.  Although based on the TRC, it is not overtly ''about'' it.  The second, ''[[The Story I Am About To Tell]]'', was produced by a support group for survivors giving TRC testimony, and starred three of them.</ref> on 26 May 1997.<ref>The world premier followed on 17 June 1997, at the Kunsfest in [[Weimar]].</ref>\n\nProduced by the [[Handspring Puppet Company]], and employing a multimedia approach in the tradition of [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], it combines [[puppetry]] with [[live action|live actors]], [[music]], [[animation]] and [[documentary film|documentary]] footage, while also drawing extensively on [[Alfred Jarry]]'s absurdist production ''[[Ubu Roi]]'' (1896).  It fuses the chaos of the Ubu legend with original testimony from witnesses at the post-[[apartheid]] [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC).\n\n== The TRC ==\nIn her \"Writer's Note\" to the 2007 book-form publication of the play, Taylor wrote,\n\n<blockquote>What has engaged me as I have followed the Commission, is the way in which individual narratives come to stand for the larger national narrative.  The stories of personal grief, loss, triumph and violation now stand as an account of South Africa's recent past.  History and autobiography merge.  This marks a significant shift, because in the past decades of popular resistance, personal suffering was eclipsed \u2014 subordinated to a larger project of mass liberation.  Now, however, we hear in individual testimony the very private patterns of language and thought that structure memory and mourning.  ''Ubu and the Truth Commission'' uses these circumstances as a starting point.<ref>Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. ii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established in 1996 with what Taylor described as a \"momentous mandate\",<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. ii\">Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. ii.</ref> to solicit testimony from those who considered themselves casualties, perpetrators or survivors of the apartheid atrocity.  Coming almost exactly two years after [[South African general election, 1994|South Africa's first democratic elections]], the Commission's purposes, in Taylor's eyes, were \"to retrieve lost histories, to make reparation to those who had suffered, to provide amnesty for acts which were demonstrably political in purpose [... and, among the most important] to create a general context through which national reconciliation might be made possible.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. ii\"/>\n\n\"The Commission itself is theatre,\" wrote William Kentridge, \"or at any rate a kind of ur-theatre [...].  One by one witnesses come and have their half hour to tell their story, pause, weep, be comforted by professional comforters who sit at the table with them.  The stories are harrowing, spellbinding.  The audience sit at the edge of their seats listening to every word.  This is exemplary civic theatre, a public hearing of private griefs which are absorbed into the body politic as a part of a deeper understanding of how the society arrived at its present position.\"<ref>Kentridge 2007, pp. viii-ix.  Of how more orthodox forms could possibly compete with this, he explained, \"Our theatre is a reflection on the debate rather than the debate itself.  It tries to make sense of the memory rather than be the memory.\"  (Kentridge 2007, p. ix)</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nPa Ubu (played by Dawid Minnaar) has been spending a great deal of time away from home, much to the concern and suspicion of his wife (Busi Zokufa), who smells on him an odour which she suspects may be that of a mistress.  In truth, however, he is an agent of a governmental death squad, and the odour that she smells is of blood and dynamite.\n\nWith the abolition of apartheid, the TRC is set in motion.  Amnesty is offered those war criminals who come forward and offer full and truthful testimony regarding their infractions.  Ubu, suspecting a trick, is unsure of what to do.  The play follows his indecisive actions as they lead his path finally to a convergence with that of the TRC.\n\n== Conception, production and performance ==\nKentridge had been working for some years with the Handspring Puppet Company in Johannesburg before the idea for ''Ubu and the Truth Commission'' was mooted, and had extensive experience of theatre that incorporated animation, puppets and actors.  He did not, he claimed, pursue the multimedia realm because of any aesthetic ideal, but rather because he was skilled in the art of animation anyway and was curious to see how it would combine with puppet theatre.   ''Woyzeck on the Highveld'' (1993) and ''Faustus in Africa'' (1996) were successful tone-setters in this respect.  The latter, according to Kentridge, was \"a huge undertaking\",<ref>Kentridge 2007, p. ix.</ref> after which he and the company were on the look-out merely for something small to \"do and survive\".<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\">Kentridge 2007, p. x.</ref>  [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' seemed ideally suited to puppetry, \"[b]ut we reckoned without the Beckett fundamentalists who would not give permission for us to leave out even a comma from the stage directions\".<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\"/>  In a bid to secure a neo-Becketian text (but not having the skill to write their own), and after rejecting several ideas, they considered a project called ''Waiting Room'', which would comprise interviews with [[land mine|land-mine]] victims waiting in rural orthopaedic hospitals in [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]].\n\nAt the time, Kentridge happened to be etching a series of pieces for an exhibition in honour of the centenary of ''Ubu Roi'''s opening appearance in [[Paris]]ian theatre.  They concerned a naked man in front of a blackboard on which were drawings of Ubu, \"with his pointed head and belly spiral\".<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\"/>  Kentridge intended when the etchings were complete to animate the chalk drawings, which led him to the natural conclusion that the naked man might as well be animated, too.  He asked a friend in [[choreography]] if she would care to have a dancer in front of screen on which a \"schematic line drawing\"<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\"/> of Ubu was to move about.\n\nWhen Kentridge realised that he could not immerse himself in both the Ubu and the ''Waiting Room'' projects simultaneously, he panicked and chose to combine the two.  When the TRC took off, it became clear that he need look no further in his hunt for material, for \"an avalanche\"<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\"/> was streaming in every day.  While he went about convincing the two parties to come together, he formed an ever-clearer picture of how the two could complement one another.  The grave documentary material from the TRC could lend to the rampant burlesque, \"which always had a danger of becoming merely amusing\",<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\"/> a certain dignity and sobriety, while the untamed liberty which characterised ''Ubu Roi'' could shed new light and offer a fresh and lively perspective on the depressing affairs of the TRC.\n\nLooking at the play retrospectively, Kentridge did not feel that its shoddy provenance had maledicted it; rather it had accorded its writer, director and producers a gradually compounding platform on which they could \"find pieces of the play, images, literary conceits, changing physical metaphors that we would never have arrived at if we had started from a sober beginning\".<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xi\">Kentridge 2007, p. xi.</ref>\n\n\"There is,\" wrote Taylor of ''Ubu Roi'' and its main character's madness, \"a particular kind of pleasure for an audience watching these infantile attacks.  Part of the satisfaction arises from the fact that in the burlesque mode which Jarry invents, there is no place for consequence.  While Ubu may be relentless in his political aspirations, and brutal in his personal relations, he apparently has no measurable effect upon those who inhabit the farcical world which he creates around himself.  He thus acts out our most childish rages and desires, in which we seek to gratify ourselves at all cost.  It is this feature in particular which has informed our own production.\"<ref>Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, pp. iii-iv.</ref>\n\nDeeply affected as she viewed the TRC's proceedings by the frequency of the atrocities and the negligence and ignorance with which so many of them were carried out, Taylor noted that \"those perpetrators who seem to have some capacity for remorse, appear to be shocked at observing, as if from the outside, the effect of their behaviour.  Others simply show no response at all, so profound is the denial, or the failure of moral imagination.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. iv\">Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. iv.</ref>  It was thus her endeavour to pluck Ubu from the world of burlesque and action without consequence, and drop him in one altogether different: \"It is as if Cause and Effect are registered through different modes of expression in the play [...].\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. iv\"/>\n\n=== Puppetry ===\nThe play's conception began in earnest with a meeting between Taylor, Kentridge, Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler, who all agreed in principle to employ Ubu as a vehicle for exploring the TRC.  Near the end of 1996, Taylor attended numerous workshops with the Handspring Puppet Company and grew to appreciate the actors' capacities and the style of puppet theatre.  Also discussed were such transcendental devices as the three-headed hound and the embrace of various hybrid forms of animation and puppetry: drawn figures were hand-controlled and filmed on a sequential frame-by-frame basis.  Taylor later confessed that her writing was greatly informed not only by Kentridge's direction but also by these experiences,<ref>\"Further,\" she wrote, \"this theatre company brings a performance style of great expressive care to the characters, an element which has determined what kinds of testimony have been appropriate for inclusion.\"  (Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vii)</ref> and believed that her colleagues were similarly inspired and edified. \n\nTaylor came to see great significance in the figurative role of the puppet, for its every motion was, in essence, tropical:\n\n<blockquote>The puppet draws attention to its own artifice, and we as audience willingly submit ourselves to the ambiguous processes that at once deny and assert the reality of what we watch.  Puppets also declare that they are being \"spoken through\".  They thus very poignantly and compellingly capture complex relations of testimony, translation and documentation apparent in the processes of the Commission itself.<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer 2007\">Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was early on in the workshops that the decision was taken as a finality to have Ma and Pa Ubu played by orthodox histrions.  \"These characters thus exist, as it were, on one scale,\" wrote Taylor.  \"The witnesses, who are represented by puppet-figures, exist on another scale, and a great deal of their meaning arises out of this fact.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer 2007\"/>  Lewis Segal, writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', declared that the puppets incarnated \"a helpless nobility in the face of great suffering\", while noting that they represented only \"a kind of supplement to a [[neo-expressionism|neo-Expressionist]] theatrical experience that the company defines primarily with human actors and film animation\".<ref name=\"Segal 1998\">Segal 1998.</ref>\n\n=== Testimonials ===\nIn tackling the matter of how to portray TRC testimonials on stage, the first question was, according to Kentridge, an ethical one:<ref>Admittedly, it had been known from the beginning that Pa and Ma Ubu would be portrayed as humans, for the original, pre-project-merging intention had been for human dancing.  The witnesses, similarly, were always going to be portrayed as puppets, as that was the premise of ''Waiting Room''.  \"The more honourable route to the decision about performance style,\" wrote Kentridge later, \"is a justification after the event.\" (Kentridge 2007, p. xi)</ref> \"what is our responsibility to the people whose stories we are using as raw fodder for the play?\"<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xi\"/>  He was uncomfortable with using \"real\" actors for the reason of \"the audience being caught halfway between having to believe in the actor for the sake of the story, and also not believe in the actor for the sake of the actual witness who existed out there but was not the actor\".<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xi\"/>  Using a puppet, on the other hand, would leave the audience with no reason to believe that the puppet or puppeteer represented an actual witness: \"The difference between the materials of which a puppet is made and human flesh,\" wrote Jones and Kohler, \"can break the illusion that both exist in the same moment.\"<ref>Kohler and Jones 2007, p. xvii.</ref>  Kentridge confirmed that \"[t]he puppet becomes a medium through which the testimony can be heard.\"<ref>Kentridge 2007, p. xi.  \"In so far as I have a polemic,\" he elucidated, \"it is this: to trust in the inauthentic, the contingent, the practical as a way of arriving at meaning.\"</ref>\n\nJones and Kohler, head puppeteers alongside Louis Seboko, elaborated:\n\n<blockquote>Their responsibility in the play is both central and extremely onerous, as their task is to re-enact the deeply harrowing personal accounts of the effect of the former [[National Party (South Africa)|Apartheid State]] on people's lives.  Badly handled, such stories could easily become a kind of horror [[pornography]].  The puppets assist in mediating this horror.  They are not actors playing a role.  Rather, they are wooden<ref>They explained elsewhere that the wood's rough sculpture made the faces and facial expressions, especially when it came to looking up, down or forward, far easier to illume.</ref> dolls attempting to be real people.  As they attempt to move and breathe as we do, they cross the barrier of the here and now and become metaphors for humanity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Kohler and Jones 2007, pp. xvi-xvii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEach puppet was given two puppeteers, which bestowed upon it a metaphorical element of vulnerability, while also calling to mind the professional comforters who accompanied witnesses during TRC proceedings.  These worked together to divide and cut down individual control over the puppet's movement and speech.  \"This,\" explained Jones and Kohler, \"encourages us to enter into the illusion that the puppet has a life and responsibility of its own. But the fact that the manipulators are present also allows us to use the emotions visible in the puppeteers' faces to inform our understanding of the emotions of the puppet character, with its immobile features [...].  Puppets are brought to life by the conviction of the puppeteer and the willingness of the audience.  When an actor plays opposite a puppet, she or he participates in the same process.  There can be no eye contact with the puppeteer.  The actor's focus is solely on the puppet itself.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe endeavour was largely successful.  \"The plain wooden faces of these characters -- handled with enormous skill by Basil Jones, Adrian Kohler and Louis Seboko -- confer a power and credibility on their words that real actors could never achieve,\" wrote crici William Triplett.  \"In such scenes actors will try to make you feel what their characters have witnessed.  But an expressionless puppet, especially one 'speaking' the unspeakable through one of the commission's monotoned translators, engages the imagination awesomely.\"<ref name=\"Triplett 1998\">Triplett 1998.</ref>\n\nThe company was especially pleased with the decision to make use of witness-puppets because of the fact that the commission often had a translator to complement each testifier: \"Two speakers for the same story and our puppets need two manipulators,\" as Kentridge put it.  \"One manipulator could tell the story in Zulu and the other could translate.\"<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xii\">Kentridge 2007, p. xii.</ref>  This did not work, however, as the stories could not be heard, so the translators were placed instead in Ubu's shower, which served as a sort of booth, and difference was made between the authentic witness voice and the contrived public address of the interlingual rendition.\n\nA significant challenge to the skills of the puppeteers (especially those controlling the witnesses) came in the form of manipulating them at the right pace, a pace usually rather more sluggish than that of a normal actor, for it was important that the audience see precisely what it was that the puppet was doing.  The puppeteers worked extensively with their figures to determine this, while also settling on specific moments of physical contact between puppet and orthodox human actor.\n\nAn even greater challenge that the decision to employ witness-puppets presented was how to achieve a balance between the put-upon placidity of the witnesses and the delirious burlesque of Ma and Pa Ubu.  \"When the play is working at its best,\" wrote Kentridge, \"Pa Ubu does not hold back.  He tries to colonise the stage and be the sole focus of the audience.  And it is the task of the actors and manipulators of the puppets to wrest that attention back.  This battle is extremely delicate.  If pushed too hard there is the danger of the witnesses becoming strident, pathetic, self pitying.  If they retreat too far they are swamped by Ubu.  But sometimes, in a good performance, and with a willing audience we do make the witnesses stories clearly heard and also throw them into a wider set of questions that Ubu engenders around them.\"<ref>Kentridge 2007, p. xiv.</ref>  Although the witness puppets were never to be seen by Ubu and his wife \u2014 they were situated in close spatial proximity to Ubu, behind his furniture, but made to appear elsewhere \u2014, their actions had a direct bearing upon them.\n\nThe most important upshot of the decision was that witnesses could now show up in manifold nooks of Ubu's life, not merely (as had originally been intended) in the witness stand.  It also engendered an experimental scene in which Ubu lies on a table looking up in a dream at a puppet as it testifies about its child's demise.  It was tried initially with the witness behind Ubu's hips, so that his body formed a rolling landscape with a small rise from behind which the witness gave testimony.  When the same scene was tried with the witness behind his head, it became evident that the best way to go would be turn the witness into a dream, and the story became Ubu's confession.  Kentridge recalled,\n\n<blockquote>We put the witness behind Ubu's legs again and he was back in the landscape. We then tried to see how close the puppet could get to touching Ubu without breaking the double image. Extremely close we found. And then we tried it with the witness touching Ubu's hip with its wooden hand. An extraordinary thing happened. What we saw was an act of absolution. The witness forgave, even comforted Ubu for his act. These were a series of wholly unexpected meanings, generated not through clarity of thought, or brilliance of invention, but through practical theatre work. This is the second polemic I would make. A faith in a practical epistemology in the theatre-trusting in and using the artifices and techniques of theatre to generate meaning.<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xii\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe opposite was also true, however, as in his idea of a dancer before an image-bearing screen.  Both the dancer and the image were to be seen together, generating an elaborate figure, but it became obvious within twenty minutes of starting the project that, \"[f]or reasons of synchronisation, parallax, lighting, [and] stilted performance\", it was incompatible.  \"Next polemic - Mistrust of Good Ideas in the abstract.  Mistrust of starting with a knowledge of the meaning of an image and thinking it can then be executed.  There is for me more than an accidental linguistic connection between ''executing'' an idea and ''killing'' it.\"<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xii\"/>\n\nThroughout the play, and specifically when Ubu feels insecure about being found out, an animated eye, intercut with a real one in classic Kentridge fashion, emerges on the screen to convey the sense that the main character is not quite so alone as he would like to think.  The screen was used repeatedly and effectively in Kentridge's production.  \"[I]n every instance the images are more suggestive than real,\" wrote Triplett, \"and hence more powerful.\"<ref name=\"Triplett 1998\"/>\n\n=== Allusions and symbolism ===\nSeveral of the play's marionettes carry allusions to the work of Jarry: the Palcontents of ''Ubu Cocu'', the protagonist's \"manic acts of mayhem\",<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer 2007\"/> find representation as lethal and destructive vices in Taylor's play with a three-headed [[dog]].\n\nFor symbolism more in keeping with the TRC, meanwhile, Kentridge was keen on including a paper shredder.  \"In South Africa at the moment,\" he explained, \"there is a battle between the paper shredders and the photostat machines.  For each police general who is shredding documents of his past there are officers under him who are Photostatting them to keep as insurance against future prosecutions.<ref>Kentridge 2007, p. viii.</ref>  A normal machine, however, did not seem especially creative, so, after abandoning representative bread-slicers (in view of the palling thought of wasted dough), animated projections (in view of Kentridge's reluctance to spend hours drawing them) and the dog's mouth (in view of its narrowness), they settled on a [[crocodile]]'s mouth, to be carried as a handbag by Ubu's wife.  This crocodile, then, played the role not only of Ma Ubu's handbag; it was Pa Ubu's pet advisor and cover-up man, too, concealing incriminatory evidence in his mouth .\n\nThree puppet-types, then \u2014 the [[vulture]], the witnesses, and Brutus the dog and Niles [[crocodile]] \u2014, were created.  It was, claimed the puppeteers, \"a fairly organic process\",<ref name=\"Jones and Kohler 2007, p. xvi\">Jones and Kohler 2007, p. xvi.</ref> undertaken in accordance with the play's requirements.  Each puppet-type had a unique and particular affiliation with Ma and Pa Ubu.  The vulture, limited in its actions, was placed near the rear of the stage, where sporadically it offered sardonic aphorisms through a series of electronically contrived squawks that were translated on the screen behind it.  \"Thus,\" wrote the puppeteers, \"it is a form of [[wikt:manipulate|manipulation]]: like gears driven by motors which in turn are driven by a remote [[technician]] \u2014 which is appropriate to its function in the play \u2014 an apparently [[author]]less automaton spewing forth programmed truisms.\"<ref name=\"Jones and Kohler 2007, p. xvi\"/>\n\nThe crocodile was given but one manipulator to the dog's one for each head.  They moved about freely and in the same space as the human characters, rather than being restricted in the traditional playboard sense seen in such earlier plays as ''Woyzeck on the Highveld''.  The puppeteers thought it difficult, though, to conceive of their being represented by human characters.\n\nBrutus, who speaks in verse, fills the role of Ubu's vicious henchman, stealing away with him to carry out atrocities: \"Their culpability is indivisible.\"<ref name=\"Jones and Kohler 2007, p. xvi\"/>  Each of its heads had its own character: one was a foot soldier, the other a general and the last a politician.  The body was created out of an old briefcase given Sir Sydney Kentridge (William's [[activism|activist]]-[[lawyer]] father) by [[Braam Fischer]].  Similarly, the crocodile's belly was a canvas kit bag previously the possession of Basil Jones's father during [[military service]] in [[North Africa]].  The scheme of using bags for bodies served to provide a suitable of place of hiding for Ubu, an easy place of discovery for his wife and an ideal place for Ubu to plant incriminatory evidence by which he could distance himself from their crimes.\n\nRather uniquely,<ref>In late September 1998, admittedly, when the play put in an afternoon appearance at the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]], [[Los Angeles]], it was followed the same evening by Teatro Hugo & Ines of [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (a country quite [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|familiar]] with the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission|TRC]] concept), which employed the same technique.</ref> ''Ubu and the Truth Commission'' allowed its puppeteers free and undisguised reign over the stage, and took advantage of the potential for interaction between them and their puppets.  It was agreed early on in the play's conception that the TRC witnesses would be represented by puppets with their speaking manipulators visible next to them, for that was almost always the case with Handspring.  \"When [...] Basil Jones, Adrian Kohler and Louis Seboko hold the hands of the puppet characters in some of the most intense moments of 'Ubu and the Truth Commission,'\" wrote Segal, \"it seems as much an act of consolation as the method by which the large, carved doll-figures are made to gesture.\"<ref name=\"Segal 1998\"/>\n\nThe play retains a great deal of its ancestor's scatology, opening, for example, with the word \"Pschitt!\",<ref>Read \"Shit!\"  (Taylor, 2007, p. 1)</ref> whose French equivalent, \"Merdre!\", invoked a riot at Jarry's premier in 1896.  \"'Ubu and the Truth Commission' dramatizes the politics of betrayal so graphically,\" opined Segal, \"that it eminently deserves its adults-only designation.\"<ref name=\"Segal 1998\"/>\n\n== Protagonist ==\nOf her main character and his role in the play, Taylor writes,\n\n<blockquote>Ubu's story is, at one level, a singular story of individual pathology; yet it is at the same time an exemplary account of the relationships between [[capitalism|capitalist ideology]], [[imperialism]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class|class]], and [[gender]], [[religion]] and [[modernization|modernisation]] in the [[southern Africa]]n [[subregion|sub-region]].<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\">Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi.</ref></blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, Ubu retains in this play the [[antihero]] status first accorded him in Jarry's: he is a greedy, sadistic, homicidal, esurient, licentious apartheid police officer.  Set against the TRC, \"[o]ur agent is thus, in a sense, an agent of evil.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. v\">Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. v.</ref>  Taylor justifies this with literary precedents like ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', where [[John Milton]], in [[William Blake]]'s famous phrase, finds himself \"of the [[Devil]]s {{sic}} party\",<ref>Blake c. 1790-1793, p. 6.</ref> her belief that \"[n]arrative depends on agency; the stories of those who 'do' are generally more compelling than those who are 'done to'\",<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\"/> and the nature of the TRC itself, which cast the victims as protagonists and gave little emphasis to other players.\n\nThere was also, according to Taylor, another reason: \"he provoked us.  He is familiar but wholly foreign, he is both human and inhuman. He is the limit term which was used to keep an entire system of meaning in place, from its most extreme to its most banal.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\"/>  \"You may not sympathize with the character,\" wrote Triplett, \"but in the end you don't hate him either; instead you are left with the feeling that reconciliation just might be possible.\"<ref name=\"Triplett 1998\"/>\n\nAlthough the play appropriates Jarry's agonist to the context of the TRC, it retains his archaic language and original slang, anachronising him as \"a figure who lives within a world of remote forms and meanings\".<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\"/>  Ubu does not represent any particular figure in South African history; rather, he is \"an aspect, a tendency, an excuse\".<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\"/>  Often, though, he speaks in voices reminiscent of those sounded at the TRC, his language set against its languages.  As Taylor observes,\n\n<blockquote>The archaic and artificial language which Ubu uses, with its [[rhyme]]s, its [[pun]]s, its bombast and its [[profanity|profanities]], is set against the detailed and careful descriptions of the witness accounts which have been, in large measure, transcribed from TRC hearings.  Ubu is confronted within his own home by those whom he has assaulted.<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\"/></blockquote>\n\nIt is the structure of the play, according to its writer, merging Ubu legend with the ongoing Truth Commission, that gives it its meaning, with patent theatrical consequences:\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps most evidently, we are automatically taking on the burden of the farcical genre which Jarry used. I remember having lengthy debates, with a student, about the ethics of [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s  ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', and whether one could ever explore human rights abuses through a burlesque idiom. My responses now are perhaps more complex than they were then.<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. v\"/></blockquote>\n\nTaylor also noted that, in modern times of vast informational overloading, it was difficult always to respond, as expected, \"with outrage, sympathy, or wonder, within a context that inculcates bewilderment and dislocation.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. v\"/>  Her play, then, sought to reproduce the ambiguous nature of response to suffering:\n\n<blockquote>Our own reactions are questioned, because, after all, what is it in us that makes us seek out the stories of another's grief?  Or, even more problematically, what makes us follow the stories of the torturers?  We follow Ubu's history, are drawn into his family drama, are confronted with his logics of self-justification.  We as audience are also implicated because we laugh at his sometimes absurd antics, and this very laughter accuses us.<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. v\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhile its focus is obviously South African, its application, according to Taylor, is broad in scope: \"We in the late twentieth century live in an era of singular attention to questions of war crimes, reparations, global 'peace-keeping'. We are, it seems, increasingly aware of the obligation to hear testimony, even while we may yet be determining how to act upon what we have heard.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer 2007\"/>  Segal agreed:\n\n<blockquote>Although the work should be a jolt for many Africa-watchers \u2014 offering a portrait of post-apartheid Mandela-land as anything but the best of all possible worlds \u2014 its key issues resonate far from that continent.  Like Americans during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] scandals, for instance, Mrs. Ubu (Busi Zokufa) fixates on accusations of sexual excess, not imagining that her lord and master might be committing bigger crimes; when she learns the truth, she immediately turns those crimes into media gold.<ref name=\"Segal 1998\"/></blockquote>\n\n== Reception ==\nIn South African circles, the play was well received.  ''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]'' dubbed it a \"multi-dimensional theatre piece which tries to make sense of the madness which overtook South Africa during apartheid\", while [[Mark Gevisser]] predicted in ''The Sunday Independent'' that it \"will be for post-apartheid theatre what ''[[Woza Albert!|Woza Albert]]'' was for protest theatre: a touchstone of artful, affecting political engagement\".<ref>Quoted in Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, blurb.</ref>\n\nIn Los Angeles, Segal was all praise: \"Director and animator William Kentridge skillfully {{sic}} integrates the movement of actors and puppets with his often startling animated chalk-drawings and live-action imagery projected at the back of the stage.  'Ubu' may be unrelievedly depressing, but it is executed with consummate artistry.\"<ref name=\"Segal 1998\"/>\n\nIn ''[[The Washington Post]]'', after viewing the play during a \"regrettably brief\" run of four performances at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], William Triplett described it to readers as a \"stunningly theatrical multimedia piece that drives home the atrocity known as apartheid without ever uttering the words 'atrocity' or 'apartheid' or any like them.  By turns chilling and hilarious, brutal and forgiving, the show casts a surreal light on the heart of darkness \u2014 and still manages to leave you with hope [...].  'Ubu' is one of those rarities, a piece of political theater that transcends politics.  Its truth is human, but you can hear it only from the mouths of puppets.\"<ref name=\"Triplett 1998\"/>\n\nIt was widely agreed that Dawid Minnaar and Busi Zokufa gave fair and accurate portrayals of Taylor's Ubus.  \"Minnaar and Zokufa give performances that are wonderfully alive in this tale of death and redemption,\" wrote Triplett.  \"Minnaar deserves a special ovation, since Taylor didn't write Pa Ubu as a monster, and Minnaar doesn't play him as one [...].<ref name=\"Tiplett 1998\">Tiplett 1998.</ref>\n\nGeneral production values, too, were lauded: \"The dynamic sound, by Wilbert Schubel, is as complex as the entire range of emotions spanned by the show.  Wesley France's lighting sometimes sweeps the bare stage, and other times pinpoints a small area, expanding and contracting focus when necessary.\"<ref name=\"Tiplett 1998\"/>\n\nAfter one performance, a [[Romanians|Romanian]] woman, deeply moved by what she had seen, approached the cast to congratulate it.  Surprise was expressed that a play of such local context could have been accessible to her.  \"That's it,\" she explained.  \"It is so local.  So local.  This play is written about [[Romania]].\"<ref>Kentridge 2007, p. xv.</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n*'''Director:''' William Kentridge\n*'''Writer:''' Jane Taylor\n*'''Pa Ubu:''' Dawid Minnaar\n*'''Ma Ubu:''' Busi Zokufa\n*'''Puppet characters:''' Basil Jones, Adrian Kohler, Louis Seboko, Busi Zokufa\n*'''Stage manager and video operator:''' Bruce Koch\n*'''Sound technician:''' Simon Mahoney\n*'''Company and tour manager:''' Wesley France\n*'''Animation:''' William Kentridge\n*'''Assistant animators:''' Tau Qwelane, Suzie Gable\n*'''Choreography:''' Robin Orlin\n*'''Puppet master:''' Adrian Kohler\n*'''Assistant puppet maker:''' Tau Qwelane\n*'''Music:''' [[Warrick Sony]], Brendan Jury\n*'''TRC research:''' [[Antjie Krog]]\n*'''Lighting design:''' Wesley France\n*'''Sound design:''' Wilbert Schubel\n*'''Film editor:''' Catherine Meyburgh\n*'''Film and video research:''' Gail Behrmann\n*'''Costumes:''' Adrian Kohler, Sue Steele\n*'''Set design:''' William Kentridge, Adrian Kohler\n*'''Production coordinator:''' Basil Jones\n*'''Production:''' Art Bureau (Munich), Kunstfest (Weimar), Migros Kulturprozent (Switzerland), Nieders\u00e4chsisches Staatstheater Hannover, The Standard Bank National Arts Festival, the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology and the Market Theatre Foundation.\n\n== Publication ==\n''Ubu and the Truth Commission'' was first published in book-form in 1998 by the University of Cape Town Press and has since undergone three reprints.

It fuses the chaos of the Ubu legend with original testimony from witnesses at the post-[[apartheid]] [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC).\n\n== The TRC ==\nIn her \"Writer's Note\" to the 2007 book-form publication of the play, Taylor wrote,\n\n<blockquote>What has engaged me as I have followed the Commission, is the way in which individual narratives come to stand for the larger national narrative.  The stories of personal grief, loss, triumph and violation now stand as an account of South Africa's recent past.  History and autobiography merge.  This marks a significant shift, because in the past decades of popular resistance, personal suffering was eclipsed \u2014 subordinated to a larger project of mass liberation.  Now, however, we hear in individual testimony the very private patterns of language and thought that structure memory and mourning.  ''Ubu and the Truth Commission'' uses these circumstances as a starting point.<ref>Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. iii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established in 1996 with what Taylor described as a \"momentous mandate\",<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. ii\">Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. ii.</ref> to solicit testimony from those who considered themselves casualties, perpetrators or survivors of the apartheid atrocity.  Coming almost exactly two years after [[South African general election, 1994|South Africa's first democratic elections]], the Commission's purposes, in Taylor's eyes, were \"to retrieve lost histories, to make reparation to those who had suffered, to provide amnesty for acts which were demonstrably political in purpose [... and, among the most important] to create a general context through which national reconciliation might be made possible.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. ii\"/>\n\n\"The Commission itself is theatre,\" wrote William Kentridge, \"or at any rate a kind of ur-theatre [...].  One by one witnesses come and have their half hour to tell their story, pause, weep, be comforted by professional comforters who sit at the table with them.  The stories are harrowing, spellbinding.  The audience sit at the edge of their seats listening to every word.  This is exemplary civic theatre, a public hearing of private griefs which are absorbed into the body politic as a part of a deeper understanding of how the society arrived at its present position.\"<ref>Kentridge 2007, pp. viii-ix.  Of how more orthodox forms could possibly compete with this, he explained, \"Our theatre is a reflection on the debate rather than the debate itself.  It tries to make sense of the memory rather than be the memory.\"  (Kentridge 2007, p. ix)</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nPa Ubu (played by Dawid Minnaar) has been spending a great deal of time away from home, much to the concern and suspicion of his wife (Busi Zokufa), who smells on him an odour which she suspects may be that of a mistress.  In truth, however, he is an agent of a governmental death squad, and the odour that she smells is of blood and dynamite.\n\nWith the abolition of apartheid, the TRC is set in motion.  Amnesty is offered those war criminals who come forward and offer full and truthful testimony regarding their infractions.  Ubu, suspecting a trick, is unsure of what to do.  The play follows his indecisive actions as they lead his path finally to a convergence with that of the TRC.\n\n== Conception, production and performance ==\nKentridge had been working for some years with the Handspring Puppet Company in Johannesburg before the idea for ''Ubu and the Truth Commission'' was mooted, and had extensive experience of theatre that incorporated animation, puppets and actors.  He did not, he claimed, pursue the multimedia realm because of any aesthetic ideal, but rather because he was skilled in the art of animation anyway and was curious to see how it would combine with puppet theatre.   ''Woyzeck on the Highveld'' (1993) and ''Faustus in Africa'' (1996) were successful tone-setters in this respect.  The latter, according to Kentridge, was \"a huge undertaking\",<ref>Kentridge 2007, p. ix.</ref> after which he and the company were on the look-out merely for something small to \"do and survive\".<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\">Kentridge 2007, p. x.</ref>  [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' seemed ideally suited to puppetry, \"[b]ut we reckoned without the Beckett fundamentalists who would not give permission for us to leave out even a comma from the stage directions\".<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\"/>  In a bid to secure a neo-Becketian text (but not having the skill to write their own), and after rejecting several ideas, they considered a project called ''Waiting Room'', which would comprise interviews with [[land mine|land-mine]] victims waiting in rural orthopaedic hospitals in [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]].\n\nAt the time, Kentridge happened to be etching a series of pieces for an exhibition in honour of the centenary of ''Ubu Roi'''s opening appearance in [[Paris]]ian theatre.  They concerned a naked man in front of a blackboard on which were drawings of Ubu, \"with his pointed head and belly spiral\".<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\"/>  Kentridge intended when the etchings were complete to animate the chalk drawings, which led him to the natural conclusion that the naked man might as well be animated, too.  He asked a friend in [[choreography]] if she would care to have a dancer in front of screen on which a \"schematic line drawing\"<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\"/> of Ubu was to move about.\n\nWhen Kentridge realised that he could not immerse himself in both the Ubu and the ''Waiting Room'' projects simultaneously, he panicked and chose to combine the two.  When the TRC took off, it became clear that he need look no further in his hunt for material, for \"an avalanche\"<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\"/> was streaming in every day.  While he went about convincing the two parties to come together, he formed an ever-clearer picture of how the two could complement one another.  The grave documentary material from the TRC could lend to the rampant burlesque, \"which always had a danger of becoming merely amusing\",<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. x\"/> a certain dignity and sobriety, while the untamed liberty which characterised ''Ubu Roi'' could shed new light and offer a fresh and lively perspective on the depressing affairs of the TRC.\n\nLooking at the play retrospectively, Kentridge did not feel that its shoddy provenance had maledicted it; rather it had accorded its writer, director and producers a gradually compounding platform on which they could \"find pieces of the play, images, literary conceits, changing physical metaphors that we would never have arrived at if we had started from a sober beginning\".<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xi\">Kentridge 2007, p. xi.</ref>\n\n\"There is,\" wrote Taylor of ''Ubu Roi'' and its main character's madness, \"a particular kind of pleasure for an audience watching these infantile attacks.  Part of the satisfaction arises from the fact that in the burlesque mode which Jarry invents, there is no place for consequence.  While Ubu may be relentless in his political aspirations, and brutal in his personal relations, he apparently has no measurable effect upon those who inhabit the farcical world which he creates around himself.  He thus acts out our most childish rages and desires, in which we seek to gratify ourselves at all cost.  It is this feature in particular which has informed our own production.\"<ref>Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, pp. iii-iv.</ref>\n\nDeeply affected as she viewed the TRC's proceedings by the frequency of the atrocities and the negligence and ignorance with which so many of them were carried out, Taylor noted that \"those perpetrators who seem to have some capacity for remorse, appear to be shocked at observing, as if from the outside, the effect of their behaviour.  Others simply show no response at all, so profound is the denial, or the failure of moral imagination.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. iv\">Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. iv.</ref>  It was thus her endeavour to pluck Ubu from the world of burlesque and action without consequence, and drop him in one altogether different: \"It is as if Cause and Effect are registered through different modes of expression in the play [...].\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. iv\"/>\n\n=== Puppetry ===\nThe play's conception began in earnest with a meeting between Taylor, Kentridge, Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler, who all agreed in principle to employ Ubu as a vehicle for exploring the TRC.  Near the end of 1996, Taylor attended numerous workshops with the Handspring Puppet Company and grew to appreciate the actors' capacities and the style of puppet theatre.  Also discussed were such transcendental devices as the three-headed hound and the embrace of various hybrid forms of animation and puppetry: drawn figures were hand-controlled and filmed on a sequential frame-by-frame basis.  Taylor later confessed that her writing was greatly informed not only by Kentridge's direction but also by these experiences,<ref>\"Further,\" she wrote, \"this theatre company brings a performance style of great expressive care to the characters, an element which has determined what kinds of testimony have been appropriate for inclusion.\"  (Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vii)</ref> and believed that her colleagues were similarly inspired and edified. \n\nTaylor came to see great significance in the figurative role of the puppet, for its every motion was, in essence, tropical:\n\n<blockquote>The puppet draws attention to its own artifice, and we as audience willingly submit ourselves to the ambiguous processes that at once deny and assert the reality of what we watch.  Puppets also declare that they are being \"spoken through\".  They thus very poignantly and compellingly capture complex relations of testimony, translation and documentation apparent in the processes of the Commission itself.<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer 2007\">Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was early on in the workshops that the decision was taken as a finality to have Ma and Pa Ubu played by orthodox histrions.  \"These characters thus exist, as it were, on one scale,\" wrote Taylor.  \"The witnesses, who are represented by puppet-figures, exist on another scale, and a great deal of their meaning arises out of this fact.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer 2007\"/>  Lewis Segal, writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', declared that the puppets incarnated \"a helpless nobility in the face of great suffering\", while noting that they represented only \"a kind of supplement to a [[neo-expressionism|neo-Expressionist]] theatrical experience that the company defines primarily with human actors and film animation\".<ref name=\"Segal 1998\">Segal 1998.</ref>\n\n=== Testimonials ===\nIn tackling the matter of how to portray TRC testimonials on stage, the first question was, according to Kentridge, an ethical one:<ref>Admittedly, it had been known from the beginning that Pa and Ma Ubu would be portrayed as humans, for the original, pre-project-merging intention had been for human dancing.  The witnesses, similarly, were always going to be portrayed as puppets, as that was the premise of ''Waiting Room''.  \"The more honourable route to the decision about performance style,\" wrote Kentridge later, \"is a justification after the event.\" (Kentridge 2007, p. xi)</ref> \"what is our responsibility to the people whose stories we are using as raw fodder for the play?\"<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xi\"/>  He was uncomfortable with using \"real\" actors for the reason of \"the audience being caught halfway between having to believe in the actor for the sake of the story, and also not believe in the actor for the sake of the actual witness who existed out there but was not the actor\".<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xi\"/>  Using a puppet, on the other hand, would leave the audience with no reason to believe that the puppet or puppeteer represented an actual witness: \"The difference between the materials of which a puppet is made and human flesh,\" wrote Jones and Kohler, \"can break the illusion that both exist in the same moment.\"<ref>Kohler and Jones 2007, p. xvii.</ref>  Kentridge confirmed that \"[t]he puppet becomes a medium through which the testimony can be heard.\"<ref>Kentridge 2007, p. xi.  \"In so far as I have a polemic,\" he elucidated, \"it is this: to trust in the inauthentic, the contingent, the practical as a way of arriving at meaning.\"</ref>\n\nJones and Kohler, head puppeteers alongside Louis Seboko, elaborated:\n\n<blockquote>Their responsibility in the play is both central and extremely onerous, as their task is to re-enact the deeply harrowing personal accounts of the effect of the former [[National Party (South Africa)|Apartheid State]] on people's lives.  Badly handled, such stories could easily become a kind of horror [[pornography]].  The puppets assist in mediating this horror.  They are not actors playing a role.  Rather, they are wooden<ref>They explained elsewhere that the wood's rough sculpture made the faces and facial expressions, especially when it came to looking up, down or forward, far easier to illume.</ref> dolls attempting to be real people.  As they attempt to move and breathe as we do, they cross the barrier of the here and now and become metaphors for humanity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Kohler and Jones 2007, pp. xvi-xvii.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEach puppet was given two puppeteers, which bestowed upon it a metaphorical element of vulnerability, while also calling to mind the professional comforters who accompanied witnesses during TRC proceedings.  These worked together to divide and cut down individual control over the puppet's movement and speech.  \"This,\" explained Jones and Kohler, \"encourages us to enter into the illusion that the puppet has a life and responsibility of its own. But the fact that the manipulators are present also allows us to use the emotions visible in the puppeteers' faces to inform our understanding of the emotions of the puppet character, with its immobile features [...].  Puppets are brought to life by the conviction of the puppeteer and the willingness of the audience.  When an actor plays opposite a puppet, she or he participates in the same process.  There can be no eye contact with the puppeteer.  The actor's focus is solely on the puppet itself.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe endeavour was largely successful.  \"The plain wooden faces of these characters -- handled with enormous skill by Basil Jones, Adrian Kohler and Louis Seboko -- confer a power and credibility on their words that real actors could never achieve,\" wrote crici William Triplett.  \"In such scenes actors will try to make you feel what their characters have witnessed.  But an expressionless puppet, especially one 'speaking' the unspeakable through one of the commission's monotoned translators, engages the imagination awesomely.\"<ref name=\"Triplett 1998\">Triplett 1998.</ref>\n\nThe company was especially pleased with the decision to make use of witness-puppets because of the fact that the commission often had a translator to complement each testifier: \"Two speakers for the same story and our puppets need two manipulators,\" as Kentridge put it.  \"One manipulator could tell the story in Zulu and the other could translate.\"<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xii\">Kentridge 2007, p. xii.</ref>  This did not work, however, as the stories could not be heard, so the translators were placed instead in Ubu's shower, which served as a sort of booth, and difference was made between the authentic witness voice and the contrived public address of the interlingual rendition.\n\nA significant challenge to the skills of the puppeteers (especially those controlling the witnesses) came in the form of manipulating them at the right pace, a pace usually rather more sluggish than that of a normal actor, for it was important that the audience see precisely what it was that the puppet was doing.  The puppeteers worked extensively with their figures to determine this, while also settling on specific moments of physical contact between puppet and orthodox human actor.\n\nAn even greater challenge that the decision to employ witness-puppets presented was how to achieve a balance between the put-upon placidity of the witnesses and the delirious burlesque of Ma and Pa Ubu.  \"When the play is working at its best,\" wrote Kentridge, \"Pa Ubu does not hold back.  He tries to colonise the stage and be the sole focus of the audience.  And it is the task of the actors and manipulators of the puppets to wrest that attention back.  This battle is extremely delicate.  If pushed too hard there is the danger of the witnesses becoming strident, pathetic, self pitying.  If they retreat too far they are swamped by Ubu.  But sometimes, in a good performance, and with a willing audience we do make the witnesses stories clearly heard and also throw them into a wider set of questions that Ubu engenders around them.\"<ref>Kentridge 2007, p. xiv.</ref>  Although the witness puppets were never to be seen by Ubu and his wife \u2014 they were situated in close spatial proximity to Ubu, behind his furniture, but made to appear elsewhere \u2014, their actions had a direct bearing upon them.\n\nThe most important upshot of the decision was that witnesses could now show up in manifold nooks of Ubu's life, not merely (as had originally been intended) in the witness stand.  It also engendered an experimental scene in which Ubu lies on a table looking up in a dream at a puppet as it testifies about its child's demise.  It was tried initially with the witness behind Ubu's hips, so that his body formed a rolling landscape with a small rise from behind which the witness gave testimony.  When the same scene was tried with the witness behind his head, it became evident that the best way to go would be turn the witness into a dream, and the story became Ubu's confession.  Kentridge recalled,\n\n<blockquote>We put the witness behind Ubu's legs again and he was back in the landscape. We then tried to see how close the puppet could get to touching Ubu without breaking the double image. Extremely close we found. And then we tried it with the witness touching Ubu's hip with its wooden hand. An extraordinary thing happened. What we saw was an act of absolution. The witness forgave, even comforted Ubu for his act. These were a series of wholly unexpected meanings, generated not through clarity of thought, or brilliance of invention, but through practical theatre work. This is the second polemic I would make. A faith in a practical epistemology in the theatre-trusting in and using the artifices and techniques of theatre to generate meaning.<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xii\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe opposite was also true, however, as in his idea of a dancer before an image-bearing screen.  Both the dancer and the image were to be seen together, generating an elaborate figure, but it became obvious within twenty minutes of starting the project that, \"[f]or reasons of synchronisation, parallax, lighting, [and] stilted performance\", it was incompatible.  \"Next polemic - Mistrust of Good Ideas in the abstract.  Mistrust of starting with a knowledge of the meaning of an image and thinking it can then be executed.  There is for me more than an accidental linguistic connection between ''executing'' an idea and ''killing'' it.\"<ref name=\"Kentridge 2007, p. xii\"/>\n\nThroughout the play, and specifically when Ubu feels insecure about being found out, an animated eye, intercut with a real one in classic Kentridge fashion, emerges on the screen to convey the sense that the main character is not quite so alone as he would like to think.  The screen was used repeatedly and effectively in Kentridge's production.  \"[I]n every instance the images are more suggestive than real,\" wrote Triplett, \"and hence more powerful.\"<ref name=\"Triplett 1998\"/>\n\n=== Allusions and symbolism ===\nSeveral of the play's marionettes carry allusions to the work of Jarry: the Palcontents of ''Ubu Cocu'', the protagonist's \"manic acts of mayhem\",<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer 2007\"/> find representation as lethal and destructive vices in Taylor's play with a three-headed [[dog]].\n\nFor symbolism more in keeping with the TRC, meanwhile, Kentridge was keen on including a paper shredder.  \"In South Africa at the moment,\" he explained, \"there is a battle between the paper shredders and the photostat machines.  For each police general who is shredding documents of his past there are officers under him who are Photostatting them to keep as insurance against future prosecutions.<ref>Kentridge 2007, p. viii.</ref>  A normal machine, however, did not seem especially creative, so, after abandoning representative bread-slicers (in view of the palling thought of wasted dough), animated projections (in view of Kentridge's reluctance to spend hours drawing them) and the dog's mouth (in view of its narrowness), they settled on a [[crocodile]]'s mouth, to be carried as a handbag by Ubu's wife.  This crocodile, then, played the role not only of Ma Ubu's handbag; it was Pa Ubu's pet advisor and cover-up man, too, concealing incriminatory evidence in his mouth .\n\nThree puppet-types, then \u2014 the [[vulture]], the witnesses, and Brutus the dog and Niles [[crocodile]] \u2014, were created.  It was, claimed the puppeteers, \"a fairly organic process\",<ref name=\"Jones and Kohler 2007, p. xvi\">Jones and Kohler 2007, p. xvi.</ref> undertaken in accordance with the play's requirements.  Each puppet-type had a unique and particular affiliation with Ma and Pa Ubu.  The vulture, limited in its actions, was placed near the rear of the stage, where sporadically it offered sardonic aphorisms through a series of electronically contrived squawks that were translated on the screen behind it.  \"Thus,\" wrote the puppeteers, \"it is a form of [[wikt:manipulate|manipulation]]: like gears driven by motors which in turn are driven by a remote [[technician]] \u2014 which is appropriate to its function in the play \u2014 an apparently [[author]]less automaton spewing forth programmed truisms.\"<ref name=\"Jones and Kohler 2007, p. xvi\"/>\n\nThe crocodile was given but one manipulator to the dog's one for each head.  They moved about freely and in the same space as the human characters, rather than being restricted in the traditional playboard sense seen in such earlier plays as ''Woyzeck on the Highveld''.  The puppeteers thought it difficult, though, to conceive of their being represented by human characters.\n\nBrutus, who speaks in verse, fills the role of Ubu's vicious henchman, stealing away with him to carry out atrocities: \"Their culpability is indivisible.\"<ref name=\"Jones and Kohler 2007, p. xvi\"/>  Each of its heads had its own character: one was a foot soldier, the other a general and the last a politician.  The body was created out of an old briefcase given Sir Sydney Kentridge (William's [[activism|activist]]-[[lawyer]] father) by [[Braam Fischer]].  Similarly, the crocodile's belly was a canvas kit bag previously the possession of Basil Jones's father during [[military service]] in [[North Africa]].  The scheme of using bags for bodies served to provide a suitable of place of hiding for Ubu, an easy place of discovery for his wife and an ideal place for Ubu to plant incriminatory evidence by which he could distance himself from their crimes.\n\nRather uniquely,<ref>In late September 1998, admittedly, when the play put in an afternoon appearance at the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]], [[Los Angeles]], it was followed the same evening by Teatro Hugo & Ines of [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (a country quite [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|familiar]] with the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission|TRC]] concept), which employed the same technique.</ref> ''Ubu and the Truth Commission'' allowed its puppeteers free and undisguised reign over the stage, and took advantage of the potential for interaction between them and their puppets.  It was agreed early on in the play's conception that the TRC witnesses would be represented by puppets with their speaking manipulators visible next to them, for that was almost always the case with Handspring.  \"When [...] Basil Jones, Adrian Kohler and Louis Seboko hold the hands of the puppet characters in some of the most intense moments of 'Ubu and the Truth Commission,'\" wrote Segal, \"it seems as much an act of consolation as the method by which the large, carved doll-figures are made to gesture.\"<ref name=\"Segal 1998\"/>\n\nThe play retains a great deal of its ancestor's scatology, opening, for example, with the word \"Pschitt!\",<ref>Read \"Shit!\"  (Taylor, 2007, p. 1)</ref> whose French equivalent, \"Merdre!\", invoked a riot at Jarry's premier in 1896.  \"'Ubu and the Truth Commission' dramatizes the politics of betrayal so graphically,\" opined Segal, \"that it eminently deserves its adults-only designation.\"<ref name=\"Segal 1998\"/>\n\n== Protagonist ==\nOf her main character and his role in the play, Taylor writes,\n\n<blockquote>Ubu's story is, at one level, a singular story of individual pathology; yet it is at the same time an exemplary account of the relationships between [[capitalism|capitalist ideology]], [[imperialism]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class|class]], and [[gender]], [[religion]] and [[modernization|modernisation]] in the [[southern Africa]]n [[subregion|sub-region]].<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\">Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi.</ref></blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, Ubu retains in this play the [[antihero]] status first accorded him in Jarry's: he is a greedy, sadistic, homicidal, esurient, licentious apartheid police officer.  Set against the TRC, \"[o]ur agent is thus, in a sense, an agent of evil.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. v\">Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. v.</ref>  Taylor justifies this with literary precedents like ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', where [[John Milton]], in [[William Blake]]'s famous phrase, finds himself \"of the [[Devil]]s {{sic}} party\",<ref>Blake c. 1790-1793, p. 6.</ref> her belief that \"[n]arrative depends on agency; the stories of those who 'do' are generally more compelling than those who are 'done to'\",<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\"/> and the nature of the TRC itself, which cast the victims as protagonists and gave little emphasis to other players.\n\nThere was also, according to Taylor, another reason: \"he provoked us.  He is familiar but wholly foreign, he is both human and inhuman. He is the limit term which was used to keep an entire system of meaning in place, from its most extreme to its most banal.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\"/>  \"You may not sympathize with the character,\" wrote Triplett, \"but in the end you don't hate him either; instead you are left with the feeling that reconciliation just might be possible.\"<ref name=\"Triplett 1998\"/>\n\nAlthough the play appropriates Jarry's agonist to the context of the TRC, it retains his archaic language and original slang, anachronising him as \"a figure who lives within a world of remote forms and meanings\".<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\"/>  Ubu does not represent any particular figure in South African history; rather, he is \"an aspect, a tendency, an excuse\".<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\"/>  Often, though, he speaks in voices reminiscent of those sounded at the TRC, his language set against its languages.  As Taylor observes,\n\n<blockquote>The archaic and artificial language which Ubu uses, with its [[rhyme]]s, its [[pun]]s, its bombast and its [[profanity|profanities]], is set against the detailed and careful descriptions of the witness accounts which have been, in large measure, transcribed from TRC hearings.  Ubu is confronted within his own home by those whom he has assaulted.<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. vi\"/></blockquote>\n\nIt is the structure of the play, according to its writer, merging Ubu legend with the ongoing Truth Commission, that gives it its meaning, with patent theatrical consequences:\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps most evidently, we are automatically taking on the burden of the farcical genre which Jarry used. I remember having lengthy debates, with a student, about the ethics of [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s  ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', and whether one could ever explore human rights abuses through a burlesque idiom. My responses now are perhaps more complex than they were then.<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. v\"/></blockquote>\n\nTaylor also noted that, in modern times of vast informational overloading, it was difficult always to respond, as expected, \"with outrage, sympathy, or wonder, within a context that inculcates bewilderment and dislocation.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. v\"/>  Her play, then, sought to reproduce the ambiguous nature of response to suffering:\n\n<blockquote>Our own reactions are questioned, because, after all, what is it in us that makes us seek out the stories of another's grief?  Or, even more problematically, what makes us follow the stories of the torturers?  We follow Ubu's history, are drawn into his family drama, are confronted with his logics of self-justification.  We as audience are also implicated because we laugh at his sometimes absurd antics, and this very laughter accuses us.<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, p. v\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhile its focus is obviously South African, its application, according to Taylor, is broad in scope: \"We in the late twentieth century live in an era of singular attention to questions of war crimes, reparations, global 'peace-keeping'. We are, it seems, increasingly aware of the obligation to hear testimony, even while we may yet be determining how to act upon what we have heard.\"<ref name=\"Taylor, Writer 2007\"/>  Segal agreed:\n\n<blockquote>Although the work should be a jolt for many Africa-watchers \u2014 offering a portrait of post-apartheid Mandela-land as anything but the best of all possible worlds \u2014 its key issues resonate far from that continent.  Like Americans during the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] scandals, for instance, Mrs. Ubu (Busi Zokufa) fixates on accusations of sexual excess, not imagining that her lord and master might be committing bigger crimes; when she learns the truth, she immediately turns those crimes into media gold.<ref name=\"Segal 1998\"/></blockquote>\n\n== Reception ==\nIn South African circles, the play was well received.  ''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]'' dubbed it a \"multi-dimensional theatre piece which tries to make sense of the madness which overtook South Africa during apartheid\", while [[Mark Gevisser]] predicted in ''The Sunday Independent'' that it \"will be for post-apartheid theatre what ''[[Woza Albert!|Woza Albert]]'' was for protest theatre: a touchstone of artful, affecting political engagement\".<ref>Quoted in Taylor, Writer's Note 2007, blurb.</ref>\n\nIn Los Angeles, Segal was all praise: \"Director and animator William Kentridge skillfully {{sic}} integrates the movement of actors and puppets with his often startling animated chalk-drawings and live-action imagery projected at the back of the stage.  'Ubu' may be unrelievedly depressing, but it is executed with consummate artistry.\"<ref name=\"Segal 1998\"/>\n\nIn ''[[The Washington Post]]'', after viewing the play during a \"regrettably brief\" run of four performances at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], William Triplett described it to readers as a \"stunningly theatrical multimedia piece that drives home the atrocity known as apartheid without ever uttering the words 'atrocity' or 'apartheid' or any like them.  By turns chilling and hilarious, brutal and forgiving, the show casts a surreal light on the heart of darkness \u2014 and still manages to leave you with hope [...].  'Ubu' is one of those rarities, a piece of political theater that transcends politics.  Its truth is human, but you can hear it only from the mouths of puppets.\"<ref name=\"Triplett 1998\"/>\n\nIt was widely agreed that Dawid Minnaar and Busi Zokufa gave fair and accurate portrayals of Taylor's Ubus.  \"Minnaar and Zokufa give performances that are wonderfully alive in this tale of death and redemption,\" wrote Triplett.  \"Minnaar deserves a special ovation, since Taylor didn't write Pa Ubu as a monster, and Minnaar doesn't play him as one [...].<ref name=\"Tiplett 1998\">Tiplett 1998.</ref>\n\nGeneral production values, too, were lauded: \"The dynamic sound, by Wilbert Schubel, is as complex as the entire range of emotions spanned by the show.  Wesley France's lighting sometimes sweeps the bare stage, and other times pinpoints a small area, expanding and contracting focus when necessary.\"<ref name=\"Tiplett 1998\"/>\n\nAfter one performance, a [[Romanians|Romanian]] woman, deeply moved by what she had seen, approached the cast to congratulate it.  Surprise was expressed that a play of such local context could have been accessible to her.  \"That's it,\" she explained.  \"It is so local.  So local.  This play is written about [[Romania]].\"<ref>Kentridge 2007, p. xv.</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n*'''Director:''' William Kentridge\n*'''Writer:''' Jane Taylor\n*'''Pa Ubu:''' Dawid Minnaar\n*'''Ma Ubu:''' Busi Zokufa\n*'''Puppet characters:''' Basil Jones, Adrian Kohler, Louis Seboko, Busi Zokufa\n*'''Stage manager and video operator:''' Bruce Koch\n*'''Sound technician:''' Simon Mahoney\n*'''Company and tour manager:''' Wesley France\n*'''Animation:''' William Kentridge\n*'''Assistant animators:''' Tau Qwelane, Suzie Gable\n*'''Choreography:''' Robin Orlin\n*'''Puppet master:''' Adrian Kohler\n*'''Assistant puppet maker:''' Tau Qwelane\n*'''Music:''' [[Warrick Sony]], Brendan Jury\n*'''TRC research:''' [[Antjie Krog]]\n*'''Lighting design:''' Wesley France\n*'''Sound design:''' Wilbert Schubel\n*'''Film editor:''' Catherine Meyburgh\n*'''Film and video research:''' Gail Behrmann\n*'''Costumes:''' Adrian Kohler, Sue Steele\n*'''Set design:''' William Kentridge, Adrian Kohler\n*'''Production coordinator:''' Basil Jones\n*'''Production:''' Art Bureau (Munich), Kunstfest (Weimar), Migros Kulturprozent (Switzerland), Nieders\u00e4chsisches Staatstheater Hannover, The Standard Bank National Arts Festival, the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology and the Market Theatre Foundation.\n\n== Publication ==\n''Ubu and the Truth Commission'' was first published in book-form in 1998 by the University of Cape Town Press and has since undergone three reprints.

They are set in, or inspired by, the [[shared universe]] of the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU film franchise]].\n\nThe MCU first expanded to television after the creation of [[Marvel Television]] in 2010, with that studio producing 12 series alongside [[ABC Studios]] and its production division [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]]. These premiered across broadcast, streaming, and cable television on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Netflix]] and [[Hulu]], and [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], respectively. The main ABC series were inspired by the films and featured film characters, and were referred to as the \"Marvel Heroes\" series. A connected group of series for Netflix were called the \"Marvel Knights\" series, and crossed over with each other. [[Young adult fiction|Young adult]]-focused series were produced for Freeform and Hulu, while the latter also had a group of series called \"Adventure into Fear\" planned before Marvel Television was shut down in December 2019.\n\n[[Marvel Studios]]\u2014the production studio behind the films\u2014began producing their own series for the streaming service [[Disney+]] in 2018, with at least eight series in development. These are focused on supporting characters from the films, have much larger budgets than Marvel Television series, and interconnect with the films in a way that the Marvel Television series did not. Following the end of Marvel Television's series on ABC, that network expressed interest in working with Marvel Studios to produce future broadcast Marvel series.\n\n==Development==\nIn June 2010, [[Marvel Television]] was launched with [[Jeph Loeb]] as head.<ref name=\"TVLaunch\" /> The studio began producing television series inspired by the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film franchise,<ref name=\"DeadlineSHIELDPilot\" /><ref name=\"AtwellAgentCarterTV\"/> though it had to be aware of [[Marvel Studios]]' plans for the films so as not to interfere when introducing someone or something to the universe.<ref name=\"AoSProducersTHR\" /> [[Joss Whedon]], who directed ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012) for Marvel Studios before co-creating ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' for Marvel Television, described the relationship between the MCU television series and films as the series getting \"leftovers\" from the films.<ref name=\"JossScepter\" /> In August 2015, Marvel Studios was integrated into [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] with President [[Kevin Feige]] reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman [[Alan F. Horn|Alan Horn]] instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO [[Isaac Perlmutter]], while Marvel Television remained under Perlmutter's control.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyAug2015\" /> This was seen as widening the existing divide between the Marvel film and television divisions, and making it even less likely that the films would acknowledge the series' events and characters.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyAug2015/Film\" />\n\nBy September 2018, Marvel was developing several limited series for Disney's new streaming service [[Disney+]], to be centered on characters from the MCU films. The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> Loeb stated that Marvel Television would continue to develop new MCU series, including their own Disney+ series.<ref name=\"LoebAug2019\" /> By September 2019, many of Marvel Television's existing series were cancelled or ending, and several developing projects did not move forward. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the industry perception of these events was that Marvel Television was being phased out in favor of the new Marvel Studios series, which had access to well-known MCU characters and much larger budgets than Marvel Television series ever had.<ref name=\"MarvelTVUnclear\" /> A month later, Feige was named Chief Creative Officer of Marvel Entertainment, with Marvel Television moving under Marvel Studios and executives of Marvel Television reporting to Feige.<ref name=\"Oct2019Restructure\" /> At the end of October, Loeb was expected to leave Marvel by the end of the year.<ref name=\"LoebGone\" />\n\nIn December, Feige referred to the Marvel Studios series as \"a new type of cinematic [story] that we haven't done before\", and indicated that he considered them the first MCU stories on television by saying \"for the first time ... the MCU will be on your TV screen at home on Disney+ and interconnect with the movies and go back and forth\".<ref name=\"FeigeInterconnectDec2019\" /> The next day, Marvel Television announced that it would complete work on its existing television series but would stop developing new projects.

based on characters that appear in publications by [[Marvel Comics]]. They are set in, or inspired by, the [[shared universe]] of the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|MCU film franchise]].\n\nThe MCU first expanded to television after the creation of [[Marvel Television]] in 2010, with that studio producing 12 series alongside [[ABC Studios]] and its production division [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]]. These premiered across broadcast, streaming, and cable television on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Netflix]] and [[Hulu]], and [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], respectively. The main ABC series were inspired by the films and featured film characters, and were referred to as the \"Marvel Heroes\" series. A connected group of series for Netflix were called the \"Marvel Knights\" series, and crossed over with each other. [[Young adult fiction|Young adult]]-focused series were produced for Freeform and Hulu, while the latter also had a group of series called \"Adventure into Fear\" planned before Marvel Television was shut down in December 2019.\n\n[[Marvel Studios]]\u2014the production studio behind the films\u2014began producing their own series for the streaming service [[Disney+]] in 2018, with at least eight series in development. These are focused on supporting characters from the films, have much larger budgets than Marvel Television series, and interconnect with the films in a way that the Marvel Television series did not. Following the end of Marvel Television's series on ABC, that network expressed interest in working with Marvel Studios to produce future broadcast Marvel series.\n\n==Development==\nIn June 2010, [[Marvel Television]] was launched with [[Jeph Loeb]] as head.<ref name=\"TVLaunch\" /> The studio began producing television series inspired by the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film franchise,<ref name=\"DeadlineSHIELDPilot\" /><ref name=\"AtwellAgentCarterTV\"/> though it had to be aware of [[Marvel Studios]]' plans for the films so as not to interfere when introducing someone or something to the universe.<ref name=\"AoSProducersTHR\" /> [[Joss Whedon]], who directed ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012) for Marvel Studios before co-creating ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' for Marvel Television, described the relationship between the MCU television series and films as the series getting \"leftovers\" from the films.<ref name=\"JossScepter\" /> In August 2015, Marvel Studios was integrated into [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] with President [[Kevin Feige]] reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman [[Alan F. Horn|Alan Horn]] instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO [[Isaac Perlmutter]], while Marvel Television remained under Perlmutter's control.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyAug2015\" /> This was seen as widening the existing divide between the Marvel film and television divisions, and making it even less likely that the films would acknowledge the series' events and characters.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyAug2015/Film\" />\n\nBy September 2018, Marvel was developing several limited series for Disney's new streaming service [[Disney+]], to be centered on characters from the MCU films. The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> Loeb stated that Marvel Television would continue to develop new MCU series, including their own Disney+ series.<ref name=\"LoebAug2019\" /> By September 2019, many of Marvel Television's existing series were cancelled or ending, and several developing projects did not move forward. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the industry perception of these events was that Marvel Television was being phased out in favor of the new Marvel Studios series, which had access to well-known MCU characters and much larger budgets than Marvel Television series ever had.<ref name=\"MarvelTVUnclear\" /> A month later, Feige was named Chief Creative Officer of Marvel Entertainment, with Marvel Television moving under Marvel Studios and executives of Marvel Television reporting to Feige.<ref name=\"Oct2019Restructure\" /> At the end of October, Loeb was expected to leave Marvel by the end of the year.<ref name=\"LoebGone\" />\n\nIn December, Feige referred to the Marvel Studios series as \"a new type of cinematic [story] that we haven't done before\", and indicated that he considered them the first MCU stories on television by saying \"for the first time ... the MCU will be on your TV screen at home on Disney+ and interconnect with the movies and go back and forth\".<ref name=\"FeigeInterconnectDec2019\" /> The next day, Marvel Television announced that it would complete work on its existing television series but would stop developing new projects. The division was set to shut down, with several executives moving to Marvel Studios to oversee the completion of existing series.

It is named after its ruling dynasty, whose rulers bore names ending with the suffix of ''Pala'' (\"protector\" in [[Sanskrit]]).

Their army was noted for its vast [[war elephant]] corps. Their navy performed both mercantile and defensive roles in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The Palas were important promoters of classical [[Indian philosophy]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian painting|painting]], and [[Indian sculpture|sculpture]]. They built grand temples and monasteries, including the [[Somapura Mahavihara]], and patronised the great universities of [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramashila]]. The [[Bengali language|Proto-Bengali language]] developed under Pala rule. The empire enjoyed relations with the [[Srivijaya Empire]], the [[Tibetan Empire]] and the [[Arab]] [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Abbasid coinage found in Pala archaeological sites, as well as records of Arab historians, point to flourishing mercantile and intellectual contacts. The [[House of Wisdom]] in Baghdad absorbed the mathematical and astronomical achievements of Indian civilisation during this period.<ref>{{cite book |author=Raj Kumar |date=2003 |title=Essays on Ancient India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvnjXOCjv7EC |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |page=199 |isbn=978-81-7141-682-0}}</ref>\n\nAt its height in the early 9th century, the Pala Empire was the dominant power in the northern Indian subcontinent, with its territory stretching across parts of modern-day eastern Pakistan, northern and northeastern [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]].<ref name=\"Majumdar1977\"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Sailendra Nath Sen |date=1999 |title=Ancient Indian History and Civilization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&pg=PA280 |publisher=New Age International |pages=280\u2013 |isbn=978-81-224-1198-0}}</ref> The empire reached its peak under Emperors [[Dharmapala (emperor)|Dharmapala]] and [[Devapala (Pala dynasty)|Devapala]]. The Palas also exerted a strong cultural influence under [[Atisa]] in Tibet, as well as in Southeast Asia. Pala control of North India was ultimately ephemeral, as they struggled with the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]s and the [[Rashtrakuta]]s for the control of [[Kannauj]] and were defeated. After a short lived decline, Emperor [[Mahipala I]] defended imperial bastions in Bengal and Bihar against South Indian [[Chola Empire|Chola]] invasions. Emperor [[Ramapala]] was the last strong Pala ruler, who gained control of [[Kamarupa]] and [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]]. The empire was considerably weakened by the 11th century, with many areas engulfed in rebellion.\n\nThe resurgent [[Hindu]] [[Sena dynasty]] dethroned the Pala Empire in the 12th century, ending the reign of the last major Buddhist imperial power in the Indian subcontinent. The Pala period is considered one of the golden eras of Bengali history.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}} The Palas brought stability and prosperity to Bengal after centuries of civil war between warring divisions. They advanced the achievements of previous Bengali civilisations and created outstanding works of arts and architecture. They laid the basis for the [[Bengali language]], including its first literary work, the ''[[Charyapada]]''. The Pala legacy is still reflected in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to the Khalimpur copper plate inscription, the first Pala king Gopala was the son of a warrior named Vapyata. The ''Ramacharitam'' attests that [[Varendra]] (North Bengal) was the fatherland (''Janakabhu'') of the Palas. The ethnic origins of the dynasty are unknown, although the later records claim that Gopala was a [[Kshatriya]] belonging to the legendary [[Solar dynasty]]. The ''Ballala-Carita'' states that the Palas were Kshatriyas, a claim reiterated by [[Taranatha]] in his ''History of Buddhism in India'' as well as Ghanaram Chakrabarty in his ''[[Dharmamangalkavya|Dharmamangala]]'' (both written in the 16th century CE). The ''Ramacharitam'' also attests the fifteenth Pala emperor, [[Ramapala]], as a Kshatriya. Claims of belonging to the legendary Solar dynasty are unreliable and clearly appear to be an attempt to cover up the humble origins of the dynasty.{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}} The Pala dynasty has also been branded as [[\u015audra]] in some sources such as ''[[Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b-m\u016bla-kalpa|Manjushri-Mulakalpa]]''; this might be because of their Buddhist leanings.{{sfn|Bagchi|1993|p=37}}<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vasily Vasilyev |author-link=Vasily Vasilyev |translator=E.

There was no central authority, and there was constant struggle between petty chieftains. The contemporary writings describe this situation as ''matsya nyaya'' (\"fish justice\" i.e. a situation where the big fish eat the small fish). Gopala ascended the throne as the first Pala king during these times. The Khalimpur copper plate suggests that the ''prakriti'' (people) of the region made him the king.{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}} Taranatha, writing nearly 800 years later, also writes that he was democratically elected by the people of Bengal. However, his account is in form of a legend, and is considered historically unreliable. The legend mentions that after a period of anarchy, the people elected several kings in succession, all of whom were consumed by the [[Naga (mythology)|Naga]] queen of an earlier king on the night following their election. Gopal, however managed to kill the queen and remained on the throne.<ref name=\"Biplab2005\">{{cite book | author=Biplab Dasgupta | author-link = Biplab Dasgupta | date=2005 | title=European Trade and Colonial Conquest | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRRnRK8lEYEC&pg=PA341 | publisher=Anthem Press | pages=341\u2013 | isbn=978-1-84331-029-7}}</ref> The historical evidence indicates that Gopala was not elected directly by his citizens, but by a group of feudal chieftains. Such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region.{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}<ref name=\"Biplab2005\"/>\n\nGopala's ascension was a significant political event as the several independent chiefs recognised his political authority without any struggle.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\">{{cite book | author=Sailendra Nath Sen | date=1999 | title=Ancient Indian History and Civilization | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&pg=PA278 | publisher=New Age International | pages=277\u2013287 | isbn=978-81-224-1198-0}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion under Dharmapala and Devapala===\n[[File:Indian Kanauj triangle map.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of the [[Kannauj]] triangle]]\nGopala's empire was greatly expanded by his son [[Dharmapala (emperor)|Dharmapala]] and his grandson [[Devapala (Pala dynasty)|Devapala]]. Dharmapala was initially defeated by the [[Gurjara-Pratihara|Pratihara]] ruler [[Vatsraja|Vatsaraja]]. Later, the [[Rashtrakuta]] king [[Dhruva Dharavarsha|Dhruva]] defeated both Dharmapala and Vatsaraja. After Dhruva left for the Deccan region, Dharmapala built a mighty empire in the northern India. He defeated Indrayudha of [[Kannauj]], and installed his own nominee Chakrayudha on the throne of Kannauj. Several other smaller states in North India also acknowledged his suzerainty. Soon, his expansion was checked by Vatsaraja's son [[Nagabhata II]], who conquered Kannauj and drove away Chakrayudha. Nagabhata II then advanced up to [[Munger]] and defeated Dharmapala in a pitched battle. Dharmapala was forced to surrender and to seek alliance with the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta]] emperor [[Govinda III]], who then intervened by invading northern India and defeating [[Nagabhata II]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=John Andrew Allan |author2=Sir T.

[[Vigrahapala I|Vigrahapala]], who was Devapala's nephew, abdicated the throne after a brief rule, and became an ascetic. Vigrahapala's son and successor [[Narayanapala]] proved to be a weak ruler. During his reign, the Rashtrakuta king [[Amoghavarsha]] defeated the Palas. Encouraged by the Pala decline, the King Harjara of [[Assam]] assumed imperial titles and the [[Shailodbhava dynasty|Sailodbhavas]] established their power in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]].<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>\n\nNaryanapala's son [[Rajyapala]] ruled for at least 12 years, and constructed several public utilities and lofty temples. His son [[Gopala II]] lost Bengal after a few years of rule, and then ruled only Bihar. The next king, [[Vigrahapala II]], had to bear the invasions from the [[Chandela]]s and the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuris]]. During his reign, the Pala empire disintegrated into smaller kingdoms like Gauda, Radha, Anga and Vanga. Kantideva of [[Harikela]] (eastern and southern Bengal) also assumed the title ''Maharajadhiraja'', and established a separate kingdom, later ruled by the [[Chandra dynasty]].<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> The Gauda state (West and North Bengal) was ruled by the [[Kamboja Pala dynasty]]. The rulers of this dynasty also bore names ending in the suffix -pala (e.g. [[Rajyapala Kamboja|Rajyapala]], [[Narayanapala (Kamboja)|Narayanapala]] and [[Naya Pala (Kamboja)|Nayapala]]). However, their origin is uncertain, and the most plausible view is that they originated from a Pala official who usurped a major part of the Pala kingdom along with its capital.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}\n\n=== Revival under Mahipala I ===\n[[File:INDIA, Medieval.

He also recovered the northern part of the present-day [[Burdwan division]]. During his reign, [[Rajendra Chola I]] of the [[Chola Empire]] frequently invaded Bengal from 1021 to 1023 CE to get Ganges water and in the process, succeeded to humble the rulers, acquiring considerable booty. The rulers of Bengal who were defeated by Rajendra Chola were Dharmapal, Ranasur and Govindachandra, who might have been feudatories under Mahipala I of the Pala Dynasty.{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|p=45}} [[Rajendra Chola I]] also defeated Mahipala, and obtained from the Pala king \"elephants of rare strength, women and treasure\".<ref>{{cite book |author=John Keay |author-link=John Keay |date=2000 |title=India: A History |publisher=Grove Press |page=220 |isbn=978-0-8021-3797-5}}</ref> Mahipala also gained control of north and south Bihar, probably aided by the invasions of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], which exhausted the strength of other rulers of North India. He may have also conquered [[Varanasi]] and surrounding area, as his brothers Sthirapala and Vasantapala undertook construction and repairs of several sacred structures at Varanasi. Later, the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] king [[Gangeyadeva]] annexed Varanasi after defeating the ruler of Anga, which could have been Mahipala I.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>\n\n=== Second period of decline ===\n\nNayapala, the son of Mahipala I, defeated the Kalachuri king Karna (son of Ganggeyadeva) after a long struggle. The two later signed a peace treaty at the mediation of the Buddhist scholar [[Ati\u015ba]]. During the reign of Nayapala's son Vigrahapala III, Karna once again invaded Bengal but was defeated. The conflict ended with a peace treaty, and Vigrahapala III married Karna's daughter Yauvanasri. Vigrahapala III was later defeated by the invading [[Western Chalukya Empire|Chalukya]] king [[Vikramaditya VI]]. The invasion of Vikramaditya VI saw several soldiers from South India into Bengal, which explains the southern origin of the Sena Dynasty.<ref>{{cite book |author1=John Andrew Allan |author2=Sir T.

Subsequently, a series of invasions considerably reduced the power of the Palas. The Varmans occupied eastern Bengal during his reign.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}\n\nMahipala II, the successor of Vigrahapala III, brought a short-lived reign of military glory. His reign is well-documented by [[Sandhyakar Nandi]] in ''[[Ramacharitam]]''. Mahipala II imprisoned his brothers Ramapala and Surapala II, on the suspicion that they were conspiring against him. Soon afterwards, he faced a [[Varendra Rebellion|rebellion of vassal chiefs from the Kaibarta]] (fishermen). A chief named Divya (or Divvoka) killed him and occupied the Varendra region. The region remained under the control of his successors Rudak and Bhima. Surapala II escaped to Magadha and died after a short reign. He was succeeded by his brother Ramapala, who launched a major offensive against Divya's grandson Bhima. He was supported by his maternal uncle Mathana of the Rashtrakuta dynasty, as well as several feudatory chiefs of south Bihar and south-west Bengal. Ramapala conclusively defeated Bhima, and killing him and his family in a cruel manner.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}\n\n=== Revival under Ramapala ===\n[[File:Avalokiteshvara and Scenes from the Buddha's Life (a), Maitreya and Scenes from the Buddha's Life (b), Two Folios from a Prajnaparamita (The Perfection of Wisdom) LACMA M.72.1.19a-b (1 of 4).jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>[[Maitreya]] and scenes from the Buddha's life.

He ruled from a new capital at Ramavati, which remained the Pala capital until the dynasty's end. He reduced taxation, promoted cultivation and constructed public utilities. He brought [[Kamarupa]] and [[Rarh region|Rar]] under his control, and forced the Varman king of east Bengal to accept his suzerainty. He also struggled with the Ganga king for control of present-day Orissa; the Gangas managed to annexe the region only after his death. Ramapala maintained friendly relations with the Chola king Kulottunga to secure support against the common enemies: the Ganas and the Chalukyas. He kept the Senas in check, but lost Mithila to a Karnataka chief named Nanyuadeva. He also held back the aggressive design of the Gahadavala ruler Govindacharndra through a matrimonial alliance.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}\n\n=== Final decline ===\n\nRamapala was the last strong Pala ruler. After his death, a rebellion broke out in [[Kamarupa]] during his son Kumarapala's reign. The rebellion was crushed by Vaidyadeva, but after Kumarapala's death, Vaidyadeva practically created a separate kingdom.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> According to ''Ramacharitam'', Kumarapala's son Gopala III was murdered by his uncle Madanapala. During Madanapala's rule, the Varmans in east Bengal declared independence, and the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Gangas]] renewed the conflict in Orissa. Madanapala captured Munger from the Gahadavalas, but was defeated by Vijayasena, who gained control of southern and eastern Bengal. A ruler named Govindapala ruled over the Gaya district around 1162 CE, but there is no concrete evidence about his relationship to the imperial Palas. The Pala dynasty was replaced by the [[Sena dynasty]].{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:INDIA, Medieval. Bengal (Palas). Jagaddeva. 12th-13th centuries.jpg|thumb|Coin of the Palas, Bengal. Jagaddeva. 12th-13th centuries.]]\nThe borders of the Pala Empire kept fluctuating throughout its existence. Though the Palas conquered a vast region in North India at one time, they could not retain it for long due to constant hostility from the Gurjara-Pratiharas, the Rashtrakutas and other less powerful kings.{{sfn|Bagchi|1993|p=4}}\n\nNo records are available about the exact boundaries of original kingdom established by Gopala, but it might have included almost all of the [[Bengal]] region.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> The Pala empire extended substantially under Dharmapala's rule.

The kingdom of Kannauj (present-day Uttar Pradesh) was a Pala dependency at times, ruled by his nominee Chakrayudha.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> While installing his nominee on the Kannauj throne, Dharmapala organised an imperial court. According to the Khalimpur copper plate issued by Dharmapala, this court was attended by the rulers of Bhoja (possibly [[Vidarbha]]), [[Matsya Kingdom|Matsya]] (Jaipur region), [[Madra]] (East Punjab), [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] (Delhi region), [[Yadu]] (possibly Mathura, Dwarka or Simhapura in the Punjab), [[Yavana]], [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]], [[Gandhara]] and Kira ([[Kangra Valley]]).{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}<ref name=\"Sinha1977p177\">{{cite book | author=Bindeshwari Prasad Sinha | author-link=Bindeshwari Prasad Sinha | year=1977 | title=Dynastic History of Magadha | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gYO25eaDrqUC&pg=PA177 | location=New Delhi | publisher=Abhinav Publications | page=177 | isbn=978-81-7017-059-4 | quote=Dharmap\u0101la after defeating Indr\u0101yudha and capturing Kanuaj made it over to Cakr\u0101yudha, who was a vassal king of Kanuaj subordinate to Dharmap\u0101la ...

The other rulers acknowledged the military and political supremacy of Dharmapala, but maintained their own territories.{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}} The poet Soddhala of Gujarat calls Dharmapala an ''Uttarapathasvamin'' (\"Lord of the North\") for his suzerainty over North India.{{sfn|Bagchi|1993|p=39\u201340}}\n\nThe epigraphic records credit Devapala with extensive conquests in hyperbolic language. The Badal pillar inscription of his successor Narayana Pala states that by the wise counsel and policy of his Brahmin minister Darbhapani, Devapala became the suzerain monarch or Chakravarti of the whole tract of Northern India bounded by the Vindhyas and the Himalayas. It also states that his empire extended up to the two oceans (presumably the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]]). It also claims that Devpala defeated [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]] (present-day Orissa), the [[Huna people|Hunas]], the Kambojas, the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidas]], the [[Kamarupa]] (present-day Assam), and the Gurjaras:<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>\n* The Gurjara adversary may have been [[Mihira Bhoja]], whose eastward expansion was checked by Devapala\n* The identity of the Huna king is uncertain.\n* The identity of the Kamboja prince is also uncertain. While an ancient country with the name [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] was located in what is now Afghanistan, there is no evidence that Devapala's empire extended that far. Kamboja, in this inscription, could refer to the Kamboja tribe that had entered North India (see [[Kamboja Pala dynasty]]).\n* The Dravida king is usually identified with the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha. Some scholars believe that the Dravida king could have been the Pandya ruler Shri Mara Shri Vallabha, since \"Dravida\" usually refers to the territory south of the Krishna river. According to this theory, Devapala could have been helped in his southern expedition by the Chandela king Vijaya. In any case, Devapala's gains in the south, if any, were temporary.\n\nThe claims about Devapala's victories are exaggerated, but cannot be dismissed entirely: there is no reason to doubt his conquest of Utkala and Kamarupa. Besides, the neighbouring kingdoms of Rashtrakutas and the Gurjara-Pratiharas were weak at the time, which might have helped him extend his empire.<ref name=\"Sinha1977p185\" /> Devapala is also believed to have led an army up to the Indus river in Punjab.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>\n\nThe empire started disintegrated after the death of Devapala, and his successor Narayanapala lost control of Assam and Orissa. He also briefly lost control over Magadha and north Bengal. Gopala II lost control of Bengal, and ruled only from a part of Bihar. The Pala empire disintegrated into smaller kingdoms during the reign of Vigrahapala II. Mahipala recovered parts of Bengal and Bihar. His successors lost Bengal again. The last strong Pala ruler, Ramapala, gained control of Bengal, Bihar, Assam and parts of Orissa.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> By the time of Madanapala's death, the Pala kingdom was confined to parts of central and east Bihar along with northern Bengal.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>\n\n== Administration ==\n\nThe Pala rule was monarchial. The king was the centre of all power. Pala kings would adopt imperial titles like ''Parameshwara'', ''Paramvattaraka'', ''Maharajadhiraja''. Pala kings appointed Prime Ministers. The '''Line of Garga''' served as the Prime Ministers of the Palas for 100 years.\n* Garga\n* Darvapani (or Darbhapani)\n* Someshwar\n* Kedarmisra\n* Bhatta Guravmisra\n\nPala Empire was divided into separate ''Bhukti''s (Provinces). Bhuktis were divided into ''Vishaya''s (Divisions) and ''Mandala''s (Districts). Smaller units were ''Khandala'', ''Bhaga'', ''Avritti'', ''Chaturaka'', and Pattaka. Administration covered widespread area from the grass root level to the imperial court.{{sfn|Paul|1939|p=122\u2013124}}\n\nThe Pala copperplates mention following administrative posts:{{sfn|Paul|1939|p=111\u2013122}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* ''Raja''\n* ''Rajanyaka''\n* ''Ranaka'' (possibly subordinate chiefs)\n* ''Samanta'' and ''Mahasamanta'' (Vassal kings)\n* ''Mahasandhi-vigrahika'' (Foreign minister)\n* ''Duta'' (Head Ambassador)\n* ''Rajasthaniya'' (Deputy)\n* ''Aggaraksa'' (Chief guard)\n* ''Sasthadhikrta'' (Tax collector)\n* ''Chauroddharanika'' (Police tax)\n* ''Shaulkaka'' (Trade tax)\n* ''Dashaparadhika'' (Collector of penalties)\n* ''Tarika'' (Toll collector for river crossings)\n* ''Mahaksapatalika'' (Accountant)\n* ''Jyesthakayastha'' (Dealing documents)\n* ''Ksetrapa'' (Head of land use division) and ''Pramatr'' (Head of land measurements)\n* ''Mahadandanayaka'' or ''Dharmadhikara'' (Chief justice)\n* ''Mahapratihara''\n* ''Dandika''\n* ''Dandapashika''\n* ''Dandashakti'' (Police forces)\n* ''Khola'' (Secret service).\n* Agricultural posts like ''Gavadhakshya'' (Head of dairy farms)\n* ''Chhagadhyakshya'' (Head of goat farms)\n* ''Meshadyakshya'' (Head of sheep farms)\n* ''Mahishadyakshya'' (Head of Buffalo farms) and many other like ''Vogpati''\n* ''Vishayapati''\n* ''Shashtadhikruta''\n* ''Dauhshashadhanika''\n* ''Nakadhyakshya''\n}}\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Nalanda.jpg|thumb|[[Nalanda]] is considered one of the first great universities in recorded history.

Devapala restored and enlarged the structures at Somapura Mahavihara, which also features several themes from the epics ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''. Mahipala I also ordered construction and repairs of several sacred structures at Saranath, Nalanda and Bodh Gaya.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> The ''Mahipala geet'' (\"songs of Mahipala\"), a set of folk songs about him, are still popular in the rural areas of Bengal.\n\nThe Palas developed the Buddhist centres of learnings, such as the [[Vikramashila]] and the [[Nalanda]] universities. Nalanda, considered one of the first great universities in recorded history, reached its height under the patronage of the Palas.

During this time, the style of sculpture changed from \"Post-Gupta\" to a distinctive style that was widely influential in other areas and later centuries.  Deity figures became more rigid in posture, very often standing with straight legs close together, and figures were often heavily loaded with jewellery; they very often have multiple arms, a convention allowing them to hold many attributes and display [[mudra]]s.  The typical form for temple images is a slab with a main figure, rather over half life-size, in very high relief, surrounded by smaller attendant figures, who might have freer [[tribhanga]] poses. Critics have found the style tending towards over-elaboration.  The quality of the carving is generally very high, with crisp, precise detail.  In east India, facial features tend to become sharp.<ref>Harle, 212-216; Craven, 170, 172-176</ref>  \n\nMuch larger numbers of smaller bronze groups of similar composition have survived than from previous periods.  Probably the numbers produced were increasing.  These were mostly made for domestic shrines of the well-off, and from monasteries.  Gradually, Hindu figures come to outnumber Buddhist ones, reflecting the terminal decline of Indian Buddhism, even in east India, its last stronghold.<ref>Harle, 212; Craven, 176</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Lalita statue.jpg|A basalt statue of [[Tripura Sundari|Lalita]] flanked by [[Ga\u1e47e\u015ba]] and [[K\u0101rttikeya]]\nFile:Carved Conch.jpg|Carved [[shankha]]s\nFile:Khasarpana Lokesvara.jpg|Sculpture of Khasarpana Lokesvara from Nalanda\nFile:Nswag, india bengala occidentale, periodo pala (760-1142) varana che libera la dea della terra bhudevi, X sec..JPG|Sculpture of [[Varaha]] avatar of Lord [[Vishnu]]\nFile:Standing Rishabhanatha.jpg|[[Tirthankara|Jina]] [[Rishabhanatha]]\n</gallery>\n\nAs noted earlier, the Palas built a number of monasteries and other sacred structures.

Their army was noted for its vast [[war elephant]] corps. Their navy performed both mercantile and defensive roles in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The Palas were important promoters of classical [[Indian philosophy]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Indian painting|painting]], and [[Indian sculpture|sculpture]]. They built grand temples and monasteries, including the [[Somapura Mahavihara]], and patronised the great universities of [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramashila]].

The Palas also exerted a strong cultural influence under [[Atisa]] in Tibet, as well as in Southeast Asia. Pala control of North India was ultimately ephemeral, as they struggled with the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]s and the [[Rashtrakuta]]s for the control of [[Kannauj]] and were defeated. After a short lived decline, Emperor [[Mahipala I]] defended imperial bastions in Bengal and Bihar against South Indian [[Chola Empire|Chola]] invasions. Emperor [[Ramapala]] was the last strong Pala ruler, who gained control of [[Kamarupa]] and [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]]. The empire was considerably weakened by the 11th century, with many areas engulfed in rebellion.\n\nThe resurgent [[Hindu]] [[Sena dynasty]] dethroned the Pala Empire in the 12th century, ending the reign of the last major Buddhist imperial power in the Indian subcontinent. The Pala period is considered one of the golden eras of Bengali history.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}} The Palas brought stability and prosperity to Bengal after centuries of civil war between warring divisions. They advanced the achievements of previous Bengali civilisations and created outstanding works of arts and architecture. They laid the basis for the [[Bengali language]], including its first literary work, the ''[[Charyapada]]''. The Pala legacy is still reflected in [[Tibetan Buddhism]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nAccording to the Khalimpur copper plate inscription, the first Pala king Gopala was the son of a warrior named Vapyata. The ''Ramacharitam'' attests that [[Varendra]] (North Bengal) was the fatherland (''Janakabhu'') of the Palas. The ethnic origins of the dynasty are unknown, although the later records claim that Gopala was a [[Kshatriya]] belonging to the legendary [[Solar dynasty]]. The ''Ballala-Carita'' states that the Palas were Kshatriyas, a claim reiterated by [[Taranatha]] in his ''History of Buddhism in India'' as well as Ghanaram Chakrabarty in his ''[[Dharmamangalkavya|Dharmamangala]]'' (both written in the 16th century CE). The ''Ramacharitam'' also attests the fifteenth Pala emperor, [[Ramapala]], as a Kshatriya. Claims of belonging to the legendary Solar dynasty are unreliable and clearly appear to be an attempt to cover up the humble origins of the dynasty.{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}} The Pala dynasty has also been branded as [[\u015audra]] in some sources such as ''[[Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b-m\u016bla-kalpa|Manjushri-Mulakalpa]]''; this might be because of their Buddhist leanings.{{sfn|Bagchi|1993|p=37}}<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vasily Vasilyev |author-link=Vasily Vasilyev |translator=E.

There was no central authority, and there was constant struggle between petty chieftains. The contemporary writings describe this situation as ''matsya nyaya'' (\"fish justice\" i.e. a situation where the big fish eat the small fish). Gopala ascended the throne as the first Pala king during these times. The Khalimpur copper plate suggests that the ''prakriti'' (people) of the region made him the king.{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}} Taranatha, writing nearly 800 years later, also writes that he was democratically elected by the people of Bengal. However, his account is in form of a legend, and is considered historically unreliable. The legend mentions that after a period of anarchy, the people elected several kings in succession, all of whom were consumed by the [[Naga (mythology)|Naga]] queen of an earlier king on the night following their election. Gopal, however managed to kill the queen and remained on the throne.<ref name=\"Biplab2005\">{{cite book | author=Biplab Dasgupta | author-link = Biplab Dasgupta | date=2005 | title=European Trade and Colonial Conquest | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRRnRK8lEYEC&pg=PA341 | publisher=Anthem Press | pages=341\u2013 | isbn=978-1-84331-029-7}}</ref> The historical evidence indicates that Gopala was not elected directly by his citizens, but by a group of feudal chieftains.

Dharmapala was initially defeated by the [[Gurjara-Pratihara|Pratihara]] ruler [[Vatsraja|Vatsaraja]]. Later, the [[Rashtrakuta]] king [[Dhruva Dharavarsha|Dhruva]] defeated both Dharmapala and Vatsaraja. After Dhruva left for the Deccan region, Dharmapala built a mighty empire in the northern India. He defeated Indrayudha of [[Kannauj]], and installed his own nominee Chakrayudha on the throne of Kannauj. Several other smaller states in North India also acknowledged his suzerainty. Soon, his expansion was checked by Vatsaraja's son [[Nagabhata II]], who conquered Kannauj and drove away Chakrayudha. Nagabhata II then advanced up to [[Munger]] and defeated Dharmapala in a pitched battle. Dharmapala was forced to surrender and to seek alliance with the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta]] emperor [[Govinda III]], who then intervened by invading northern India and defeating [[Nagabhata II]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=John Andrew Allan |author2=Sir T.

[[Vigrahapala I|Vigrahapala]], who was Devapala's nephew, abdicated the throne after a brief rule, and became an ascetic. Vigrahapala's son and successor [[Narayanapala]] proved to be a weak ruler. During his reign, the Rashtrakuta king [[Amoghavarsha]] defeated the Palas. Encouraged by the Pala decline, the King Harjara of [[Assam]] assumed imperial titles and the [[Shailodbhava dynasty|Sailodbhavas]] established their power in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]].<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>\n\nNaryanapala's son [[Rajyapala]] ruled for at least 12 years, and constructed several public utilities and lofty temples. His son [[Gopala II]] lost Bengal after a few years of rule, and then ruled only Bihar. The next king, [[Vigrahapala II]], had to bear the invasions from the [[Chandela]]s and the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuris]]. During his reign, the Pala empire disintegrated into smaller kingdoms like Gauda, Radha, Anga and Vanga. Kantideva of [[Harikela]] (eastern and southern Bengal) also assumed the title ''Maharajadhiraja'', and established a separate kingdom, later ruled by the [[Chandra dynasty]].<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> The Gauda state (West and North Bengal) was ruled by the [[Kamboja Pala dynasty]]. The rulers of this dynasty also bore names ending in the suffix -pala (e.g. [[Rajyapala Kamboja|Rajyapala]], [[Narayanapala (Kamboja)|Narayanapala]] and [[Naya Pala (Kamboja)|Nayapala]]). However, their origin is uncertain, and the most plausible view is that they originated from a Pala official who usurped a major part of the Pala kingdom along with its capital.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}\n\n=== Revival under Mahipala I ===\n[[File:INDIA, Medieval. Palas. Mahipala I and later. Circa 988-1161.jpg|thumb|Coin of the Pala Empire, [[Mahipala I]] and later. Circa 988-1161 CE]]\nMahipala I recovered northern and eastern Bengal within three years of ascending the throne in 988 CE. He also recovered the northern part of the present-day [[Burdwan division]]. During his reign, [[Rajendra Chola I]] of the [[Chola Empire]] frequently invaded Bengal from 1021 to 1023 CE to get Ganges water and in the process, succeeded to humble the rulers, acquiring considerable booty. The rulers of Bengal who were defeated by Rajendra Chola were Dharmapal, Ranasur and Govindachandra, who might have been feudatories under Mahipala I of the Pala Dynasty.{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|p=45}} [[Rajendra Chola I]] also defeated Mahipala, and obtained from the Pala king \"elephants of rare strength, women and treasure\".<ref>{{cite book |author=John Keay |author-link=John Keay |date=2000 |title=India: A History |publisher=Grove Press |page=220 |isbn=978-0-8021-3797-5}}</ref> Mahipala also gained control of north and south Bihar, probably aided by the invasions of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], which exhausted the strength of other rulers of North India. He may have also conquered [[Varanasi]] and surrounding area, as his brothers Sthirapala and Vasantapala undertook construction and repairs of several sacred structures at Varanasi. Later, the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] king [[Gangeyadeva]] annexed Varanasi after defeating the ruler of Anga, which could have been Mahipala I.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>\n\n=== Second period of decline ===\n\nNayapala, the son of Mahipala I, defeated the Kalachuri king Karna (son of Ganggeyadeva) after a long struggle. The two later signed a peace treaty at the mediation of the Buddhist scholar [[Ati\u015ba]]. During the reign of Nayapala's son Vigrahapala III, Karna once again invaded Bengal but was defeated. The conflict ended with a peace treaty, and Vigrahapala III married Karna's daughter Yauvanasri. Vigrahapala III was later defeated by the invading [[Western Chalukya Empire|Chalukya]] king [[Vikramaditya VI]]. The invasion of Vikramaditya VI saw several soldiers from South India into Bengal, which explains the southern origin of the Sena Dynasty.<ref>{{cite book |author1=John Andrew Allan |author2=Sir T. Wolseley Haig |date=1934 |title=The Cambridge Shorter History of India |publisher=Macmillan Company |page=10}}</ref> Vigrahapala III also faced another invasion led by the [[Somava\u1e43\u015b\u012b dynasty|Somavamsi]] king Mahasivagupta Yayati of Orissa. Subsequently, a series of invasions considerably reduced the power of the Palas. The Varmans occupied eastern Bengal during his reign.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}\n\nMahipala II, the successor of Vigrahapala III, brought a short-lived reign of military glory. His reign is well-documented by [[Sandhyakar Nandi]] in ''[[Ramacharitam]]''. Mahipala II imprisoned his brothers Ramapala and Surapala II, on the suspicion that they were conspiring against him. Soon afterwards, he faced a [[Varendra Rebellion|rebellion of vassal chiefs from the Kaibarta]] (fishermen). A chief named Divya (or Divvoka) killed him and occupied the Varendra region. The region remained under the control of his successors Rudak and Bhima. Surapala II escaped to Magadha and died after a short reign. He was succeeded by his brother Ramapala, who launched a major offensive against Divya's grandson Bhima. He was supported by his maternal uncle Mathana of the Rashtrakuta dynasty, as well as several feudatory chiefs of south Bihar and south-west Bengal. Ramapala conclusively defeated Bhima, and killing him and his family in a cruel manner.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}\n\n=== Revival under Ramapala ===\n[[File:Avalokiteshvara and Scenes from the Buddha's Life (a), Maitreya and Scenes from the Buddha's Life (b), Two Folios from a Prajnaparamita (The Perfection of Wisdom) LACMA M.72.1.19a-b (1 of 4).jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>[[Maitreya]] and scenes from the Buddha's life.

He ruled from a new capital at Ramavati, which remained the Pala capital until the dynasty's end. He reduced taxation, promoted cultivation and constructed public utilities. He brought [[Kamarupa]] and [[Rarh region|Rar]] under his control, and forced the Varman king of east Bengal to accept his suzerainty. He also struggled with the Ganga king for control of present-day Orissa; the Gangas managed to annexe the region only after his death. Ramapala maintained friendly relations with the Chola king Kulottunga to secure support against the common enemies: the Ganas and the Chalukyas. He kept the Senas in check, but lost Mithila to a Karnataka chief named Nanyuadeva.

After his death, a rebellion broke out in [[Kamarupa]] during his son Kumarapala's reign. The rebellion was crushed by Vaidyadeva, but after Kumarapala's death, Vaidyadeva practically created a separate kingdom.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> According to ''Ramacharitam'', Kumarapala's son Gopala III was murdered by his uncle Madanapala. During Madanapala's rule, the Varmans in east Bengal declared independence, and the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Gangas]] renewed the conflict in Orissa. Madanapala captured Munger from the Gahadavalas, but was defeated by Vijayasena, who gained control of southern and eastern Bengal. A ruler named Govindapala ruled over the Gaya district around 1162 CE, but there is no concrete evidence about his relationship to the imperial Palas. The Pala dynasty was replaced by the [[Sena dynasty]].{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:INDIA, Medieval. Bengal (Palas). Jagaddeva. 12th-13th centuries.jpg|thumb|Coin of the Palas, Bengal. Jagaddeva. 12th-13th centuries.]]\nThe borders of the Pala Empire kept fluctuating throughout its existence. Though the Palas conquered a vast region in North India at one time, they could not retain it for long due to constant hostility from the Gurjara-Pratiharas, the Rashtrakutas and other less powerful kings.{{sfn|Bagchi|1993|p=4}}\n\nNo records are available about the exact boundaries of original kingdom established by Gopala, but it might have included almost all of the [[Bengal]] region.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> The Pala empire extended substantially under Dharmapala's rule. Apart from Bengal, he directly ruled the present-day Bihar. The kingdom of Kannauj (present-day Uttar Pradesh) was a Pala dependency at times, ruled by his nominee Chakrayudha.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> While installing his nominee on the Kannauj throne, Dharmapala organised an imperial court. According to the Khalimpur copper plate issued by Dharmapala, this court was attended by the rulers of Bhoja (possibly [[Vidarbha]]), [[Matsya Kingdom|Matsya]] (Jaipur region), [[Madra]] (East Punjab), [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] (Delhi region), [[Yadu]] (possibly Mathura, Dwarka or Simhapura in the Punjab), [[Yavana]], [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]], [[Gandhara]] and Kira ([[Kangra Valley]]).{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}}<ref name=\"Sinha1977p177\">{{cite book | author=Bindeshwari Prasad Sinha | author-link=Bindeshwari Prasad Sinha | year=1977 | title=Dynastic History of Magadha | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gYO25eaDrqUC&pg=PA177 | location=New Delhi | publisher=Abhinav Publications | page=177 | isbn=978-81-7017-059-4 | quote=Dharmap\u0101la after defeating Indr\u0101yudha and capturing Kanuaj made it over to Cakr\u0101yudha, who was a vassal king of Kanuaj subordinate to Dharmap\u0101la ...

The other rulers acknowledged the military and political supremacy of Dharmapala, but maintained their own territories.{{sfn|Sengupta|2011|pp=39\u201349}} The poet Soddhala of Gujarat calls Dharmapala an ''Uttarapathasvamin'' (\"Lord of the North\") for his suzerainty over North India.{{sfn|Bagchi|1993|p=39\u201340}}\n\nThe epigraphic records credit Devapala with extensive conquests in hyperbolic language. The Badal pillar inscription of his successor Narayana Pala states that by the wise counsel and policy of his Brahmin minister Darbhapani, Devapala became the suzerain monarch or Chakravarti of the whole tract of Northern India bounded by the Vindhyas and the Himalayas. It also states that his empire extended up to the two oceans (presumably the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]]). It also claims that Devpala defeated [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]] (present-day Orissa), the [[Huna people|Hunas]], the Kambojas, the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidas]], the [[Kamarupa]] (present-day Assam), and the Gurjaras:<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>\n* The Gurjara adversary may have been [[Mihira Bhoja]], whose eastward expansion was checked by Devapala\n* The identity of the Huna king is uncertain.\n* The identity of the Kamboja prince is also uncertain. While an ancient country with the name [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] was located in what is now Afghanistan, there is no evidence that Devapala's empire extended that far. Kamboja, in this inscription, could refer to the Kamboja tribe that had entered North India (see [[Kamboja Pala dynasty]]).\n* The Dravida king is usually identified with the Rashtrakuta king Amoghavarsha. Some scholars believe that the Dravida king could have been the Pandya ruler Shri Mara Shri Vallabha, since \"Dravida\" usually refers to the territory south of the Krishna river. According to this theory, Devapala could have been helped in his southern expedition by the Chandela king Vijaya. In any case, Devapala's gains in the south, if any, were temporary.\n\nThe claims about Devapala's victories are exaggerated, but cannot be dismissed entirely: there is no reason to doubt his conquest of Utkala and Kamarupa. Besides, the neighbouring kingdoms of Rashtrakutas and the Gurjara-Pratiharas were weak at the time, which might have helped him extend his empire.<ref name=\"Sinha1977p185\" /> Devapala is also believed to have led an army up to the Indus river in Punjab.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>\n\nThe empire started disintegrated after the death of Devapala, and his successor Narayanapala lost control of Assam and Orissa. He also briefly lost control over Magadha and north Bengal. Gopala II lost control of Bengal, and ruled only from a part of Bihar. The Pala empire disintegrated into smaller kingdoms during the reign of Vigrahapala II. Mahipala recovered parts of Bengal and Bihar. His successors lost Bengal again. The last strong Pala ruler, Ramapala, gained control of Bengal, Bihar, Assam and parts of Orissa.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> By the time of Madanapala's death, the Pala kingdom was confined to parts of central and east Bihar along with northern Bengal.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/>\n\n== Administration ==\n\nThe Pala rule was monarchial. The king was the centre of all power. Pala kings would adopt imperial titles like ''Parameshwara'', ''Paramvattaraka'', ''Maharajadhiraja''. Pala kings appointed Prime Ministers. The '''Line of Garga''' served as the Prime Ministers of the Palas for 100 years.\n* Garga\n* Darvapani (or Darbhapani)\n* Someshwar\n* Kedarmisra\n* Bhatta Guravmisra\n\nPala Empire was divided into separate ''Bhukti''s (Provinces). Bhuktis were divided into ''Vishaya''s (Divisions) and ''Mandala''s (Districts). Smaller units were ''Khandala'', ''Bhaga'', ''Avritti'', ''Chaturaka'', and Pattaka. Administration covered widespread area from the grass root level to the imperial court.{{sfn|Paul|1939|p=122\u2013124}}\n\nThe Pala copperplates mention following administrative posts:{{sfn|Paul|1939|p=111\u2013122}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* ''Raja''\n* ''Rajanyaka''\n* ''Ranaka'' (possibly subordinate chiefs)\n* ''Samanta'' and ''Mahasamanta'' (Vassal kings)\n* ''Mahasandhi-vigrahika'' (Foreign minister)\n* ''Duta'' (Head Ambassador)\n* ''Rajasthaniya'' (Deputy)\n* ''Aggaraksa'' (Chief guard)\n* ''Sasthadhikrta'' (Tax collector)\n* ''Chauroddharanika'' (Police tax)\n* ''Shaulkaka'' (Trade tax)\n* ''Dashaparadhika'' (Collector of penalties)\n* ''Tarika'' (Toll collector for river crossings)\n* ''Mahaksapatalika'' (Accountant)\n* ''Jyesthakayastha'' (Dealing documents)\n* ''Ksetrapa'' (Head of land use division) and ''Pramatr'' (Head of land measurements)\n* ''Mahadandanayaka'' or ''Dharmadhikara'' (Chief justice)\n* ''Mahapratihara''\n* ''Dandika''\n* ''Dandapashika''\n* ''Dandashakti'' (Police forces)\n* ''Khola'' (Secret service).\n* Agricultural posts like ''Gavadhakshya'' (Head of dairy farms)\n* ''Chhagadhyakshya'' (Head of goat farms)\n* ''Meshadyakshya'' (Head of sheep farms)\n* ''Mahishadyakshya'' (Head of Buffalo farms) and many other like ''Vogpati''\n* ''Vishayapati''\n* ''Shashtadhikruta''\n* ''Dauhshashadhanika''\n* ''Nakadhyakshya''\n}}\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Nalanda.jpg|thumb|[[Nalanda]] is considered one of the first great universities in recorded history.

He established the [[Vikramashila]] monastery and the [[Somapura Mahavihara]]. Taranatha also credits him with establishing 50 religious institutions and patronising the Buddhist author Hariibhadra. Devapala restored and enlarged the structures at Somapura Mahavihara, which also features several themes from the epics ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''. Mahipala I also ordered construction and repairs of several sacred structures at Saranath, Nalanda and Bodh Gaya.<ref name=\"Sailendra1999\"/> The ''Mahipala geet'' (\"songs of Mahipala\"), a set of folk songs about him, are still popular in the rural areas of Bengal.\n\nThe Palas developed the Buddhist centres of learnings, such as the [[Vikramashila]] and the [[Nalanda]] universities. Nalanda, considered one of the first great universities in recorded history, reached its height under the patronage of the Palas. Noted Buddhist scholars from the Pala period include [[Atisha]], [[Santaraksita]], [[Saraha]], [[Tilopa]], Bimalamitra, Dansheel, Dansree, Jinamitra, Jnanasrimitra, Manjughosh, Muktimitra, Padmanava, Sambhogabajra, Shantarakshit, Silabhadra, Sugatasree and Virachan.\n\nAs the rulers of [[Gautama Buddha]]'s land, the Palas acquired great reputation in the Buddhist world.

During this time, the style of sculpture changed from \"Post-Gupta\" to a distinctive style that was widely influential in other areas and later centuries.  Deity figures became more rigid in posture, very often standing with straight legs close together, and figures were often heavily loaded with jewellery; they very often have multiple arms, a convention allowing them to hold many attributes and display [[mudra]]s.  The typical form for temple images is a slab with a main figure, rather over half life-size, in very high relief, surrounded by smaller attendant figures, who might have freer [[tribhanga]] poses. Critics have found the style tending towards over-elaboration.  The quality of the carving is generally very high, with crisp, precise detail.  In east India, facial features tend to become sharp.<ref>Harle, 212-216; Craven, 170, 172-176</ref>  \n\nMuch larger numbers of smaller bronze groups of similar composition have survived than from previous periods.  Probably the numbers produced were increasing.  These were mostly made for domestic shrines of the well-off, and from monasteries.  Gradually, Hindu figures come to outnumber Buddhist ones, reflecting the terminal decline of Indian Buddhism, even in east India, its last stronghold.<ref>Harle, 212; Craven, 176</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Lalita statue.jpg|A basalt statue of [[Tripura Sundari|Lalita]] flanked by [[Ga\u1e47e\u015ba]] and [[K\u0101rttikeya]]\nFile:Carved Conch.jpg|Carved [[shankha]]s\nFile:Khasarpana Lokesvara.jpg|Sculpture of Khasarpana Lokesvara from Nalanda\nFile:Nswag, india bengala occidentale, periodo pala (760-1142) varana che libera la dea della terra bhudevi, X sec..JPG|Sculpture of [[Varaha]] avatar of Lord [[Vishnu]]\nFile:Standing Rishabhanatha.jpg|[[Tirthankara|Jina]] [[Rishabhanatha]]\n</gallery>\n\nAs noted earlier, the Palas built a number of monasteries and other sacred structures.

According to the contemporary accounts, the Rashtrakutas had the best infantry, the Gurjara-Pratiharas had the finest cavalry and the Palas had the largest elephant force. The Arab merchant Sulaiman states that the Palas had an army bigger than those of the Balhara (possibly the Rashtrakutas) and the king of Jurz (possibly the Gurjara-Pratiharas). He also states that the Pala army employed 10,000\u201315,000 men for fuelling and washing clothes. He further claims that during the battles, the Pala king would lead 50,000 [[war elephant]]s.

Travelling from western [[Europe]] to [[China]] and [[India]], Jacobovici finds tantalizing evidence that the \"lost tribes\" are, like the tribe of Dan, not really lost. The tribe of Dan is the only original tribe of Israel not to be included in the [[Book of Revelation]]'s list of tribes that are sealed. No mention is made of why it is excluded.\n\n=== ''Impact of Terror'' ===\nThe 2004 documentary, produced by Jacobovici and directed by [[Tim Wolochatiuk]], is about Israeli victims of terrorism struggling to cope in the aftermath of the August 2001 [[Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing]] in [[Jerusalem]].\n\n=== ''[[The Exodus Decoded]]'' ===\nThe 2006 [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary was created by Jacobovici and the producer/director [[James Cameron]]. It explores evidence for the [[biblical]] account of [[the Exodus]]. Its claims and methods were widely criticized by Biblical scholars and by mainstream scientists.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2006/09/debunking-the-exodus-decoded.aspx|title=Debunking \"The Exodus Decoded\"|first=Bryant G.

In the documentary, the biblical [[plagues of Egypt]] are explained as having resulted from that eruption and a related [[limnic eruption]] in the [[Nile Delta]]. While much of Jacobovici's archaeological evidence for the Exodus comes from Egypt, some comes from [[Mycenae]] on Mainland Greece, such as a gold ornament that somewhat resembles the [[Ark of the Covenant]].\n\nThe documentary makes extensive use of computer animation and visual effects made by Gravity Visual Effects, Inc. It runs for 90 min and was first aired in [[Canada]] on April 16 ([[Easter Day]]), 2006 (''[[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel Canada]]''). It was shown in the [[United States]] on August 20, 2006 (''[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel US]]''), [[United Kingdom|UK]] on December 23, 2006 (''[[Discovery Channel (UK and Ireland)|Discovery Channel UK]]'') and [[Spain]] on December 25, 2006 ([[Cuatro (channel)|Cuatro]]).\n\n=== ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'' ===\nThe documentary was co-produced and first broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Vision TV]] in Canada on March 4, 2007, covering the discovery of the [[Talpiot Tomb]]. It was directed by Jacobovici and produced by Felix Golubev and [[Ric Esther Bienstock]], and [[James Cameron]] served as executive producer. It was released in conjunction with a book on the same subject, ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]'', issued in late February 2007 and co-authored by Jacobovici and [[Charles R. Pellegrino]]. The documentary and book has claims that are disputed by some [[archaeologists]] and [[theologians]] fields as well as some linguistic and biblical scholars.\n\n=== ''[[The Naked Archaeologist]]'' ===\nThe television show was produced for [[VisionTV]] in Canada and [[History International]] in the US and was hosted and prepared by Jacobovici and [[Avri Gilad]]. The show ultimately reviewed biblical stories and then tried to find proof for them by exploring the [[Holy Land]] looking for archaeological evidence, making personal inferences and deductions and interviewing scholars and experts. After its original run on [[VisionTV]], it was picked up in the U.S. by [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] and its sister network, [[History International]].\n\nThe episode \"A Nabatean by Any Other Name\" won the Special Jury Prize at the 8th International Archaeological Film Festival in [[Brussels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kineon.be/Palmares-2009.html|title=List of Award Winners, 2009 Festival International du Film Archaeologique de Bruxelles|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Finding Atlantis'' ===\nJacobovici was involved as executive producer<ref>[http://www.apltd.ca/films/display/57 Finding Atlantis - Apltd.]</ref> in the production of a documentary that was shown in March 2010 on the [[National Geographic Channel]]. He claimed that [[Atlantis]] had been found in Spain, and he said that evidence found by [[University of Hartford]] Professor Richard Freund included the unearthed emblem of Atlantis and that \"[[Tarshish]] is Atlantis itself\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Hartman|first=Ben|title=The deepest Jewish encampment?|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=212935|accessdate=22 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=20 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Atlantis Rising'' ===\nIn 2016, Jacobovici directed a documentary on Atlantis for National Geographic Channel; its executive producer was James Cameron.

According to the documentary, the group was conquered by neighbouring tribes in the 17th century and suffered persecution.\n\nAfter the documentary, during the Israeli [[Operation Moses]] ({{lang-he-n|\u05de\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e6\u05b8\u05e2 \u05de\u05b9\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d4}}, ''Mivtza Moshe''), the Falasha were evacuated from [[Sudan]] during a famine in 1984 and airlifted to Israel.\n\n=== ''Expulsion & Memory: Descendants of the Hidden Jews'' ===\nIn the 1996 documentary, Jacobovici studies the [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]] of [[New Mexico]] and tiny populations of Jewish descendants in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], known as ''nuevos Cristianos'' (\"new Christians\"). He explores the Jewish ancestry of the New Mexican Hispanic families now living in New Mexico and finds that many of them have always been aware of their Jewish heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfilm.org/Catalogue/films/expulsion.htm |title=Expulsion and Memory: Descendants of the Hidden Jews |publisher=Jewishfilm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===''The Struma''===\nIn the 2002 documentary, directed by Jacobovici, tells the story of {{MV|Struma}}, a small ship chartered to carry [[Jewish]] refugees from [[Axis powers|Axis]]-allied [[Romania]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] during [[World War II]].

Travelling from western [[Europe]] to [[China]] and [[India]], Jacobovici finds tantalizing evidence that the \"lost tribes\" are, like the tribe of Dan, not really lost. The tribe of Dan is the only original tribe of Israel not to be included in the [[Book of Revelation]]'s list of tribes that are sealed. No mention is made of why it is excluded.\n\n=== ''Impact of Terror'' ===\nThe 2004 documentary, produced by Jacobovici and directed by [[Tim Wolochatiuk]], is about Israeli victims of terrorism struggling to cope in the aftermath of the August 2001 [[Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing]] in [[Jerusalem]].\n\n=== ''[[The Exodus Decoded]]'' ===\nThe 2006 [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary was created by Jacobovici and the producer/director [[James Cameron]]. It explores evidence for the [[biblical]] account of [[the Exodus]]. Its claims and methods were widely criticized by Biblical scholars and by mainstream scientists.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2006/09/debunking-the-exodus-decoded.aspx|title=Debunking \"The Exodus Decoded\"|first=Bryant G.

In the documentary, the biblical [[plagues of Egypt]] are explained as having resulted from that eruption and a related [[limnic eruption]] in the [[Nile Delta]]. While much of Jacobovici's archaeological evidence for the Exodus comes from Egypt, some comes from [[Mycenae]] on Mainland Greece, such as a gold ornament that somewhat resembles the [[Ark of the Covenant]].\n\nThe documentary makes extensive use of computer animation and visual effects made by Gravity Visual Effects, Inc. It runs for 90 min and was first aired in [[Canada]] on April 16 ([[Easter Day]]), 2006 (''[[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel Canada]]''). It was shown in the [[United States]] on August 20, 2006 (''[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel US]]''), [[United Kingdom|UK]] on December 23, 2006 (''[[Discovery Channel (UK and Ireland)|Discovery Channel UK]]'') and [[Spain]] on December 25, 2006 ([[Cuatro (channel)|Cuatro]]).\n\n=== ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'' ===\nThe documentary was co-produced and first broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Vision TV]] in Canada on March 4, 2007, covering the discovery of the [[Talpiot Tomb]]. It was directed by Jacobovici and produced by Felix Golubev and [[Ric Esther Bienstock]], and [[James Cameron]] served as executive producer. It was released in conjunction with a book on the same subject, ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]'', issued in late February 2007 and co-authored by Jacobovici and [[Charles R. Pellegrino]]. The documentary and book has claims that are disputed by some [[archaeologists]] and [[theologians]] fields as well as some linguistic and biblical scholars.\n\n=== ''[[The Naked Archaeologist]]'' ===\nThe television show was produced for [[VisionTV]] in Canada and [[History International]] in the US and was hosted and prepared by Jacobovici and [[Avri Gilad]]. The show ultimately reviewed biblical stories and then tried to find proof for them by exploring the [[Holy Land]] looking for archaeological evidence, making personal inferences and deductions and interviewing scholars and experts. After its original run on [[VisionTV]], it was picked up in the U.S. by [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] and its sister network, [[History International]].\n\nThe episode \"A Nabatean by Any Other Name\" won the Special Jury Prize at the 8th International Archaeological Film Festival in [[Brussels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kineon.be/Palmares-2009.html|title=List of Award Winners, 2009 Festival International du Film Archaeologique de Bruxelles|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Finding Atlantis'' ===\nJacobovici was involved as executive producer<ref>[http://www.apltd.ca/films/display/57 Finding Atlantis - Apltd.]</ref> in the production of a documentary that was shown in March 2010 on the [[National Geographic Channel]]. He claimed that [[Atlantis]] had been found in Spain, and he said that evidence found by [[University of Hartford]] Professor Richard Freund included the unearthed emblem of Atlantis and that \"[[Tarshish]] is Atlantis itself\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Hartman|first=Ben|title=The deepest Jewish encampment?|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=212935|accessdate=22 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=20 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Atlantis Rising'' ===\nIn 2016, Jacobovici directed a documentary on Atlantis for National Geographic Channel; its executive producer was James Cameron.

In the pre-Reformation Tudor years, the site was used not only for religious but also for political functions, such as the annulment trial of [[Catherine of Aragon]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] which, some eight decades later, would be reenacted in the same room by Shakespeare's company.<ref>''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', apparently a collaboration between Shakespeare and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], probably dates to 1613.</ref> After Henry's [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|expropriation]] of monastic property, the monastery became the property of the crown; control of the property was granted to [[Thomas Cawarden|Sir Thomas Cawarden]], [[Master of the Revels]]. Cawarden used part of the monastery as Revels offices; other parts he sold or leased to the neighbourhood's wealthy residents, including [[William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]] and [[John Cheke]]. After Cawarden's death in 1559, the property was sold by Lady Cawarden to [[William More (died 1600)|Sir William More]].  In 1576, [[Richard Farrant]], then Master of [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle|Windsor Chapel]] leased part of the former [[buttery (shop)|buttery]] from More in order to stage plays. As often in the theatrical practice of the time, this commercial enterprise was justified by the convenient fiction of royal necessity; Farrant claimed to need the space for his child choristers to practice plays for the Queen, but he also staged plays for paying audiences. The theatre was small, perhaps {{convert|46|ft|m}} long and {{convert|25|ft|m}} wide, and admission, compared to public theatres, expensive (apparently four [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]]); both these factors limited attendance at the theatre to a fairly select group of well-to-do gentry and nobles.\n\nFor his playing company, Farrant combined his Windsor children with the Children of the [[Chapel Royal]], then directed by [[William Hunnis]]. On Farrant's death in 1580, Hunnis took on John Newman as a partner and they subleased the property from Farrant's widow, putting up a \u00a3100 bond on the promise to promptly pay the rent and to make needed repairs. But the venture did not go well financially, which put Farrant's widow in jeopardy of defaulting on the rent to More. In November 1583, Farrant brought suit against Hunnis and Newman for default on the bond. To escape a suit by her or More, Hunnis and Newman transferred their sublease to [[Henry Evans (theatre)|Henry Evans]], a Welsh [[scrivener]] and theatrical affectionado. This unauthorised assignment of the sublease gave More an excuse to bring suit to retake possession of the property, but Evans used legal delays and finally escaped legal action by selling the sublease to [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]], sometime after [[Michaelmas term#The legal year|Michaelmas Term]] (November) of 1583, who then gave it to his secretary, the writer [[John Lyly]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1964|pp=150\u20131}}.</ref>\n\nAs proprietor of the playhouse, Lyly installed Evans as the manager of the new company of [[Oxford's Boys]], composed of the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul's, and turned his talents to play writing. Lyly's [[Campaspe (play)|''Campaspe'']] was performed at Blackfriars <ref name=\"Bond, III, p. 310\">Bond, III, p. 310.</ref> and subsequently at Court on New Year's Day 1584; likewise, his ''[[Sapho and Phao]]'' was produced first at Blackfriars on Shrove Tuesday<ref name=\"Bond, III, p. 310\"/> and then at court on 3 March, with Lyly listed as the payee for both Court appearances. In November 1583, Hunnis, still Master of the Chapel Children, successfully petitioned the Queen to increase the stipend to house, feed, and clothe the company. More finally obtained a legal judgement voiding the original lease at the end of [[Easter term|Easter Term]] (June) of 1584, thereby ending the First Blackfriars Playhouse after eight years and postponing the performance of Lyly's third play, ''[[Gallathea]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1964|pp=151\u20132}}; {{Harvnb|Hunter|2004}}.</ref>\n\n==Second theatre==\n[[File:Blackfriars theatre conjectural reconstruction 1921.png|thumb|250px|Conjectural reconstruction of the second Blackfriars Theatre from contemporary documents.]]\nThe second Blackfriars was an indoor theatre built elsewhere on the property at the instigation of [[James Burbage]], father of [[Richard Burbage]], and [[impresario]] of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]].  In 1596, Burbage purchased, for \u00a3600, the [[refectory|frater]] of the former priory and rooms below. This large space, perhaps {{convert|100|ft|m}} long and 50 wide (15 metres), with high ceilings allowed Burbage to construct two galleries, substantially increasing potential attendance. The nature of Burbage's modifications to his purchase is not clear, and the many contemporary references to the theatre do not offer a precise picture of its design. Once fitted for playing, the space may have been about {{convert|69|ft|m}} long and {{convert|46|ft|m}} wide (20 by 14 metres), including [[Green room|tiring areas]]. There were at least two and possibly three galleries, and perhaps a number of stage boxes adjacent to the stage. Estimates of its capacity have varied from below 600 to almost 1000, depending on the number of galleries and boxes.<ref>In 1609 [[Francis Beaumont]] described the Blackfriars as a place in which \"a thousand men in judgment sit\"\u2014Gurr, p. 213. His figure may be hyperbole.</ref> Perhaps as many as ten spectators would have encumbered the stage.\n\nAs Burbage built, however, a petition from the residents of the wealthy neighbourhood persuaded the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] to forbid playing there; the letter was signed even by [[George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon|Lord Hunsdon]], patron of Burbage's company, and by [[Richard Field (printer)|Richard Field]], the Blackfriars printer and hometown neighbour of [[William Shakespeare]].<ref>Stopes, p. 12.</ref> The company was absolutely forbidden to perform there. Three years later, Richard Burbage was able to lease the property to [[Henry Evans (theatre)|Henry Evans]], who had been among those ejected more than fifteen years earlier. Evans entered a partnership with [[Nathaniel Giles]], Hunnis's successor at the Chapel Royal. They used the theatre for a commercial enterprise with a group called the [[Children of the Chapel]], which combined the choristers of the chapel with other boys, many taken up from local grammar schools under colour of Giles's warrant to provide entertainment for the Queen. The dubious legality of these dramatic [[impressment]]s led to a challenge from a father in 1600; however, this method brought the company some of its most famous actors, including [[Nathan Field|Nathaniel Field]] and [[Salmon Pavy]].  The residents did not protest at this use, probably because of perceived social differences between the adult and child companies.\n\nWhile it housed this company, Blackfriars was the site of an explosion of innovative drama and staging. Together with its competitor, Paul's Children, the Blackfriars company produced plays by a number of the most talented young dramatists of [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] literature, among them [[Thomas Middleton]], [[Ben Jonson]], [[George Chapman]], and [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]].  Chapman and Jonson wrote almost exclusively for Blackfriars in this period, while Marston began with Paul's but switched to Blackfriars, in which he appears to have been a sharer, by around 1605. In the latter half of the decade, the company at Blackfriars premiered plays by [[Francis Beaumont]] (''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'') and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] (''[[The Faithful Shepherdess]]'') that, although failures in their first production, marked the first significant appearance of these two dramatists, whose work would profoundly affect early Stuart drama.  The new plays of all these playwrights deliberately pushed the accepted boundaries of personal and social satire, of violence on stage, and of sexual frankness. These plays appear to have attracted members of a higher social class than was the norm at the [[Bankside]] and [[Shoreditch]] theatres, and the admission price ([[British sixpence coin|sixpence]] for a cheap seat) probably excluded the poorer patrons of the amphitheatres. Prefaces and internal references speak of gallants and [[Inns of Court]] men, who came not only to see a play but also, of course, to be seen; the private theatres sold seats on the stage itself.\n\nThe Blackfriars playhouse was also the source of other innovations which would profoundly change the nature of English commercial staging: it was among the first commercial theatrical enterprises to rely on artificial lighting, and it featured music between acts, a practice which the induction to Marston's ''[[The Malcontent]]'' (1604) indicates was not common in the public theatres at that time.\n\nIn the years around the turn of the century, the children's companies were something of a phenomenon; a reference in ''[[Hamlet]]'' to \"little eyasses\" suggests that even the adult companies felt threatened by them. By the later half of that decade, the fashion had changed somewhat. In 1608, Burbage's company (by this time, the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]) took possession of the theatre, which they still owned, this time without objections from the neighbourhood. There were originally seven sharers in the reorganised theatre: Richard Burbage, William Shakespeare, [[Henry Condell]], [[John Heminges]], and [[William Sly]], all members of the King's Men, plus [[Cuthbert Burbage]] and Thomas Evans, agent for the theatre manager Henry Evans. This arrangement of shareholders (or \"housekeepers) was similar to how the [[Globe Theatre]] was operated.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sly, however, died soon after the arrangement was made, and his share was divided among the other six.\n\nAfter renovations, the King's Men began using the theatre for performances in 1609. Thereafter the King's Men played in Blackfriars for the seven months in winter, and at the Globe during the summer. Blackfriars appears to have brought in a little over twice the revenue of the Globe; the shareholders could earn as much as \u00a313 from a single performance, apart from what went to the actors.<ref>Cook, p. 210.</ref>\n\nIn the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], even [[Queen Henrietta Maria]] was in the Blackfriars audience. On 13 May 1634 she and her attendants saw a play by [[Philip Massinger]]; in late 1635 or early 1636 they saw [[Lodowick Carlell]]'s ''Arviragus and Philicia, part 2;'' and they attended a third performance in May 1636.<ref>Cook, p. 115.</ref>\n\nThe theatre closed at the onset of the [[English Civil War]], and was demolished on 6 August 1655.<ref>Halliday, p. 235.</ref>\n\n==Reconstructions==\n\n===Blackfriars Playhouse===\nThe [[American Shakespeare Center]]'s [[Blackfriars Playhouse]] in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], [[Virginia]], is a re-creation of a Jacobean theatre based on what is known of the original Blackfriars.<ref name=Menzer>{{Cite book |chapter=Afterword: Discovery Spaces?

In the pre-Reformation Tudor years, the site was used not only for religious but also for political functions, such as the annulment trial of [[Catherine of Aragon]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] which, some eight decades later, would be reenacted in the same room by Shakespeare's company.<ref>''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', apparently a collaboration between Shakespeare and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], probably dates to 1613.</ref> After Henry's [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|expropriation]] of monastic property, the monastery became the property of the crown; control of the property was granted to [[Thomas Cawarden|Sir Thomas Cawarden]], [[Master of the Revels]]. Cawarden used part of the monastery as Revels offices; other parts he sold or leased to the neighbourhood's wealthy residents, including [[William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]] and [[John Cheke]]. After Cawarden's death in 1559, the property was sold by Lady Cawarden to [[William More (died 1600)|Sir William More]].  In 1576, [[Richard Farrant]], then Master of [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle|Windsor Chapel]] leased part of the former [[buttery (shop)|buttery]] from More in order to stage plays. As often in the theatrical practice of the time, this commercial enterprise was justified by the convenient fiction of royal necessity; Farrant claimed to need the space for his child choristers to practice plays for the Queen, but he also staged plays for paying audiences. The theatre was small, perhaps {{convert|46|ft|m}} long and {{convert|25|ft|m}} wide, and admission, compared to public theatres, expensive (apparently four [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]]); both these factors limited attendance at the theatre to a fairly select group of well-to-do gentry and nobles.\n\nFor his playing company, Farrant combined his Windsor children with the Children of the [[Chapel Royal]], then directed by [[William Hunnis]]. On Farrant's death in 1580, Hunnis took on John Newman as a partner and they subleased the property from Farrant's widow, putting up a \u00a3100 bond on the promise to promptly pay the rent and to make needed repairs. But the venture did not go well financially, which put Farrant's widow in jeopardy of defaulting on the rent to More. In November 1583, Farrant brought suit against Hunnis and Newman for default on the bond. To escape a suit by her or More, Hunnis and Newman transferred their sublease to [[Henry Evans (theatre)|Henry Evans]], a Welsh [[scrivener]] and theatrical affectionado. This unauthorised assignment of the sublease gave More an excuse to bring suit to retake possession of the property, but Evans used legal delays and finally escaped legal action by selling the sublease to [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]], sometime after [[Michaelmas term#The legal year|Michaelmas Term]] (November) of 1583, who then gave it to his secretary, the writer [[John Lyly]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1964|pp=150\u20131}}.</ref>\n\nAs proprietor of the playhouse, Lyly installed Evans as the manager of the new company of [[Oxford's Boys]], composed of the Children of the Chapel and the Children of Paul's, and turned his talents to play writing. Lyly's [[Campaspe (play)|''Campaspe'']] was performed at Blackfriars <ref name=\"Bond, III, p. 310\">Bond, III, p. 310.</ref> and subsequently at Court on New Year's Day 1584; likewise, his ''[[Sapho and Phao]]'' was produced first at Blackfriars on Shrove Tuesday<ref name=\"Bond, III, p. 310\"/> and then at court on 3 March, with Lyly listed as the payee for both Court appearances. In November 1583, Hunnis, still Master of the Chapel Children, successfully petitioned the Queen to increase the stipend to house, feed, and clothe the company. More finally obtained a legal judgement voiding the original lease at the end of [[Easter term|Easter Term]] (June) of 1584, thereby ending the First Blackfriars Playhouse after eight years and postponing the performance of Lyly's third play, ''[[Gallathea]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1964|pp=151\u20132}}; {{Harvnb|Hunter|2004}}.</ref>\n\n==Second theatre==\n[[File:Blackfriars theatre conjectural reconstruction 1921.png|thumb|250px|Conjectural reconstruction of the second Blackfriars Theatre from contemporary documents.]]\nThe second Blackfriars was an indoor theatre built elsewhere on the property at the instigation of [[James Burbage]], father of [[Richard Burbage]], and [[impresario]] of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]].  In 1596, Burbage purchased, for \u00a3600, the [[refectory|frater]] of the former priory and rooms below. This large space, perhaps {{convert|100|ft|m}} long and 50 wide (15 metres), with high ceilings allowed Burbage to construct two galleries, substantially increasing potential attendance. The nature of Burbage's modifications to his purchase is not clear, and the many contemporary references to the theatre do not offer a precise picture of its design. Once fitted for playing, the space may have been about {{convert|69|ft|m}} long and {{convert|46|ft|m}} wide (20 by 14 metres), including [[Green room|tiring areas]]. There were at least two and possibly three galleries, and perhaps a number of stage boxes adjacent to the stage. Estimates of its capacity have varied from below 600 to almost 1000, depending on the number of galleries and boxes.<ref>In 1609 [[Francis Beaumont]] described the Blackfriars as a place in which \"a thousand men in judgment sit\"\u2014Gurr, p. 213. His figure may be hyperbole.</ref> Perhaps as many as ten spectators would have encumbered the stage.\n\nAs Burbage built, however, a petition from the residents of the wealthy neighbourhood persuaded the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] to forbid playing there; the letter was signed even by [[George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon|Lord Hunsdon]], patron of Burbage's company, and by [[Richard Field (printer)|Richard Field]], the Blackfriars printer and hometown neighbour of [[William Shakespeare]].<ref>Stopes, p. 12.</ref> The company was absolutely forbidden to perform there. Three years later, Richard Burbage was able to lease the property to [[Henry Evans (theatre)|Henry Evans]], who had been among those ejected more than fifteen years earlier. Evans entered a partnership with [[Nathaniel Giles]], Hunnis's successor at the Chapel Royal. They used the theatre for a commercial enterprise with a group called the [[Children of the Chapel]], which combined the choristers of the chapel with other boys, many taken up from local grammar schools under colour of Giles's warrant to provide entertainment for the Queen. The dubious legality of these dramatic [[impressment]]s led to a challenge from a father in 1600; however, this method brought the company some of its most famous actors, including [[Nathan Field|Nathaniel Field]] and [[Salmon Pavy]].  The residents did not protest at this use, probably because of perceived social differences between the adult and child companies.\n\nWhile it housed this company, Blackfriars was the site of an explosion of innovative drama and staging. Together with its competitor, Paul's Children, the Blackfriars company produced plays by a number of the most talented young dramatists of [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] literature, among them [[Thomas Middleton]], [[Ben Jonson]], [[George Chapman]], and [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]].  Chapman and Jonson wrote almost exclusively for Blackfriars in this period, while Marston began with Paul's but switched to Blackfriars, in which he appears to have been a sharer, by around 1605. In the latter half of the decade, the company at Blackfriars premiered plays by [[Francis Beaumont]] (''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'') and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] (''[[The Faithful Shepherdess]]'') that, although failures in their first production, marked the first significant appearance of these two dramatists, whose work would profoundly affect early Stuart drama.  The new plays of all these playwrights deliberately pushed the accepted boundaries of personal and social satire, of violence on stage, and of sexual frankness. These plays appear to have attracted members of a higher social class than was the norm at the [[Bankside]] and [[Shoreditch]] theatres, and the admission price ([[British sixpence coin|sixpence]] for a cheap seat) probably excluded the poorer patrons of the amphitheatres. Prefaces and internal references speak of gallants and [[Inns of Court]] men, who came not only to see a play but also, of course, to be seen; the private theatres sold seats on the stage itself.\n\nThe Blackfriars playhouse was also the source of other innovations which would profoundly change the nature of English commercial staging: it was among the first commercial theatrical enterprises to rely on artificial lighting, and it featured music between acts, a practice which the induction to Marston's ''[[The Malcontent]]'' (1604) indicates was not common in the public theatres at that time.\n\nIn the years around the turn of the century, the children's companies were something of a phenomenon; a reference in ''[[Hamlet]]'' to \"little eyasses\" suggests that even the adult companies felt threatened by them. By the later half of that decade, the fashion had changed somewhat. In 1608, Burbage's company (by this time, the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]) took possession of the theatre, which they still owned, this time without objections from the neighbourhood. There were originally seven sharers in the reorganised theatre: Richard Burbage, William Shakespeare, [[Henry Condell]], [[John Heminges]], and [[William Sly]], all members of the King's Men, plus [[Cuthbert Burbage]] and Thomas Evans, agent for the theatre manager Henry Evans. This arrangement of shareholders (or \"housekeepers) was similar to how the [[Globe Theatre]] was operated.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sly, however, died soon after the arrangement was made, and his share was divided among the other six.\n\nAfter renovations, the King's Men began using the theatre for performances in 1609. Thereafter the King's Men played in Blackfriars for the seven months in winter, and at the Globe during the summer. Blackfriars appears to have brought in a little over twice the revenue of the Globe; the shareholders could earn as much as \u00a313 from a single performance, apart from what went to the actors.<ref>Cook, p. 210.</ref>\n\nIn the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], even [[Queen Henrietta Maria]] was in the Blackfriars audience. On 13 May 1634 she and her attendants saw a play by [[Philip Massinger]]; in late 1635 or early 1636 they saw [[Lodowick Carlell]]'s ''Arviragus and Philicia, part 2;'' and they attended a third performance in May 1636.<ref>Cook, p. 115.</ref>\n\nThe theatre closed at the onset of the [[English Civil War]], and was demolished on 6 August 1655.<ref>Halliday, p. 235.</ref>\n\n==Reconstructions==\n\n===Blackfriars Playhouse===\nThe [[American Shakespeare Center]]'s [[Blackfriars Playhouse]] in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], [[Virginia]], is a re-creation of a Jacobean theatre based on what is known of the original Blackfriars.<ref name=Menzer>{{Cite book |chapter=Afterword: Discovery Spaces?

Women's Snooker Championship]]''' was a women's [[snooker]] tournament held in 1997.\n\n==Tournament summary==\nThe tournament started as the 1996 [[World Women's Snooker Championship|World Championship]], but due to delays in the scheduling of the later rounds, it became the 1997 Championship. It was promoted by [[Barry Hearn]]<ref name=WTOH /> who had been promoting the Women's world championship since [[1990 Women's World Snooker Championship|1990]].<ref name=LATE /> The defending champion was [[Karen Corr]]. There were 52 players who entered the tournament. [[Allison Fisher]] who had won the title seven times, most recently in 1994, did not enter as she has moved to the [[United States]] where she had embarked on a successful [[pool (sports)|pool]] career. 1984 amateur champion and five-times runner-up [[Stacey Hillyard]] had retired from competition and so was another non-participant. The original schedule was for the quarter-finals onwards to be held in [[India]], as they had been in 1994 and 1995,<ref name=LATE /> from 16 to 19 September 1996,<ref name=MTPI /> but eventually the final rounds took place in [[Llanelli]], with the semi-finals and final not happening until well into 1997.\n\nThis was the last women's world snooker championship to be held before the [[World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association]] amalgamated with the [[WPBSA]] later in 1997.<ref name=YSSP>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  |date=24 October 1997 |title=Young Stevens silences Parrott  |work=The Guardian |page=B11 |via=ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Guardian and The Observer. Retrieved 6 December 2019.}}</ref>\n\n===Rounds 1 to 4===\nThe tournament started as the 1996 World Championship. The first four rounds took place at Raunds Cue Sports Club, [[Northamptonshire]], to decide the eight players that would go on to contest the quarter-finals onwards, which were expected to be played in Bombay in mid-September 1996. Defending champion [[Karen Corr]] won her first match without losing a {{cuegloss|frame}} but won only on the final black in the deciding frame of her match against [[Lynette Horsburgh]]. Second seed [[Kelly Fisher]] and 1995 runner-up [[Kim Shaw (snooker player)|Kim Shaw]] both won both of their matches 4\u20130. Mary Talbot, ranked 26th, was a surprising quarter-finalist, beating 7th seed Sarah Smith and 12th ranked player Helen Audus. The highest break in the main qualifying was a 77 by [[Ann-Marie Farren]]. A plate competition was held for players who did not qualify to the quarter finals and was won by Horsburgh, who made a break of 100 in the first round of the plate competition.<ref name=MTPI>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Mary Talbot's passage to India |magazine=Snooker Scene |page=14 |publisher=Everton's News Agency |issue=September 1996}}</ref>\n\n===Quarter-finals===\nFollowing postponements of the final stages and a lack of response from promoter Barry Hearn's partner in India, it was decided to hold the quarter-finals at the Terry Griffiths Matchroom, [[Llanelli]], and they took place in November 1996. Corr [[whitewash (sport)|whitewashed]] 1984 professional champion [[Mandy Fisher]] 4\u20130. Banks saw off 1987 champion Farren 4\u20132, and Lisa Quick beat Shaw 4\u20131. Fisher's match with Talbot was delayed due to Talbot's illness, with Fisher winning 4\u20131. Meanwhile, Hearn requested the termination of his contract with the [[WLBSA]] to promote the event in future.<ref name=WTOH>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=World title on hold |magazine=Snooker Scene |page=37 |publisher=Everton's News Agency |issue=December 1996}}</ref>\n\n===Semi-finals and Final===\nThe semi-finals and final were eventually scheduled to be held in Llanelli in mid-1997, following a continued lack of communication from Hearn's partner in India. Corr made the highest break of the competition, 87, and three other breaks over 30 in overcoming Banks 5\u20130. Quick won the first frame against Fisher, but no more, losing 1\u20135. The final between Corr and Fisher was closely contested until 3\u20133 but then Corr won three frames in a row to take her third world title. The tournament finished some eleven months after the start of the qualifying matches, and was the end of promoter Hearn's relationship with women's snooker that stretched back to 1990.<ref name=LATE>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Karen Corr wins 1996 world title a little late |magazine=Snooker Scene |pages=12\u201313 |publisher=Everton's News Agency |issue=July 1997}}</ref> \n\nThis was the last world championship to be held before the amalgamation of the [[World Ladies Billiards and Snooker Association]] with the [[WPBSA]] a few months later. The intention was that major finals for women should be played at the same venues as the men's events, for example the womens' world championship final being held at the [[Crucible Theatre]] during the [[World Snooker Championship]].<ref name=YSSP />\n\n==Results==\nSource: Snooker Scene<ref name=WTOH /><ref name=LATE /><ref name=MTPI />\n===First round===\nAt Raunds Cue Sports Club.
