The title characters, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], shared the focus of the book. The series was launched following the cancellation of the characters' previous ongoing solo series. The book's mix of humor, action, and intricate plotting have won it a devoted fanbase. Marvel Comics canceled the series with issue #50 to make way for a new ''[[Deadpool (comic book)|Deadpool]]'' ongoing series that began on September 10, 2008, and a new Cable ongoing series that was launched in March 2008. Cable & Deadpool were ranked #7 on Marvel.com's list of \"The 10 Greatest Buddy Teams\" of all time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/news/story/2641/take_10_marvels_best_buddy_teams | title=Take 10: Marvel's Best Buddy Teams | last=Morse | first=Ben | work=Marvel.com | date=June 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Main characters==\n*'''Cable''' ('''Nathan Dayspring Askani\u2019son Summers''') is the time-traveling son of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]] (a clone of [[Jean Grey]]). Cable, having [https://www.quirkybyte.com/blog/2018/01/super-cool-things-deadpools-cable/ mutant powers] and knowing what the future could be, is trying to bring about a better world.\n*'''Deadpool''' ('''Wade Wilson''') is a talkative mercenary for hire known as the \"Merc with a Mouth\". Like Wolverine, he is a subject of the [[Weapon X]] experiment for which he volunteered in the hopes of finding a cure for his [[cancer]]. Although he received an enhanced body from the project, the cancer was not cured, he went insane, and his skin became covered in hideous scars. Deadpool helps to further Cable's plans, sometimes unwittingly.\n\n==Minor and recurring characters==\n* [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] (Alex Hayden) was injected with the \"American Gene\" during a botched mission infiltrating a [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] base, making him incredibly obese. He appointed Deadpool as the head of his mercenary organization, Agency X, while he is getting back in shape.\n* The [[Black Box (comics)|Black Box]] (Garabed Bashur), a one-time information broker, worked for Cable in hopes of changing the world. He was killed by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].\n* [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]] is an average HYDRA agent pressed into service by Deadpool during his mission to rescue Agent X. He now works with Agency X.\n* [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] is the on/off confidante, lover, and teammate of Cable. She knows Cable better than most and is scared and excited about what might happen if he succeeds.\n* [[Nick Fury]] is the former Director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Fury appears early in the series after Cable threatens to use his out-of-control telekinesis to throw all the world's nuclear weapons into space. Later, he sends [[Captain America]] to infiltrate Providence.\n* [[Prester John (comics)|Prester John]], time-displaced from the past, operates Providence's multi-religious studies program and occasionally ends up fighting to defend Providence.\n* Johann Kriek, a former [[Interpol]] operative, is now the Chief of Security for Providence.\n* [[Irene Merryweather]], a former reporter for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', is now the Chief of Staff on Providence and Cable's chronicler.\n* Rabbi Rosen is a [[Rabbi]] aboard Providence.

Weasel aids in some of Deadpool's activities.\n* [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]] (Inez Temple) is an attractive and short-tempered mercenary from [[Texas]] who is currently employed by Agency X. She is a mutant with enhanced durability, speed, and incredible accuracy with firearms (even rivaling [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in terms of targeting skills). She is a descendant of the [[Outlaw Kid]] and dresses in a [[cowgirl]] motif.\n* [[Sandi Brandenberg]] is the secretary of Agency X, as well as a former love interest to both Deadpool and Agent X. She is currently the girlfriend of the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. She was recently kidnapped and kept bound and gagged along with Outlaw by T-Ray, but was rescued by Deadpool.\n* [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]] is a group of mercenaries hired by S.H.I.E.L.D. to watch over Cable.

Bridge]], [[Hammer (comics)|Hammer]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Solo (Marvel Comics)|Solo]], [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]], and [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]].\n\n==Features==\n\n=== Recap page===\nStarting with issue #11, ''Cable & Deadpool'' opens each book with a unique recap page. This page, usually presented by Deadpool and occasionally with Cable or by/with the book's supporting characters, villains, and guest stars, breaks the [[fourth wall]] and literally talks to the audience. Keeping with the book's tone, the recap page is usually funny, often with Deadpool having to explain what the fourth wall is to other characters on the page. From issue #44, the recap pages have been in the form of an online [[blog]] as written by Bob, Agent of HYDRA.\n\n===Dear Deadpool===\nIssue #13 saw the start of \"Dear Deadpool\", a letters page seemingly hosted by Deadpool himself. Like the recap page, \"Dear Deadpool\" is often comical and has Deadpool breaking the fourth wall. In this section, Deadpool frequently refers to not only the characters in this comic, but often mentions (and makes fun of) the creators, as well as various conventions of Marvel Comics and the comics industry in general. He even goes so far as to refer to \"the man who types my answers\". A running gag features Deadpool's excitement over a typical feature of comic book fan letters: a numbered list of questions. This would prompt the response, \"Ooh, numbered questions!\" In 2006, ''[[Wizard Magazine]]'' named \"Dear Deadpool\" as \"the Funniest Letters Page in Comics\".\n\n==Story arcs==\n\n;If Looks Could Kill\n\"If Looks Could Kill\" (issues #1-6) brings Cable and Deadpool together (literally). In this first story arc, Deadpool is hired by \"The One World Church\" to steal a virus that will allow them to turn everyone on Earth blue. Meanwhile, Cable is trying to figure how to best use his newly enhanced mutant powers to help change the world. Through a series of events, both Cable and Deadpool end up back at \"The One World Church\" where they are both infected by the virus. In order for them both to survive, Cable absorbs and then throws up Deadpool which ends up mixing their [[DNA]]. Cable eventually takes control of the virus and uses it to turn the entire world pink. A couple of days later, Cable restores everyone to their original color, and takes credit for this calling himself their \"Saviour\". During this, Cable uses his enhanced powers to rebuild his space station, [[Graymalkin]], which includes a teleportation system. Because of the mixing of their DNA, both Cable and Deadpool can [[Teleportation|teleport]], but when one does it he takes the other with him.\n\n;Burnt offering\nIn \"The Burnt Offering\" (issues #7-10, originally known as \"The Passion of the Cable\"), Cable continues with his plan to espouse a philosophy of moderation, and offers invitations to the world's top thinkers, scientists and philosophers to live on [[Providence (comics)|Providence]] (the recently rebuilt Graymalkin) in the face of a nervous [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Delivering a stark message to the world's leaders, he deliberately sets them all against him by threatening to throw their missiles into the sun. Meanwhile, the [[Astonishing X-Men|X-Men]], including Cable\u2019s father [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], hire Deadpool to gather pieces of a mini-teleporter in order to stop Cable. After they mounted an attack on Providence, Cable confesses to Deadpool that he'd wanted to be killed in order to set an example of how the world could work together, even if it were against him. After being injured by the [[Silver Surfer]], Cable has Deadpool use the mini-teleporter to [[lobotomy|lobotomize]] Cable in order to save him from burning out as [[X-Man]] had. With the last of his powers, Cable left the world a final message of what the world could be if everyone tried a bit harder to make it a better place.\n\n[[File:Cabledeadpool12.jpg|thumb|left|Cover to ''Cable & Deadpool'' #12<br>Art by Patrick Zircher]]\n\n;Thirty pieces\nDuring \"Thirty Pieces\" (issues #11-12), Deadpool goes on a quest to save Cable\u2019s life. After obtaining a techno-organic alien from [[MODOK]], Deadpool tracks down the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] in hopes that he would be able to fix Cable. Along the way, Deadpool battles [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] who was hired by what appears to be a religious organization to track Deadpool in order to prevent the \u2018resurrection\u2019 of Cable. After having the alien grafted to his body, Cable, who is comatose and trapped in a dreamscape with the [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]], overcomes the alien\u2019s brain and heals himself, though he still extremely depowered.\n\n;Murder in Paradise\n\"A Murder in Paradise\" (issues #13-14) starts on Providence with the murder mystery of Haji Bin Barat, the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist. Deadpool insists on being involved in the investigation, but [[Irene Merryweather]] takes charge.  Eventually Deadpool, and everyone else, realizes that he was the only person that could have killed Barat. Following a fight with [[Prester John (comics)|Prestor John]], Cable confronts Deadpool, who admits he cannot remember killing Barat. Although Cable wants to help Deadpool, he tells him he has to leave the island until he gets back from a mission with [[X-Force]]. Deadpool leaves Providence in search of the [[Black Box (comics)|Black Box]] whom he hopes can find a way to kill him.\n \n[[File:CableDeadpool17.jpg|thumb|From ''Cable & Deadpool'' #17<br>Art by Patrick Zircher.]]\n\n;Enema of the State\n\"Enema of the State\" (issues #15-18) takes place after the end of the ''[[X-Force]]'' miniseries where Cable vanished after defeating the mutant-hunting [[Skornn]]. After finding and being brainwashed by the Black Box to kill Cable, Deadpool returns to Providence where he finds [[Siryn]] and '[[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]' (Deadpool loses some respect for Sam Guthrie on learning his true codename) who are also looking for Cable. With the help of [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], Deadpool uses a modified version of the teleportation device to track down Cable through various dimensions with Siryn and Cannonball following three minutes behind. The group travels through these dimensions finding Cable as a [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (comics)|Horseman of Apocalypse]] (War); a messiah-like, benevolent dictator; and the central conscience of a [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] invasion of Earth. Finally in the [[House of M]] reality, Deadpool finds a baby version of Cable in the care of [[Mister Sinister]]. After the ''House of M'' reality fades, Cable starts to age and his memory is restored. He then burns out his restored powers to \u2018fix\u2019 Deadpool\u2019s mind. With Cable depowered and still in his teens, Deadpool teleports them both to [[Intercourse, PA]].\n\n;Why, When I Was Your Age\n\"Why, When I Was Your Age...\" (issue #19) picks up with Deadpool taking Cable to Intercourse, PA, with hopes that the city will live up to its name. While at a bar, Cable talks about growing up in the future, and Deadpool discusses the death of his father. At the end of the night, Cable is fully aged, and neither of the two wish to discuss what actually happened in their past.\n\n;Bosom Buddies\nIn \"Bosom Buddies\" (issues #20-23), Deadpool is hired to steal the Dominus Objective, a secondary hard drive that acts like a virus that acts like a server. While Deadpool is out to steal the Objective, he ends up fighting both the [[BAD Girls, Inc.|B.A.D. Girls]], [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] only to discover that the [[Dominus Project]] had already been stolen. Later, The B.A.D. Girls confront [[Shen Kuei]] (The Cat) who actually stole the Dominus Objective. The Cat reveals to them it was the Black Box who hired him originally, though it was Cable who paid him, as well as who hired them and Deadpool. In the final confrontation, Cable links with Dominus Objective which gives him a new power similar to his telepathy. When everything is settled, Black Box decides to work for Cable.\n\n;Sticky Situations and Living Legends\nIn \"Sticky Situations\" and \"Living Legends\" (issues #24 & 25), Deadpool is hired to steal plans for a secret government project called the \"Cone of Silence\", which was originally designed as a force field to cut off Providence from the rest of the world. During his escapades, Deadpool ends up briefly fighting [[Spider-Man]] before finally getting the plans. After realizing that it was probably Cable who had the plans stolen, Nick Fury sends [[Captain America]] to infiltrate Providence. Captain America finds Providence to be a peaceful place and learns of Cable's past and his plans to change the future. During a fight between Cable and Captain America, Cable reveals that he has used the \"Cone of Silence\" to create a technological replacement for his [[telekinesis]].\n\n;Born Again\nIn \"Born Again\" (issues #26 & 27), the story reveals the hidden past connections between Apocalypse and Cable, specifically that it was Cable who infected Apocalypse with the techno-organic virus that Apocalypse would pass on to Cable as an infant.\n\n;The Domino Principle\nIn \"The Domino Principle\" (issues #28 & 29), Cable employs Deadpool to remove [[Flag-Smasher]] as the ruler of [[Rumekistan]]. Flag-Smasher had become ruler in the mini-series ''[[Citizen V]] & The V-Battalion: The Everlasting'', also written by Fabian Nicieza. The coup becomes complicated with the separate interferences of Citizen V and Cable's old love interest, Domino. Although Cable successfully manipulates Domino into assassinating Flag-Smasher, he finds his own resolve shaken when faced with his ex-lover's doubts about his agenda.\n\n;Civil War\nIn the \"Civil War\" story arc, Deadpool has been given the job of hunting down super-powered individuals who have not signed the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. There is a confrontation between Cable and Deadpool in which Cable reveals that he will be fostering superheroes in Providence. When Cable meets Captain America to extend this offer, Cap refuses. Cable tries to convince him by revealing what he knows about the Secret Avengers' secret identities. This gesture does not go unnoticed by Deadpool, who is watching them from a nearby rooftop and notes [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]'s new identity. He attacks Daredevil in a warehouse, and is himself attacked by members of the Secret Avengers and the [[Young Avengers]]. Cable attempts to intervene and convince Deadpool to join their cause by offering him a bigger paycheck (and when Deadpool refuses, a bigger badge). This fails when Deadpool tries to shoot Cable with tranquilizer darts, which Cable deflects into Wade's face. Wade wakes up bound and gagged (with a full body covering of duct tape, after Cable suggested an entire roll for his mouth alone) in the warehouse before Cable reappears, setting him free and taking him along to the White House to meet with the American President about the possible repercussions of the superhero registration act. When the President orders hostilities on Cable (Deadpool had briefly left to go to the bathroom), he and Deadpool shift out before anyone can get harmed. They arrive in the countryside, where Deadpool attacks (following the President's orders) Cable. After a brief fight, Cable reveals the fight to have been staged and televised in order to lose Deadpool his job as a government agent. The arc ends with a very uneasy truce between the two men.\n\n;Six Packs and Powder Kegs\nIn \"Six Packs and Powder Kegs\" (issue 33 - 35) story arc, a massive explosions rocks Cable's island paradise of Providence. Bodysliding back from Rumekistan (which he has been working to install democracy within), Cable finds that a saboteur may still be hidden on the island. His search for the bomber is stopped when he finds reports that the United States, along with several European allies, have sent the mercenary group [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]] into Rumekistan to disrupt the peace. Cable arrives and attempts to stop the group, only to note that there are five members present. The mysterious sixth member and the terrorist bomber on Providence? Deadpool, who shoots Cable in the back of the head while his personal force field is down. Cable is knocked unconscious, but not killed. Domino is upset at Deadpools actions, and the Six Pack leaves Cable lying in the street. He is recovered by the citizens of the city while the Six Pack plan to de-power the country goes through. While news reports of the happenings in both Rumekistan and Providence are aired, Cable's seemingly unconscious body seems to take power from one of the few remaining sources, the hospital that his citizens were taking him to. Cable's body levitates, and he ends up using his technology to repair the damage done by the Six Pack. Conscious again, he tracks down the Six Pack. Domino asserts that Cable acts as if he'd planned the entire thing from the start. Cable tells them that in order to do so, he'd need the ability to read minds or at least be \"able to predict the future.\" Telling Deadpool to \"Get the Hell out of my country and never come back!\" he throws Deadpool from Rumekistan, while keeping the rest of the Six Pack disabled. He then has Domino explain the happenings on TV, while Deadpool thinks it was all to punish him for opposing Cable during the Civil War. Cable and Domino then share a kiss. In the letters page, Deadpool is upset at his depiction on the next issue's cover, and asserts that it should be both an epilogue to this arc and a prologue to the next arc which should center around him.\n\n;Unfinished Business\nIn \"Unfinished Business\" (issue 36 - 39) Deadpool has to find a way to get his reputation back for being one of the best mercenaries for hire. After consulting Blind Al for validation of his plan, and getting Weasel to help him with the preparations, he kidnaps a mother and two children from a highway rest stop at 2 in the morning, setting them tied up in the middle of the road forcing a large armored truck to stop and investigate. He then proceeds to knock out the guards and blow a hole in the back of the truck with a bazooka, thus freeing a well known mercenary and trainer of supervillain henchmen, [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. He tells Taskmaster (whom he affectionately calls 'Tasky') that he won't owe him anything. He simply wants a trade. His freedom, in exchange for a fight with Deadpool. He explains that he wants to have the bout where \"Insidious, malevolent, Machiavellian people who do the hiring for our kind are gathered.\" He then promptly knocks Taskmaster unconscious so as to skip a lot of explaining and move right onto the fight. It turns out that he kidnapped a select group of the kinds of people who hire mercenaries, and has Weasel show them the fight on a projector. He has himself [[Handcuffs|manacled]] and fights Taskmaster, all the while spouting comments about his abilities as though the captives were watching an advertisement. Even though Taskmaster stabs him straight through the chest, Deadpool comes out on top, returning the battered opponent and himself to the room where the men are held. His plan fails however, as they are just as reluctant to hire him as ever. Taskmaster re-awakens and Deadpool thanks him for letting him win. Taskmaster then tells Deadpool that he didn't let him win, saying \"The truth is... You're that good. You've always been that good. Which won't get you a cup of coffee until you figure out how to be a professional...\" He then leaves and Deadpool is left to reflect on this as he realizes that neither he nor Weasel have the keys to his handcuffs. Two weeks later, a still handcuffed Deadpool struggled with a twist top beer, and while watching the news, hears that [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] has escaped. This strikes him with the revelation that if he can't be a mercenary, he'll become a superhero.\n\nHowever, Rhino has hired someone to feed Deadpool [[Henry Pym]]'s pills after hearing that Deadpool was after him, which result in Deadpool shrinking, since Rhino planned to turn Deadpool into a keychain as retaliation to the same that Deadpool did to him during the first Deadpool running series. Although, Deadpool soon beats up and defeats Rhino, along with various bar goers to who Rhino was showing off his \"deadpool-keychain\" to.\n\nWhile still shrunken, Deadpool is informed by Sandi and [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]] that Agent X was captured by Hydra while he was fighting Hydra, a terrorist organization, to steal a \"morphogenic actuator\", which can be used to cure or cause diseases. Deadpool, with Weasel, goes to the Hydra Headquarters where Agent X is being held, in Pakistan. Using his small size to his advantage, Deadpool infiltrates the Headquarters and captures [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]], to help him get to Agent X. It is then found that the actuator has been used to give Agent X morbid obesity by scientists experimenting with the actuator, and that it can not be removed by the actuator. Deadpool then forces the scientists to turn him back to his normal size (\"They had some Pym Particles lying around. Figured they must. Who doesn't, right?\") and gets Bob to drive a plane with Deadpool, obese Agent X and the actuator towards home. However, they forgot to get Weasel. During the journey home, Agent X levels with Deadpool, asking him if he could take over Agency X (Agent X's company of hireling mercenaries) while he deals with his weight problem. However, T-Ray has returned and captured Sandi and Outlaw, using them in his plan to kill Deadpool and Agent X for stealing his identity. Deadpool succeeds in killing T-Ray with his katana. Deadpool then recounts how Cable healed him of his insanity and that T-Ray and Deadpool had shared memories and that Deadpool spotted many holes in his story.\n\n;Fractured\nIn \"Fractured\" (#40-42) Cable's island of Providence is attacked by the creature Hecatomb, who Cable's X-Men are fighting. When Deadpool and the Agency X gang hear of this, they travel to Providence to help Cable. However, Rogue has already defeated Hecatomb by absorbing the 8 billion people's minds it absorbed. Sabretooth attacks the building where Irene Merryweather and the Black Box are. Domino heads for the building to rescue them as Cable heads for the Power Core. Domino gets to the building to discover that Sabretooth has killed Black Box and is holding Irene hostoge by using her as a human shield. Deadpool, who has parachuted from the Angency X jet, shoots Sabretooth and Irene manages to roll away. Domino takes Irene to the evacuation boats. Deadpool then proceeds to shoot Sabretooth repeatedly, stating that he knows he's running out of bullets, but he wonders if there will be anything left of Sabretooth for his healing factor to heal, just as he runs out bullets. Domino gets Irene to the evacuation boats as Cable joins them after he added just enough energy to the island to \"finish the job.\" Domino makes Cable promise not to commit suicide, as Providence has a fail-safe system should Cable die. As Domino leaves, Cable wonders how many promises he's broken. Cable goes to help Deadpool get rid of Sabretooth by hurling him out to the middle of the ocean. Cable then sends Deadpool to obtain secrets about the future (in the form of a mini statue of Anton Krutch) that could be dangerous if in the wrong hands. Cable heads for the Core, where he is attacked by Gambit and Sunfire. Meanwhile, Deadpool succeeds in locating the statue, but is attacked by Senyaka, former Acolyte.\n\nAs Cable makes a run for the Core, Deadpool continues to fight Senyaka for the mini statue. Cable makes it to the Core and activates the self-destruct system as Deadpool finally gets his hands on the mini statue, which turns out to be a teleport matrix. Gambit and Sunfire escape as Providence explodes. Deadpool is teleported to his apartment where Deadpool claims he wasn't worth it and that he won't let Cable down.\n\n;Alone Again, Naturally\nIn \"Alone Again, Naturally\" (#43-50), after meeting Cyclops at a memorial statue of Cable, Deadpool goes to the Hydra base to finally save Weasel because if he doesn't, Wolverine will kill him and everyone else in the base.  He almost succeeds but after trying to reason with Wolverine, Deadpool is decapitated. However Bob finally proves his worth by placing Deadpool's head back on his shoulders while Wolverine deals with the offending Hydra agents. Deadpool, Weasel, and Bob leave the Hydra base after Weasel's sabotage imprisons the remaining Hydra soldiers; however, the same device malfunctions as they head home, teleporting Deadpool and Bob to World War II Germany.\n\nHaving found themselves alongside [[Captain America]] and a foul-mouthed [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], Deadpool and Bob join in on the fight against the Nazis.  All goes well but due to 'temporal hiccups', Captain America and Bucky seem to repeatedly forget who Deadpool and Bob are.  The group heads off to find [[Arnim Zola|Doctor Zola]] and do battle with a Frankenstein Monster of his, but seem to be trapped in the past. Meanwhile, in the present time, Weasel has convinced the Fantastic Four to let him use their time machine, pointing out how bad an idea it is to have Deadpool and a rogue Hydra agent remain lost in time. He is unsuccessful however, and the Fantastic Four offer to help bring Deadpool home instead.\n\nUsing the technology provided by the [[Fantastic Four]] of the present day Weasel managed to pull Deadpool and Bob to the [[Baxter Building]] although at an earlier point in time where he meets the older iteration of the Fantastic Four (although appearing through [[Doctor Doom]]'s time platform doesn't help matters, also with the 'temporal hiccups' still in effect the team gets quite confused about why there is a [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] agent at their breakfast table). Eventually they agree to help Deadpool return to the future, although complications mean he and Bob end up falling further and further into the time-stream until they are rescued at the last minute by both time periods versions of the Fantastic Four. After being dismissed from the Baxter Building for his mercenary lifestyle (although Sandi and Outlaw, who also work for Agency X are invited to stay for poker) Deadpool, Bob and Weasel return to the Agency X offices. Here they find [[Doctor Strange]] who has come to recruit Deadpool to save the [[multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] from a problem he apparently created.\n\nUnfortunately for Deadpool this involves finding T-Ray's body, so he and Bob sent to fight their way through various mystical realms by Dr. Strange to search for it. Upon finding T-Ray, Dr Strange reveals that at the moment Deadpool killed him he had used his black magic to try to escape through a 'mystical burrow', this sent him tumbling through various magical planes leaving the barriers between frayed. Deadpool had been sent to collect the portions of life essence he left in each realm, which he now has to use to restore T-Ray to life. After replacing the life essence, Dr Strange informs Deadpool and Bob that although T-Ray's body is complete, his soul is still missing. He then sends them to the [[Louisiana]] swamps where they meet [[Brother Voodoo]], who arranges for Deadpool to confront T-Ray's soul and try to restore it to his body. After an antagonistic encounter, Deadpool succeeds and, as both had to be kept alive, they somewhat amicably part ways.\n\nDeadpool is later contacted by [[Irene Merryweather]] who asks him to retrieve an \"electro-polarity reconfiguration engine\" left over in the [[Savage Land]] by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] to help power Rumekistan since [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s death. After being attacked by a mind-controlled [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] and eventually freeing him, Deadpool, Weasel and Bob discover [[Brainchild (comics)|Brainchild]] has taken over. After Deadpool breaks in and finds the \"reconfigurator\" Weasel and Bob teleport to him. Brainchild then sends an army of dinosaurs to attack them which Deadpool teleports to [[Genosha]] using Weasels pene-traitor technology. After Deadpool shoots down Brainchild's escape dinosaur Ka-zar agrees to let him take the \"reconfigurator\". Weasel than points out that Deadpool sent the dinosaurs not to Genosha but the Genoshan embassy in [[New York City]] where they break open a van which the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] and [[Fantastic Four]] were using to transport the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote, this quickly combines with the dinosaurs leaving an army of Venomsaurs loose in Manhattan.\n\nDeadpool then returns to New York to fight the Venomsaurs. At first, he and [[Spider-Man]] fight them, but Weasel, the Fantastic Four and the Mighty Avengers all help Deadpool clean up the mess that he made. Agent X even gets in on the action, and Bob manages to bring down one of the bigger Venomsaurs, regaining the respect of his wife, who saw it on TV. After much fighting, Deadpool is eventually knocked far away from the action. Cable (from the future) manages to send a psimitar, which can destroy the symbionts on the dinosaurs. Deadpool takes on the last venomsaur, and almost gets absorbed by the symbiote. However, Deadpool stabs himself in the head with the psimitar, and is released from the grip of the symbiote. Deadpool awakes to find out from the Avengers that the dinosaurs have been returned to the jungle thanks to Weasel.\n\nIt all ends with Deadpool back at his apartment watching TV. Deadpool had been blamed for the incident by the media on TV. Weasel, Bob, Irene Merryweather, Agent X, Sandi, and Outlaw all come in to hang out with Deadpool. The series ends with Deadpool asking his friends, \"So... whaddyou guys want to watch?\"\n\n==Creators==\n\n===Writers===\n* [[Fabian Nicieza]] (issues #1-48, script #49-50)\n* Reilly Brown (issues #49-50)\n\n===Artists===\n* [[Mark Brooks (comics)|Mark Brooks]] (issues #1-2)\n* [[Patrick Zircher]] (issues #3-24)\n* [[Lan Medina]] (issues #25-27)\n* Reilly Brown (issues #28, #33-36, #38, #40-42, #45-46, #48-50)\n* [[Ron Lim]] (issues #29, #39, #43-44, #47)\n* Staz Johnson (issues #30-32, #37)\n* Jon Malin (issue #42)\n\n==Collected editions==\n*''Cable & Deadpool'':\n**''Deadpool & Cable Omnibus'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' 1-50, Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun Spectacular and material from ''Deadpool (2012)'' #27,  1272 pages, November 2014, {{ISBN|9780785192763}})\n***''[[Marvel Ultimate Collection|Ultimate Collection]] Book 1'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #1-18, 440 pages, March 2010, {{ISBN|0-7851-4313-0}}) previously collected as:\n****''Volume 1: If Looks Could Kill'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #1-6, 136 pages, December 2004, {{ISBN|0-7851-1374-6}})\n****''Volume 2: The Burnt Offering'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #7-12, 144 pages, May 2005, {{ISBN|0-7851-1571-4}})\n****''Volume 3: The Human Race'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #13-18, 144 pages, November 2005, {{ISBN|0-7851-1763-6}})\n***''Ultimate Collection Book 2'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #19-35, 424 pages, July 2010, {{ISBN|0-7851-4821-3}}) previously collected as:\n****''Volume 4: Bosom Buddies'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #19-24, 144 pages, April 2005, {{ISBN|0-7851-1869-1}})\n****''Volume 5: Living Legends'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #25-29, 144 pages, August 2006, {{ISBN|0-7851-2041-6}})\n****''Volume 6: Paved With Good Intentions'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #30-35, 144 pages, May 2007, {{ISBN|0-7851-2233-8}})\n***''Ultimate Collection Book 3'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #36-50 and ''Deadpool/[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLI]]: Summer Fun Spectacular'', 424 pages, October 2010, {{ISBN|0-7851-4920-1}}) previously collected as:\n****''Volume 7: Separation Anxiety'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #36-42, 176 pages, September 2007, {{ISBN|0-7851-2523-X}})\n****''Volume 8: Deadpool vs. The Marvel Universe'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #43-50, 192 pages, May 2005, {{ISBN|0-7851-2524-8}})\n**''Other Reading'':\n***''[[X-Force]] & Cable, Volume 1: The Legend Returns'' (collects ''X-Force'' (vol. 2) #1-6, 144 pages, April 2005, {{ISBN|0-7851-1429-7}})\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*{{Comicbookdb|type=title|id=651|title=''Cable & Deadpool''}}\n*[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=12032 Wade & Bob's Bogus Adventure: Nicieza Talks ''Cable & Deadpool''] at [[Comic Book Resources]] (October 3, 2007)\n\n{{X-Comics}}\n{{Deadpool}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cable and Deadpool}}\n[[Category:2004 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Deadpool titles]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Comic book series}}\n{{redirect|Commcast|the broadcasting company|Comcast}}\n{{update|date=August 2015}}\n{{Infobox comic book title\n| title = Cable & Deadpool\n| image = CABLEDP005l.jpg\n| caption = Cover to ''Cable & Deadpool'' #5.<br>Art by Mark Brooks.\n| schedule = Monthly\n| ongoing = n\n| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| startmo = May\n| startyr = 2004\n| endmo = April\n| endyr = 2008\n| issues = 50\n| Superhero = y\n| main_char_team = [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]<br>[[Deadpool]]\n| writers = [[Fabian Nicieza]]<br>Reilly Brown\n| artists = [[Mark Brooks (comics)|Mark Brooks]]<br>[[Patrick Zircher]]<br>[[Lan Medina]]<br>Reilly Brown<br>[[Ron Lim]]<br>Staz Johnson<br>Jon Malin\n| pencillers = \n| inkers = \n| colorists = \n| creative_team_month = \n| creative_team_year = \n| creators = '''Cable''':<br>[[Rob Liefeld]]<br>[[Louise Simonson]]<br>'''Deadpool''':<br>Rob Liefeld<br>Fabian Nicieza\n| TPB = If Looks Could Kill\n| ISBN = 0-7851-1374-6\n| TPB1 = Burnt Offering\n| ISBN1 = 0-7851-1571-4\n| TPB2 = The Human Race\n| ISBN2 = 0-7851-1763-6\n| TPB3 = Bosom Buddies\n| ISBN3 = 0-7851-1869-1\n| TPB4 = Living Legends\n| ISBN4 = 0-7851-2041-6\n| TPB5 = Paved With Good Intentions\n| ISBN5 = 0-7851-2233-8\n| TPB6 = Separation Anxiety\n| ISBN6 = 0-7851-2523-X\n| subcat = Marvel Comics\n| sort = Cable &amp; Deadpool\n}}\n'''''Cable & Deadpool''''' was a [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]] beginning in 2004. The title characters, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], shared the focus of the book. The series was launched following the cancellation of the characters' previous ongoing solo series. The book's mix of humor, action, and intricate plotting have won it a devoted fanbase. Marvel Comics canceled the series with issue #50 to make way for a new ''[[Deadpool (comic book)|Deadpool]]'' ongoing series that began on September 10, 2008, and a new Cable ongoing series that was launched in March 2008. Cable & Deadpool were ranked #7 on Marvel.com's list of \"The 10 Greatest Buddy Teams\" of all time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/news/story/2641/take_10_marvels_best_buddy_teams | title=Take 10: Marvel's Best Buddy Teams | last=Morse | first=Ben | work=Marvel.com | date=June 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Main characters==\n*'''Cable''' ('''Nathan Dayspring Askani\u2019son Summers''') is the time-traveling son of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Madelyne Pryor]] (a clone of [[Jean Grey]]). Cable, having [https://www.quirkybyte.com/blog/2018/01/super-cool-things-deadpools-cable/ mutant powers] and knowing what the future could be, is trying to bring about a better world.\n*'''Deadpool''' ('''Wade Wilson''') is a talkative mercenary for hire known as the \"Merc with a Mouth\". Like Wolverine, he is a subject of the [[Weapon X]] experiment for which he volunteered in the hopes of finding a cure for his [[cancer]]. Although he received an enhanced body from the project, the cancer was not cured, he went insane, and his skin became covered in hideous scars. Deadpool helps to further Cable's plans, sometimes unwittingly.\n\n==Minor and recurring characters==\n* [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] (Alex Hayden) was injected with the \"American Gene\" during a botched mission infiltrating a [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] base, making him incredibly obese. He appointed Deadpool as the head of his mercenary organization, Agency X, while he is getting back in shape.\n* The [[Black Box (comics)|Black Box]] (Garabed Bashur), a one-time information broker, worked for Cable in hopes of changing the world. He was killed by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].\n* [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]] is an average HYDRA agent pressed into service by Deadpool during his mission to rescue Agent X. He now works with Agency X.\n* [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] is the on/off confidante, lover, and teammate of Cable. She knows Cable better than most and is scared and excited about what might happen if he succeeds.\n* [[Nick Fury]] is the former Director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Fury appears early in the series after Cable threatens to use his out-of-control telekinesis to throw all the world's nuclear weapons into space. Later, he sends [[Captain America]] to infiltrate Providence.\n* [[Prester John (comics)|Prester John]], time-displaced from the past, operates Providence's multi-religious studies program and occasionally ends up fighting to defend Providence.\n* Johann Kriek, a former [[Interpol]] operative, is now the Chief of Security for Providence.\n* [[Irene Merryweather]], a former reporter for the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', is now the Chief of Staff on Providence and Cable's chronicler.\n* Rabbi Rosen is a [[Rabbi]] aboard Providence. Rosen tends to offer advice where he can.\n* [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]] is a technological genius and one of Deadpool's best friends. Weasel aids in some of Deadpool's activities.\n* [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]] (Inez Temple) is an attractive and short-tempered mercenary from [[Texas]] who is currently employed by Agency X. She is a mutant with enhanced durability, speed, and incredible accuracy with firearms (even rivaling [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] in terms of targeting skills). She is a descendant of the [[Outlaw Kid]] and dresses in a [[cowgirl]] motif.\n* [[Sandi Brandenberg]] is the secretary of Agency X, as well as a former love interest to both Deadpool and Agent X. She is currently the girlfriend of the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. She was recently kidnapped and kept bound and gagged along with Outlaw by T-Ray, but was rescued by Deadpool.\n* [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]] is a group of mercenaries hired by S.H.I.E.L.D. to watch over Cable. They are: [[G. W. Bridge]], [[Hammer (comics)|Hammer]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Solo (Marvel Comics)|Solo]], [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]], and [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]].\n\n==Features==\n\n=== Recap page===\nStarting with issue #11, ''Cable & Deadpool'' opens each book with a unique recap page. This page, usually presented by Deadpool and occasionally with Cable or by/with the book's supporting characters, villains, and guest stars, breaks the [[fourth wall]] and literally talks to the audience. Keeping with the book's tone, the recap page is usually funny, often with Deadpool having to explain what the fourth wall is to other characters on the page. From issue #44, the recap pages have been in the form of an online [[blog]] as written by Bob, Agent of HYDRA.\n\n===Dear Deadpool===\nIssue #13 saw the start of \"Dear Deadpool\", a letters page seemingly hosted by Deadpool himself. Like the recap page, \"Dear Deadpool\" is often comical and has Deadpool breaking the fourth wall. In this section, Deadpool frequently refers to not only the characters in this comic, but often mentions (and makes fun of) the creators, as well as various conventions of Marvel Comics and the comics industry in general. He even goes so far as to refer to \"the man who types my answers\". A running gag features Deadpool's excitement over a typical feature of comic book fan letters: a numbered list of questions. This would prompt the response, \"Ooh, numbered questions!\" In 2006, ''[[Wizard Magazine]]'' named \"Dear Deadpool\" as \"the Funniest Letters Page in Comics\".\n\n==Story arcs==\n\n;If Looks Could Kill\n\"If Looks Could Kill\" (issues #1-6) brings Cable and Deadpool together (literally). In this first story arc, Deadpool is hired by \"The One World Church\" to steal a virus that will allow them to turn everyone on Earth blue. Meanwhile, Cable is trying to figure how to best use his newly enhanced mutant powers to help change the world. Through a series of events, both Cable and Deadpool end up back at \"The One World Church\" where they are both infected by the virus. In order for them both to survive, Cable absorbs and then throws up Deadpool which ends up mixing their [[DNA]]. Cable eventually takes control of the virus and uses it to turn the entire world pink. A couple of days later, Cable restores everyone to their original color, and takes credit for this calling himself their \"Saviour\". During this, Cable uses his enhanced powers to rebuild his space station, [[Graymalkin]], which includes a teleportation system. Because of the mixing of their DNA, both Cable and Deadpool can [[Teleportation|teleport]], but when one does it he takes the other with him.\n\n;Burnt offering\nIn \"The Burnt Offering\" (issues #7-10, originally known as \"The Passion of the Cable\"), Cable continues with his plan to espouse a philosophy of moderation, and offers invitations to the world's top thinkers, scientists and philosophers to live on [[Providence (comics)|Providence]] (the recently rebuilt Graymalkin) in the face of a nervous [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Delivering a stark message to the world's leaders, he deliberately sets them all against him by threatening to throw their missiles into the sun. Meanwhile, the [[Astonishing X-Men|X-Men]], including Cable\u2019s father [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], hire Deadpool to gather pieces of a mini-teleporter in order to stop Cable. After they mounted an attack on Providence, Cable confesses to Deadpool that he'd wanted to be killed in order to set an example of how the world could work together, even if it were against him. After being injured by the [[Silver Surfer]], Cable has Deadpool use the mini-teleporter to [[lobotomy|lobotomize]] Cable in order to save him from burning out as [[X-Man]] had. With the last of his powers, Cable left the world a final message of what the world could be if everyone tried a bit harder to make it a better place.\n\n[[File:Cabledeadpool12.jpg|thumb|left|Cover to ''Cable & Deadpool'' #12<br>Art by Patrick Zircher]]\n\n;Thirty pieces\nDuring \"Thirty Pieces\" (issues #11-12), Deadpool goes on a quest to save Cable\u2019s life. After obtaining a techno-organic alien from [[MODOK]], Deadpool tracks down the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] in hopes that he would be able to fix Cable. Along the way, Deadpool battles [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]] who was hired by what appears to be a religious organization to track Deadpool in order to prevent the \u2018resurrection\u2019 of Cable. After having the alien grafted to his body, Cable, who is comatose and trapped in a dreamscape with the [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]], overcomes the alien\u2019s brain and heals himself, though he still extremely depowered.\n\n;Murder in Paradise\n\"A Murder in Paradise\" (issues #13-14) starts on Providence with the murder mystery of Haji Bin Barat, the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist. Deadpool insists on being involved in the investigation, but [[Irene Merryweather]] takes charge.  Eventually Deadpool, and everyone else, realizes that he was the only person that could have killed Barat. Following a fight with [[Prester John (comics)|Prestor John]], Cable confronts Deadpool, who admits he cannot remember killing Barat. Although Cable wants to help Deadpool, he tells him he has to leave the island until he gets back from a mission with [[X-Force]]. Deadpool leaves Providence in search of the [[Black Box (comics)|Black Box]] whom he hopes can find a way to kill him.\n \n[[File:CableDeadpool17.jpg|thumb|From ''Cable & Deadpool'' #17<br>Art by Patrick Zircher.]]\n\n;Enema of the State\n\"Enema of the State\" (issues #15-18) takes place after the end of the ''[[X-Force]]'' miniseries where Cable vanished after defeating the mutant-hunting [[Skornn]]. After finding and being brainwashed by the Black Box to kill Cable, Deadpool returns to Providence where he finds [[Siryn]] and '[[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]' (Deadpool loses some respect for Sam Guthrie on learning his true codename) who are also looking for Cable. With the help of [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], Deadpool uses a modified version of the teleportation device to track down Cable through various dimensions with Siryn and Cannonball following three minutes behind. The group travels through these dimensions finding Cable as a [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (comics)|Horseman of Apocalypse]] (War); a messiah-like, benevolent dictator; and the central conscience of a [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] invasion of Earth. Finally in the [[House of M]] reality, Deadpool finds a baby version of Cable in the care of [[Mister Sinister]]. After the ''House of M'' reality fades, Cable starts to age and his memory is restored. He then burns out his restored powers to \u2018fix\u2019 Deadpool\u2019s mind. With Cable depowered and still in his teens, Deadpool teleports them both to [[Intercourse, PA]].\n\n;Why, When I Was Your Age\n\"Why, When I Was Your Age...\" (issue #19) picks up with Deadpool taking Cable to Intercourse, PA, with hopes that the city will live up to its name. While at a bar, Cable talks about growing up in the future, and Deadpool discusses the death of his father. At the end of the night, Cable is fully aged, and neither of the two wish to discuss what actually happened in their past.\n\n;Bosom Buddies\nIn \"Bosom Buddies\" (issues #20-23), Deadpool is hired to steal the Dominus Objective, a secondary hard drive that acts like a virus that acts like a server. While Deadpool is out to steal the Objective, he ends up fighting both the [[BAD Girls, Inc.|B.A.D. Girls]], [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] only to discover that the [[Dominus Project]] had already been stolen. Later, The B.A.D. Girls confront [[Shen Kuei]] (The Cat) who actually stole the Dominus Objective. The Cat reveals to them it was the Black Box who hired him originally, though it was Cable who paid him, as well as who hired them and Deadpool. In the final confrontation, Cable links with Dominus Objective which gives him a new power similar to his telepathy. When everything is settled, Black Box decides to work for Cable.\n\n;Sticky Situations and Living Legends\nIn \"Sticky Situations\" and \"Living Legends\" (issues #24 & 25), Deadpool is hired to steal plans for a secret government project called the \"Cone of Silence\", which was originally designed as a force field to cut off Providence from the rest of the world. During his escapades, Deadpool ends up briefly fighting [[Spider-Man]] before finally getting the plans. After realizing that it was probably Cable who had the plans stolen, Nick Fury sends [[Captain America]] to infiltrate Providence. Captain America finds Providence to be a peaceful place and learns of Cable's past and his plans to change the future. During a fight between Cable and Captain America, Cable reveals that he has used the \"Cone of Silence\" to create a technological replacement for his [[telekinesis]].\n\n;Born Again\nIn \"Born Again\" (issues #26 & 27), the story reveals the hidden past connections between Apocalypse and Cable, specifically that it was Cable who infected Apocalypse with the techno-organic virus that Apocalypse would pass on to Cable as an infant.\n\n;The Domino Principle\nIn \"The Domino Principle\" (issues #28 & 29), Cable employs Deadpool to remove [[Flag-Smasher]] as the ruler of [[Rumekistan]]. Flag-Smasher had become ruler in the mini-series ''[[Citizen V]] & The V-Battalion: The Everlasting'', also written by Fabian Nicieza. The coup becomes complicated with the separate interferences of Citizen V and Cable's old love interest, Domino. Although Cable successfully manipulates Domino into assassinating Flag-Smasher, he finds his own resolve shaken when faced with his ex-lover's doubts about his agenda.\n\n;Civil War\nIn the \"Civil War\" story arc, Deadpool has been given the job of hunting down super-powered individuals who have not signed the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. There is a confrontation between Cable and Deadpool in which Cable reveals that he will be fostering superheroes in Providence. When Cable meets Captain America to extend this offer, Cap refuses. Cable tries to convince him by revealing what he knows about the Secret Avengers' secret identities. This gesture does not go unnoticed by Deadpool, who is watching them from a nearby rooftop and notes [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]'s new identity. He attacks Daredevil in a warehouse, and is himself attacked by members of the Secret Avengers and the [[Young Avengers]]. Cable attempts to intervene and convince Deadpool to join their cause by offering him a bigger paycheck (and when Deadpool refuses, a bigger badge). This fails when Deadpool tries to shoot Cable with tranquilizer darts, which Cable deflects into Wade's face. Wade wakes up bound and gagged (with a full body covering of duct tape, after Cable suggested an entire roll for his mouth alone) in the warehouse before Cable reappears, setting him free and taking him along to the White House to meet with the American President about the possible repercussions of the superhero registration act. When the President orders hostilities on Cable (Deadpool had briefly left to go to the bathroom), he and Deadpool shift out before anyone can get harmed. They arrive in the countryside, where Deadpool attacks (following the President's orders) Cable. After a brief fight, Cable reveals the fight to have been staged and televised in order to lose Deadpool his job as a government agent. The arc ends with a very uneasy truce between the two men.\n\n;Six Packs and Powder Kegs\nIn \"Six Packs and Powder Kegs\" (issue 33 - 35) story arc, a massive explosions rocks Cable's island paradise of Providence. Bodysliding back from Rumekistan (which he has been working to install democracy within), Cable finds that a saboteur may still be hidden on the island. His search for the bomber is stopped when he finds reports that the United States, along with several European allies, have sent the mercenary group [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]] into Rumekistan to disrupt the peace. Cable arrives and attempts to stop the group, only to note that there are five members present. The mysterious sixth member and the terrorist bomber on Providence? Deadpool, who shoots Cable in the back of the head while his personal force field is down. Cable is knocked unconscious, but not killed. Domino is upset at Deadpools actions, and the Six Pack leaves Cable lying in the street. He is recovered by the citizens of the city while the Six Pack plan to de-power the country goes through. While news reports of the happenings in both Rumekistan and Providence are aired, Cable's seemingly unconscious body seems to take power from one of the few remaining sources, the hospital that his citizens were taking him to. Cable's body levitates, and he ends up using his technology to repair the damage done by the Six Pack. Conscious again, he tracks down the Six Pack. Domino asserts that Cable acts as if he'd planned the entire thing from the start. Cable tells them that in order to do so, he'd need the ability to read minds or at least be \"able to predict the future.\" Telling Deadpool to \"Get the Hell out of my country and never come back!\" he throws Deadpool from Rumekistan, while keeping the rest of the Six Pack disabled. He then has Domino explain the happenings on TV, while Deadpool thinks it was all to punish him for opposing Cable during the Civil War. Cable and Domino then share a kiss. In the letters page, Deadpool is upset at his depiction on the next issue's cover, and asserts that it should be both an epilogue to this arc and a prologue to the next arc which should center around him.\n\n;Unfinished Business\nIn \"Unfinished Business\" (issue 36 - 39) Deadpool has to find a way to get his reputation back for being one of the best mercenaries for hire. After consulting Blind Al for validation of his plan, and getting Weasel to help him with the preparations, he kidnaps a mother and two children from a highway rest stop at 2 in the morning, setting them tied up in the middle of the road forcing a large armored truck to stop and investigate. He then proceeds to knock out the guards and blow a hole in the back of the truck with a bazooka, thus freeing a well known mercenary and trainer of supervillain henchmen, [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]. He tells Taskmaster (whom he affectionately calls 'Tasky') that he won't owe him anything. He simply wants a trade. His freedom, in exchange for a fight with Deadpool. He explains that he wants to have the bout where \"Insidious, malevolent, Machiavellian people who do the hiring for our kind are gathered.\" He then promptly knocks Taskmaster unconscious so as to skip a lot of explaining and move right onto the fight. It turns out that he kidnapped a select group of the kinds of people who hire mercenaries, and has Weasel show them the fight on a projector. He has himself [[Handcuffs|manacled]] and fights Taskmaster, all the while spouting comments about his abilities as though the captives were watching an advertisement. Even though Taskmaster stabs him straight through the chest, Deadpool comes out on top, returning the battered opponent and himself to the room where the men are held. His plan fails however, as they are just as reluctant to hire him as ever. Taskmaster re-awakens and Deadpool thanks him for letting him win. Taskmaster then tells Deadpool that he didn't let him win, saying \"The truth is... You're that good. You've always been that good. Which won't get you a cup of coffee until you figure out how to be a professional...\" He then leaves and Deadpool is left to reflect on this as he realizes that neither he nor Weasel have the keys to his handcuffs. Two weeks later, a still handcuffed Deadpool struggled with a twist top beer, and while watching the news, hears that [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] has escaped. This strikes him with the revelation that if he can't be a mercenary, he'll become a superhero.\n\nHowever, Rhino has hired someone to feed Deadpool [[Henry Pym]]'s pills after hearing that Deadpool was after him, which result in Deadpool shrinking, since Rhino planned to turn Deadpool into a keychain as retaliation to the same that Deadpool did to him during the first Deadpool running series. Although, Deadpool soon beats up and defeats Rhino, along with various bar goers to who Rhino was showing off his \"deadpool-keychain\" to.\n\nWhile still shrunken, Deadpool is informed by Sandi and [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]] that Agent X was captured by Hydra while he was fighting Hydra, a terrorist organization, to steal a \"morphogenic actuator\", which can be used to cure or cause diseases. Deadpool, with Weasel, goes to the Hydra Headquarters where Agent X is being held, in Pakistan. Using his small size to his advantage, Deadpool infiltrates the Headquarters and captures [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]], to help him get to Agent X. It is then found that the actuator has been used to give Agent X morbid obesity by scientists experimenting with the actuator, and that it can not be removed by the actuator. Deadpool then forces the scientists to turn him back to his normal size (\"They had some Pym Particles lying around. Figured they must. Who doesn't, right?\") and gets Bob to drive a plane with Deadpool, obese Agent X and the actuator towards home. However, they forgot to get Weasel. During the journey home, Agent X levels with Deadpool, asking him if he could take over Agency X (Agent X's company of hireling mercenaries) while he deals with his weight problem. However, T-Ray has returned and captured Sandi and Outlaw, using them in his plan to kill Deadpool and Agent X for stealing his identity. Deadpool succeeds in killing T-Ray with his katana. Deadpool then recounts how Cable healed him of his insanity and that T-Ray and Deadpool had shared memories and that Deadpool spotted many holes in his story.\n\n;Fractured\nIn \"Fractured\" (#40-42) Cable's island of Providence is attacked by the creature Hecatomb, who Cable's X-Men are fighting. When Deadpool and the Agency X gang hear of this, they travel to Providence to help Cable. However, Rogue has already defeated Hecatomb by absorbing the 8 billion people's minds it absorbed. Sabretooth attacks the building where Irene Merryweather and the Black Box are. Domino heads for the building to rescue them as Cable heads for the Power Core. Domino gets to the building to discover that Sabretooth has killed Black Box and is holding Irene hostoge by using her as a human shield. Deadpool, who has parachuted from the Angency X jet, shoots Sabretooth and Irene manages to roll away. Domino takes Irene to the evacuation boats. Deadpool then proceeds to shoot Sabretooth repeatedly, stating that he knows he's running out of bullets, but he wonders if there will be anything left of Sabretooth for his healing factor to heal, just as he runs out bullets. Domino gets Irene to the evacuation boats as Cable joins them after he added just enough energy to the island to \"finish the job.\" Domino makes Cable promise not to commit suicide, as Providence has a fail-safe system should Cable die. As Domino leaves, Cable wonders how many promises he's broken. Cable goes to help Deadpool get rid of Sabretooth by hurling him out to the middle of the ocean. Cable then sends Deadpool to obtain secrets about the future (in the form of a mini statue of Anton Krutch) that could be dangerous if in the wrong hands. Cable heads for the Core, where he is attacked by Gambit and Sunfire. Meanwhile, Deadpool succeeds in locating the statue, but is attacked by Senyaka, former Acolyte.\n\nAs Cable makes a run for the Core, Deadpool continues to fight Senyaka for the mini statue. Cable makes it to the Core and activates the self-destruct system as Deadpool finally gets his hands on the mini statue, which turns out to be a teleport matrix. Gambit and Sunfire escape as Providence explodes. Deadpool is teleported to his apartment where Deadpool claims he wasn't worth it and that he won't let Cable down.\n\n;Alone Again, Naturally\nIn \"Alone Again, Naturally\" (#43-50), after meeting Cyclops at a memorial statue of Cable, Deadpool goes to the Hydra base to finally save Weasel because if he doesn't, Wolverine will kill him and everyone else in the base.  He almost succeeds but after trying to reason with Wolverine, Deadpool is decapitated. However Bob finally proves his worth by placing Deadpool's head back on his shoulders while Wolverine deals with the offending Hydra agents. Deadpool, Weasel, and Bob leave the Hydra base after Weasel's sabotage imprisons the remaining Hydra soldiers; however, the same device malfunctions as they head home, teleporting Deadpool and Bob to World War II Germany.\n\nHaving found themselves alongside [[Captain America]] and a foul-mouthed [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], Deadpool and Bob join in on the fight against the Nazis.  All goes well but due to 'temporal hiccups', Captain America and Bucky seem to repeatedly forget who Deadpool and Bob are.  The group heads off to find [[Arnim Zola|Doctor Zola]] and do battle with a Frankenstein Monster of his, but seem to be trapped in the past. Meanwhile, in the present time, Weasel has convinced the Fantastic Four to let him use their time machine, pointing out how bad an idea it is to have Deadpool and a rogue Hydra agent remain lost in time. He is unsuccessful however, and the Fantastic Four offer to help bring Deadpool home instead.\n\nUsing the technology provided by the [[Fantastic Four]] of the present day Weasel managed to pull Deadpool and Bob to the [[Baxter Building]] although at an earlier point in time where he meets the older iteration of the Fantastic Four (although appearing through [[Doctor Doom]]'s time platform doesn't help matters, also with the 'temporal hiccups' still in effect the team gets quite confused about why there is a [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] agent at their breakfast table). Eventually they agree to help Deadpool return to the future, although complications mean he and Bob end up falling further and further into the time-stream until they are rescued at the last minute by both time periods versions of the Fantastic Four. After being dismissed from the Baxter Building for his mercenary lifestyle (although Sandi and Outlaw, who also work for Agency X are invited to stay for poker) Deadpool, Bob and Weasel return to the Agency X offices. Here they find [[Doctor Strange]] who has come to recruit Deadpool to save the [[multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] from a problem he apparently created.\n\nUnfortunately for Deadpool this involves finding T-Ray's body, so he and Bob sent to fight their way through various mystical realms by Dr. Strange to search for it. Upon finding T-Ray, Dr Strange reveals that at the moment Deadpool killed him he had used his black magic to try to escape through a 'mystical burrow', this sent him tumbling through various magical planes leaving the barriers between frayed. Deadpool had been sent to collect the portions of life essence he left in each realm, which he now has to use to restore T-Ray to life. After replacing the life essence, Dr Strange informs Deadpool and Bob that although T-Ray's body is complete, his soul is still missing. He then sends them to the [[Louisiana]] swamps where they meet [[Brother Voodoo]], who arranges for Deadpool to confront T-Ray's soul and try to restore it to his body. After an antagonistic encounter, Deadpool succeeds and, as both had to be kept alive, they somewhat amicably part ways.\n\nDeadpool is later contacted by [[Irene Merryweather]] who asks him to retrieve an \"electro-polarity reconfiguration engine\" left over in the [[Savage Land]] by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] to help power Rumekistan since [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s death. After being attacked by a mind-controlled [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] and eventually freeing him, Deadpool, Weasel and Bob discover [[Brainchild (comics)|Brainchild]] has taken over. After Deadpool breaks in and finds the \"reconfigurator\" Weasel and Bob teleport to him. Brainchild then sends an army of dinosaurs to attack them which Deadpool teleports to [[Genosha]] using Weasels pene-traitor technology. After Deadpool shoots down Brainchild's escape dinosaur Ka-zar agrees to let him take the \"reconfigurator\". Weasel than points out that Deadpool sent the dinosaurs not to Genosha but the Genoshan embassy in [[New York City]] where they break open a van which the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] and [[Fantastic Four]] were using to transport the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote, this quickly combines with the dinosaurs leaving an army of Venomsaurs loose in Manhattan.\n\nDeadpool then returns to New York to fight the Venomsaurs. At first, he and [[Spider-Man]] fight them, but Weasel, the Fantastic Four and the Mighty Avengers all help Deadpool clean up the mess that he made. Agent X even gets in on the action, and Bob manages to bring down one of the bigger Venomsaurs, regaining the respect of his wife, who saw it on TV. After much fighting, Deadpool is eventually knocked far away from the action. Cable (from the future) manages to send a psimitar, which can destroy the symbionts on the dinosaurs. Deadpool takes on the last venomsaur, and almost gets absorbed by the symbiote. However, Deadpool stabs himself in the head with the psimitar, and is released from the grip of the symbiote. Deadpool awakes to find out from the Avengers that the dinosaurs have been returned to the jungle thanks to Weasel.\n\nIt all ends with Deadpool back at his apartment watching TV. Deadpool had been blamed for the incident by the media on TV. Weasel, Bob, Irene Merryweather, Agent X, Sandi, and Outlaw all come in to hang out with Deadpool. The series ends with Deadpool asking his friends, \"So... whaddyou guys want to watch?\"\n\n==Creators==\n\n===Writers===\n* [[Fabian Nicieza]] (issues #1-48, script #49-50)\n* Reilly Brown (issues #49-50)\n\n===Artists===\n* [[Mark Brooks (comics)|Mark Brooks]] (issues #1-2)\n* [[Patrick Zircher]] (issues #3-24)\n* [[Lan Medina]] (issues #25-27)\n* Reilly Brown (issues #28, #33-36, #38, #40-42, #45-46, #48-50)\n* [[Ron Lim]] (issues #29, #39, #43-44, #47)\n* Staz Johnson (issues #30-32, #37)\n* Jon Malin (issue #42)\n\n==Collected editions==\n*''Cable & Deadpool'':\n**''Deadpool & Cable Omnibus'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' 1-50, Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun Spectacular and material from ''Deadpool (2012)'' #27,  1272 pages, November 2014, {{ISBN|9780785192763}})\n***''[[Marvel Ultimate Collection|Ultimate Collection]] Book 1'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #1-18, 440 pages, March 2010, {{ISBN|0-7851-4313-0}}) previously collected as:\n****''Volume 1: If Looks Could Kill'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #1-6, 136 pages, December 2004, {{ISBN|0-7851-1374-6}})\n****''Volume 2: The Burnt Offering'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #7-12, 144 pages, May 2005, {{ISBN|0-7851-1571-4}})\n****''Volume 3: The Human Race'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #13-18, 144 pages, November 2005, {{ISBN|0-7851-1763-6}})\n***''Ultimate Collection Book 2'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #19-35, 424 pages, July 2010, {{ISBN|0-7851-4821-3}}) previously collected as:\n****''Volume 4: Bosom Buddies'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #19-24, 144 pages, April 2005, {{ISBN|0-7851-1869-1}})\n****''Volume 5: Living Legends'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #25-29, 144 pages, August 2006, {{ISBN|0-7851-2041-6}})\n****''Volume 6: Paved With Good Intentions'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #30-35, 144 pages, May 2007, {{ISBN|0-7851-2233-8}})\n***''Ultimate Collection Book 3'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #36-50 and ''Deadpool/[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLI]]: Summer Fun Spectacular'', 424 pages, October 2010, {{ISBN|0-7851-4920-1}}) previously collected as:\n****''Volume 7: Separation Anxiety'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #36-42, 176 pages, September 2007, {{ISBN|0-7851-2523-X}})\n****''Volume 8: Deadpool vs. The Marvel Universe'' (collects ''Cable & Deadpool'' #43-50, 192 pages, May 2005, {{ISBN|0-7851-2524-8}})\n**''Other Reading'':\n***''[[X-Force]] & Cable, Volume 1: The Legend Returns'' (collects ''X-Force'' (vol. 2) #1-6, 144 pages, April 2005, {{ISBN|0-7851-1429-7}})\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*{{Comicbookdb|type=title|id=651|title=''Cable & Deadpool''}}\n*[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=12032 Wade & Bob's Bogus Adventure: Nicieza Talks ''Cable & Deadpool''] at [[Comic Book Resources]] (October 3, 2007)\n\n{{X-Comics}}\n{{Deadpool}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cable and Deadpool}}\n[[Category:2004 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Deadpool titles]]\n", "name_user": "92.24.251.100", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed a few typos)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_%26_Deadpool"}
{"title_page": "Dinko Zlatari\u0107", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=July 2019}}[[Image:Zlataric.jpg|thumb|Dinko Zlatari\u0107]]\n\n'''Dominko \"Dinko\" Zlatari\u0107''' (1558\u20131613) was a [[Croatian literature|Croatian]] poet and translator from [[Republic of Ragusa]], considered the best [[translation|translator]] of the  [[Renaissance]].\n\n==Life==\nDominiko was the most famous member of the [[Zlatari\u0107 (family)|Zlatari\u0107 noble family]] from Dubrovnik.  Dinko was born in 1558 as the son of \u017dimun (Simone Slatarich) Zlatari\u0107 and Frana, daughter of a very wealthy nobleman by the name of Dominik Kladurobovi\u0107. Dinko's brother Mihajlo Zlatari\u0107 served as a major-lieutenant in the forces of [[Juraj IV Zrinski]], while history didn't remember his other brothers Cvijeto and Nikola. His only sister Kata died by 1597. Dominiko had one son the name \u017dimun Zlatari\u0107.\n\nLearning [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Latin]] from a young age and writing his first poems when still a child, Dinko showed his talent early. Because of that, his father sent him to [[Padua]], where after completing the famous Gymnasium, he entered the local [[University of Padua|University]], where he learned [[rhetoric]], [[philosophy]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. In 1579 he funded the printing of Italian poems of his close friend [[Caesar Simonetti]] and dedicated them to [[Cvijeta Zuzori\u0107]]. He also studied [[Greek language|Greek]] in Padua.\n\nBecause of his knowledge and seriousness, the students elected him [[Rector (academia)|rector]] on 13 August 1579. For keeping the peace and order at the university, he was rewarded by the [[Republic of Venice]] with the title of \"Golden Knight\" (''eliues auratis''). In 1580, a plaque was put at the university in his honor and he returned to his home Dubrovnik.\n\nIn 1587 he married Mara, the daughter of Pero Gomovi\u0107. He shared his time between writing and running his estates in [[Cavtat]] and [[Konavle]]. He had friends among poets from Italy and Dubrovnik and admired the famous Renaissance beauty [[Cvijeta Zuzori\u0107]]. Zlatari\u0107 wrote in [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] \u2013 love poems, epitaphs and poetic meditations \u2013 but his greatest achievements are his translations.\n\nHe held an important place in the historiography of Croatian literature, as he explicitly declared  the language of his works under its Croatian name, \"''iz ve\u0107e tu\u0111ijeh jezika u hrvacki izlo\u017eene''\".\n\n==Translations and poems==\nHe translated [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso's]] manuscript of the pastoral drama ''Aminta'' in Padua in 1580. Later, dissatisfied with his translation, Zlatari\u0107 changed it, reworked it and adapted it to a Croatian setting, so it became ''Ljubmir''. Then he published ''[[Electra]], a Tragedy, and Ljubmir, a Pastoral History'' (a collection of his translations) and ''Love and Death of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]], Translated into Croatian from Several Foreign Languages'', in [[Venice]] in 1597. Zlatari\u0107 dedicated ''Electra'' to [[Juraj Zrinski]], ''Ljubmir'' to [[Miho Matufi\u0107]], and ''Pyramus and Thisbe'' to [[Cvijeta Zuzori\u0107]].\n\nHis translations from Greek, Italian and Latin included 26 original ''pjesni u smrt od razlicijeh'' (poems about various people's deaths). After his death, his son Miho Zlatari\u0107 collected and published 137 [[lyrical poetry|lyrical poems]] of his father under the title ''Pjesni razlike'' (Various Poems). Most of them are love poems.\n\nZlatari\u0107 was one of the most prolific [[epitaph]] writers of the Croatian [[Renaissance]]. The most effective one is his short epitaph to [[Dinko Ranjina]] (''Nadgrobje Dinku Ranjini''), followed by the epitaph to Bartolomeo Pescionio, the husband of Cvijeta Zuzori\u0107. Zlatari\u0107's poems are included in the ''Zadar Collection''.\n\n==Analysis==\nHe wrote under the influence of the first generation of Croatian [[Petrarch]]ists and Italian Petrarchist schools. His strong links with the local Petrarchist tradition are shown by his rich style. His varied expression, mastery of verse and sound, put Zlatari\u0107 among the best Croatian lyrical poets of his time.\n\nZlatari\u0107 is also renowned as the best translator of the Croatian Renaissance. He translated Tasso's ''Aminta'' literally, with the necessary changes forced by a different [[meter (poetry)|meter]]. The second version, ''Ljubmir'', is even more refined, literary and pure, with a richer language. His translation of [[Sophocles]]' ''Electra'' reveals not only Zlatari\u0107's education, taste and versifying ability, but also his poetic gift. ''Love of Pyramus and Thisbe'' is closer to a prose translation. In general, Zlatari\u0107's translations can be considered independent poetic achievements, widening the range of Croatian Renaissance literature.\n\n==Works==\n*''Aminta'', Padua, 1580\n*''Elektra, tra\u0111eija, Ljubmir, pripovijes pastijerska'' (Electra, a Tragedy, and Ljubmir, a Pastoral History), Venice, 1597\n*''Ljubav i smrt Pirama i Tizbe, iz ve\u0107e tu\u0111ijeh jezika u hrvacki slo\u017eene'' (Love and Death of Pyramus and Thisbe, Translated into Croatian from Several Foreign Languages), Venice, 1597\n*''Pjesni razlike'' (Various Poems), posthumous\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Poetry}}\n\n* [[Republic of Ragusa]]\n* [[Dubrovnik]]\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikisourcelang|hr|Dominko Zlatari\u0107}}\n* [https://books.google.hr/books?id=OCyLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=dominko+zlatari%C4%87+writer&source=bl&ots=TSDPxEKWfJ&sig=ACfU3U0lG1YqbixJqFEzz21kxkyuLpMfTw&hl=hr&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjonte1i8bhAhVEr3EKHScRBR4Q6AEwD3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=dominko%20zlatari%C4%87%20writer&f=false Zlatari\u0107 - renowned Croatian poet of the second half of the sixteenth century]\n* [https://books.google.hr/books?id=dC7FCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=dominko+zlatari%C4%87+writer&source=bl&ots=KvOD0md5HJ&sig=ACfU3U2c-hI2be7_D3qeBiexIx_TnLDR8g&hl=hr&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjonte1i8bhAhVEr3EKHScRBR4Q6AEwDnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=dominko%20zlatari%C4%87%20writer&f=false Zlatari\u0107 - poet and translator]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zlataric, Dinko}}\n[[Category:1558 births]]\n[[Category:1613 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century Croatian poets]]\n[[Category:Croatian translators]]\n[[Category:People from the Republic of Ragusa]]\n[[Category:Ragusan poets]]\n[[Category:Croatian male poets]]\n[[Category:People from Dubrovnik]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=July 2019}}[[Image:Zlataric.jpg|thumb|Dinko Zlatari\u0107]]\n\n'''Dominko \"Dinko\" Zlatari\u0107''' (1558\u20131613) was a [[Croatia]]n poet and translator from [[Republic of Ragusa]], considered the best [[translation|translator]] of the  [[Renaissance]].\n\n==Life==\nDominiko was the most famous member of the [[Zlatari\u0107 (family)|Zlatari\u0107 noble family]] from Dubrovnik.

The album went [[Music recording certification|gold]] after selling 150,000 copies and eventually sold over a quarter of a million copies. Three singles were released off the album: \"Vzd\u00e1len\u00e1\" (Far away, or \"Faraway\" on the English version), \"\u010carovn\u00e1 noc\" (Magical night, or \"Deep in the Night\" on the English version), and \"Nejde vr\u00e1tit \u010das\" (Can't turn back time, or \"I Need You\" on the English version), all of which were successful in the charts. An English version of the album, titled ''Angel on the Run'', came out the same year. Upon the success of Kreyson's first album, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek released his first solo record, titled ''Zlatej chlapec'' (Golden boy), in 1991. The rest of the band accompanied him on this record as well, though by this point Robert Vondrovic had been replaced by Daniel Hafstein (Motorband) and Libor Matej\u010d\u00edk (Motorband) took over guitar duties from Daniel Krob a year later.\n\n==Subsequent albums and hiatus==\nIn 1992, Kreyson released their second studio album, titled ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' (Crusaders). The record saw a shift towards faster, more speed-metal oriented tracks. As with ''Angel on the Run'', an English version of this album was released, titled ''Crusaders''. This album also attained gold status.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.last.fm/music/Kreyson+&+Ladislav+K%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%BEek/+wiki |title=Kreyson and Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek Bio |publisher=last.fm |accessdate=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n1993 saw the release of K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek's second solo album, ''Kl\u00ed\u010d k m\u00e9 du\u0161i'' (Key to my soul), and Kreyson's third studio album, ''Elix\u00edr \u017eivota'' (Elixir of life). This record didn't prove to be as successful as the band's previous two efforts, though it didn't fare poorly either. Jaroslav Barto\u0148 played only a few solos on the album, and the majority of the guitar tracks were recorded by Petr Henych.\n\nThe band's next effort, ''Z\u00e1kon d\u017eungle'' (Law of the jungle) was released in 1995, though by this point they were no longer signed to Tomm\u00fc Records, which had released their previous albums. A follow-up album was planned, but it never materialized and the band subsequently went on a 10-year hiatus after issuing a compilation album titled ''The best of'', in 1996.\n\n==Return==\nDuring this time, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek continued touring, working on solo material, as well as taking part in other musical projects. In 2006, in anticipation of bringing Kreyson back, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek launched a contest to select new band members. This culminated in a new lineup consisting of K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek on vocals, Jaroslav Barto\u0148 returning on lead guitar, Radek \"Reddy\" Kroc on second guitar, Honza Kirk B\u011bhunek on third guitar (a first for a Czech metal band), Lud\u011bk Ad\u00e1mek on bass (Ad\u00e1mek had briefly played with the band in 1993), and Zdenek Pradlovsk\u00fd on drums.\nThe band played a pre-launch show on March 17, 2007, which was broadcast live on Czech television from Ostrava's [[Ostravar Ar\u00e9na|\u010cEZ Ar\u00e9na]], during which they were joined on stage by Germany's [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]]. In June 2007, Kreyson filmed their first live album, titled ''Kreyson \u2013 T\u0159inec live'', at the ''Noc Pln\u00e1 Hv\u011bzd'' (Star-studded night) international music festival in [[T\u0159inec]]. They followed this with a successful tour of Czechia, Germany, and Switzerland in December 2007, together with Doro. Honza Kirk B\u011bhunek left the band around this time.\n\nKreyson began recording their fifth studio album, ''N\u00e1vrat kr\u00e1le'' (Return of the king), in the spring of 2011. Two singles were released before funds ran out and recording stopped. A new drummer also had to be found after Zdenek Pradlovsk\u00fd left, and Michal Dan\u011bk joined the band. With help from sponsors, Kreyson got the opportunity to continue the recording abroad, and they set out for [[Andy LaRocque]]'s ([[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]]) studio in [[Varberg]], [[Sweden]] in 2013. The entire album was thus recorded in LaRocque's Sonic Train Studios, and the artwork for it was done by famed English illustrator [[Mark Wilkinson]] ([[Marillion]], [[Fish (singer)|Fish]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Iron Maiden]]). The album was released in October 2013, and subsequently gained gold status.\n\n==Kreyson Memorial==\nIn 2016, Kreyson founding member and former guitarist Daniel Krob reached out to a few of his previous bandmates with the idea of a tour commemorating 25 years since the release of the band's debut album ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku''. The eventual lineup of this live act would be Krob on guitar, Robert Vondrovic on drums, Radek \"Reddy\" Kroc on second guitar, Petr \"Doldy\" Dol\u00e9nek on vocals, Stanislav \"Jokki\" Jokiel on bass, and Marek \"Elrin\" Svoboda on keyboards. Other former members of Kreyson were set to join the band on stage, including Jaroslav Barto\u0148 and Karel Adam. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek was also approached with the offer of joining but declined, citing his renewed commitment to the band Citron. The ensemble, going by the name Kreyson Memorial, began playing shows, and in 2019 they released their first album, a set of original tracks titled ''Str\u00e1\u017eci plamen\u016f'' (Guardians of the flames). Their current lineup consists of Krob, Kroc, Vondrovic, and Dol\u00e9nek, as well as Petr Form\u00e1nek on bass.\n\n==Kreyson MMXVII==\nIn May 2017, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek announced a new lineup for his band, this time with international contributions from German guitarist [[Roland Grapow]] ([[Helloween]], [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]]) and American drummer [[Mike Terrana]] ([[Rage (German band)|Rage]], [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]]). The band was further fleshed out by Michal K\u016fs (Eagleheart) on guitar and Ji\u0159\u00ed\u00a0\"George\"\u00a0Rain\u00a0(Citron, [[Sebastien (band)|Sebastien]]) on bass.

This album also attained gold status.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.last.fm/music/Kreyson+&+Ladislav+K%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%BEek/+wiki |title=Kreyson and Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek Bio |publisher=last.fm |accessdate=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n1993 saw the release of K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek's second solo album, ''Kl\u00ed\u010d k m\u00e9 du\u0161i'' (Key to my soul), and Kreyson's third studio album, ''Elix\u00edr \u017eivota'' (Elixir of life). This record didn't prove to be as successful as the band's previous two efforts, though it didn't fare poorly either. Jaroslav Barto\u0148 played only a few solos on the album, and the majority of the guitar tracks were recorded by Petr Henych.\n\nThe band's next effort, ''Z\u00e1kon d\u017eungle'' (Law of the jungle) was released in 1995, though by this point they were no longer signed to Tomm\u00fc Records, which had released their previous albums. A follow-up album was planned, but it never materialized and the band subsequently went on a 10-year hiatus after issuing a compilation album titled ''The best of'', in 1996.\n\n==Return==\nDuring this time, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek continued touring, working on solo material, as well as taking part in other musical projects. In 2006, in anticipation of bringing Kreyson back, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek launched a contest to select new band members. This culminated in a new lineup consisting of K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek on vocals, Jaroslav Barto\u0148 returning on lead guitar, Radek \"Reddy\" Kroc on second guitar, Honza Kirk B\u011bhunek on third guitar (a first for a Czech metal band), Lud\u011bk Ad\u00e1mek on bass (Ad\u00e1mek had briefly played with the band in 1993), and Zdenek Pradlovsk\u00fd on drums.\nThe band played a pre-launch show on March 17, 2007, which was broadcast live on Czech television from Ostrava's [[Ostravar Ar\u00e9na|\u010cEZ Ar\u00e9na]], during which they were joined on stage by Germany's [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]]. In June 2007, Kreyson filmed their first live album, titled ''Kreyson \u2013 T\u0159inec live'', at the ''Noc Pln\u00e1 Hv\u011bzd'' (Star-studded night) international music festival in [[T\u0159inec]]. They followed this with a successful tour of Czechia, Germany, and Switzerland in December 2007, together with Doro. Honza Kirk B\u011bhunek left the band around this time.\n\nKreyson began recording their fifth studio album, ''N\u00e1vrat kr\u00e1le'' (Return of the king), in the spring of 2011. Two singles were released before funds ran out and recording stopped. A new drummer also had to be found after Zdenek Pradlovsk\u00fd left, and Michal Dan\u011bk joined the band. With help from sponsors, Kreyson got the opportunity to continue the recording abroad, and they set out for [[Andy LaRocque]]'s ([[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]]) studio in [[Varberg]], [[Sweden]] in 2013. The entire album was thus recorded in LaRocque's Sonic Train Studios, and the artwork for it was done by famed English illustrator [[Mark Wilkinson]] ([[Marillion]], [[Fish (singer)|Fish]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Iron Maiden]]). The album was released in October 2013, and subsequently gained gold status.\n\n==Kreyson Memorial==\nIn 2016, Kreyson founding member and former guitarist Daniel Krob reached out to a few of his previous bandmates with the idea of a tour commemorating 25 years since the release of the band's debut album ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku''. The eventual lineup of this live act would be Krob on guitar, Robert Vondrovic on drums, Radek \"Reddy\" Kroc on second guitar, Petr \"Doldy\" Dol\u00e9nek on vocals, Stanislav \"Jokki\" Jokiel on bass, and Marek \"Elrin\" Svoboda on keyboards. Other former members of Kreyson were set to join the band on stage, including Jaroslav Barto\u0148 and Karel Adam. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek was also approached with the offer of joining but declined, citing his renewed commitment to the band Citron. The ensemble, going by the name Kreyson Memorial, began playing shows, and in 2019 they released their first album, a set of original tracks titled ''Str\u00e1\u017eci plamen\u016f'' (Guardians of the flames). Their current lineup consists of Krob, Kroc, Vondrovic, and Dol\u00e9nek, as well as Petr Form\u00e1nek on bass.\n\n==Kreyson MMXVII==\nIn May 2017, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek announced a new lineup for his band, this time with international contributions from German guitarist [[Roland Grapow]] ([[Helloween]], [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]]) and American drummer [[Mike Terrana]] ([[Rage (German band)|Rage]], [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]]). The band was further fleshed out by Michal K\u016fs (Eagleheart) on guitar and Ji\u0159\u00ed\u00a0\"George\"\u00a0Rain\u00a0(Citron, [[Sebastien (band)|Sebastien]]) on bass. They began to play shows and festivals, and a new album was discussed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spark-rockmagazine.cz/kreyson-ladi-krizka-ma-terranu-a-grapowa?address=kreyson-ladi-krizka-ma-terranu-a-grapowa&Event_page=5 |title=Kreyson's L\u00e1\u010fa K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek has Terrana and Grapow |publisher=spark-rockmagazine.cz |date=May 3, 2017 |accessdate=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n* ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku'' (1990)\n* ''Angel on the Run'' (1990)\n* ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' (1992)\n* ''Crusaders'' (1992)\n* ''Elix\u00edr \u017eivota'' (1993)\n* ''Z\u00e1kon d\u017eungle'' (1995)\n* ''N\u00e1vrat kr\u00e1le'' (2013)\n\n===Compilations===\n* ''The best of'' (1996)\n* ''20 years of Kreyson'' (2009)\n\n===Live albums===\n* ''Kreyson Live \u2013 T\u0159inec 2007'' CD/DVD (2007)\n\n==Band members==\n\n===Current members===\n* [[Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek]] \u2013 vocals\n* [[Roland Grapow]]\u00a0- guitar (2016 - present)\n* Michal K\u016fs \u2013 guitar (2016 - present)\n* Ji\u0159\u00ed\u00a0\"George\"\u00a0Rain\u00a0 \u2013 bass (2016 - present)\n* [[Mike Terrana]]\u00a0- drums (2016 - present)\n\n===Past members===\n* Jaroslav Barto\u0148 - guitar (1989 - 2009)\n* Daniel Krob - guitar, vocals (1989 - 1992)\n* Karel Adam - bass, keyboards (1989 - 1993)\n* Lud\u011bk Ad\u00e1mek - bass (1993; 2007 - 2016)\n* V\u00edtek Fiala - bass (1995)\n* Robert Vondrovic - drums (1989 - 1991)  \n* Daniel Hafstein - drums (1991 - 1993)\n* Daniel \u0160\u016fra - drums (1993 - 1995)  \n* Karel Schurrer - drums (1995)\n* Libor Matej\u010d\u00edk - guitar (1992 - 1993)\n* Petr Henych - guitar (1992 - 1995) \n* Radek \"Reddy\" Kroc - guitar (2007 - 2016)\n* Honza Kirk B\u011bhunek - guitar (2007 - 2008)\n* Zdenek Pradlovsk\u00fd - drums (2007 - 2012)\n* Peter Bo\u0161ka - guitar (2008 - 2016)\n* Michal Dan\u011bk - drums (2012 - 2016)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ladakrizek.com Official band page]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Czechoslovak rock music groups]]\n[[Category: Czech heavy metal musical groups]]\n[[Category:Czech rock music groups]]\n[[Category: Czech musical groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Prague]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1989]]\n", "name_user": "Revirvlkodlaku", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCompilations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreyson"}

Transition to aeronautical mode.]]\nAfter takeoff the plane reaches an altitude of 12&nbsp;km. This classical aeronautical phase can last for 45 minutes. The pilot shuts down the jets and starts the methane oxygen rocket engine at the rear of the vehicle. The plane then raises along a vertical trajectory. For 90 seconds of flight with a top speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 3, the plane is rocketed upwards. The maximum acceleration is 3 ''g'' (30&nbsp;m/s\u00b2). At an altitude of 60&nbsp;km, the rocket engine is shut down and the plane continues to climb up to a maximum altitude of 100&nbsp;km. This is the weightlessness phase.\n\nThen the plane gets down to 15&nbsp;km at a high [[angle of attack]], being progressively decelerated by the atmosphere; at this altitude, after transition to aeronautical mode, the jets are reignited to bring the plane back to a classical landing strip.<ref>[http://www.iafastro.org/fileadmin/template/main/Documents/Events/2007IAC/LBN5.pdf Description of the project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128184910/http://www.iafastro.org/fileadmin/template/main/Documents/Events/2007IAC/LBN5.pdf |date=2007-11-28 }} - Presentation at IAC 2007 Hyderabad by Christophe Chavagnac - Flight profile provided on page 7</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[Image:EADS Astrium Space Tourism interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior layout of the vehicle at Paris Air Show 2007]]\n\nThe total mass of the vehicle is 18 metric tons (39,700&nbsp;lb) at takeoff.

The seats are attached to a pendular system which allows the acceleration to be perpendicular to the back of the passengers. They pivot around the attachment points so that the passengers are aligned rearside to the spacecraft x-axis (body aligned on Gx-axis) during launch acceleration and they are rearside on the negative z-axis during weightlessness and reentry.<ref>[http://www.personalspaceflight.info/2007/06/14/eads-reinvents-rocketplane/ EADS reinvents Rocketplane]</ref>\n\nThe plane is designed for ten years of service at a flight rate of once a week.<ref name =\"Air & Cosmos\" />\n\n==Industrial organisation==\nThe development will be led by EADS Astrium.

Transition to aeronautical mode.]]\nAfter takeoff the plane reaches an altitude of 12&nbsp;km. This classical aeronautical phase can last for 45 minutes. The pilot shuts down the jets and starts the methane oxygen rocket engine at the rear of the vehicle. The plane then raises along a vertical trajectory. For 90 seconds of flight with a top speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 3, the plane is rocketed upwards. The maximum acceleration is 3 ''g'' (30&nbsp;m/s\u00b2). At an altitude of 60&nbsp;km, the rocket engine is shut down and the plane continues to climb up to a maximum altitude of 100&nbsp;km. This is the weightlessness phase.\n\nThen the plane gets down to 15&nbsp;km at a high [[angle of attack]], being progressively decelerated by the atmosphere; at this altitude, after transition to aeronautical mode, the jets are reignited to bring the plane back to a classical landing strip.<ref>[http://www.iafastro.org/fileadmin/template/main/Documents/Events/2007IAC/LBN5.pdf Description of the project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128184910/http://www.iafastro.org/fileadmin/template/main/Documents/Events/2007IAC/LBN5.pdf |date=2007-11-28 }} - Presentation at IAC 2007 Hyderabad by Christophe Chavagnac - Flight profile provided on page 7</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[Image:EADS Astrium Space Tourism interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior layout of the vehicle at Paris Air Show 2007]]\n\nThe total mass of the vehicle is 18 metric tons (39,700&nbsp;lb) at takeoff.

The seats are attached to a pendular system which allows the acceleration to be perpendicular to the back of the passengers. They pivot around the attachment points so that the passengers are aligned rearside to the spacecraft x-axis (body aligned on Gx-axis) during launch acceleration and they are rearside on the negative z-axis during weightlessness and reentry.<ref>[http://www.personalspaceflight.info/2007/06/14/eads-reinvents-rocketplane/ EADS reinvents Rocketplane]</ref>\n\nThe plane is designed for ten years of service at a flight rate of once a week.<ref name =\"Air & Cosmos\" />\n\n==Industrial organisation==\nThe development will be led by EADS Astrium.

In 1567, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary\u2019s]] short period of personal rule ended in recrimination, intrigue and disaster when, after her capture at [[battle of Carberry Hill|Carberry Hill]], she was forced to [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|abdicate]] in favour of [[James VI]], her infant son.  Mary was imprisoned in [[Loch Leven Castle]], while her Protestant half-brother, [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James Stewart, Earl of Moray]] was appointed [[Regent]] on behalf of his nephew.  In early May 1568 Mary escaped, heading west to the country of the Hamiltons, high among her remaining supporters, and the safety of [[Dumbarton Castle]] with the determination to restore her rights as queen. Mary was defeated and went into exile and captivity in England. The battle can be regarded as the start of the [[Marian civil war]].\n\n==Queen's Men==\n[[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|Mary's abdication]] had not been universally popular, even among sections of the Protestant nobility, and news of her escape were widely welcomed.  With an escort of fifty horse led by [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley|Lord Claud Hamilton]] she arrived in [[Lanarkshire]], soon to be joined by a wide cross-section of the nobility, including the Earls of [[Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll|Argyll]], [[Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis|Cassillis]], [[Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes|Rothes]] and [[Earl of Eglinton|Eglinton]], the Lords [[Lord Somerville|Sommerville]], [[Lord Hay of Yester|Yester]], [[Lord Livingston|Livingston]], [[Lord Herries of Terregles|Herries]], [[Lord Fleming|Fleming]], [[James Ross, 4th Lord Ross|Ross]], numerous of the feudal barons and their followers.  Within a few days Mary had managed to gather a respectable force of some 6000 men.\n\nIt was openly declared that her abdication, and her consent to the coronation of James, had been extorted from her under threat of death.  An act of council was then passed, declaring the whole process by which Moray had been appointed as Regent to be [[treason]]able.  A [[Contract|bond]] was drawn up by those present for her restitution, signed by eight earls, nine bishops, eighteen lords, twelve abbots and nearly one hundred barons.\n\n==Mary's march==\nIt was Mary's intention to avoid battle if possible, retiring instead to [[Dumbarton Castle]], still held for her by [[John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming]]. Here she would be in a virtually impregnable position, well placed to receive the expected reinforcements from the north, and then recover her hold over the country by degrees. With the intention of by-passing Moray she marched to [[Rutherglen castle]] meeting loyal supporters and then on a wide circuit past Glasgow, intending to move by way of [[Langside]], [[Crookston, Glasgow|Crookston]] and [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] back towards the [[River Clyde]], and then on to Dumbarton on the north side of the Clyde estuary. Moray drew up his army on the moor close to the village of Langside, then several miles south of Glasgow but now well within the city. [[William Kirkcaldy of Grange|Kirkcaldy]], keeping an eye on the enemy movements, noted that they were keeping to the south of the River Cart, the Regent's army being on the opposite bank. In response he ordered hackbutters ([[musketeer]]s) to mount behind each of his horsemen, rapidly fording the river, and placing them among the cottages, hedges and gardens of the village, which bordered each side of a narrow lane, through which Mary's army must [[defile (geography)|defile]]. Meanwhile Moray continued to deploy the rest of the army, the [[Vanguard (military tactics)|vanguard]] under the command of the [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]] leading the march across a nearby bridge. The whole army then deployed the right around the village. No sooner was this complete than the Queen's vanguard, commanded by Lord Hamilton, began its advance through the village. The battle was now under way.\n\n==Guns and pikes==\nMary's army was commanded by Argyll, who was to show little in the way of real military skill, seemingly hoping simply to push Moray aside by sheer force of numbers: it is even suggested in the sources that he fainted at one point, though this is almost certainly a rumour spread by his enemies.  With her army now engaged the Queen stood some distance to the rear, close to Cathcart Castle on a mound since named as the Court Knowe.  As Hamilton attempted to force a passage through Langside he was met by close fire from Grange's hackbutters.  Many in the front ranks were killed, throwing the remainder back on those following, and adding to the general confusion.  Hamilton pushed on, finally reaching the top of a hill, only to find the main enemy army drawn up in good order. Morton with the border pikemen advanced to intercept Mary's vanguard.  Both sides now met in '[[push of pike]]'.  The forest of inter-locked spears was now so thick it is said that if those behind threw their discharged pistols at the enemy the weapons simply rested on the shafts as on a carpet, rather than falling to the ground.\n\nGrange, whom Moray had allowed considerable leeway, continued to act with courage and distinction; \"...&nbsp;the Regent committed unto the laird of Grange, the special care, as an experienced captain, to oversee every danger, to ride to every wing and encourage and make help where the greatest height was.\"   The battle was now at its height and the outcome still doubtful, until Grange saw that the right wing of the Regent's army-consisting of the barons of [[Renfrewshire]]-was beginning to lose ground.  He immediately galloped to the main battalion and brought reinforcements.  This was done so effectively, and the counter-attack pressed with such force, that it broke the enemy ranks.  Moray, who hitherto had stood on the defensive, repulsing Mary's cavalry, now charged at the main enemy battalion, the fight now joined all along the line.  The Queen's men crumbled, the fugitives being closely pursued by a party of Highlanders.  The Battle of Langside, which had lasted for some forty-five minutes, was over.\n\n==Aftermath==\nMary's biographer, [[Antonia Fraser]], describes the Battle of Langside a \"colossal defeat\" for Mary.<ref>Fraser, Antonia, ''Mary Queen of Scots'', Orion, London, 1969</ref> Only one of Moray's men was killed, whereas over 100 of Mary's men were lost,<ref>Fraser, Antonia, ''Mary Queen of Scots'', Orion, London, 1969</ref> a figure that almost certainly would have been much higher but for Moray's decision to avoid further bloodshed by ordering a halt to the pursuit. Over 300 of Mary's men were taken prisoner, including [[George Seton, 7th Lord Seton|Lord Seton]] and Sir James Hamilton and many of his Clan.<ref>Fraser, Antonia, ''Mary Queen of Scots'', Orion, London, 1969</ref> Mary and her escort rode off, first trying to reach Dumbarton Castle, but then turning south, eventually arriving at [[Dundrennan Abbey]].  From here she left for England, never to see Scotland again.\n\nMary crossed the [[Solway Firth]] to [[Workington]] on 16 May 1568 at night with twenty companions. This unexpected event provoked a dispute amongst the English border officials. On the next day she moved to [[Cockermouth]] and was greeted by Richard Lowther, the deputy of [[Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope]] at [[Carlisle Castle]]. Lowther escorted Mary to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] on 18 May. Meanwhile, the [[Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] who was at [[Topcliffe, North Yorkshire|Topcliffe]] heard the news from Workington, which was in his jurisdiction. The Earl obtained a letter of authority from the Council of the North at York to be the Scottish Queen's host and to \"let none of them escape.\" When the Earl arrived at Carlisle on 22 May, Richard Lowther defied him, and the Vice-Chamberlain of England, [[Francis Knollys (the elder)|Francis Knollys]], upheld Lowther's actions.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), pp. 408-413</ref>\n\nOver the next five years Mary's supporters in Scotland continued a [[Marian civil war|civil war]] with the Regents of Scotland.\n\n==Queen and King's men==\nA contemporary list of leading supporters on both sides at the battle survives.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), p. 405, no. 653.</ref><br />'''For the Queen''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Earl of Argyll]]\n* [[Earl of Eglinton]]\n* [[Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis|Earl of Cassillis]]\n* [[Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes|Earl of Rothes]]\n* [[George Seton, 7th Lord Seton|Lord Seton]]\n* [[Robert Seton, 1st Earl of Winton|Master of Seton]]\n* [[Lord Herries]]\n* [[Robert Boyd, 5th Lord Boyd|Lord Boyd]]\n* [[Lord Hay of Yester]]\n* [[Lord Ross]]\n* [[James Somerville, 6th Lord Somerville|Lord Somerville]]\n* [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley|Lord Claude Hamilton]]\n* Sir James Hamilton & the [[Clan Hamilton|Hamilton name]]\n}}\n'''For Regent Moray and the King''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]]\n* [[Alexander Cunningham, 5th Earl of Glencairn|Earl of Glencairn]]\n* [[Earl of Menteith]]\n* [[Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home|Lord Home]]\n* [[Patrick Lindsay, 6th Lord Lindsay|Lord Lindsay]]\n* [[Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree|Lord Ochiltree]]\n* [[William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Lord Ruthven]]\n* Laird of Trawick (sic), John Stewart of [[Traquair]]\n* [[James Douglas, 7th Baron Drumlanrig|Laird of Drumlanrig]]\n* [[William Maitland of Lethington|Lord Secretary Maitland]]\n* [[Duke of Atholl|William Murray of Tullibardine]], Lord Comptroller\n* [[Robert Pitcairn (commendator)|Robert Pitcairn]], [[Abbot of Dunfermline]]\n* John Hay, [[Abbot of Balmerino]],\n* [[Robert Richardson (Lord Treasurer)|Robert Richardson]], [[Lord High Treasurer of Scotland|Lord Treasurer]]\n* [[James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich|Sir James Balfour]], Justice Clerk\n* [[James MacGill of Nether Rankeillour]]\n* Thomas Kennedy, laird of Bargany\n* Laird of [[Glengarnock]]\n* [[Clan MacFarlane|Andrew MacFarlane, laird of MacFarlane with his Highlandmen]], and others.\n}}\n'''Prisoners (taken by Regent Moray)''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Lord Seton\n* Master of Cassilis\n* Lord Ross\n* [[Earl of Eglinton|Master of Eglinton]]\n* Sheriff of Ayr\n* Sir James Hamilton (of Libberton}\n* The two sons of Archbishop Hamilton\n* A son of Lord Kilwinning\n* Laird of [[Innerwick Castle|Innerwick]]\n* Laird of Tabroune\n* Laird of Balwerie\n* Laird of Preston younger\n* Laird of Lauchop\n* Laird of Mowe\n* Laird of Irnok\n* Laird of Camskeith\n* Laird of Hahill\n* Laird of Kneeland\n* Laird of Greenschellis\n* Goodman of Bothwellhaugh\n* Goodman of Pardovan\n* Other Hamiltons\n}}\n\nFrom this list and other evidence, [[Gordon Donaldson]] analysed the allegiances of Scottish families during the 16th century to the cause of Mary, to English or French policy, and to the [[Scottish Reformation]], in his ''All the Queen's Men'' (1983).\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bain, Joseph, ''Calendar of Scottish Papers 1563-1569'', Edinburgh, 1900.\n* [[Antonia Fraser|Fraser, Antonia]], ''Mary Queen of Scots''Orion, London, 1969.\n* Melville, Sir James, ''Memoirs of His Own Life, 1549-1593'', 1827.\n* [[Patrick Fraser Tytler|Tytler, Patrick Fraser]] ''The History of Scotland'', vol.

In 1567, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary\u2019s]] short period of personal rule ended in recrimination, intrigue and disaster when, after her capture at [[battle of Carberry Hill|Carberry Hill]], she was forced to [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|abdicate]] in favour of [[James VI]], her infant son.  Mary was imprisoned in [[Loch Leven Castle]], while her Protestant half-brother, [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James Stewart, Earl of Moray]] was appointed [[Regent]] on behalf of his nephew.  In early May 1568 Mary escaped, heading west to the country of the Hamiltons, high among her remaining supporters, and the safety of [[Dumbarton Castle]] with the determination to restore her rights as queen. Mary was defeated and went into exile and captivity in England. The battle can be regarded as the start of the [[Marian civil war]].\n\n==Queen's Men==\n[[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|Mary's abdication]] had not been universally popular, even among sections of the Protestant nobility, and news of her escape were widely welcomed.  With an escort of fifty horse led by [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley|Lord Claud Hamilton]] she arrived in [[Lanarkshire]], soon to be joined by a wide cross-section of the nobility, including the Earls of [[Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll|Argyll]], [[Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis|Cassillis]], [[Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes|Rothes]] and [[Earl of Eglinton|Eglinton]], the Lords [[Lord Somerville|Sommerville]], [[Lord Hay of Yester|Yester]], [[Lord Livingston|Livingston]], [[Lord Herries of Terregles|Herries]], [[Lord Fleming|Fleming]], [[James Ross, 4th Lord Ross|Ross]], numerous of the feudal barons and their followers.  Within a few days Mary had managed to gather a respectable force of some 6000 men.\n\nIt was openly declared that her abdication, and her consent to the coronation of James, had been extorted from her under threat of death.  An act of council was then passed, declaring the whole process by which Moray had been appointed as Regent to be [[treason]]able.  A [[Contract|bond]] was drawn up by those present for her restitution, signed by eight earls, nine bishops, eighteen lords, twelve abbots and nearly one hundred barons.\n\n==Mary's march==\nIt was Mary's intention to avoid battle if possible, retiring instead to [[Dumbarton Castle]], still held for her by [[John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming]].
