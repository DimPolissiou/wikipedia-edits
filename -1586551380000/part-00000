Before entering politics, he farmed in the [[Waikato]] and was involved in [[Federated Farmers]], a nationwide agricultural association. Bolger won election to Parliament in [[1972 New Zealand general election|1972]], and subsequently served in several portfolios in the [[Third National Government of New Zealand|Third National Government]]. Following one unsuccessful bid for the party leadership in [[1984 New Zealand National Party leadership election|1984]], Bolger was elected as [[Leader of the New Zealand National Party|National Party leader]] in [[1986 New Zealand National Party leadership election|1986]].  He served as [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 1986 to 1990.\n\nBolger led the National Party to a [[landslide victory]]\u2014the largest in its history\u2014in the {{NZ election link|1990}}, allowing him to become Prime Minister on 2 November 1990. The [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]] was elected on the promise of delivering a \"Decent Society\" following the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|previous Labour government]]'s economic reforms, known as \"[[Rogernomics]]\", which Bolger criticised. However, shortly after taking office, his government was forced to bail out the [[Bank of New Zealand]] and as a result reneged on a number of promises made during the election campaign. Bolger's government essentially advanced the [[Free market|free-market]] reforms of the previous government, while implementing drastic cuts in public spending. National retained power in the [[1993 New Zealand general election|1993 election]], albeit with a much-reduced majority.\n\nBolger's second term in office saw the introduction of the [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|MMP electoral system]]. In the subsequent [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]] National emerged as the largest party but it was forced to enter into a coalition with [[New Zealand First]]. Bolger continued as Prime Minister, however his critics argued that he gave the inexperienced NZ First too much influence in his Cabinet. On 8 December 1997, Bolger was effectively [[1997 New Zealand National Party leadership election|ousted as leader]] by his party caucus, and was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Jenny Shipley]].\n\nAfter resigning as a Member of Parliament in 1998, Bolger became [[List of ambassadors of New Zealand to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]] and remained in this post until 2002.\n\n==Early life==\nBolger was born in 1935 in [[Opunake]] in Taranaki.

In 1977 he was made a cabinet minister under Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]], first as New Zealand's [[Minister of Fisheries (New Zealand)|Minister of Fisheries]] and Associate Minister of Agriculture (1977), later as [[Minister of Labour (New Zealand)|Minister of Labour]] and [[Minister of Immigration (New Zealand)|Minister of Immigration]] following the 1978 election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://executive.govt.nz/93-96/minister/pm/INDEX.HTML|title=Rt Hon Jim Bolger|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=6 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407171926/http://www.beehive.govt.nz/|archive-date=7 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter the defeat of National at the [[1984 New Zealand general election|1984 general elections]], Bolger and deputy leader [[Jim McLay]] challenged Muldoon for the leadership of the party. McLay succeeded and named Bolger as deputy leader (and hence [[Deputy Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Deputy Leader of the Opposition]]). However, in 1986 Bolger successfully challenged McLay's leadership. Initially Bolger pursued a pro law and order approach, with a focus on critiquing Labour's perceived reluctance to combat \"lawlessness\" and offering a referendum on the reintroduction of [[capital punishment]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pratt|first1=John|last2=Treacher|first2=Phillip|date=December 1988|title=Law and Order and the 1987 New Zealand Election|journal=Aust & NZ Journal of Criminology|volume=21|issue=4|pages=253\u2013254|doi=10.1177/000486588802100407}}</ref> Following an unsuccessful election in [[1987 New Zealand general election|1987]], National under Bolger capitalised on public anger at the Labour government's highly unpopular economic policies to win National's biggest ever majority (and by extension the largest in New Zealand history) at the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990]].

In 1992, New Zealanders voted to change to the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) system. This was confirmed in a binding referendum held at the same time as the 1993 general election, which National won. Bolger had originally proposed a return to a [[bicameral]] system, with a [[Parliament of New Zealand#Senate proposals|Senate]] elected by [[Single Transferable Vote]],<ref name=\"nzhistory\"/> but this proposal was dropped in the face of support for electoral reform.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Second term====\n\nAt the [[1993 New Zealand general election|1993 election]], National was narrowly able to retain government owing partly to a slight economic recovery and the opposition being split between three competing parties; Bolger himself expected a comfortable election win, exclaiming \"bugger the pollsters\" upon the election result. National's unprecedented eighteen-seat majority had virtually disappeared and the country faced an election night [[hung parliament]] for the first time since [[New Zealand general election, 1931|1931]], with National one seat short of the required 50 seats to govern. Final [[special vote]]s counted over the following days revealed National had won {{NZ electorate link|Waitaki}}, allowing it to form a government with the majority of one seat but required the election of a Speaker from the opposition benches ([[Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)|Peter Tapsell]] of the Labour Party) to hold a working majority in the House.\n\nFollowing this election result Bolger expressed the need to work with other political parties and decided to demote Richardson from her post, appointing [[Bill Birch]] who was seen as more moderate. During Birch's tenure, spending on core areas such as health<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/82f4780aa066f8d7cc2570bb006b5d4d/8399fc0f59415f4bcc256c7e007165be/$FILE/expenditure.pdf |title=Health Expenditure Trends in New Zealand 1990\u20132001 |year=2001 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and education increased. His government passed the [[Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994]]. During the 1994 Address-in-Reply debate, Bolger argued in favour of a [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand republic]], Bolger denied that his views related to his Irish heritage.<ref name=\"bolger_bio\">{{cite book|title=Bolger: A view from the top \u2013 my seven years as Prime Minister|author=Jim Bolger|publisher=Viking|year=1998|isbn=978-0-670-88369-1}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1995 the [[Cave Creek disaster]] gained public attention after a scenic viewing platform collapsed, killing fourteen people. The platform had been erected by the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] in 1994 and later inquiries found that many of those who constructed it did not have prerequisite qualifications for building the platform. Despite DOC taking responsibility for its collapse, there would be no prosecutions (as the Crown is unable to prosecute itself) but $2.6 million worth of compensation was paid to the victims' families. Bolger initially attacked the report produced by the Commission of Inquiry, arguing that the platform failed \"essentially because it lacked about $20 worth of bolts to hold it together\". The Minister of Conservation, [[Denis Marshall]], was criticised in the media for his management of the Department. Many people blamed Marshall, although there was also wide criticism of the whole government's policies on management of the conservation estate. Marshall eventually resigned in May 1996, just over a year after the accident occurred. A new Minister, [[Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)|Nick Smith]], was appointed, and a full review of the Department was conducted by the State Services Commission.\n\nProposals to end the status of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] as the country's highest court of appeal failed to gain parliamentary sanction during Bolger's premiership (however Helen Clark's [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] would replace the right of appeal in 2003 when it set up the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]]). Bolger's government ended the awarding of [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|British honours]] in 1996, introducing a [[New Zealand Honours System]]. At a conference on the \"Bolger years\" in 2007, Bolger recalled speaking to the Queen about the issue of New Zealand becoming a republic: \"I have more than once spoken with Her Majesty about my view that New Zealand would at some point elect its own Head of State, we discussed the matter in a most sensible way and she was in no way surprised or alarmed and neither did she cut my head off.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10436441|title=Bolger told Queen monarchy's time numbered|author=Maggie Tait|accessdate=27 April 2007|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=27 April 2007}}</ref> With the new MMP environment some National Party MPs defected to a new grouping, [[United New Zealand]] in mid-1995, whilst other splinter parties emerged.\n\n====Third term====\nThe 1996 election saw the New Zealand First Party, led by [[Winston Peters]], holding the balance of power after the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]]. Bolger's government stayed in office in a caretaker role while negotiations began for a coalition government. Although National remained the largest single party, neither Bolger nor Labour leader [[Helen Clark]] could form a government on their own.  The balance of power in the new House rested with [[New Zealand First]], a party that had only been formed three years earlier. Its leader, [[Winston Peters]], had left the National Party to form his own party, opposing many of the free-market policies implemented by National and Labour before it.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Ultimately, in December 1996, Peters decided to go into coalition with National.  Bolger had to pay a very high price in order to stay in power, however.  As part of a detailed coalition agreement Peters became Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer (senior to the existing post of Finance Minister - which was retained by Birch). Although Bolger had previously sacked Peters from a National cabinet the two initially seemed to work well together.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Resignation====\n[[File:Jenny Shipley.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jenny Shipley]] mounted a coup against Bolger in December 1997]]\nGrowing opposition to Bolger's slow pace and perceived exaggerated influence of New Zealand First led Transport Minister [[Jenny Shipley]] to stage a caucus room coup in 1997. Bolger was out of the country at the time, and when he returned he found that he did not have enough support in his caucus to remain as party leader and prime minister. Rather than face being voted out, he resigned on 8 December, and Shipley became New Zealand's first woman prime minister. As a concession, Bolger was made a junior minister in Shipley's government.<ref name=\"usnzcouncil\">{{cite web|title=Rt Hon.

Retiring politician journalist [[Peter Luke]] said that Bolger was \"[t]he most under-estimated prime minister I have come across. He made up for his lack of education by having an innate ability to relate to the aspirations of ordinary Kiwis.

({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|\u028c|l|d\u0292|\u0259r}} {{respell|BUL|j\u0259r}}; born 31 May 1935) is a [[List of New Zealand politicians|New Zealand politician]] of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] who was the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|35th Prime Minister of New Zealand]], serving from 1990 to 1997.\n\nBolger was born to an [[Irish diaspora|Irish immigrant]] family in [[Opunake]], [[Taranaki]]. Before entering politics, he farmed in the [[Waikato]] and was involved in [[Federated Farmers]], a nationwide agricultural association. Bolger won election to Parliament in [[1972 New Zealand general election|1972]], and subsequently served in several portfolios in the [[Third National Government of New Zealand|Third National Government]]. Following one unsuccessful bid for the party leadership in [[1984 New Zealand National Party leadership election|1984]], Bolger was elected as [[Leader of the New Zealand National Party|National Party leader]] in [[1986 New Zealand National Party leadership election|1986]].  He served as [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 1986 to 1990.\n\nBolger led the National Party to a [[landslide victory]]\u2014the largest in its history\u2014in the {{NZ election link|1990}}, allowing him to become Prime Minister on 2 November 1990. The [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]] was elected on the promise of delivering a \"Decent Society\" following the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|previous Labour government]]'s economic reforms, known as \"[[Rogernomics]]\", which Bolger criticised. However, shortly after taking office, his government was forced to bail out the [[Bank of New Zealand]] and as a result reneged on a number of promises made during the election campaign. Bolger's government essentially advanced the [[Free market|free-market]] reforms of the previous government, while implementing drastic cuts in public spending. National retained power in the [[1993 New Zealand general election|1993 election]], albeit with a much-reduced majority.\n\nBolger's second term in office saw the introduction of the [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|MMP electoral system]]. In the subsequent [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]] National emerged as the largest party but it was forced to enter into a coalition with [[New Zealand First]]. Bolger continued as Prime Minister, however his critics argued that he gave the inexperienced NZ First too much influence in his Cabinet. On 8 December 1997, Bolger was effectively [[1997 New Zealand National Party leadership election|ousted as leader]] by his party caucus, and was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Jenny Shipley]].\n\nAfter resigning as a Member of Parliament in 1998, Bolger became [[List of ambassadors of New Zealand to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]] and remained in this post until 2002.\n\n==Early life==\nBolger was born in 1935 in [[Opunake]] in Taranaki.

This electorate is traditional National territory, and Bolger won easily. He represented this electorate, renamed [[Taranaki-King Country]] in 1996, until his retirement in 1998. In 1977 he was made a cabinet minister under Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]], first as New Zealand's [[Minister of Fisheries (New Zealand)|Minister of Fisheries]] and Associate Minister of Agriculture (1977), later as [[Minister of Labour (New Zealand)|Minister of Labour]] and [[Minister of Immigration (New Zealand)|Minister of Immigration]] following the 1978 election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://executive.govt.nz/93-96/minister/pm/INDEX.HTML|title=Rt Hon Jim Bolger|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=6 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407171926/http://www.beehive.govt.nz/|archive-date=7 April 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter the defeat of National at the [[1984 New Zealand general election|1984 general elections]], Bolger and deputy leader [[Jim McLay]] challenged Muldoon for the leadership of the party. McLay succeeded and named Bolger as deputy leader (and hence [[Deputy Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Deputy Leader of the Opposition]]). However, in 1986 Bolger successfully challenged McLay's leadership. Initially Bolger pursued a pro law and order approach, with a focus on critiquing Labour's perceived reluctance to combat \"lawlessness\" and offering a referendum on the reintroduction of [[capital punishment]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pratt|first1=John|last2=Treacher|first2=Phillip|date=December 1988|title=Law and Order and the 1987 New Zealand Election|journal=Aust & NZ Journal of Criminology|volume=21|issue=4|pages=253\u2013254|doi=10.1177/000486588802100407}}</ref> Following an unsuccessful election in [[1987 New Zealand general election|1987]], National under Bolger capitalised on public anger at the Labour government's highly unpopular economic policies to win National's biggest ever majority (and by extension the largest in New Zealand history) at the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990]].

In 1992, New Zealanders voted to change to the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) system. This was confirmed in a binding referendum held at the same time as the 1993 general election, which National won. Bolger had originally proposed a return to a [[bicameral]] system, with a [[Parliament of New Zealand#Senate proposals|Senate]] elected by [[Single Transferable Vote]],<ref name=\"nzhistory\"/> but this proposal was dropped in the face of support for electoral reform.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====Second term====\n\nAt the [[1993 New Zealand general election|1993 election]], National was narrowly able to retain government owing partly to a slight economic recovery and the opposition being split between three competing parties; Bolger himself expected a comfortable election win, exclaiming \"bugger the pollsters\" upon the election result. National's unprecedented eighteen-seat majority had virtually disappeared and the country faced an election night [[hung parliament]] for the first time since [[New Zealand general election, 1931|1931]], with National one seat short of the required 50 seats to govern. Final [[special vote]]s counted over the following days revealed National had won {{NZ electorate link|Waitaki}}, allowing it to form a government with the majority of one seat but required the election of a Speaker from the opposition benches ([[Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)|Peter Tapsell]] of the Labour Party) to hold a working majority in the House.\n\nFollowing this election result Bolger expressed the need to work with other political parties and decided to demote Richardson from her post, appointing [[Bill Birch]] who was seen as more moderate. During Birch's tenure, spending on core areas such as health<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/82f4780aa066f8d7cc2570bb006b5d4d/8399fc0f59415f4bcc256c7e007165be/$FILE/expenditure.pdf |title=Health Expenditure Trends in New Zealand 1990\u20132001 |year=2001 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and education increased. His government passed the [[Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994]]. During the 1994 Address-in-Reply debate, Bolger argued in favour of a [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand republic]], Bolger denied that his views related to his Irish heritage.<ref name=\"bolger_bio\">{{cite book|title=Bolger: A view from the top \u2013 my seven years as Prime Minister|author=Jim Bolger|publisher=Viking|year=1998|isbn=978-0-670-88369-1}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1995 the [[Cave Creek disaster]] gained public attention after a scenic viewing platform collapsed, killing fourteen people. The platform had been erected by the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] in 1994 and later inquiries found that many of those who constructed it did not have prerequisite qualifications for building the platform. Despite DOC taking responsibility for its collapse, there would be no prosecutions (as the Crown is unable to prosecute itself) but $2.6 million dollars worth of compensation was paid to the victims' families. Bolger initially attacked the report produced by the Commission of Inquiry, arguing that the platform failed \"essentially because it lacked about $20 worth of bolts to hold it together\". The Minister of Conservation, [[Denis Marshall]], was criticised in the media for his management of the Department. Many people blamed Marshall, although there was also wide criticism of the whole government's policies on management of the conservation estate. Marshall eventually resigned in May 1996, just over a year after the accident occurred. A new Minister, [[Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)|Nick Smith]], was appointed, and a full review of the Department was conducted by the State Services Commission.\n\nProposals to end the status of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] as the country's highest court of appeal failed to gain parliamentary sanction during Bolger's premiership (however Helen Clark's [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] would replace the right of appeal in 2003 when it set up the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]]). Bolger's government ended the awarding of [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|British honours]] in 1996, introducing a [[New Zealand Honours System]]. At a conference on the \"Bolger years\" in 2007, Bolger recalled speaking to the Queen about the issue of New Zealand becoming a republic: \"I have more than once spoken with Her Majesty about my view that New Zealand would at some point elect its own Head of State, we discussed the matter in a most sensible way and she was in no way surprised or alarmed and neither did she cut my head off.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10436441|title=Bolger told Queen monarchy's time numbered|author=Maggie Tait|accessdate=27 April 2007|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=27 April 2007}}</ref> With the new MMP environment some National Party MPs defected to a new grouping, [[United New Zealand]] in mid-1995, whilst other splinter parties emerged.\n\n====Third term====\nThe 1996 election saw the New Zealand First Party, led by [[Winston Peters]], holding the balance of power after the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]]. Bolger's government stayed in office in a caretaker role while negotiations began for a coalition government. Although National remained the largest single party, neither Bolger nor Labour leader [[Helen Clark]] could form a government on their own.  The balance of power in the new House rested with [[New Zealand First]], a party that had only been formed three years earlier. Its leader, [[Winston Peters]], had left the National Party to form his own party, opposing many of the free-market policies implemented by National and Labour before it.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Ultimately, in December 1996, Peters decided to go into coalition with National.  Bolger had to pay a very high price in order to stay in power, however.  As part of a detailed coalition agreement Peters became Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer (senior to the existing post of Finance Minister - which was retained by Birch). Although Bolger had previously sacked Peters from a National cabinet the two initially seemed to work well together.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Resignation====\n[[File:Jenny Shipley.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jenny Shipley]] mounted a coup against Bolger in December 1997]]\nGrowing opposition to Bolger's slow pace and perceived exaggerated influence of New Zealand First led Transport Minister [[Jenny Shipley]] to stage a caucus room coup in 1997. Bolger was out of the country at the time, and when he returned he found that he did not have enough support in his caucus to remain as party leader and prime minister. Rather than face being voted out, he resigned on 8 December, and Shipley became New Zealand's first woman prime minister. As a concession, Bolger was made a junior minister in Shipley's government.<ref name=\"usnzcouncil\">{{cite web|title=Rt Hon.

Retiring politician journalist [[Peter Luke]] said that Bolger was \"[t]he most under-estimated prime minister I have come across.

It was developed in conjunction with ATAK to provide similar functionality on a Windows platform.\n\n==Commercial Licensing==\n\nIn January 2015, AFRL began licensing ATAK through TechLink to U.

Animal was performed by [[Rob Mills]] in the series finale of ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]'', and was occasionally performed by [[Kevin Clash]] on ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'' in the absence of [[Frank Oz]]. [[John Kennedy (puppeteer)|John Kennedy]] also briefly performed Animal in a 2002 commercial for [[MasterCard]], as well as the 2003 video game ''[[Muppets Party Cruise]]''. [[Drew Massey]] performed Animal in ''[[Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony]]''. In ''[[Jim Henson's Little Muppet Monsters]]'', Animal was voiced by [[Hal Rayle]] (who also voiced Gonzo and [[Miss Piggy]]).\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n[[Frank Oz]] has stated that Animal's character can be summed up in five words: sex, sleep, food, drums, and pain.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-333379 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093220/http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-333379 |url-status = dead |archive-date = March 4, 2016 |title = In Honor of Jim Henson's Birthday, Five Mindblowing Muppet Revelations (Wayback Machine archive) |author = Larena |date = September 25, 2009 |publisher = CNN |accessdate = October 23, 2014 }}</ref> However, Animal has retorted: \"Drums ''are'' food!\" Animal's vocabulary is generally limited to guttural shouts and monosyllabic grunts, often repeating a few simple phrases, as well as his trademark gravelly laugh. During performances, Animal is usually chained to the drum set by a collar around his neck, as his musical outbursts are extremely violent. In some episodes, he has been summoned to chase off performers who are 'being annoying'.\n\nFrom ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', as the Electric Mayhem introduces themselves:\n{{quote|quote=<poem>''Animal'': [flails and babbles wildly, pants, and yells as Fozzie clutches an also-frightened Kermit in fear]\n''Floyd'': Oh yeah, that's Animal. Show 'em whatcha do, Animal!\n''Animal'': I want to eat drums! [loudly chews on a cymbal]\n''Dr. Teeth'': No, no, ''beat'' drums, ''beat'' drums.\n''Animal'': [open eyes wide] ''Beat'' drums! ''Beat drums''! [hits the third [[tom-tom drum]] three times with his head, grunting before each hit]\n''Floyd'': Down, Animal!\n''Animal'': Down!\n''Floyd'': Back!\n''Animal'': Back!\n''Floyd'': Sit!\n''Animal'': Sit! [laughs shortly as he gets back up to look at Scooter, who is introducing himself]</poem>}}\n\nUnique among characters on the show, Floyd has trained his fellow musician to obey a few simple off-drum commands correctly, suggesting [[dog training]].\n\nAnimal's bushy eyebrows and hair, outrageous behavior, and wild drumming style can be associated with classical hard-partying rock drummers, such as [[The Who]]'s  [[Keith Moon]],<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.keithmoon.co.uk/ |title = Keith Moon Longtime drummer for the Who |date = February 7, 2006 |accessdate = October 23, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title = Myers 'to play' Who's Keith Moon |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4298548.stm |date = September 30, 2005 |work = [[BBC News]] |accessdate = October 23, 2014 }}</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[John Bonham]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s [[Ginger Baker]]. The original Animal sketches point to one Grammy Award-winning drummer named Steve Mitchell, a friend of Jim Henson's.<ref>''Best of the Muppet Show'' volume 4, Time-Life Home Video, 2001</ref> Animal is a savant, versatile session drummer, to back Muppet tunes, capable even of finishing a slow song, if the singer is nice lady. He can match both [[Buddy Rich]] and [[Harry Belafonte]] in drum-offs on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', and [[Questlove]] on [[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]] in 2011. He shows a talent for jazz in a television advert for the [[Renault Clio]] car with French footballer [[Thierry Henry]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.carpages.co.uk/renault/renault_thierry_and_animal_explain_meaning_of_va_va_voom_25_10_03.asp |title = Thierry And 'Animal' Explain The Meaning Of Va Va Voom |first = Melanie |last = Carter |date = October 25, 2003 |publisher = carpages.co.uk |accessdate = October 23, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nAnimal has also run afoul of ''Muppet Show'' guests. In 1981, the aforementioned scene with Buddy Rich ends with the seasoned pro learning Animal's gonzo style, and performing it with twice the speed and proficiency.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://boingboing.net/2007/11/20/buddy-rich-vs-monste.html |title = Buddy Rich vs. Animal on the Muppet Show / Boing Boing |publisher = Boingboing.net |date =  |accessdate = February 2, 2016 }}</ref> Animal throws a drum onto the irascible entertainer's head. When he repeatedly interrupted [[Rita Moreno]]'s rendition of ''[[Fever (1956 song)|Fever]]'' with loud drumming outbursts, she became annoyed and slammed his head between a pair of cymbals (to which Animal responded by saying \"Uh, that's my kinda woman!\", before passing out). In another episode, Animal became hostile toward [[Dudley Moore]] when Moore tried to replace the band with a programmable, music-playing [[robot]]. On another occasion, however, Animal is starstruck by [[James Coburn]] after the movie tough-guy demonstrates his own violent streak:\n\n{{quote|quote=<poem>''Coburn'': There's a right way and a wrong way to handle aggression...\n''Animal'': Aggressionnnnn...\n''Coburn'': You don't want to bust a chair up like that \u2013 [takes the chair Animal is mauling] you bust it up like ''this''! [smashes chair to bits on the staircase banister (forcing Animal to duck) and coolly walks back up to his dressing room]\n''Animal'': [eyes wide] My kinda ''guy''! [races after him] Jimmy! Jimmy!</poem>}}\n\nA common gag involves someone imparting a figure of speech to Animal: Animal turns to the audience, his eyes go wide and he goes berserk, taking the figure of speech literally. For example, [[Jim Nabors]] once spoke the traditional theatrical good luck wish, \"[[Break a leg]]\", whereupon Animal indulged him by trying to break Nabors's leg. Another gag would occasionally occur when the band plays a slow song: Animal will get about halfway through and then after announcing \"Too slow!\" launch into a faster paced version of the song. The band would usually comment that Animal lasted much longer than they thought he would.\n\nAnimal is a literal skirt-chaser. In ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'', he chases a female student out of the auditorium, chanting \"Woo-maaaan!\" after her. He also chases cars. While many Animal gags involve a role reversal, or a moment of intellectualism, others are still more subtle, such as in this piece of dialog from ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'', where it is revealed that Animal has a passion for the impressionist paintings of [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]:\n\n{{quote|quote=<poem>''[[Kermit the Frog]]: What's wrong with the drummer? He looks a little crazed.''\n''Zoot: Oh, he's just upset about missing the [[Rembrandt]] exhibit at [[National Gallery|The National Gallery]].''\n''Animal: [Correcting him in a wild, angry tone] Renoir!!''</poem>}}\n\nIn the movie ''[[Muppets from Space]]'', Animal meets his match in the form of a security guard played by [[Kathy Griffin]]\u2014after chasing her down a hallway with his \"Woo-man\" call, he later comes running back around the corner, yelling \"HELP HELP!\" with Griffin calling after him about how they'll settle down, buy a house, and have children.\n\n[[Ty Pennington]] commented about the possibility of Animal suffering  from [[ADHD]] when the character appeared on an episode of ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.toughpigs.com/anthnewstuff02.htm |title = New Muppet Stuff Extreme Makeover: Home Edition |date = March 6, 2005 |publisher = toughpigs.com }}</ref>\n\nAnimal's lack of social grace is on display at the very end of ''[[The Muppet Movie]]''. After the credits, his face fills the screen as he admonishes the audience: \"Go home! Go home!\"\n\n== Appearances in other media ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}\n\nAnimal was the official mascot of the [[U.S. Ski Team]] during the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news |title = U.S. Snowboarders Have An 'Animal' Attraction |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-723034.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121019150340/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-723034.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = October 19, 2012 |date = June 11, 1997 |work = The Washington Post }}</ref> He was also featured in one of eleven commemorative stamps issued by the [[U.S. Postal Service]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Jim Henson, Muppets, Get Stamps of Approval |url = http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2005/sr05_046.htm |date = September 28, 2005 |publisher = USPS |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606064953/http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2005/sr05_046.htm |archivedate = June 6, 2011 |url-status = dead |accessdate = October 23, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Animal was featured in a viral video alongside power-pop band [[OK Go]], where he challenged the band's drummer, Dan Konopka, to a staring contest.

[laughs shortly as he gets back up to look at Scooter, who is introducing himself]</poem>}}\n\nUnique among characters on the show, Floyd has trained his fellow musician to obey a few simple off-drum commands correctly, suggesting [[dog training]].\n\nAnimal's bushy eyebrows and hair, outrageous behavior, and wild drumming style can be associated with classical hard-partying rock drummers, such as [[The Who]]'s  [[Keith Moon]],<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.keithmoon.co.uk/ |title = Keith Moon Longtime drummer for the Who |date = February 7, 2006 |accessdate = October 23, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title = Myers 'to play' Who's Keith Moon |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4298548.stm |date = September 30, 2005 |work = [[BBC News]] |accessdate = October 23, 2014 }}</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[John Bonham]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s [[Ginger Baker]]. The original Animal sketches point to one Grammy Award-winning drummer named Steve Mitchell, a friend of Jim Henson's.<ref>''Best of the Muppet Show'' volume 4, Time-Life Home Video, 2001</ref> Animal is a savant, versatile session drummer, to back Muppet tunes, capable even of finishing a slow song, if the singer is nice lady. He can match both [[Buddy Rich]] and [[Harry Belafonte]] in drum-offs on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', and [[Questlove]] on [[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]] in 2011. He shows a talent for jazz in a television advert for the [[Renault Clio]] car with French footballer [[Thierry Henry]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.carpages.co.uk/renault/renault_thierry_and_animal_explain_meaning_of_va_va_voom_25_10_03.asp |title = Thierry And 'Animal' Explain The Meaning Of Va Va Voom |first = Melanie |last = Carter |date = October 25, 2003 |publisher = carpages.co.uk |accessdate = October 23, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nAnimal has also run afoul of ''Muppet Show'' guests. In 1981, the aforementioned scene with Buddy Rich ends with the seasoned pro learning Animal's gonzo style, and performing it with twice the speed and proficiency.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://boingboing.net/2007/11/20/buddy-rich-vs-monste.html |title = Buddy Rich vs. Animal on the Muppet Show / Boing Boing |publisher = Boingboing.net |date =  |accessdate = February 2, 2016 }}</ref> Animal throws a drum onto the irascible entertainer's head. When he repeatedly interrupted [[Rita Moreno]]'s rendition of ''[[Fever (1956 song)|Fever]]'' with loud drumming outbursts, she became annoyed and slammed his head between a pair of cymbals (to which Animal responded by saying \"Uh, that's my kinda woman!\", before passing out). In another episode, Animal became hostile toward [[Dudley Moore]] when Moore tried to replace the band with a programmable, music-playing [[robot]]. On another occasion, however, Animal is starstruck by [[James Coburn]] after the movie tough-guy demonstrates his own violent streak:\n\n{{quote|quote=<poem>''Coburn'': There's a right way and a wrong way to handle aggression...\n''Animal'': Aggressionnnnn...\n''Coburn'': You don't want to bust a chair up like that \u2013 [takes the chair Animal is mauling] you bust it up like ''this''! [smashes chair to bits on the staircase banister (forcing Animal to duck) and coolly walks back up to his dressing room]\n''Animal'': [eyes wide] My kinda ''guy''! [races after him] Jimmy! Jimmy!</poem>}}\n\nA common gag involves someone imparting a figure of speech to Animal: Animal turns to the audience, his eyes go wide and he goes berserk, taking the figure of speech literally. For example, [[Jim Nabors]] once spoke the traditional theatrical good luck wish, \"[[Break a leg]]\", whereupon Animal indulged him by trying to break Nabors's leg. Another gag would occasionally occur when the band plays a slow song: Animal will get about halfway through and then after announcing \"Too slow!\" launch into a faster paced version of the song. The band would usually comment that Animal lasted much longer than they thought he would.\n\nAnimal is a literal skirt-chaser. In ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'', he chases a female student out of the auditorium, chanting \"Woo-maaaan!\" after her. He also chases cars. While many Animal gags involve a role reversal, or a moment of intellectualism, others are still more subtle, such as in this piece of dialog from ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'', where it is revealed that Animal has a passion for the impressionist paintings of [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]:\n\n{{quote|quote=<poem>''[[Kermit the Frog]]: What's wrong with the drummer? He looks a little crazed.''\n''Zoot: Oh, he's just upset about missing the [[Rembrandt]] exhibit at [[National Gallery|The National Gallery]].''\n''Animal: [Correcting him in a wild, angry tone] Renoir!!''</poem>}}\n\nIn the movie ''[[Muppets from Space]]'', Animal meets his match in the form of a security guard played by [[Kathy Griffin]]\u2014after chasing her down a hallway with his \"Woo-man\" call, he later comes running back around the corner, yelling \"HELP HELP!\" with Griffin calling after him about how they'll settle down, buy a house, and have children.\n\n[[Ty Pennington]] commented about the possibility of Animal suffering  from [[ADHD]] when the character appeared on an episode of ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.toughpigs.com/anthnewstuff02.htm |title = New Muppet Stuff Extreme Makeover: Home Edition |date = March 6, 2005 |publisher = toughpigs.com }}</ref>\n\nAnimal's lack of social grace is on display at the very end of ''[[The Muppet Movie]]''. After the credits, his face fills the screen as he admonishes the audience: \"Go home! Go home!\"\n\n== Appearances in other media ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}\n\nAnimal was the official mascot of the [[U.S. Ski Team]] during the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news |title = U.S. Snowboarders Have An 'Animal' Attraction |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-723034.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121019150340/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-723034.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = October 19, 2012 |date = June 11, 1997 |work = The Washington Post }}</ref> He was also featured in one of eleven commemorative stamps issued by the [[U.S. Postal Service]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Jim Henson, Muppets, Get Stamps of Approval |url = http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2005/sr05_046.htm |date = September 28, 2005 |publisher = USPS |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606064953/http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2005/sr05_046.htm |archivedate = June 6, 2011 |url-status = dead |accessdate = October 23, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Animal was featured in a viral video alongside power-pop band [[OK Go]], where he challenged the band's drummer, Dan Konopka, to a staring contest.
