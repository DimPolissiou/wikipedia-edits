{"title_page": "Cultural depictions of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson", "text_new": "{{short description|Fictional and biographical depictions of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson in culture}}\n[[Image:Statue of Edward VIII as Prince of Wales, Old College, Aberystwyth (cropped).jpg|thumb|Statue of Edward VIII as [[Prince of Wales]] in [[Old College, Aberystwyth]], [[Wales]]]]\n\n[[Edward VIII]] and [[Wallis Simpson]] have been depicted in culture, both biographical and fictional, following [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|his abdication]] in 1936 and their marriage the following year.\n\n==Literature==\n* [[Robertson Davies]]'s ''[[The Deptford Trilogy]]'' has Edward's profound effect on his public as a key element. One of the characters, Boy Staunton, is a great admirer of Edward VIII, having met him in person once and styled himself after him. His discontent upon being appointed as [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario]] mirrors Edward's decision to choose love over his title and position.\n* Several [[Alternate history]] works depicting a [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II| A victorious Nazi Germany]], it is assumed that Edward VIII would have become a pro-Nazi puppet King (which the Nazis indeed tried to achieve in actual history - see [[Operation Willi]]).  \n** [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]'s alternative history novel ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' depicts Edward VIII as the restored king of the United Kingdom alongside Wallis Simpson as part of a pro-[[Nazi Party|Nazi]] [[puppet government]] in Britain. Like the rest of western Europe, Great Britain, although unoccupied, is forced to sign up to an E.U. (except [[Switzerland]]) which shows their loyalty to the [[Nazi Germany|Greater German Reich]]. However, the [[British Empire]] still controls its territories in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], Germany allows this to spread their influence around the world, whereas [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are US allies which recognize his niece [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] as the Queen of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms.\n** In [[Stephen Fry]]'s ''[[Making History (novel)| Making History]]'', Adolf Hitler was never born, but the Nazi Party nevertheless got founded and took power, led by Rudolf Glodner - a far more capable leader than Hitler. Under him, Nazi Germany developed nuclear weapons already in 1938, and easily conquered the whole of Europe including Britain by 1939, its rule remaining firm and uncontested for generations to come. Also in this timeline, Edward VIII lives out his life as a puppet King, and is complicit in the brutal suppression by the Nazis of a forlorn British rebellion in 1939 and in the mass executions which follow - among those summarily shot by the occupying Nazis also the King's own brother, the Duke of York (who in other circumstances would have become King [[George VI]]). \n** [[Guy Walters]]'s ''The Leader''{{spaced ndash}}an [[alternate history]] of [[World War II]] wherein Edward VIII does not abdicate but reigns as king with Wallis Simpson as queen. They rule a [[fascist]] Britain after World War II and are allied with a victorious [[Adolf Hitler]], but are opposed by the hero of the book, Captain James Armstrong. In this scenario, Edward VIII is an ally of the Nazis rather than their complete puppet.\n* In the timeline of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s first novel ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'' (written 1938, published 2003) - then a [[future history]] which can now be considered as a retroactive alternative history - Edward returns to England at the outbreak of war and distinguishes himself in wartime service. After the war - which ends in 1944 due to Germany's economic collapse - a European Federation is formed and Edward is made into a Constitutional Emperor of Europe, a task which he fulfills with great success. However, he dies without issue in 1970 (two years earlier than in actual history) and in the aftermath Europe is torn up in forty years of highly destructive war and is largely depopulated.\n* In ''[[I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (novel)|I Never Promised You a Rose Garden]]'', written by [[Joanne Greenberg]] under the [[pseudonym]] Hannah Green, a mental patient believes that she is the secret first wife of Edward VIII.\n* ''[[Famous Last Words (novel)|Famous Last Words]]'', a novel by [[Timothy Findley]], is a fictional recreation of the relationship between the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. In it, the couple conspire with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] to overthrow Hitler, with the intention of assuming control of the [[Nazi Party]] and taking over [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Findley|first=Timothy|authorlink=Timothy Findley|title=Famous Last Words|location=New York|publisher=Delacorte Press/Seymour Laurence|year=1981}}</ref>\n* [[Royce Ryton]]'s play ''[[Crown Matrimonial (play)|Crown Matrimonial]]'', telling the abdication story from [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]'s viewpoint, opened at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1972, with [[Peter Barkworth]] as Edward, and [[Wendy Hiller]] as Queen Mary. In a televised version in 1974, Barkworth reprised his role, but Queen Mary was played by [[Greer Garson]].\n* [[Snoo Wilson]]'s 1994 play ''HRH'' dealt with the Duke's life in [[Bahamas]] and examined his possible role in a suggested cover-up following the murder of multi-millionaire [[Harry Oakes]] in 1943. This subject also features prominently in [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]]'s novel ''[[Any Human Heart]]''.\n* In the detective novel ''[[Thrones, Dominations]]'', completed by [[Jill Paton Walsh]] from notes left by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] is charged with recovering secret documents which King Edward treated carelessly. Wimsey has an outspokenly negative opinion on Edward, whom he considers an irresponsible person unfit to be a King. Moreover, Wimsey discovers evidence of King Edward meeting secretly in France with high-level Nazi emissaries. Wimsey's report of this to the Foreign Office cannot be published, but it increases the pressure on the King to abdicate.\n* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Two Georges]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], Edward VIII remained on the throne until his death in 1972. He was succeeded by Edward IX and later Charles III, who was the reigning monarch in 1995.\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[Back in the USSA]]'' by [[Eugene Byrne]] and [[Kim Newman]] in which the [[United States of America]] became a [[communist state]] in 1917, Edward VIII [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|almost lost his throne]] over his relationship with Wallis Simpson in 1936. However, the abdication was averted and he and Mrs Simpson eventually married. He remained King until his death in 1972, though with Wallis as [[Princess consort|Princess Consort]] rather than [[Queen consort|Queen]]. His near abdication was later the subject of a novel by [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]], the aunt of Tsar Nicholas III, which was adapted for television as a miniseries. Shortly before he died, his great-nephew and heir presumptive [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles, Duke of Cornwall]] was to marry Nicholas III's eldest daughter Grand Duchess Ekaterina. While in [[Moscow]], however, the Duke met and fell in love with the television make-up artist Cinzia Davidovna Bronstein, the granddaughter of the [[silent film]] comedian [[Leon Trotsky|Lev Bronstein]].\n* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Timewyrm: Exodus]]'', the [[Seventh Doctor]] and [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]] visited an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]] in which the Nazis won World War II.

During their time in the present, they discover that the Players have been manipulating various Nazi sympathisers in Britain to push Edward into deciding to dismiss the government and establish a new one sympathetic to Hitler's policies out of respect for his 'friendship' with Hitler, in response to the government's refusal to allow him to marry Wallis Simpson; but the Doctor and Peri - aided by Winston Churchill and his various contacts - instead have his government dismissal recorded as evidence and blackmail him into abdicating or be charged with high treason while the Nazi sympathisers are kept under observation.\n* In the ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'' alternate history series of novels by Harry Turtledove, set in a reality where the Confederate States won the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], Edward VIII remained on the throne during the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]], reigning until at least 1944. After Britain, the CSA and the rest of the [[Entente]] lost the [[Great War (series)|First Great War]]  to the Central Powers in 1917, losing Canada and Ireland as a result, a revanchist [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-[[British Union of Fascists|Silvershirt]] coalition came to power in 1935. Due to longstanding British-American animosity, Edward did not become romantically involved with Wallis Simpson.\n* In the alternate history novel ''The Man Who Prevented WW2'' by [[Roy Carter]], Edward VIII was assassinated by [[George McMahon (failed assassin)|Jerome Bannigan]] on 18 July 1936. It was suspected that the Prime Minister Sir [[Oswald Mosley]], who came to power when the [[British Union of Fascists]] won a landslide victory in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 election]], was responsible for his murder. After his death, the BUF government abolished the monarchy and placed the Royal Family under [[house arrest]] in [[Balmoral Castle]] until they were expatriated to [[Switzerland]] in September 1939. His younger brother and heir presumptive [[George VI|Albert, Duke of York]] (who would have become George VI if the monarchy had not been abolished) was given the deed to the Royal Hotel in [[Geneva]]. His mother [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] was disturbed that he had become an innkeeper and even more disturbed that she was an innkeeper's mother.

Like the rest of western Europe, Great Britain, although unoccupied, is forced to sign up to an E.U. (except [[Switzerland]]) which shows their loyalty to the [[Nazi Germany|Greater German Reich]]. However, the [[British Empire]] still controls its territories in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], Germany allows this to spread their influence around the world, whereas [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are US allies which recognize his niece [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] as the Queen of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms.\n** In [[Stephen Fry]]'s ''[[Making History (novel)| Making History]]'', Adolf Hitler was never born, but the Nazi Party nevertheless got founded and took power, led by Rudolf Glodner - a far more capable leader than Hitler. Under him, Nazi Germany developed nuclear weapons already in 1938, and easily conquered the whole of Europe including Britain by 1939, its rule remaining firm and uncontested for generations to come. Also in this timeline, Edward VIII lives out his life as a puppet King, and is complicit in the brutal suppression by the Nazis of a forlorn British rebellion in 1939 and in the mass executions which follow - among those summarily shot by the occupying Nazis also the King's own brother, the Duke of York (who in other circumstances would have become become King [[George VI]]). \n** [[Guy Walters]]'s ''The Leader''{{spaced ndash}}an [[alternate history]] of [[World War II]] wherein Edward VIII does not abdicate but reigns as king with Wallis Simpson as queen. They rule a [[fascist]] Britain after World War II and are allied with a victorious [[Adolf Hitler]], but are opposed by the hero of the book, Captain James Armstrong. In this scenario, Edward VIII is an ally of the Nazis rather than their complete puppet.\n* In the timeline of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s first novel ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'' (written 1938, published 2003) - then a [[future history]] which can now be considered as a retroactive alternative history - Edward returns to England at the outbreak of war and distinguishes himself in wartime service. After the war - which ends in 1944 due to Germany's economic collapse - a European Federation is formed and Edward is made into a Constitutional Emperor of Europe, a task which he fulfills with great success. However, he dies without issue in 1970 (two years earlier than in actual history) and in the aftermath Europe is torn up in forty years of highly destructive war and is largely depopulated.\n* In ''[[I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (novel)|I Never Promised You a Rose Garden]]'', written by [[Joanne Greenberg]] under the [[pseudonym]] Hannah Green, a mental patient believes that she is the secret first wife of Edward VIII.\n* ''[[Famous Last Words (novel)|Famous Last Words]]'', a novel by [[Timothy Findley]], is a fictional recreation of the relationship between the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. In it, the couple conspire with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] to overthrow Hitler, with the intention of assuming control of the [[Nazi Party]] and taking over [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Findley|first=Timothy|authorlink=Timothy Findley|title=Famous Last Words|location=New York|publisher=Delacorte Press/Seymour Laurence|year=1981}}</ref>\n* [[Royce Ryton]]'s play ''[[Crown Matrimonial (play)|Crown Matrimonial]]'', telling the abdication story from [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]'s viewpoint, opened at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1972, with [[Peter Barkworth]] as Edward, and [[Wendy Hiller]] as Queen Mary. In a televised version in 1974, Barkworth reprised his role, but Queen Mary was played by [[Greer Garson]].\n* [[Snoo Wilson]]'s 1994 play ''HRH'' dealt with the Duke's life in [[Bahamas]] and examined his possible role in a suggested cover-up following the murder of multi-millionaire [[Harry Oakes]] in 1943. This subject also features prominently in [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]]'s novel ''[[Any Human Heart]]''.\n* In the detective novel ''[[Thrones, Dominations]]'', completed by [[Jill Paton Walsh]] from notes left by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] is charged with recovering secret documents which King Edward treated carelessly. Wimsey has an outspokenly negative opinion on Edward, whom he considers an irresponsible person unfit to be a King. Moreover, Wimsey discovers evidence of King Edward meeting secretly in France with high-level Nazi emissaries. Wimsey's report of this to the Foreign Office cannot be published, but it increases the pressure on the King to abdicate.\n* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Two Georges]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], Edward VIII remained on the throne until his death in 1972. He was succeeded by Edward IX and later Charles III, who was the reigning monarch in 1995.\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[Back in the USSA]]'' by [[Eugene Byrne]] and [[Kim Newman]] in which the [[United States of America]] became a [[communist state]] in 1917, Edward VIII [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|almost lost his throne]] over his relationship with Wallis Simpson in 1936. However, the abdication was averted and he and Mrs Simpson eventually married. He remained King until his death in 1972, though with Wallis as [[Princess consort|Princess Consort]] rather than [[Queen consort|Queen]].

{"title_page": "List of Major League Baseball mascots", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2018}}\nThis is a '''list of current and former [[Major League Baseball]] [[mascot]]s''', sorted alphabetically.\n\nThe tradition in the [[Major League Baseball]] [[mascot]] began with [[Mr. Met]], introduced for the [[New York Mets]] when [[Shea Stadium]] opened in 1964. Although some mascots came and went over time, the popularity of mascots increased when [[The San Diego Chicken]] started independently making appearances at [[San Diego Padres]] games in 1977. [[Philadelphia Phillies]] management felt they needed a mascot similar to the Chicken, so they debuted the [[Phillie Phanatic]] in 1978.\n\nToday, all but three major-league teams have \"official\" mascots (Dodgers, Yankees, and Angels). Five team mascots \u2013 Sluggerrr (Kansas City Royals), the San Diego Chicken, the Phillie Phanatic, Mr. Met, and Slider (Cleveland Indians) \u2013 have been inducted into the [[Mascot Hall of Fame]]. Several others have been nominated since the Hall's creation in 2005.\n\nMascots in the MLB are often used to help market the team and league to young children.\n\n== Current mascots ==\n=== Ace (Toronto Blue Jays) ===\n{{Main|Toronto Blue Jays mascots}}\n[[File:Blue Jays Mascot.jpg|thumb|Ace, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] mascot]]\n'''Ace''' is the official mascot of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. He, along with his female counterpart, \"Diamond\" replaced former mascot BJ Birdie before the 2002 season as a mascot duo. Like his predecessor, Ace resembles a large [[blue jay]]. The mascot's name is baseball slang for a team's top starting pitcher (the \"ace\" of the staff, such as former Blue Jays pitcher [[Roy Halladay]]).\n\nIn 2004, Ace became the sole mascot of the team after Diamond was removed by the Blue Jays prior to the start of the season. In 2011, Blue Jays fans were introduced to his younger brother Junior (see below).\n\n=== Barrelman (Milwaukee Brewers) ===\n{{Main|Beer Barrel Man}}\n[[File:Barrelman Mascot June 2015.jpg|thumb|Barrelman, the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] mascot.]]\nBarrelman (aka \"Owgust\" and \"Beer Barrel Man\"), is an auxiliary mascot for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. He was resurrected and upgraded to be a costumed performing character in 2015, having previously only been an official logo image and since 1977 only appearing on special materials.\n\n=== Baxter the Bobcat (Arizona Diamondbacks) ===\n'''Baxter the Bobcat''' is the mascot of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phoenix.about.com/od/sportsandrecreation/ss/mascots_5.htm|title=Sparky is the Mascot for the Arizona State University Sun Devils|author=Judy Hedding|work=About.com Travel}}</ref> His full name is D. Baxter the Bobcat, and he became the mascot in 2000. The mascot was created by Brantley Bell (who is currently an infielder in the Cincinnati Reds minor league system), the son of [[Jay Bell]], one of the players on the Diamondbacks 1998 inaugural season roster. Brantley came up with the name from two sources. \"D. Baxter\" comes from the team's nickname, \"the D-Backs\". The bobcat is from the original name of the stadium where the Diamondbacks play. Today called [[Chase Field]], it was once called Bank One Ballpark, or \"BOB\" for short. The [[bobcat]] is a wild cat native to Arizona.\n\n=== Bernie Brewer (Milwaukee Brewers) ===\n[[File:Bernie brewer in dugout.jpg|thumb|left|Bernie Brewer (left) in his dugout at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]]]]\n{{Main|Bernie Brewer}}\n{{See also|#The Sausages (Milwaukee Brewers)}}\n'''Bernie Brewer''' is the official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe Bernie Brewer character became the team's mascot in 1973, appearing as a cheerful man with a big [[mustache]]. A beer-barreled [[chalet]] was built for him inside the stadium where he led the crowd cheering. Following each [[home run]] and every victory by the Brewers, he would slide down and plunge himself into a huge beer mug in celebration. He was joined by a companion [[Bonnie Brewer]], who would playfully swat at the backside of the opposing team's third base coach with a broom as the field crew swept the base paths.\n\nBernie Brewer was a fixture at Brewers home games until 1984, when the Brewers re-built the [[bleacher]]s at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], replacing the chalet with a sound tower and sending Bernie into retirement. By popular demand, Bernie Brewer came out of his retirement in 1993, when the fans voted for his return. Bernie was brought back not as just a mustachioed man in [[lederhosen]], but a full-body costume of a man, including large foam head. The chalet was then rebuilt (it had been in storage on the third base side under the box seats) above the left-center field bleachers. The original beer mug that Bernie used to slide into is still in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] as part of the [[Lakefront Brewery, Inc.]] tour.\n\nIn 2001, Bernie moved to [[Miller Park]], and today the old chalet has become known as \"Bernie's Dugout\", stationed above the left field bleachers, where he cheers on for the team during home games. Currently he slides down a plastic yellow slide, no longer into a vat of beer but onto a platform in the shape of home plate when a Brewer hits a home run, while a sign tower with Bob Uecker's trademark home run call (\"Get up, get up, get outta here, GONE!!\") lights up above the Dugout, and he waves the team flag after landing in the bottom platform.\n\n=== Billy The Marlin (Miami Marlins) ===\n{{Main|Billy the Marlin}}\n[[File:Billy the Marlin 2011.jpg|thumb|Billy the Marlin]]\n'''Billy The Marlin''' is the official mascot of the [[Miami Marlins]]. Resembling a [[marlin]] with limbs, he can be seen at every Marlins home game. He competes in a waterboat race, which is a computer-animated video shown on the screen, during each game. The name, picked by original team owner [[Wayne Huizenga]], is derived from the fact that a marlin is a [[billfish]], and Huizenga wanted a name that was different from the baseball type names of other mascots (like Slider and Sluggerrr) and one that children could remember more easily. On Mothers Day and Father's Day, Billy is joined by his parents, Bill Sr. and Betty the Marlin. Billy is also seen at games dancing with kids on the field in between innings and making special appearances in the Fan Zone.\n\nOn Opening Day of 1997, the year the Marlins won their first World Series Championship, a Navy SEAL who was parachuting into [[Hard Rock Stadium]] (then known as Pro Player Stadium) as Billy, lost the head in mid-air. While the crowd was unaware of the problem, media outlets had been alerted to Billy's parachute entrance. When he didn't arrive, the media ran with the story, getting national attention and leading to ESPN's Dan Patrick's nightly quote, \"Bring me the head of Billy the Marlin!\"\n\nThe original Billy The Marlin was John Routh, who spent 10 years (1993\u20132002) entertaining Marlins fans.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/columnists/20030328gene6.asp | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Gene Therapy: Fond memories of Billy the Marlin | date=March 28, 2003}}</ref> Routh previously portrayed the University of Miami mascots, Sebastian the Ibis and The Miami Maniac from 1983 to 1993, and prior to that, Cocky for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks.\n\n=== Blooper (Atlanta Braves) ===\n'''Blooper''' is the new mascot of the [[Atlanta Braves]].<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Barker |date=March 30, 2018 |url=https://patch.com/georgia/douglasville/blooper-new-braves-mascot-makes-debut-opening-day |title=Blooper, New Braves Mascot, Makes Debut on Opening Day |work=Patch |access-date=July 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Clark (Chicago Cubs) ===\n{{Main|Clark (mascot)}}\n[[File:Clark-the-Cub-01.jpg|thumb|Clark with the Oriole Bird]]\nOn January 13, 2014, the Chicago Cubs announced that [[Clark (mascot)|Clark]], a \"young, friendly Cub\", would become the team's first official mascot in modern history.

His name \"Dinger\" is one of many slang terms for a [[home run]].\n\nDinger is often seen on the field before and after the game and roaming around the stadium during the game.

A person dressed up as Fredbird can often be found entertaining young children during baseball games at [[Busch Stadium III|Busch Stadium]]. His name is derived from \"Redbird\", a synonym for the cardinal bird and for the Cardinals themselves.\n\nFredbird was introduced in 1979 by the Cardinals, then owned by [[Anheuser-Busch]], to entertain younger fans at the games. He quickly became popular with fans for his dancing, habit of \"beaking\" the heads of supporters, and for throwing T-shirts into the stands. In later years, he has been joined by \"Team Fredbird\", a group of young women employed by the club who help him with his T-shirt toss and occasionally in other duties. He is one of baseball's best-known mascots, and he makes hundreds of appearances year-round in the St. Louis area.\n\n=== Gapper (Cincinnati Reds) ===\n[[File:Gapper.jpg|thumb|right|Gapper in 2005 signing a Gapper doll for a fan]]\n:''See also: [[#Mr. Redlegs (Cincinnati Reds)]] and [[#Rosie Red (Cincinnati Reds)]]''\n'''Gapper''' is one of the current mascots for the [[Cincinnati Reds]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/cin/fan_forum/gapper.jsp | title=Gapper | publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P. | accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref> He was first introduced as the furry companion to [[Mr. Red]], the long-time mascot in the winter of 2002 as the franchise was preparing to move to their new home, [[Great American Ball Park]]. The mascot was created by David Raymond's Raymond Entertainment Group, the founder being the man inside the Phillie Phanatic costume from 1973 to 1993. A young fan won two season tickets for submitting the winning name; he is named after the \"gap\" in the stands in the seats of Great American, which provides a view into and out of the stadium. The term \"gapper\" is also a slang phrase for a batted ball which falls into the \"gap\" between outfielders (generally a ball hit to either left-center or right-center field which rolls to the fence). According to a recent Cincinnati.com poll of the Red's four mascots, he is the least popular amongst fans. He received 6% of the voting, Mr. Red received 23%, Rosie Red received 34%, and Mr. Redlegs received 47%.\n\n=== Junior (Toronto Blue Jays) ===\nJunior is the younger brother of Ace.

This practice ended in 2006 when the San Jose Giants introduced their own mascot named Gigante.\n\n=== Mariner Moose (Seattle Mariners) ===\n{{Main|Mariner Moose}}\n[[File:MarinerMooseFlag.jpg|thumb|Mariner Moose]]\nThe '''Mariner Moose''' is the mascot of the [[Seattle Mariners]]. In 1990, a contest for children 14 and under was held to select a mascot, after 2500 entries the club chose the \"Mariner Moose\" The Moose made his debut on April 13, 1990 dancing on the field at the [[Kingdome]].\nDuring the [[1995 American League Division Series]] between the M's and the New York Yankees, the Moose gained national attention when he broke his ankle crashing into the outfield wall at the Kingdome while being towed on [[inline skates]] behind an [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]] in the outfield. Inline skating behind an ATV would continue to be a fan favorite until 1999, when the team moved to [[T-Mobile Park]] and a natural grass playing surface. Since then, the Moose has become quite adept at driving his own ATV around T-Mobile Park's warning track while performing various tricks and having water coolers emptied on him by bullpen pitchers.\n\nThe Moose makes several hundred appearances in the community each year in addition to Mariners home games, at everything from hospitals to wedding receptions. The Mariner Moose was featured on the ballot for the [[Mascot Hall of Fame]] in 2006 and 2007. He also nearly ran over [[Coco Crisp]] with his ATV in 2007, raising the ire of Red Sox pitching coach [[John Farrell (pitcher)|John Farrell]].\n\n=== Mr. Met (New York Mets) ===\n{{Main|Mr. Met}}\n[[File:Mr-met-mrs-met.jpg|thumb|Mr. and Mrs. Met]]\n'''Mr. Met''' is the official mascot of the [[New York Mets]], and MLB's first live action mascot (April 14, 1964).

He is a humanoid figure dressed in a Reds uniform, with an oversized baseball for a head.\n\nMr. Red made his first appearance on a Reds uniform as a sleeve patch in 1955. The patch featured Mr. Red's head, clad in an old-fashioned white pillbox baseball cap with red stripes. The following season, 1956, saw the Reds adopt sleeveless jerseys, and Mr. Red was eliminated from the home uniform. He was moved to the left breast of the road uniform, and remained there for one season before being eliminated entirely. In 1999, the Reds re-designed their uniform and \"Mr. Red\" was reintroduced as a sleeve patch on the undershirt.\nA human version of the mascot didn't appear until the early 1980s. The costumed mascot disappeared in the late 1980s but was reintroduced in 1997. The humanoid Mr. Red retired in 2007 leaving Gapper, Rosie Red and Mr. Redlegs to take his place. A new version of Mr. Red was unveiled at Redsfest 2012; the new mascot will be on the field with Mr. Redlegs, Gapper and Rosie Red.\n\n=== Mr. Redlegs (Cincinnati Reds) ===\n:''See also: [[#Gapper (Cincinnati)]] and [[#Rosie Red (Cincinnati)]]''\n'''Mr. Redlegs''' is a mascot of the Cincinnati Reds.

Mr. Redlegs appeared as a patch on the Reds' uniforms for two seasons in the 1950s (the team briefly assumed the nickname as a response to the [[McCarthyism|second red scare]]). In 2008, Mr. Redlegs gained national notoriety by falling off of an [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]] during pre-game antics. This caused the large, baseball-shaped head to fall off of the Mr. Redlegs costume, exposing the head of the person inside the costume. He was seen a few days later wearing a [[neck brace]] as a joke.\n\n=== Orbit (Houston Astros) ===\n{{Main|Orbit (mascot)}}\n[[File:Orbit Houston Astros mascot preseason 2014.jpg|thumb|Orbit]]\nOrbit is the mascot of the Houston Astros. Orbit represents a green space [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] with antennae, in keeping with the Space City theme of the city of Houston.

He is a tiger who made his debut on May 5, 1995, in [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]]. He wears a Tigers hat and jersey; in previous years, Paws' jersey would have the current season's 2 digit abbreviation (i.e. '10 for 2010). However, in 2011 and 2016, Paws' number changed to 00, since the Tigers retired No. 11 and No. 16 in honor of [[Sparky Anderson]] and [[Hal Newhouser]], respectively. His dress changes during Comerica Park theme nights such as a [[Santa Claus]] outfit during \"Christmas in July\" night, or an [[Elvis Presley]]-inspired costume for Elvis Night.

He is a large, furry, green bi-pedal creature with a cylindrical beak containing a tongue that sticks out. He was created by Harrison/Erickson, who thought that the team needed a mascot similar to [[The San Diego Chicken]]. The character is named for the fanatical fans of the team and, according to current owner and former team vice president, [[Bill Giles (baseball)|Bill Giles]], was to bring more families to [[Veterans Stadium]], the Phillies' ballpark at the time, which had become noted for rowdiness and even violence at times. He can be seen riding around on an [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]] at home games. In 2008, Forbes named the Phanatic the second best mascot in sports, behind San Francisco's Lou Seal.\n\n=== The Pierogis (Pittsburgh Pirates) ===\n{{Main|Great Pierogi Race}}\n'''The Pierogis''' are a series of seven people dressed in [[pierogi]] costumes that race in a promotion between innings during [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] [[baseball]] games. The contestants in this race include: Jalape\u00f1o Hannah (green hat), Cheese Chester (yellow), Sauerkraut Saul (red), Oliver Onion (purple), Bacon Burt (orange), Potato Pete (blue), and Pizza Penny (Red and White checkered). The Great Pierogi Race was inspired by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]' [[Sausage Race]].\n\n=== Pirate Parrot (Pittsburgh Pirates) ===\n{{Main|Pirate Parrot}}\n\nThe '''Pirate Parrot''' is the mascot of the Pittsburgh Pirates, debuting in 1979. He is a large green parrot who wears a Pirates jersey and cap. The character of a parrot was derived from the classic story ''[[Treasure Island]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], most notably the one owned by [[Long John Silver]] named \"[[Captain Flint]]\". He is often seen dancing on the dugouts and shooting [[hot-dogs]] from a cannon, during team home wins he can be seen celebrating waving a [[Jolly Roger]] flag.\n\n=== The Racing presidents (Washington Nationals) ===\n{{Main|Presidents Race}}\n{{See also|#Screech (Washington Nationals)}}\nThe [[Washington Nationals]] have a President's Race during their games. The race debuted in 2006, and the four presidents on [[Mount Rushmore]] \u2013 [[George Washington]] (\"George\"), [[Thomas Jefferson]] (\"Tom\"), [[Abraham Lincoln]] (\"Abe\"), and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (\"Teddy\") \u2013 have raced in every season since. In 2013, a fifth permanent contestant \u2013 [[William Howard Taft]] (\"Bill\") \u2013 was added. A sixth contestant was added in 2015 as part of a three-year marketing deal with the [[White House Historical Association]], with the sixth slot changing annually based on the president featured by the association on its annual Christmas ornament. [[Calvin Coolidge]] (\"Cal\") was the first to fill the sixth slot, making his debut in July 2015. [[Herbert Hoover]] (\"Herbie\") replaced Coolidge for 2016. Each president has a uniform number corresponding to his place in the order in which they held the office (George \u2013 1; Tom \u2013 3; Abe \u2013 16; Teddy \u2013 26; William \u2013 27; Cal \u2013 30; Herbie \u2013 31).\n\nThe Racing presidents became an instant success upon their 2006 debut and make multiple public appearances every year. Notably, Abraham Lincoln appeared on the [[Illinois]] float for President [[Barack Obama]]'s first [[Presidential inauguration|inauguration]] parade on January 20, 2009.\n\nA running gag with the Racing presidents from 2006 to 2012 was that Teddy could never win a race, although he came close in 2012, after apparently defeating the other three presidents: While he was \"[[Tebowing]]\" near the finish line, George drove up in a car and whacked him in the back of the head with a baseball bat, knocking him out before he could finish the race. In October 2012, however, just before the regular season ended and shortly before the Nationals' first postseason run began, Teddy finally won his first race, and he then went on to win four straight.\n\nThe Nationals scrapped plans to replace Herbie in 2017 with the president to be featured on that year's White House Historical Association Christmas ornament. Instead, they announced before the 2017 season that Bill, Cal, and Herbie all had retired to Florida, where in 2017 they began a new series of presidents Races among themselves during Nationals [[spring training]] games at [[FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. Meanwhile, the presidents Race at [[Nationals Park]] returned in 2017 to its original format of 2006\u20132012, featuring only George, Tom, Abe, and Teddy.\n\n=== Rally Squirrel (St. Louis Cardinals) ===\n{{Main|Rally Squirrel}}\n{{See also|#Fredbird (St. Louis Cardinals)}}\n'''Rally Squirrel''' is a secondary mascot for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. He is an anthropomorphic [[Eastern gray squirrel|squirrel]] wearing the team's uniform with a number 11 (presumably for the 2011 postseason), and was introduced not long after an actual squirrel appeared on the field at [[Busch Stadium III|Busch Stadium]] during the fifth inning of Game 4 of the [[2011 National League Division Series]]. The squirrel ran across home plate as [[Philadelphia Phillies]] pitcher [[Roy Oswalt]] was delivering a pitch to [[Skip Schumaker]], causing Oswalt to complain to the umpire that he was distracted by the squirrel. The video of the incident became very popular, and several local businesses in the St. Louis area began creating items to capitalize on the phenomenon.\n\nA performer dressed up as Rally Squirrel took part in Cardinals fan rallies beginning with Game 3 of the [[2011 National League Championship Series]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksdk.com/dontmiss/280851/193/Rally-Squirrel-to-attend-Cardinals-pep-rally |title=\"Rally Squirrel\" to attend Cardinals pep rally |date=October 11, 2011 |publisher=KSDK |accessdate=October 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127074256/http://www.ksdk.com/dontmiss/280851/193/Rally-Squirrel-to-attend-Cardinals-pep-rally |archivedate=January 27, 2013 }}</ref> and was a companion of the existing Cardinals mascot [[Fredbird]] during the remainder of the postseason, assisting Fredbird and Team Fredbird with their duties entertaining the Cardinals fans at Busch Stadium.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Rangers Captain (Texas Rangers) ===\n[[File:Rangerscaptain.jpg|right|thumb|Rangers Captain is the mascot of the Texas Rangers.]]\n'''Rangers Captain''' is the [[mascot]] for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].

He wears the uniform number \"72\" in honor of 1972, the year the Rangers relocated to the [[Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex]].\n\nRangers Captain has multiple uniforms to match each of the variants the team has; his chosen uniform for the game matches the uniform choice made by the team for that particular game. However, his outfit sometimes matches a theme the team is promoting; as an example, on April 24, 2010, he dressed up like [[Elvis Presley]] as part of an Elvis theme promotional night.\n\n=== Raymond (Tampa Bay Rays) ===\n[[File:RaymondTampaBayDevilRaysMascotSeptember2007.jpg|thumb|left|Raymond, the Tampa Bay Rays mascot in September 2007]]\n'''Raymond''' is the mascot of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/raymonddray|title=Featured Content on Myspace|work=Myspace}}{{Primary source inline|date=December 2018}}</ref> Raymond is a furry blue creature wearing a large pair of [[sneaker (footwear)|sneakers]] and a backwards [[baseball cap]], completed with a Rays [[jersey]].

She was introduced in August 2008 as the new companion of Gapper and Mr. Redlegs, and her name comes from a female fan, Rosie Janis, who became famous in 1940 for cheering for the team, and is also derived from a female fan group founded to prevent the team from moving from Cincinnati in 1963 and is a philanthropic group associated with the team. The official group name comes from the acronym of \"'''R'''ooters '''O'''rganized to '''S'''timulate '''I'''nterest and '''E'''nthuiasm in the Cincinnati '''Reds'''.\"\n\n=== The Sausages (Milwaukee Brewers) ===\n{{Main|Sausage Race}}\n{{See also|#Bernie Brewer (Milwaukee Brewers)}}\nThe sausages are unofficial mascots of the Milwaukee Brewers. They are stylized in the appearance of sausages from around the world. When they were debuted in the mid-1990s there were only three: The German Bratwurst, The Polish Kielbasa, and The Italian Sausage. In the late 1990s the  Hot Dog became a racer. In 2006 a fifth sausage was debuted, The Spanish Chorizo.

A nine-year-old fourth grade student in Washington, Glenda Gutierrez, designed the mascot and won a contest sponsored by the team, explaining that it was \"strong and eats almost everything.\" A new \"matured\" edition of the mascot was unveiled March 2, 2009. The [[Springfield Falcons]], which played in the [[American Hockey League]] until they moved to [[Tucson Roadrunners|Tucson]] in 2016, also had a mascot named Screech.\n\n=== Slider (Cleveland Indians) ===\n[[File:Slider 5-28-12.jpg|thumb|left|Slider]]\n'''Slider''' is the mascot for the [[Cleveland Indians]].

The lion whose mane looks like a crown made his debut on April 5, 1996. The word [[slugging percentage|slugger]] also refers to a powerful [[batter (baseball)|batter]] with a high percentage of extra base hits. Sluggerrr is one of few mascots that has Facebook and Twitter accounts, both clearly marked on his homepage.\n\nIn 2009, a spectator was injured by a hot dog thrown into the stands by Sluggerrr as part of a between-innings promotion. The spectator sued the Royals organization, claiming that they had been negligent. A jury found for the team under the [[Baseball Rule]], which limits spectators' ability to sue teams for injuries arising from gameplay, but the [[Missouri Supreme Court]] reversed that decision, [[holding (law)|holding]] that a mascot's hot dog toss is not an essential part of baseball. On retrial, a new jury found that neither the team nor the fan were at fault, and awarded no damages.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Burnes |date=June 17, 2015 |url=https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article24791023.html |title=Jury Clears Royals Once Again in Sluggerrr Hot Dog Toss that Ended Badly |work=The Kansas City Star |access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Sluggerrr was inducted into the [[Mascot Hall of Fame]].\n\n=== Southpaw (Chicago White Sox) ===\n[[File:Southpaw.jpg|thumb|left|Southpaw, the mascot of the Chicago White Sox]]\n'''Southpaw''' is the mascot of the [[Chicago White Sox]]. His name is a reference to a left-hand [[pitcher]] and is also a reference to Chicago's [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]], where the team plays.

Created in 1997, he is an elephant who wears an A's uniform adorned with the number 00. Stomper has performed at several [[Major League Baseball All-Star Games|All-Star Games]] and has appeared in a [[Public Service Announcement]] discouraging the use of [[chewing tobacco]].\n\nThe use of an elephant to symbolize the A's dates back to the early years of the franchise, when a group of [[Philadelphia]] businessmen, headed by industrialist [[Benjamin Shibe]], became the team's first owners. When asked to comment, [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]], manager of the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] of the rival [[National League]], said something to the effect that \"Shibe had bought himself a [[white elephant]].\"  In response, A's manager (and future owner) [[Connie Mack]] selected the elephant as the team symbol and mascot. From time to time an [[illustration]] of an elephant has been featured on the Athletics [[baseball uniform|uniform]], including from 1988 to the present.\n\n=== Swinging Friar (San Diego Padres) ===\n[[File:Sdmascotfriar2015.jpg|right|thumb|The Swinging Friar is the mascot for the San Diego Padres.]]\nThe '''Swinging Friar''' is the mascot of the [[San Diego Padres]].\n\nThe Swinging Friar has been a mascot with the team as early as 1958, when the Padres were still a member of the [[Pacific Coast League]], a [[minor league baseball]] organization. He was named after the Spanish [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s, who founded the [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1]], around which the city of [[San Diego]] began to emerge in the 18th century. The Padres joined [[Major League Baseball]] in 1969 and kept the popular mascot. He was even on the team [[emblem]] until 1984. Wanting a more \"professional\" image, the owners introduced a more [[corporate logo]]. In 1996, he was brought back as a sleeve patch for the club's blue alternate jerseys, and though the team has changed its logo and colors since then, the Friar remains there to this day.\n\nThe Swinging Friar is a [[cartoon]]-like character, pudgy, balding, and always smiling. He is dressed as a [[friar]] with a [[tonsure]], [[sandal (footwear)|sandals]], a dark hooded cloak, and a rope around the waist. He swings a [[baseball bat]]; but reportedly, in some years he swings left-handed, in other years he swings right-handed, he may be [[ambidextrous]], or even a [[switch hitter]]. On home game Sundays, the Friar wears a special [[camouflage]] cloak as the team honors the military background of San Diego with similar uniforms. The Friar also rings a mission bell at home games immediately after a win.\n\nOriginally, The Swinging Friar was represented at the ballpark as a real man wearing a friar outfit. Since his return, the character has been a full mascot costume.\n\nSome in the past have confused [[The San Diego Chicken]] as the mascot of the Padres. Although he does make appearances occasionally at San Diego sporting events, he has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team.\n\nAs of 2019, the Friar is also active with his own Twitter account, which debuted just days after the team's decision to readopt the classic brown and gold uniform colors for 2020 and beyond.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== T. C. Bear (Minnesota Twins) ===\n[[File:061307-Twins-TC.jpg|right|thumb|T.C. Bear, the mascot of the Minnesota Twins]]\n'''T. C.''' is the mascot for the [[Minnesota Twins]]. He was first introduced to Minnesota on April 3, 2000. T. C. is loosely modeled {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} after the [[Hamm's Beer Bear]], a mascot used in advertisements for [[Hamm's Brewery]], an early sponsor for the Twins. The \"T. C.\" stands for the \"Twin Cities\", [[Minneapolis]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/min/community/mascot.jsp|title=Twins Mascot \u2013 T.C.|work=Minnesota Twins}}</ref> Prior to T.C., the mascot for the Minnesota Twins 1980\u201381 was a loon named \"Twinkie\".

His name is derived from the [[Green Monster]] nickname of the {{convert|37|ft|m|adj=on}} wall in left field at [[Fenway Park]]. Wally debuted in 1997 to the chagrin of many older Red Sox fans, despite his popularity with children.\n\nAccording to the Red Sox promotions department, Wally was a huge Red Sox fan who, in 1947, decided to move inside the left field wall of Fenway Park, since it \"eats up\" hits that would easily be home runs at other parks. Apparently, he was very shy and lived the life of a [[hermit]] for 50 years. In 1997, on the 50th anniversary of the Green Monster being painted green, he came out of the manual scoreboard and has been interacting with players and fans ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/bos/community/wally.jsp|title=Wally the Green Monster|work=Boston Red Sox}}</ref>\n\nWhen the team began to grow out their beards as a trademark during their 2013 World Series run, Wally was given a long beard as well.\n\nIn January 2016, the Red Sox unveiled a new mascot named '''Tessie''', Wally the Green Monster's little sister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whdh.com/story/30892376/red-sox-introduce-new-mascot-tessie |title=Red Sox introduce new mascot Tessie |work=[[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] |publisher=Sunbeam Television. |date=January 5, 2016 |accessdate=6 January 2016 }}</ref> Tessie is named after the song \"[[Tessie#Inspiration for Red Sox mascots|Tessie]]\", which has long been associated with the Red Sox.<ref>Slane, Kevin (January 5, 2016).

Some of these mascots may still be used, but are not considered \"official\" mascots.\n\n=== Astrojack and Astrodillo ===\n'''Astrojack''', an anthropomorphic rabbit, and '''Astrodillo''', an anthropomorphic [[Nine-banded armadillo|armadillo]], were mascots for the Houston Astros in the 1980s. They wore the Astros' \"rainbow\" uniforms of that time, and were also the team's first mascots to circulate through the crowd. Before games and during breaks between innings, they would also race around the field on three-wheelers and perform skits with the [[Astrodome]]'s house band, The Astronuts. The creator of Astrojack and Astrodillo, Logan Goodson, would go on to create a later Astros mascot, [[#Junction Jack|Junction Jack]].\n\n=== BJ Birdy ===\n{{Main|Toronto Blue Jays mascots}}\n'''BJ Birdy''' served as the official mascot for the Toronto Blue Jays from 1979 to 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.guelphmercury.com/News/article/255508|title=Guelph News \u2013 Latest Daily Breaking News Stories \u2013 GuelphMercury.com|website=GuelphMercury.com}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He was ejected from a game in 1993 for \"showing up\" the umpire, after making gestures the umpire found offensive.<ref>[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Baseball/Canada/2004/06/25/514117.html McKean an athlete behind plate] ''SLAM!

BJ was created and played by the same person, Kevin Shanahan, for his entire 20-year career as the Jays' mascot. Shanahan lost 3 toes on his left foot in an automobile accident during the 1991 off season, but managed to return as the Jays mascot, missing only the first home game of the season.\n\n=== Bluepper ===\n'''Bluepper''' was a former mascot for the San Diego Padres from 1992 to 1994, He was a dark blue dog-like character with a baseball nose and a sun visor, he was later retired in 1994 because of his unpopularity.\n\n=== Bonnie Brewer ===\n'''Bonnie Brewer''' is a former official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers, appearing at Milwaukee County Stadium from 1973 to 1979. Bonnie was portrayed as a young blonde woman in a gold blouse and short blue [[lederhosen]], wearing a baseball cap and frequently carrying a blue-and-gold broom which she would use to sweep the bases.\n\nBonnie was first introduced as the female companion to the Brewers' mascot Bernie Brewer. Bernie and Bonnie were created by then-team vice president Dick Hackett as part of an effort to create a lively atmosphere at County Stadium, which also included hiring organist Frank Charles to play a Wurlitzer during the games. As Hackett remembers it, Bernie and Bonnie were added over the objections of team owner [[Bud Selig]].\n\nBonnie was noted mainly for her colorful antics during the seventh-inning stretch. As the grounds crew swept the infield, Bonnie wielded her signature broom, sweeping off each base in turn. After sweeping third base, she would playfully swat the opposing team's third-base coach on the backside with her broom, following it up with a kiss on his cheek.\n\nBonnie was discontinued after the 1979 season, although no clear reason has ever been given for her \"firing\". Bernie Brewer was discontinued as a mascot in 1984, although he was brought back as a costumed mascot in 1993, complete with full-body costume and large foam head. Bonnie Brewer returned as part of the nostalgia-heavy final home stand at County Stadium, September 18\u201328, 2000. {{As of|2008}}, Bonnie is part of the Brewers' \"Retro Fridays\" promotions at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], incorporating the traditional base sweeping as well as dancing with Bernie on Bernie's Dugout during the fans' singing of the \"[[Beer Barrel Polka]]\" in the seventh inning stretch.\n\n=== Braves Bleacher Creature ===\nThe Braves Bleacher Creature was a mascot for the Atlanta Braves major league baseball team during the late 1970s. It featured green shaggy fur with a Braves cap and logo on top. The word Braves was written across its chest in big red letters. It had a permanent toothless smile. The mascot usually roamed the stands from time to time during home games and was intended more for the entertainment of younger fans.\n\nThe mascot was costumed by Alan Stensland, then a student at Georgia Tech. Stensland was working as an usher at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium when he was approached to wear the costume. The outfit required someone who was 5\"8\" to 5'10\" tall, and Alen met the height and shoe size requirements. Alen recalls having one of his costume's eyes removed by a youngster on his first night out. They also attempted to bust his kneecaps on bat night. During the 1977 season, the mascot made some 250 appearances at games, parties, and parades.\n\nStensland was only 18 at the time he first donned the costume. The most intense problem he had was the heat. With the added humidity, a really \"funky smell\" permeated the inside of the costume. Once Stensland graduated, he left the Braves organization, and the mascot was discontinued. The other Braves mascot, Chief Noc-A-Homa, continued on for several more years.\n\n=== Charlie-O ===\n{{Main|Charlie-O}}\n'''Charlie-O the Mule''' was the mascot used by the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City Athletics and Oakland A's]] from 1963 to 1976. The [[mule]] was named after their colorful owner at that time, [[Charlie Finley|Charles O. Finley]].\n\nWhen the A's moved to then heavily Democratic [[Missouri]], where the official state animal is the mule, [[Warren Hearnes]] gave a mule to Finley for his barnyard menagerie at [[Municipal Stadium (Kansas City)|Municipal Stadium]] which also include sheep and goats that scampered up the hill behind right field.<ref>{{cite news|title=Finley Claims His Mule Adds Color to the A's|agency=Associated Press|first=Frank|last=Eck|date=May 6, 1965|newspaper=Ada (Oklahoma) Evening News}}</ref> The Municipal Stadium menagerie also included [[Warpaint (horse)|Warpaint]], the horse mascot of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. As questions swirled about whether Finley would be loyal to Missouri, he embraced the mule and removed the elephant from the A's logo and changed the A's colors from blue, red and white to green, gold, and white.\n\nFinley took the [[sorrel (horse)|sorrel]] {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mule around the country, walking him into cocktail parties and hotel lobbies, and on one occasion even into the press room after a large feeding to annoy reporters.\n\n=== Chester Charge ===\nIn April 1977 the Houston Astros introduced their very first mascot, Chester Charge. Chester Charge was a 45-pound costume of a cartoon Texas cavalry soldier on a horse. Chester appeared on the field at the beginning of each home game, during the seventh inning stretch and then ran around the bases at the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would light up and the audience would yell, \"Charge!\"  The first Chester Charge was played by Steve Ross who was then an 18-year-old Senior High School student. The creation of Chester Charge and the (incredible for its day) scoreboard graphics were created by Ed Henderson.\n\n=== Chief Noc-A-Homa ===\n{{Main|Chief Noc-A-Homa}}\n\n[[Chief Noc-A-Homa]] was the original mascot of the [[Atlanta Braves]] from the 1950s until 1986. The name was used for the \"laughing Indian\" sleeve patch worn on Braves jerseys. From at least the early 1960s, while still in [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], until the early 1980s at Atlanta's [[Fulton County Stadium]], this mascot \"lived\" in a [[teepee]] in an unoccupied section of the bleacher seats.\n\nThe teepee was involved in a bit of controversy in 1982 when the Braves, who were in first place in the National League West at the time, elected to remove the chief's home to provide more seating for the fans. The team dropped out of first when they lost 19 of 21 games after the removal. The teepee was returned to its spot and the team won the division.\n\nOpposition to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] mascots caused the Braves to retire Chief Noc-A-Homa and eventually replace him with Homer The Brave.\n\n=== Crazy Crab ===\nThe '''Crazy Crab''' was a mascot of the San Francisco Giants for the 1984 season. As opposed to other mascots, Crazy Crab was meant as an \"anti-mascot\", satirizing on the mascot craze that was going on at the time. Fans were encouraged to boo the mascot (played by actor Wayne Doba) and manager [[Frank Robinson]] appeared in a commercial with the crustacean where Robinson was restrained from attacking him. This encouragement may have worked too well, as Giants fans regularly threw various dangerous objects at Crazy Crab, including beer bottles and batteries, and Crazy Crab's suit had to be reinforced with a fiberglass shell for protection.<ref>{{cite news|title=Giant Crab Fete|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/18/SP6J11QTDH.DTL|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 18, 2008 | first=Matt | last=Woolsey}}</ref> The crab was so hated, players on both the Giants and even the opposition would throw [[rosin]] bags and other objects at the mascot. Doba sued the [[San Diego Padres]] after two of their players ([[Kurt Bevacqua]] and [[Bruce Bochy]]) tackled him, causing injuries. The mascot lasted only one year and the Giants would not have another mascot until Lou Seal in 1996. The crab returned for the last game at [[Candlestick Park]] that the Giants played in 1999, and a bobblehead was given away with its likeness on July 18, 2008 as the franchise celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in the Bay Area. There is even a website devoted to bringing back the Crazy Crab called Rehab The Crab<ref>[http://www.rehabthecrab.com/ Bring Back the Crazy Crab] www.rehabthecrab.com (Petition site)</ref> and now a Crazy Crab sandwich at AT&T Park. In 2014, [[Colin Hanks]] directed ''The Anti-Mascot'', an ESPN ''[[30 for 30]]'' short about Crazy Crab.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=12876146 30 for 30 Shorts: The Anti-Mascot] ESPN</ref> On July 7, 2018, Crazy Crab made an appearance at AT&T Park in honor of the Giants' Crazy Crab scarf giveaway.<ref>{{cite news|title=Return of the Crazy Crab|url=https://www.mccoveychronicles.com/2018/7/7/17544530/return-of-the-crazy-crab|work=SB Nation|date=July 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Dandy ===\n{{Main|Dandy (mascot)}}\n'''Dandy''' was a short-lived mascot of the [[New York Yankees]]. He was a large pinstriped bird-like mascot that sported a Yankees hat. He had a mustache that gave him an appearance similar to that of former Yankee pitcher [[Sparky Lyle]]. His name was a play on the classic American folk song \"[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]\". He appeared at the start of the 1980 season and was so unpopular that he was quickly canceled. Dandy was beaten up by fans who didn't want a mascot, and quit, leading to the elimination of the character as the Yankees chose not to replace him.\n\nAlong with this experiment, the Yankees briefly had mascots resembling ballpark food (plus Yankees hats on top) during the mid-1990s. Outside of these two occasions, the Yankees have not had an official mascot or cheerleading squad roam the stands or perform on the field, although the late [[Freddy Schuman]] has served as an unofficial promoter in the stands for decades, and [[Rally Squirrel#Other Rally Squirrels|a squirrel]] appearing on the field has brought inspiration as a mascot for the team.\n\n=== Diamond ===\n'''Diamond''' was a secondary mascot of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] alongside Ace. She and Ace replaced [[BJ Birdy]] in 2000. However, she was dropped at the end of the 2003 season, leaving Ace the sole mascot of the team.\n\n=== General Admission ===\n'''General Admission''' (a pun on the unreserved $4 seating section of the [[Astrodome]]) was a mascot for the [[Houston Astros]] in the mid-to-late 1990s. He was played by Michael Kenny, who is now the Senior Director of Guest Relations for the [[Houston Astros]], and wore a traditional [[U.S. Cavalry]] uniform complete with gold stars he would affix to his uniform for every Astros home run hit in the dome. Whenever an Astro hit a home run, General Admission would fire a cannon from his outfield platform (that would often scare those seated near him). He was \"killed off\" at the end of the 1999 season when the Astros main mascot, Orbit, had him zapped by an alien ray gun on the penultimate game of the regular season.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Homer ===\n'''Homer''' was the mascot of the [[Atlanta Braves]]. He had a [[baseball (object)|baseball]] shaped head, and looked a little like [[Mr. Met]]. Before having the baseball head however, Homer was the personification of the old \"Screaming Warrior\" logo the Braves used before dropping it in 1988.\n\nHomer's full name was Homer the Brave. This was meant to sound like \"home of the brave\", the last words of the [[Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]]. Incidentally, \"homer\" was also the longtime nickname for a home run.\n\n=== Junction Jack ===\n'''Junction Jack''' was the mascot character for the [[Houston Astros]] from 2000 until 2012. He was a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} rabbit dressed as a railroad engineer. His \"relatives\" were Junction Julie and Junction Jesse, although they were not certified official mascots by the Astros.\n\nJunction Jack replaced Orbit when the team moved from the [[Reliant Astrodome|Astrodome]] to [[Minute Maid Park]]. The new stadium was originally called \"The Ballpark at Union Station\" because it was built on the site of the historic railway station in downtown Houston. In keeping with this new theme for the Astros, Orbit was replaced by the engineer. The character was designed by Logan Goodson and named by Duone Byars, both former Astros employees.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Junction Jack, Julie, and Jesse were retired, with Orbit returning to his former place as the Astros mascot on November 2, 2012. Orbit's return coincided with the Astros' move to the American League West as well as their new uniforms, caps, and logo.\n\n=== Larry ===\nLarry, a [[Bull Terrier]], was the mascot for the [[Cleveland Naps]] in the 1910s, cared for by player [[Jack Graney]].<ref>Ulrey, Adam. \"[http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/9e908f7c Jack Graney]\".

After the Sox were sold in 1981 by [[Bill Veeck]] to an ownership group headed by [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] and [[Eddie Einhorn]], the new owners, who were eager to draw on the 1970s popularity of such mascots as The San Diego Chicken, hired the design firm responsible for creating the Phillie Phanatic to create a new mascot for the Sox.\n\nThey debuted the pair of furry mascots in September 1981, but the fans never accepted the two, ridiculing them throughout their tenure with the team\u2014both because of their ludicrous appearance, which had no apparent connection with the team, and also because they were seen as an attempt to eliminate [[Andy the Clown]], who had performed unofficially at Sox games since 1960. \"Rhubarb\" is longtime [[List of baseball jargon (R)#rhubarb|baseball slang]] for a heated on-field argument; Ribbie comes from the acronym RBI, for [[run batted in|runs batted in]]. Often reports will say ribbie instead of RBI to describe it.\n\n{{quote|For most of the 1980s, the patrons at Comiskey Park ... were asked to endure the 'antics' of baseball's least appealing mascots, Ribbie and Roobarb.

The White Sox introduced a new mascot, Southpaw, in 2003.\n\n=== Ribbie and Southpaw ===\n'''Ribbie and Southpaw''' were a pair of bear mascots created by the Los Angeles Angels in 1993, but they were replaced by Scoop and Clutch in the mid 1990s\n\n=== Schottzie ===\n'''Schottzie''' was a live [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] mascot used by the Cincinnati Reds from 1982 until his death in 1991, he was later replaced by another St. Bernard named '''Schottzie (02)''', who was mascot from 1992 until 1999.\n\n=== Scoop and Clutch ===\nScoop and Clutch were mascots for the Anaheim Angels in the 1990s. The pair were bears wearing Angels uniforms complete with halos and wings for some time. They disappeared and were effectively replaced by the Rally Monkey in the 2002 season.\n\n=== Souki ===\n'''Souki''' was the mascot of the [[Montreal Expos]], for only one season (1978), a figure in an Expos uniform with a giant baseball for a head. It was a variation of the popular mascot of the New York Mets called Mr. Met, but with one difference. The Expos' Mr. Met, called Souki, had odd antennas sticking out the sides of his head. He looked like something from outer space and the kids were afraid of him. During a game in late fall, a father attacked Souki after his child was afraid of him (and after a loss).\n\n=== The Baseball Bug ===\n'''The Baseball Bug''' was the former mascot of the [[Cleveland Indians]] from 1980 to 1981. He was a large red creature with a long nose and a baseball cap with eyes and antennas sticking out. He was retired after the 1981 season.\n\n=== Trunk ===\nTrunk was the former mascot of the [[Oakland Athletics]] from 1993 to 1996. he was an elephant similar to Stomper, but was more skinnier and wore black sunglasses similar to the alternate logo used from 1994 to 2002. he was replaced by Stomper later on in the 1997 season.\n\n=== Twinkie the Loon ===\nTwinkie was used by the Minnesota Twins for two seasons 1980 and 1981.\n\n=== Youppi! ===\n{{Main|Youppi!}}\n\n'''Youppi!''' was the mascot of the [[Montreal Expos]], before the franchise moved to Washington as the [[Washington Nationals]]. He is an orange furry creature with a white face originally leased in 1979 and designed by [[Bonnie Erickson]], formerly a designer for some of [[Jim Henson]]'s [[Muppets]] characters. Youppi! was so named resembling the phrase ''Yippee!'' or ''Hooray!'' in French. Youppi! was the first mascot to be thrown out of a Major League Baseball game: on August 23, 1989, in the 11th inning, while atop the visitors' dugout, Youppi! took a running leap, landing hard and noisily on its roof, and then sneaked into a front row seat. [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] manager [[Tommy Lasorda]] complained to the umpires and Youppi! was ejected, though he later returned, confined to the home team's dugout roof. Youppi! was abandoned as a mascot after the Expos franchise moved to Washington in 2005, but was adopted by the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Montreal Canadiens]] team on September 16, 2005, as potentially the first sports mascot to switch their allegiance from one sport to another, while remaining in the same city.\n\n== Teams without a mascot ==\nThe following MLB teams do not currently have an official mascot:\n\n* [[New York Yankees]]\n* [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]\n* [[Los Angeles Angels]]\n\n== Mascot store in various ballparks ==\nThe [[Citizens Bank Park#Other attractions|\"Build-A-Bear Workshop\" Make-Your-Own-Phanatic store]], at Citizens Bank Park, was the first store of its kind in sports. Fans are invited to buy and stuff a [[Phillie Phanatic]] doll and dress it up. Following the 2010 season, the Build-A- Bear in Philadelphia was discontinued. Similar shops have since been set up in Cincinnati ([[Great American Ball Park]]), Cleveland ([[Progressive Field]]), St. Louis ([[Busch Stadium]]), San Francisco ([[Oracle Park]]), and Washington, D.C. ([[Nationals Park]]). The Milwaukee Brewers also have in their main team store at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] a whole section of their store consisting entirely of merchandise featuring the [[Sausage Race|Racing Sausages]], called The Meat Locker.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Gapper1.jpg|Gapper, one of the official mascots of the [[Cincinnati Reds]].\nFile:MarinerMooseFlag.jpg|The mascot of the [[Seattle Mariners]], the [[Mariner Moose]].\nFile:Sluggerrr.JPG|Sluggerrr, the team mascot of the [[Kansas City Royals]].\nFile:Ace blue jays mascot.jpg|Ace is the mascot for the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n{{Commons category|Major League Baseball team mascots}}\n*[[List of National Football League mascots]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{MLB}}\n{{MLB mascots}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Major League Baseball Mascots}}\n[[Category:Major League Baseball team mascots|*]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball lists|Mascots]]\n[[Category:Lists of mascots]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2018}}\nThis is a '''list of current and former [[Major League Baseball]] [[mascot]]s''', sorted alphabetically.\n\nThe tradition in the [[Major League Baseball]] [[mascot]] began with [[Mr. Met]], introduced for the [[New York Mets]] when [[Shea Stadium]] opened in 1964. Although some mascots came and went over time, the popularity of mascots increased when [[The San Diego Chicken]] started independently making appearances at [[San Diego Padres]] games in 1977. [[Philadelphia Phillies]] management felt they needed a mascot similar to the Chicken, so they debuted the [[Phillie Phanatic]] in 1978.\n\nToday, all but three major-league teams have \"official\" mascots (Dodgers, Yankees, and Angels). Five team mascots \u2013 Sluggerrr (Kansas City Royals), the San Diego Chicken, the Phillie Phanatic, Mr. Met, and Slider (Cleveland Indians) \u2013 have been inducted into the [[Mascot Hall of Fame]]. Several others have been nominated since the Hall's creation in 2005.\n\nMascots in the MLB are often used to help market the team and league to young children.\n\n== Current mascots ==\n=== Ace (Toronto Blue Jays) ===\n{{Main|Toronto Blue Jays mascots}}\n[[File:Blue Jays Mascot.jpg|thumb|Ace, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] mascot]]\n'''Ace''' is the official mascot of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. He, along with his female counterpart, \"Diamond\" replaced former mascot BJ Birdie before the 2002 season as a mascot duo. Like his predecessor, Ace resembles a large [[blue jay]]. The mascot's name is baseball slang for a team's top starting pitcher (the \"ace\" of the staff, such as former Blue Jays pitcher [[Roy Halladay]]).\n\nIn 2004, Ace became the sole mascot of the team after Diamond was removed by the Blue Jays prior to the start of the season. In 2011, Blue Jays fans were introduced to his younger brother Junior (see below).\n\n=== Barrelman (Milwaukee Brewers) ===\n{{Main|Beer Barrel Man}}\n[[File:Barrelman Mascot June 2015.jpg|thumb|Barrelman, the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] mascot.]]\nBarrelman (aka \"Owgust\" and \"Beer Barrel Man\"), is an auxiliary mascot for the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. He was resurrected and upgraded to be a costumed performing character in 2015, having previously only been an official logo image and since 1977 only appearing on special materials.\n\n=== Baxter the Bobcat (Arizona Diamondbacks) ===\n'''Baxter the Bobcat''' is the mascot of the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phoenix.about.com/od/sportsandrecreation/ss/mascots_5.htm|title=Sparky is the Mascot for the Arizona State University Sun Devils|author=Judy Hedding|work=About.com Travel}}</ref> His full name is D. Baxter the Bobcat, and he became the mascot in 2000. The mascot was created by Brantley Bell (who is currently an infielder in the Cincinnati Reds minor league system), the son of [[Jay Bell]], one of the players on the Diamondbacks 1998 inaugural season roster. Brantley came up with the name from two sources. \"D. Baxter\" comes from the team's nickname, \"the D-Backs\". The bobcat is from the original name of the stadium where the Diamondbacks play. Today called [[Chase Field]], it was once called Bank One Ballpark, or \"BOB\" for short. The [[bobcat]] is a wild cat native to Arizona.\n\n=== Bernie Brewer (Milwaukee Brewers) ===\n[[File:Bernie brewer in dugout.jpg|thumb|left|Bernie Brewer (left) in his dugout at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]]]]\n{{Main|Bernie Brewer}}\n{{See also|#The Sausages (Milwaukee Brewers)}}\n'''Bernie Brewer''' is the official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThe Bernie Brewer character became the team's mascot in 1973, appearing as a cheerful man with a big [[mustache]]. A beer-barreled [[chalet]] was built for him inside the stadium where he led the crowd cheering. Following each [[home run]] and every victory by the Brewers, he would slide down and plunge himself into a huge beer mug in celebration. He was joined by a companion [[Bonnie Brewer]], who would playfully swat at the backside of the opposing team's third base coach with a broom as the field crew swept the base paths.\n\nBernie Brewer was a fixture at Brewers home games until 1984, when the Brewers re-built the [[bleacher]]s at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], replacing the chalet with a sound tower and sending Bernie into retirement. By popular demand, Bernie Brewer came out of his retirement in 1993, when the fans voted for his return. Bernie was brought back not as just a mustachioed man in [[lederhosen]], but a full-body costume of a man, including large foam head. The chalet was then rebuilt (it had been in storage on the third base side under the box seats) above the left-center field bleachers. The original beer mug that Bernie used to slide into is still in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] as part of the [[Lakefront Brewery, Inc.]] tour.\n\nIn 2001, Bernie moved to [[Miller Park]], and today the old chalet has become known as \"Bernie's Dugout\", stationed above the left field bleachers, where he cheers on for the team during home games. Currently he slides down a plastic yellow slide, no longer into a vat of beer but onto a platform in the shape of home plate when a Brewer hits a home run, while a sign tower with Bob Uecker's trademark home run call (\"Get up, get up, get outta here, GONE!!\") lights up above the Dugout, and he waves the team flag after landing in the bottom platform.\n\n=== Billy The Marlin (Miami Marlins) ===\n{{Main|Billy the Marlin}}\n[[File:Billy the Marlin 2011.jpg|thumb|Billy the Marlin]]\n'''Billy The Marlin''' is the official mascot of the [[Miami Marlins]]. Resembling a [[marlin]] with limbs, he can be seen at every Marlins home game. He competes in a waterboat race, which is a computer-animated video shown on the screen, during each game. The name, picked by original team owner [[Wayne Huizenga]], is derived from the fact that a marlin is a [[billfish]], and Huizenga wanted a name that was different from the baseball type names of other mascots (like Slider and Sluggerrr) and one that children could remember more easily. On Mothers Day and Father's Day, Billy is joined by his parents, Bill Sr. and Betty the Marlin. Billy is also seen at games dancing with kids on the field in between innings and making special appearances in the Fan Zone.\n\nOn Opening Day of 1997, the year the Marlins won their first World Series Championship, a Navy SEAL who was parachuting into [[Hard Rock Stadium]] (then known as Pro Player Stadium) as Billy, lost the head in mid-air. While the crowd was unaware of the problem, media outlets had been alerted to Billy's parachute entrance. When he didn't arrive, the media ran with the story, getting national attention and leading to ESPN's Dan Patrick's nightly quote, \"Bring me the head of Billy the Marlin!\"\n\nThe original Billy The Marlin was John Routh, who spent 10 years (1993\u20132002) entertaining Marlins fans.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/columnists/20030328gene6.asp | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Gene Therapy: Fond memories of Billy the Marlin | date=March 28, 2003}}</ref> Routh previously portrayed the University of Miami mascots, Sebastian the Ibis and The Miami Maniac from 1983 to 1993, and prior to that, Cocky for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks.\n\n=== Blooper (Atlanta Braves) ===\n'''Blooper''' is the new mascot of the [[Atlanta Braves]].<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Barker |date=March 30, 2018 |url=https://patch.com/georgia/douglasville/blooper-new-braves-mascot-makes-debut-opening-day |title=Blooper, New Braves Mascot, Makes Debut on Opening Day |work=Patch |access-date=July 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Clark (Chicago Cubs) ===\n{{Main|Clark (mascot)}}\n[[File:Clark-the-Cub-01.jpg|thumb|Clark with the Oriole Bird]]\nOn January 13, 2014, the Chicago Cubs announced that [[Clark (mascot)|Clark]], a \"young, friendly Cub\", would become the team's first official mascot in modern history.

After a giveaway of [[Wrestling mask|masks]] in June 2012 proved popular, the team introduced the Luchador as a permanent character in July 2013. He wears a black cape, red pants, and a mask patterned after the team's logo. Meant to represent the team's Hispanic fans, the Luchador also wrestles with Club Deportivo Coloseo at the Glendale Park and Swap.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/ari/fan_forum/luchador.jsp|title=The D-backs Luchador|work=Arizona Diamondbacks}}</ref>\n\n=== Dinger (Colorado Rockies) ===\n[[File:Rockiesdinger.JPG|right|thumb|Dinger at Coors Field]]\n'''Dinger''' is the official mascot of the [[Colorado Rockies]]. He is an [[anthropomorphic]] purple [[triceratops]]. The choice of a dinosaur, specifically this type, was inspired by the discovery of a number of dinosaur fossils\u2014most notably a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|1000|lb|kg|adj=on}} triceratops skull\u2014at [[Coors Field]] during its construction. His name \"Dinger\" is one of many slang terms for a [[home run]].\n\nDinger is often seen on the field before and after the game and roaming around the stadium during the game. When Rockies hitters are at bat in the late innings of a game, he often dances in the seats immediately behind home plate in an effort to distract opposing pitchers, sitting down only immediately before the beginning motion of each pitch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.purplerow.com/2012/2/17/2805206/dingers-antics|title=Dinger's Antics|author=Helton17|work=Purple Row}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/Fed-up-Rockies-fan-wants-Dinger-the-purple-dinos?urn=mlb-280016|title=Fed up Rockies fan wants Dinger the purple dinosaur extinct|work=Yahoo!

DJ Kitty comes from the Internet sensation of a kitty playing a DJ System and dancing to the music. The cat wears a Tampa Bay Rays ring, wears chains, and wears his Rays hat backwards. As of 2013, DJ Kitty is the new secondary mascot for the Rays along with Raymond.\n\n=== Fredbird (St. Louis Cardinals) ===\n{{Main|Fredbird}}\n{{See also|#Rally Squirrel (St. Louis Cardinals)}}\n[[File:Fredbird.jpg|right|thumb|Fredbird entertaining the crowd between innings during a Cardinals game at Busch Stadium]]\n'''Fredbird''' is the official mascot for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/fan_forum/fredbird.jsp | title=Fredbird | publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P. | accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref> He is an anthropomorphic [[Northern cardinal|cardinal]] wearing the team's uniform. A person dressed up as Fredbird can often be found entertaining young children during baseball games at [[Busch Stadium III|Busch Stadium]]. His name is derived from \"Redbird\", a synonym for the cardinal bird and for the Cardinals themselves.\n\nFredbird was introduced in 1979 by the Cardinals, then owned by [[Anheuser-Busch]], to entertain younger fans at the games. He quickly became popular with fans for his dancing, habit of \"beaking\" the heads of supporters, and for throwing T-shirts into the stands. In later years, he has been joined by \"Team Fredbird\", a group of young women employed by the club who help him with his T-shirt toss and occasionally in other duties. He is one of baseball's best-known mascots, and he makes hundreds of appearances year-round in the St. Louis area.\n\n=== Gapper (Cincinnati Reds) ===\n[[File:Gapper.jpg|thumb|right|Gapper in 2005 signing a Gapper doll for a fan]]\n:''See also: [[#Mr. Redlegs (Cincinnati Reds)]] and [[#Rosie Red (Cincinnati Reds)]]''\n'''Gapper''' is one of the current mascots for the [[Cincinnati Reds]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/cin/fan_forum/gapper.jsp | title=Gapper | publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P. | accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref> He was first introduced as the furry companion to [[Mr. Red]], the long-time mascot in the winter of 2002 as the franchise was preparing to move to their new home, [[Great American Ball Park]]. The mascot was created by David Raymond's Raymond Entertainment Group, the founder being the man inside the Phillie Phanatic costume from 1973 to 1993. A young fan won two season tickets for submitting the winning name; he is named after the \"gap\" in the stands in the seats of Great American, which provides a view into and out of the stadium. The term \"gapper\" is also a slang phrase for a batted ball which falls into the \"gap\" between outfielders (generally a ball hit to either left-center or right-center field which rolls to the fence). According to a recent Cincinnati.com poll of the Red's four mascots, he is the least popular amongst fans. He received 6% of the voting, Mr. Red received 23%, Rosie Red received 34%, and Mr. Redlegs received 47%.\n\n=== Junior (Toronto Blue Jays) ===\nJunior is the younger brother of Ace. He made his mascot debut in 2011. He is half the size of Ace and wears the number 1/2. He only appears on Jr. Jays Sundays (formerly Jr. Jays Saturdays, prior to the 2018 season).\n\n=== Lou Seal (San Francisco Giants) ===\n[[File:Lou seal giants mascot.jpg|thumb|right|'''Lou Seal''' has served as mascot of the San Francisco Giants since 1996.]]\n'''Lou Seal''' is the official mascot of the [[San Francisco Giants]]. \"Born\" on July 25, 1996, Luigi Francisco Seal<ref>[http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/fan_forum/louseal.jsp \"Lou Seal Interview,\"] San Francisco Giants Official site.

Inline skating behind an ATV would continue to be a fan favorite until 1999, when the team moved to [[T-Mobile Park]] and a natural grass playing surface. Since then, the Moose has become quite adept at driving his own ATV around T-Mobile Park's warning track while performing various tricks and having water coolers emptied on him by bullpen pitchers.\n\nThe Moose makes several hundred appearances in the community each year in addition to Mariners home games, at everything from hospitals to wedding receptions. The Mariner Moose was featured on the ballot for the [[Mascot Hall of Fame]] in 2006 and 2007. He also nearly ran over [[Coco Crisp]] with his ATV in 2007, raising the ire of Red Sox pitching coach [[John Farrell (pitcher)|John Farrell]].\n\n=== Mr. Met (New York Mets) ===\n{{Main|Mr. Met}}\n[[File:Mr-met-mrs-met.jpg|thumb|Mr. and Mrs. Met]]\n'''Mr. Met''' is the official mascot of the [[New York Mets]], and MLB's first live action mascot (April 14, 1964).

He is a humanoid figure dressed in a Reds uniform, with an oversized baseball for a head.\n\nMr. Red made his first appearance on a Reds uniform as a sleeve patch in 1955. The patch featured Mr. Red's head, clad in an old-fashioned white pillbox baseball cap with red stripes. The following season, 1956, saw the Reds adopt sleeveless jerseys, and Mr. Red was eliminated from the home uniform. He was moved to the left breast of the road uniform, and remained there for one season before being eliminated entirely. In 1999, the Reds re-designed their uniform and \"Mr. Red\" was reintroduced as a sleeve patch on the undershirt.\nA human version of the mascot didn't appear until the early 1980s. The costumed mascot disappeared in the late 1980s but was reintroduced in 1997. The humanoid Mr. Red retired in 2007 leaving Gapper, Rosie Red and Mr. Redlegs to take his place. A new version of Mr. Red was unveiled at Redsfest 2012; the new mascot will be on the field with Mr. Redlegs, Gapper and Rosie Red.\n\n=== Mr. Redlegs (Cincinnati Reds) ===\n:''See also: [[#Gapper (Cincinnati)]] and [[#Rosie Red (Cincinnati)]]''\n'''Mr. Redlegs''' is a mascot of the Cincinnati Reds.

Mr. Redlegs appeared as a patch on the Reds' uniforms for two seasons in the 1950s (the team briefly assumed the nickname as a response to the [[McCarthyism|second red scare]]). In 2008, Mr. Redlegs gained national notoriety by falling off of an [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]] during pre-game antics. This caused the large, baseball-shaped head to fall off of the Mr. Redlegs costume, exposing the head of the person inside the costume. He was seen a few days later wearing a [[neck brace]] as a joke.\n\n=== Orbit (Houston Astros) ===\n{{Main|Orbit (mascot)}}\n[[File:Orbit Houston Astros mascot preseason 2014.jpg|thumb|Orbit]]\nOrbit is the mascot of the Houston Astros. Orbit represents a green space [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] with antennae, in keeping with the Space City theme of the city of Houston. Originally serving as team mascot from 1990 until 1999, he was replaced by a new mascot, Junction Jack.\n\nTo coincide with the Astros' move to the American League West and unveiling of their new uniforms, caps, and logo, Orbit was reintroduced on November 2, 2012 to serve as the Astros' mascot once more for 2013 and beyond.\n\n=== The Oriole Bird (Baltimore Orioles) ===\n[[File:The Oriole Bird 2014.jpg|thumb|right|The Oriole Bird]]\n\n'''The Oriole Bird''' is the official mascot of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] and is a cartoon version of the [[Baltimore oriole|bird of the same name]]. He was \"hatched\" out of a giant egg prior to the team's [[1979 Baltimore Orioles season|1979 season]] opener at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] on April 6. According to Orioles.com, The Oriole Bird's favorite foods are \"mostly bird seed, with occasional [[crab cake]].\"{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The Oriole Bird's head was featured on the team's caps from 1966 until 1988, and again since 2012.\n\n=== Paws (Detroit Tigers) ===\n{{Main|Paws (Detroit Tigers)}}\n'''Paws''' is the mascot of the [[Detroit Tigers]]. He is a tiger who made his debut on May 5, 1995, in [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]]. He wears a Tigers hat and jersey; in previous years, Paws' jersey would have the current season's 2 digit abbreviation (i.e. '10 for 2010). However, in 2011 and 2016, Paws' number changed to 00, since the Tigers retired No. 11 and No. 16 in honor of [[Sparky Anderson]] and [[Hal Newhouser]], respectively. His dress changes during Comerica Park theme nights such as a [[Santa Claus]] outfit during \"Christmas in July\" night, or an [[Elvis Presley]]-inspired costume for Elvis Night. He \"resides\" in [[Comerica Park]] to this day.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Phillie Phanatic (Philadelphia Phillies) ===\n{{Main|Phillie Phanatic}}\n[[File:Phillie Phanatic.jpg|thumb|left|The Phillie Phanatic, arguably the most recognizable mascot in all of North American sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/gen/articles/printer_friendly/milb/y2008/m08/d12/c444748.jsp |title=Mascot showdown: Phillie Phanatic vs. Parker|first=Benjamin|last=Hill|work=MLB Advanced Media, L.P. |date=August 12, 2008|accessdate= June 19, 2015}}</ref>]]\n'''Phillie Phanatic''' is the official mascot of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. He is a large, furry, green bi-pedal creature with a cylindrical beak containing a tongue that sticks out. He was created by Harrison/Erickson, who thought that the team needed a mascot similar to [[The San Diego Chicken]]. The character is named for the fanatical fans of the team and, according to current owner and former team vice president, [[Bill Giles (baseball)|Bill Giles]], was to bring more families to [[Veterans Stadium]], the Phillies' ballpark at the time, which had become noted for rowdiness and even violence at times. He can be seen riding around on an [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]] at home games. In 2008, Forbes named the Phanatic the second best mascot in sports, behind San Francisco's Lou Seal.\n\n=== The Pierogis (Pittsburgh Pirates) ===\n{{Main|Great Pierogi Race}}\n'''The Pierogis''' are a series of seven people dressed in [[pierogi]] costumes that race in a promotion between innings during [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] [[baseball]] games. The contestants in this race include: Jalape\u00f1o Hannah (green hat), Cheese Chester (yellow), Sauerkraut Saul (red), Oliver Onion (purple), Bacon Burt (orange), Potato Pete (blue), and Pizza Penny (Red and White checkered). The Great Pierogi Race was inspired by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]' [[Sausage Race]].\n\n=== Pirate Parrot (Pittsburgh Pirates) ===\n{{Main|Pirate Parrot}}\n\nThe '''Pirate Parrot''' is the mascot of the Pittsburgh Pirates, debuting in 1979. He is a large green parrot who wears a Pirates jersey and cap. The character of a parrot was derived from the classic story ''[[Treasure Island]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], most notably the one owned by [[Long John Silver]] named \"[[Captain Flint]]\". He is often seen dancing on the dugouts and shooting [[hot-dogs]] from a cannon, during team home wins he can be seen celebrating waving a [[Jolly Roger]] flag.\n\n=== The Racing presidents (Washington Nationals) ===\n{{Main|Presidents Race}}\n{{See also|#Screech (Washington Nationals)}}\nThe [[Washington Nationals]] have a President's Race during their games. The race debuted in 2006, and the four presidents on [[Mount Rushmore]] \u2013 [[George Washington]] (\"George\"), [[Thomas Jefferson]] (\"Tom\"), [[Abraham Lincoln]] (\"Abe\"), and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (\"Teddy\") \u2013 have raced in every season since. In 2013, a fifth permanent contestant \u2013 [[William Howard Taft]] (\"Bill\") \u2013 was added. A sixth contestant was added in 2015 as part of a three-year marketing deal with the [[White House Historical Association]], with the sixth slot changing annually based on the president featured by the association on its annual Christmas ornament. [[Calvin Coolidge]] (\"Cal\") was the first to fill the sixth slot, making his debut in July 2015. [[Herbert Hoover]] (\"Herbie\") replaced Coolidge for 2016. Each president has a uniform number corresponding to his place in the order in which they held the office (George \u2013 1; Tom \u2013 3; Abe \u2013 16; Teddy \u2013 26; William \u2013 27; Cal \u2013 30; Herbie \u2013 31).\n\nThe Racing presidents became an instant success upon their 2006 debut and make multiple public appearances every year. Notably, Abraham Lincoln appeared on the [[Illinois]] float for President [[Barack Obama]]'s first [[Presidential inauguration|inauguration]] parade on January 20, 2009.\n\nA running gag with the Racing presidents from 2006 to 2012 was that Teddy could never win a race, although he came close in 2012, after apparently defeating the other three presidents: While he was \"[[Tebowing]]\" near the finish line, George drove up in a car and whacked him in the back of the head with a baseball bat, knocking him out before he could finish the race. In October 2012, however, just before the regular season ended and shortly before the Nationals' first postseason run began, Teddy finally won his first race, and he then went on to win four straight.\n\nThe Nationals scrapped plans to replace Herbie in 2017 with the president to be featured on that year's White House Historical Association Christmas ornament. Instead, they announced before the 2017 season that Bill, Cal, and Herbie all had retired to Florida, where in 2017 they began a new series of presidents Races among themselves during Nationals [[spring training]] games at [[FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. Meanwhile, the presidents Race at [[Nationals Park]] returned in 2017 to its original format of 2006\u20132012, featuring only George, Tom, Abe, and Teddy.\n\n=== Rally Squirrel (St. Louis Cardinals) ===\n{{Main|Rally Squirrel}}\n{{See also|#Fredbird (St. Louis Cardinals)}}\n'''Rally Squirrel''' is a secondary mascot for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. He is an anthropomorphic [[Eastern gray squirrel|squirrel]] wearing the team's uniform with a number 11 (presumably for the 2011 postseason), and was introduced not long after an actual squirrel appeared on the field at [[Busch Stadium III|Busch Stadium]] during the fifth inning of Game 4 of the [[2011 National League Division Series]]. The squirrel ran across home plate as [[Philadelphia Phillies]] pitcher [[Roy Oswalt]] was delivering a pitch to [[Skip Schumaker]], causing Oswalt to complain to the umpire that he was distracted by the squirrel. The video of the incident became very popular, and several local businesses in the St. Louis area began creating items to capitalize on the phenomenon.\n\nA performer dressed up as Rally Squirrel took part in Cardinals fan rallies beginning with Game 3 of the [[2011 National League Championship Series]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksdk.com/dontmiss/280851/193/Rally-Squirrel-to-attend-Cardinals-pep-rally |title=\"Rally Squirrel\" to attend Cardinals pep rally |date=October 11, 2011 |publisher=KSDK |accessdate=October 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127074256/http://www.ksdk.com/dontmiss/280851/193/Rally-Squirrel-to-attend-Cardinals-pep-rally |archivedate=January 27, 2013 }}</ref> and was a companion of the existing Cardinals mascot [[Fredbird]] during the remainder of the postseason, assisting Fredbird and Team Fredbird with their duties entertaining the Cardinals fans at Busch Stadium.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Rangers Captain (Texas Rangers) ===\n[[File:Rangerscaptain.jpg|right|thumb|Rangers Captain is the mascot of the Texas Rangers.]]\n'''Rangers Captain''' is the [[mascot]] for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Introduced in 2002, he is a [[palomino]]-style horse, dressed in the team's uniform. He wears the uniform number \"72\" in honor of 1972, the year the Rangers relocated to the [[Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex]].\n\nRangers Captain has multiple uniforms to match each of the variants the team has; his chosen uniform for the game matches the uniform choice made by the team for that particular game. However, his outfit sometimes matches a theme the team is promoting; as an example, on April 24, 2010, he dressed up like [[Elvis Presley]] as part of an Elvis theme promotional night.\n\n=== Raymond (Tampa Bay Rays) ===\n[[File:RaymondTampaBayDevilRaysMascotSeptember2007.jpg|thumb|left|Raymond, the Tampa Bay Rays mascot in September 2007]]\n'''Raymond''' is the mascot of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/raymonddray|title=Featured Content on Myspace|work=Myspace}}{{Primary source inline|date=December 2018}}</ref> Raymond is a furry blue creature wearing a large pair of [[sneaker (footwear)|sneakers]] and a backwards [[baseball cap]], completed with a Rays [[jersey]].

Raymond was awarded an honorable mention in the GameOps.com Best Mascot contest for 2006.\n\n=== Rosie Red (Cincinnati Reds) ===\n:''See also: {{section link| |Gapper (Cincinnati Reds)}} and {{slink| |Mr. Redlegs (Cincinnati Reds)}}''\n'''Rosie Red''' is the female mascot of the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. She was introduced in August 2008 as the new companion of Gapper and Mr. Redlegs, and her name comes from a female fan, Rosie Janis, who became famous in 1940 for cheering for the team, and is also derived from a female fan group founded to prevent the team from moving from Cincinnati in 1963 and is a philanthropic group associated with the team. The official group name comes from the acronym of \"'''R'''ooters '''O'''rganized to '''S'''timulate '''I'''nterest and '''E'''nthuiasm in the Cincinnati '''Reds'''.\"\n\n=== The Sausages (Milwaukee Brewers) ===\n{{Main|Sausage Race}}\n{{See also|#Bernie Brewer (Milwaukee Brewers)}}\nThe sausages are unofficial mascots of the Milwaukee Brewers. They are stylized in the appearance of sausages from around the world. When they were debuted in the mid-1990s there were only three: The German Bratwurst, The Polish Kielbasa, and The Italian Sausage. In the late 1990s the  Hot Dog became a racer. In 2006 a fifth sausage was debuted, The Spanish Chorizo. They are a favorite of fans and make sports highlights reels occasionally.\n\n=== Screech (Washington Nationals) ===\n{{Main|Screech (mascot)}}\n{{See also|#The Presidents (Washington Nationals)}}\n'''Screech''' is the mascot of the [[Washington Nationals]]. He is a [[bald eagle]] who wears the home cap and jersey of the team. He was \"hatched\" on April 17, 2005 at the \"Kids Opening Day\" promotion at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]]. A nine-year-old fourth grade student in Washington, Glenda Gutierrez, designed the mascot and won a contest sponsored by the team, explaining that it was \"strong and eats almost everything.\" A new \"matured\" edition of the mascot was unveiled March 2, 2009. The [[Springfield Falcons]], which played in the [[American Hockey League]] until they moved to [[Tucson Roadrunners|Tucson]] in 2016, also had a mascot named Screech.\n\n=== Slider (Cleveland Indians) ===\n[[File:Slider 5-28-12.jpg|thumb|left|Slider]]\n'''Slider''' is the mascot for the [[Cleveland Indians]].

The lion whose mane looks like a crown made his debut on April 5, 1996. The word [[slugging percentage|slugger]] also refers to a powerful [[batter (baseball)|batter]] with a high percentage of extra base hits. Sluggerrr is one of few mascots that has Facebook and Twitter accounts, both clearly marked on his homepage.\n\nIn 2009, a spectator was injured by a hot dog thrown into the stands by Sluggerrr as part of a between-innings promotion. The spectator sued the Royals organization, claiming that they had been negligent. A jury found for the team under the [[Baseball Rule]], which limits spectators' ability to sue teams for injuries arising from gameplay, but the [[Missouri Supreme Court]] reversed that decision, [[holding (law)|holding]] that a mascot's hot dog toss is not an essential part of baseball. On retrial, a new jury found that neither the team nor the fan were at fault, and awarded no damages.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Burnes |date=June 17, 2015 |url=https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article24791023.html |title=Jury Clears Royals Once Again in Sluggerrr Hot Dog Toss that Ended Badly |work=The Kansas City Star |access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Sluggerrr was inducted into the [[Mascot Hall of Fame]].\n\n=== Southpaw (Chicago White Sox) ===\n[[File:Southpaw.jpg|thumb|left|Southpaw, the mascot of the Chicago White Sox]]\n'''Southpaw''' is the mascot of the [[Chicago White Sox]]. His name is a reference to a left-hand [[pitcher]] and is also a reference to Chicago's [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]], where the team plays.

Created in 1997, he is an elephant who wears an A's uniform adorned with the number 00. Stomper has performed at several [[Major League Baseball All-Star Games|All-Star Games]] and has appeared in a [[Public Service Announcement]] discouraging the use of [[chewing tobacco]].\n\nThe use of an elephant to symbolize the A's dates back to the early years of the franchise, when a group of [[Philadelphia]] businessmen, headed by industrialist [[Benjamin Shibe]], became the team's first owners. When asked to comment, [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw]], manager of the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] of the rival [[National League]], said something to the effect that \"Shibe had bought himself a [[white elephant]].\"  In response, A's manager (and future owner) [[Connie Mack]] selected the elephant as the team symbol and mascot. From time to time an [[illustration]] of an elephant has been featured on the Athletics [[baseball uniform|uniform]], including from 1988 to the present.\n\n=== Swinging Friar (San Diego Padres) ===\n[[File:Sdmascotfriar2015.jpg|right|thumb|The Swinging Friar is the mascot for the San Diego Padres.]]\nThe '''Swinging Friar''' is the mascot of the [[San Diego Padres]].\n\nThe Swinging Friar has been a mascot with the team as early as 1958, when the Padres were still a member of the [[Pacific Coast League]], a [[minor league baseball]] organization. He was named after the Spanish [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s, who founded the [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1]], around which the city of [[San Diego]] began to emerge in the 18th century. The Padres joined [[Major League Baseball]] in 1969 and kept the popular mascot. He was even on the team [[emblem]] until 1984. Wanting a more \"professional\" image, the owners introduced a more [[corporate logo]]. In 1996, he was brought back as a sleeve patch for the club's blue alternate jerseys, and though the team has changed its logo and colors since then, the Friar remains there to this day.\n\nThe Swinging Friar is a [[cartoon]]-like character, pudgy, balding, and always smiling. He is dressed as a [[friar]] with a [[tonsure]], [[sandal (footwear)|sandals]], a dark hooded cloak, and a rope around the waist. He swings a [[baseball bat]]; but reportedly, in some years he swings left-handed, in other years he swings right-handed, he may be [[ambidextrous]], or even a [[switch hitter]]. On home game Sundays, the Friar wears a special [[camouflage]] cloak as the team honors the military background of San Diego with similar uniforms. The Friar also rings a mission bell at home games immediately after a win.\n\nOriginally, The Swinging Friar was represented at the ballpark as a real man wearing a friar outfit. Since his return, the character has been a full mascot costume.\n\nSome in the past have confused [[The San Diego Chicken]] as the mascot of the Padres. Although he does make appearances occasionally at San Diego sporting events, he has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team.\n\nAs of 2019, the Friar is also active with his own Twitter account, which debuted just days after the team's decision to readopt the classic brown and gold uniform colors for 2020 and beyond.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== T.

He was first introduced to Minnesota on April 3, 2000. T. C. is loosely modeled {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} after the [[Hamm's Beer Bear]], a mascot used in advertisements for [[Hamm's Brewery]], an early sponsor for the Twins. The \"T.

His name is derived from the [[Green Monster]] nickname of the {{convert|37|ft|m|adj=on}} wall in left field at [[Fenway Park]]. Wally debuted in 1997 to the chagrin of many older Red Sox fans, despite his popularity with children.\n\nAccording to the Red Sox promotions department, Wally was a huge Red Sox fan who, in 1947, decided to move inside the left field wall of Fenway Park, since it \"eats up\" hits that would easily be home runs at other parks. Apparently, he was very shy and lived the life of a [[hermit]] for 50 years. In 1997, on the 50th anniversary of the Green Monster being painted green, he came out of the manual scoreboard and has been interacting with players and fans ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/bos/community/wally.jsp|title=Wally the Green Monster|work=Boston Red Sox}}</ref>\n\nWhen the team began to grow out their beards as a trademark during their 2013 World Series run, Wally was given a long beard as well.\n\nIn January 2016, the Red Sox unveiled a new mascot named '''Tessie''', Wally the Green Monster's little sister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whdh.com/story/30892376/red-sox-introduce-new-mascot-tessie |title=Red Sox introduce new mascot Tessie |work=[[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] |publisher=Sunbeam Television. |date=January 5, 2016 |accessdate=6 January 2016 }}</ref> Tessie is named after the song \"[[Tessie#Inspiration for Red Sox mascots|Tessie]]\", which has long been associated with the Red Sox.<ref>Slane, Kevin (January 5, 2016).

They wore the Astros' \"rainbow\" uniforms of that time, and were also the team's first mascots to circulate through the crowd. Before games and during breaks between innings, they would also race around the field on three-wheelers and perform skits with the [[Astrodome]]'s house band, The Astronuts. The creator of Astrojack and Astrodillo, Logan Goodson, would go on to create a later Astros mascot, [[#Junction Jack|Junction Jack]].\n\n=== BJ Birdy ===\n{{Main|Toronto Blue Jays mascots}}\n'''BJ Birdy''' served as the official mascot for the Toronto Blue Jays from 1979 to 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.guelphmercury.com/News/article/255508|title=Guelph News \u2013 Latest Daily Breaking News Stories \u2013 GuelphMercury.com|website=GuelphMercury.com}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He was ejected from a game in 1993 for \"showing up\" the umpire, after making gestures the umpire found offensive.<ref>[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Baseball/Canada/2004/06/25/514117.html McKean an athlete behind plate] ''SLAM!

Bonnie was portrayed as a young blonde woman in a gold blouse and short blue [[lederhosen]], wearing a baseball cap and frequently carrying a blue-and-gold broom which she would use to sweep the bases.\n\nBonnie was first introduced as the female companion to the Brewers' mascot Bernie Brewer. Bernie and Bonnie were created by then-team vice president Dick Hackett as part of an effort to create a lively atmosphere at County Stadium, which also included hiring organist Frank Charles to play a Wurlitzer during the games. As Hackett remembers it, Bernie and Bonnie were added over the objections of team owner [[Bud Selig]].\n\nBonnie was noted mainly for her colorful antics during the seventh-inning stretch. As the grounds crew swept the infield, Bonnie wielded her signature broom, sweeping off each base in turn. After sweeping third base, she would playfully swat the opposing team's third-base coach on the backside with her broom, following it up with a kiss on his cheek.\n\nBonnie was discontinued after the 1979 season, although no clear reason has ever been given for her \"firing\". Bernie Brewer was discontinued as a mascot in 1984, although he was brought back as a costumed mascot in 1993, complete with full-body costume and large foam head. Bonnie Brewer returned as part of the nostalgia-heavy final home stand at County Stadium, September 18\u201328, 2000. {{As of|2008}}, Bonnie is part of the Brewers' \"Retro Fridays\" promotions at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], incorporating the traditional base sweeping as well as dancing with Bernie on Bernie's Dugout during the fans' singing of the \"[[Beer Barrel Polka]]\" in the seventh inning stretch.\n\n=== Braves Bleacher Creature ===\nThe Braves Bleacher Creature was a mascot for the Atlanta Braves major league baseball team during the late 1970s. It featured green shaggy fur with a Braves cap and logo on top. The word Braves was written across its chest in big red letters. It had a permanent toothless smile. The mascot usually roamed the stands from time to time during home games and was intended more for the entertainment of younger fans.\n\nThe mascot was costumed by Alan Stensland, then a student at Georgia Tech. Stensland was working as an usher at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium when he was approached to wear the costume. The outfit required someone who was 5\"8\" to 5'10\" tall, and Alen met the height and shoe size requirements. Alen recalls having one of his costume's eyes removed by a youngster on his first night out. They also attempted to bust his kneecaps on bat night. During the 1977 season, the mascot made some 250 appearances at games, parties, and parades.\n\nStensland was only 18 at the time he first donned the costume. The most intense problem he had was the heat. With the added humidity, a really \"funky smell\" permeated the inside of the costume. Once Stensland graduated, he left the Braves organization, and the mascot was discontinued. The other Braves mascot, Chief Noc-A-Homa, continued on for several more years.\n\n=== Charlie-O ===\n{{Main|Charlie-O}}\n'''Charlie-O the Mule''' was the mascot used by the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City Athletics and Oakland A's]] from 1963 to 1976.

Finley]].\n\nWhen the A's moved to then heavily Democratic [[Missouri]], where the official state animal is the mule, [[Warren Hearnes]] gave a mule to Finley for his barnyard menagerie at [[Municipal Stadium (Kansas City)|Municipal Stadium]] which also include sheep and goats that scampered up the hill behind right field.<ref>{{cite news|title=Finley Claims His Mule Adds Color to the A's|agency=Associated Press|first=Frank|last=Eck|date=May 6, 1965|newspaper=Ada (Oklahoma) Evening News}}</ref> The Municipal Stadium menagerie also included [[Warpaint (horse)|Warpaint]], the horse mascot of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. As questions swirled about whether Finley would be loyal to Missouri, he embraced the mule and removed the elephant from the A's logo and changed the A's colors from blue, red and white to green, gold, and white.\n\nFinley took the [[sorrel (horse)|sorrel]] {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mule around the country, walking him into cocktail parties and hotel lobbies, and on one occasion even into the press room after a large feeding to annoy reporters.\n\n=== Chester Charge ===\nIn April 1977 the Houston Astros introduced their very first mascot, Chester Charge. Chester Charge was a 45-pound costume of a cartoon Texas cavalry soldier on a horse. Chester appeared on the field at the beginning of each home game, during the seventh inning stretch and then ran around the bases at the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would light up and the audience would yell, \"Charge!\"  The first Chester Charge was played by Steve Ross who was then an 18-year-old Senior High School student. The creation of Chester Charge and the (incredible for its day) scoreboard graphics were created by Ed Henderson.\n\n=== Chief Noc-A-Homa ===\n{{Main|Chief Noc-A-Homa}}\n\n[[Chief Noc-A-Homa]] was the original mascot of the [[Atlanta Braves]] from the 1950s until 1986. The name was used for the \"laughing Indian\" sleeve patch worn on Braves jerseys. From at least the early 1960s, while still in [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], until the early 1980s at Atlanta's [[Fulton County Stadium]], this mascot \"lived\" in a [[teepee]] in an unoccupied section of the bleacher seats.\n\nThe teepee was involved in a bit of controversy in 1982 when the Braves, who were in first place in the National League West at the time, elected to remove the chief's home to provide more seating for the fans. The team dropped out of first when they lost 19 of 21 games after the removal. The teepee was returned to its spot and the team won the division.\n\nOpposition to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] mascots caused the Braves to retire Chief Noc-A-Homa and eventually replace him with Homer The Brave.\n\n=== Crazy Crab ===\nThe '''Crazy Crab''' was a mascot of the San Francisco Giants for the 1984 season. As opposed to other mascots, Crazy Crab was meant as an \"anti-mascot\", satirizing on the mascot craze that was going on at the time. Fans were encouraged to boo the mascot (played by actor Wayne Doba) and manager [[Frank Robinson]] appeared in a commercial with the crustacean where Robinson was restrained from attacking him. This encouragement may have worked too well, as Giants fans regularly threw various dangerous objects at Crazy Crab, including beer bottles and batteries, and Crazy Crab's suit had to be reinforced with a fiberglass shell for protection.<ref>{{cite news|title=Giant Crab Fete|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/18/SP6J11QTDH.DTL|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 18, 2008 | first=Matt | last=Woolsey}}</ref> The crab was so hated, players on both the Giants and even the opposition would throw [[rosin]] bags and other objects at the mascot. Doba sued the [[San Diego Padres]] after two of their players ([[Kurt Bevacqua]] and [[Bruce Bochy]]) tackled him, causing injuries. The mascot lasted only one year and the Giants would not have another mascot until Lou Seal in 1996. The crab returned for the last game at [[Candlestick Park]] that the Giants played in 1999, and a bobblehead was given away with its likeness on July 18, 2008 as the franchise celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in the Bay Area. There is even a website devoted to bringing back the Crazy Crab called Rehab The Crab<ref>[http://www.rehabthecrab.com/ Bring Back the Crazy Crab] www.rehabthecrab.com (Petition site)</ref> and now a Crazy Crab sandwich at AT&T Park. In 2014, [[Colin Hanks]] directed ''The Anti-Mascot'', an ESPN ''[[30 for 30]]'' short about Crazy Crab.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=12876146 30 for 30 Shorts: The Anti-Mascot] ESPN</ref> On July 7, 2018, Crazy Crab made an appearance at AT&T Park in honor of the Giants' Crazy Crab scarf giveaway.<ref>{{cite news|title=Return of the Crazy Crab|url=https://www.mccoveychronicles.com/2018/7/7/17544530/return-of-the-crazy-crab|work=SB Nation|date=July 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Dandy ===\n{{Main|Dandy (mascot)}}\n'''Dandy''' was a short-lived mascot of the [[New York Yankees]]. He was a large pinstriped bird-like mascot that sported a Yankees hat. He had a mustache that gave him an appearance similar to that of former Yankee pitcher [[Sparky Lyle]]. His name was a play on the classic American folk song \"[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]\". He appeared at the start of the 1980 season and was so unpopular that he was quickly canceled. Dandy was beaten up by fans who didn't want a mascot, and quit, leading to the elimination of the character as the Yankees chose not to replace him.\n\nAlong with this experiment, the Yankees briefly had mascots resembling ballpark food (plus Yankees hats on top) during the mid-1990s. Outside of these two occasions, the Yankees have not had an official mascot or cheerleading squad roam the stands or perform on the field, although the late [[Freddy Schuman]] has served as an unofficial promoter in the stands for decades, and [[Rally Squirrel#Other Rally Squirrels|a squirrel]] appearing on the field has brought inspiration as a mascot for the team.\n\n=== Diamond ===\n'''Diamond''' was a secondary mascot of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] alongside Ace. She and Ace replaced [[BJ Birdy]] in 2000. However, she was dropped at the end of the 2003 season, leaving Ace the sole mascot of the team.\n\n=== General Admission ===\n'''General Admission''' (a pun on the unreserved $4 seating section of the [[Astrodome]]) was a mascot for the [[Houston Astros]] in the mid-to-late 1990s. He was played by Michael Kenny, who is now the Senior Director of Guest Relations for the [[Houston Astros]], and wore a traditional [[U.S. Cavalry]] uniform complete with gold stars he would affix to his uniform for every Astros home run hit in the dome. Whenever an Astro hit a home run, General Admission would fire a cannon from his outfield platform (that would often scare those seated near him). He was \"killed off\" at the end of the 1999 season when the Astros main mascot, Orbit, had him zapped by an alien ray gun on the penultimate game of the regular season.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Homer ===\n'''Homer''' was the mascot of the [[Atlanta Braves]]. He had a [[baseball (object)|baseball]] shaped head, and looked a little like [[Mr. Met]]. Before having the baseball head however, Homer was the personification of the old \"Screaming Warrior\" logo the Braves used before dropping it in 1988.\n\nHomer's full name was Homer the Brave. This was meant to sound like \"home of the brave\", the last words of the [[Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]]. Incidentally, \"homer\" was also the longtime nickname for a home run.\n\n=== Junction Jack ===\n'''Junction Jack''' was the mascot character for the [[Houston Astros]] from 2000 until 2012. He was a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} rabbit dressed as a railroad engineer. His \"relatives\" were Junction Julie and Junction Jesse, although they were not certified official mascots by the Astros.\n\nJunction Jack replaced Orbit when the team moved from the [[Reliant Astrodome|Astrodome]] to [[Minute Maid Park]]. The new stadium was originally called \"The Ballpark at Union Station\" because it was built on the site of the historic railway station in downtown Houston. In keeping with this new theme for the Astros, Orbit was replaced by the engineer. The character was designed by Logan Goodson and named by Duone Byars, both former Astros employees.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, Junction Jack, Julie, and Jesse were retired, with Orbit returning to his former place as the Astros mascot on November 2, 2012. Orbit's return coincided with the Astros' move to the American League West as well as their new uniforms, caps, and logo.\n\n=== Larry ===\nLarry, a [[Bull Terrier]], was the mascot for the [[Cleveland Naps]] in the 1910s, cared for by player [[Jack Graney]].<ref>Ulrey, Adam. \"[http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/9e908f7c Jack Graney]\". ''[[Society for American Baseball Research|SABR]] Baseball Biography Project''. Retrieved 16 May 2012.</ref>\n\n=== Lefty and Righty (Boston Red Sox) ===\nBefore their retirement in 2014, Lefty and Righty were each a large, red sock with arms, and before [[Tessie#Inspiration for Red Sox mascots|Tessie the Green Monster]]'s introduction in 2016,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/bos/fan_forum/about_tessie.jsp |title=Wally's Clubhouse \u2013 About Tessie |author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=Major League Baseball |access-date=March 30, 2017 }}</ref> were the alternate mascot characters for the [[Boston Red Sox]] through the 2014 MLB season, joining Wally the Green Monster. They were seen on large outings with Wally such as the [[2007 World Series]] Parade as well as weekend afternoon games at [[Fenway Park]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Mettle the Mule ===\n'''Mettle the Mule''' was a mascot of the New York Mets for a short time starting in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080319&content_id=2444907&vkey=news_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym|title=Great moments at Shea Stadium|work=New York Mets|access-date=17 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411020201/http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080319&content_id=2444907&vkey=news_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym|archive-date=2008-04-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> Originally named Arthur, Mettle was renamed as a result of a fan contest.

Their costumes invoked the city's revolutionary spirit from 1776. The pair reappeared with their replacement\u2014the Phanatic\u2014as the Phillies celebrated their final year at [[Veterans Stadium]] in 2003, including the final opening day and final game.\n\n=== Rally ===\n{{expand section|date=November 2017}}\n'''Rally''' was one of the Atlanta Braves mascots. He was a Red and Blue Muppet-like mascot with a Blue Mowhawk, he first appeared during the 1985-1986 season and became a fan favorite, he would often hang out with Homer during games, later on he gained a baseball nose sometime in the early 2000s, but then he suddenly disappeared sometime during the 2004-2005 season, leaving Homer the only mascot until Blooper Arrived in 2018.\n\n=== Ribbie and Roobarb ===\n'''Ribbie and Roobarb''' were a pair of mascots used by the Chicago White Sox from 1981 to 1988 at [[Comiskey Park]]. After the Sox were sold in 1981 by [[Bill Veeck]] to an ownership group headed by [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] and [[Eddie Einhorn]], the new owners, who were eager to draw on the 1970s popularity of such mascots as The San Diego Chicken, hired the design firm responsible for creating the Phillie Phanatic to create a new mascot for the Sox.\n\nThey debuted the pair of furry mascots in September 1981, but the fans never accepted the two, ridiculing them throughout their tenure with the team\u2014both because of their ludicrous appearance, which had no apparent connection with the team, and also because they were seen as an attempt to eliminate [[Andy the Clown]], who had performed unofficially at Sox games since 1960. \"Rhubarb\" is longtime [[List of baseball jargon (R)#rhubarb|baseball slang]] for a heated on-field argument; Ribbie comes from the acronym RBI, for [[run batted in|runs batted in]]. Often reports will say ribbie instead of RBI to describe it.\n\n{{quote|For most of the 1980s, the patrons at Comiskey Park ... were asked to endure the 'antics' of baseball's least appealing mascots, Ribbie and Roobarb. One looked like the dim-witted son of [[Oscar the Grouch]], the other like a chartreuse [[anteater]] with a genetic flaw.<ref>Bruce Bursma, [[Chicago Tribune]], June 3, 1990</ref>}}\n\nAfter another failed mascot in the early 1990s was Waldo the White Sox Wolf. The White Sox introduced a new mascot, Southpaw, in 2003.\n\n=== Ribbie and Southpaw ===\n'''Ribbie and Southpaw''' were a pair of bear mascots created by the Los Angeles Angels in 1993, but they were replaced by Scoop and Clutch in the mid 1990s\n\n=== Schottzie ===\n'''Schottzie''' was a live [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] mascot used by the Cincinnati Reds from 1982 until his death in 1991, he was later replaced by another St. Bernard named '''Schottzie (02)''', who was mascot from 1992 until 1999.\n\n=== Scoop and Clutch ===\nScoop and Clutch were mascots for the Anaheim Angels in the 1990s. The pair were bears wearing Angels uniforms complete with halos and wings for some time. They disappeared and were effectively replaced by the Rally Monkey in the 2002 season.\n\n=== Souki ===\n'''Souki''' was the mascot of the [[Montreal Expos]], for only one season (1978), a figure in an Expos uniform with a giant baseball for a head. It was a variation of the popular mascot of the New York Mets called Mr. Met, but with one difference. The Expos' Mr. Met, called Souki, had odd antennas sticking out the sides of his head. He looked like something from outer space and the kids were afraid of him. During a game in late fall, a father attacked Souki after his child was afraid of him (and after a loss).\n\n=== The Baseball Bug ===\n'''The Baseball Bug''' was the former mascot of the [[Cleveland Indians]] from 1980 to 1981. He was a large red creature with a long nose and a baseball cap with eyes and antennas sticking out. He was retired after the 1981 season.\n\n=== Trunk ===\nTrunk was the former mascot of the [[Oakland Athletics]] from 1993 to 1996. he was an elephant similar to Stomper, but was more skinnier and wore black sunglasses similar to the alternate logo used from 1994 to 2002. he was replaced by Stomper later on in the 1997 season.\n\n=== Twinkie the Loon ===\nTwinkie was used by the Minnesota Twins for two seasons 1980 and 1981.\n\n=== Youppi! ===\n{{Main|Youppi!}}\n\n'''Youppi!''' was the mascot of the [[Montreal Expos]], before the franchise moved to Washington as the [[Washington Nationals]]. He is an orange furry creature with a white face originally leased in 1979 and designed by [[Bonnie Erickson]], formerly a designer for some of [[Jim Henson]]'s [[Muppets]] characters. Youppi! was so named resembling the phrase ''Yippee!'' or ''Hooray!'' in French. Youppi! was the first mascot to be thrown out of a Major League Baseball game: on August 23, 1989, in the 11th inning, while atop the visitors' dugout, Youppi! took a running leap, landing hard and noisily on its roof, and then sneaked into a front row seat. [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] manager [[Tommy Lasorda]] complained to the umpires and Youppi! was ejected, though he later returned, confined to the home team's dugout roof. Youppi! was abandoned as a mascot after the Expos franchise moved to Washington in 2005, but was adopted by the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Montreal Canadiens]] team on September 16, 2005, as potentially the first sports mascot to switch their allegiance from one sport to another, while remaining in the same city.\n\n== Teams without a mascot ==\nThe following MLB teams do not currently have an official mascot:\n\n* [[New York Yankees]]\n* [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]\n* [[Los Angeles Angels]]\n\n== Mascot store in various ballparks ==\nThe [[Citizens Bank Park#Other attractions|\"Build-A-Bear Workshop\" Make-Your-Own-Phanatic store]], at Citizens Bank Park, was the first store of its kind in sports. Fans are invited to buy and stuff a [[Phillie Phanatic]] doll and dress it up. Following the 2010 season, the Build-A- Bear in Philadelphia was discontinued. Similar shops have since been set up in Cincinnati ([[Great American Ball Park]]), Cleveland ([[Progressive Field]]), St. Louis ([[Busch Stadium]]), San Francisco ([[Oracle Park]]), and Washington, D.C. ([[Nationals Park]]). The Milwaukee Brewers also have in their main team store at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] a whole section of their store consisting entirely of merchandise featuring the [[Sausage Race|Racing Sausages]], called The Meat Locker.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Gapper1.jpg|Gapper, one of the official mascots of the [[Cincinnati Reds]].\nFile:MarinerMooseFlag.jpg|The mascot of the [[Seattle Mariners]], the [[Mariner Moose]].\nFile:Sluggerrr.JPG|Sluggerrr, the team mascot of the [[Kansas City Royals]].\nFile:Ace blue jays mascot.jpg|Ace is the mascot for the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n{{Commons category|Major League Baseball team mascots}}\n*[[List of National Football League mascots]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{MLB}}\n{{MLB mascots}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Major League Baseball Mascots}}\n[[Category:Major League Baseball team mascots|*]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball lists|Mascots]]\n[[Category:Lists of mascots]]\n", "name_user": "71.37.216.145", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eT.
