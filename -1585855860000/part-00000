The strip has been serialized in [[Houbunsha]]'s seinen manga magazine ''[[Manga Time Kirara Max]]'' since April 19, 2007.  It is about Kana Nakamachi and her growing experience as a newspaper deliverer, cook, and orphan.\n\nThe anime adaptation premiered in Japan on July 5, 2009 by [[Feel (animation studio)|Feel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-01-17/kanamemo-four-panel-manga-gets-anime-green-lit|title=''Kanamemo'' Four-Panel Manga Gets Anime Green-Lit|date=2009-01-17|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe story centers on Kana Nakamachi, a middle-school girl who had already lost her parents and just recently lost her only remaining relative, her grandmother. As a result, she ends up living and working at a newspaper delivery office. Everyone else living at the office are all charming, self-assertive [[bish\u014djo]].\n\nThe manga follows Kana's daily life in the fast-paced yet joyous environment.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Kana Nakamachi|\u4e2d\u753a \u304b\u306a|Nakamachi Kana}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Aki Toyosaki]]}}\n:Kana is the [[main protagonist]] of the story, a young girl of thirteen years old. After the death of her parents, she is an orphan living with her grandmother.  At the beginning of the story her grandmother also passes away. When repo-men come to repossess the grandmother's belongings, Kana assumes she is being repossessed too and runs away. Her search for a new lodging leads her to the Fuhshin Gazette, where she now lives.\n:Kana is a particularly soft spoken and shy girl who also gets frightened a lot, particularly in the presence of Haruka. She also tends to generally overreact to things she doesn't quite understand and frequently misinterprets them. Having lost her grandma, she sometimes gets rather lonely whenever she realizes she will inevitably have to leave the Fuhshin Gazette. However, she is willing to prove herself and do what she needs to help the paper. Although she is sometimes clumsy and not generally skilled at various things, she is rather good at cooking.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Saki Amano|\u5929\u91ce \u54b2\u5983|Amano Saki}}\n:{{Voiced by|Kaoru Mizuhara}}\n:Saki is the assistant chief of Fuhshin Gazette, despite still being in elementary school.  She is the only \"serious\" one of the group, and frequently reprimands the other girls when they neglect their duties.  However, she often helps Kana with her problems, including stepping in when Haruka becomes too invasive, and is also prone to giving spontaneous rewards to everyone else, even though she always justifies her actions in the format of \"We were (fill in the blank), anyway.\" Although having a mental disposition of a mature adult, she will sometimes act like a polite child in order to befriend classmates and convince their parents to buy subscriptions.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yume Kitaoka|\u5317\u5ca1 \u3086\u3081|Kitaoka Yume}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ryou Hirohashi]]}}\n:Yume is an energetic girl with a taste for sweet things.  For the most part, she is carefree and consistently in a good mood, sometimes to the point of annoyance in people around her.  She is a student at a [[patisserie]] academy, and, whenever cooking, often adds far too much sugar than what the recipe calls for (such as when she added two bags of sugar to a dish of [[curry]]).  She and Yuuki are a couple, albeit an odd one.  She is obsessed with doing everything with Yuuki, and is severely disappointed when they are denied the opportunity.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuuki Minami|\u5357 \u3086\u3046\u304d|Minami Y\u016bki}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Aya Endo]]}}\n:Yuuki is a tall shy girl and Yume's girlfriend and soulmate.  Her emotional state is usually placid, except when Yume is doing something with someone else without her.  She and Yume share an expressive [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] love, even kissing in public occasionally. When it comes to Yume's affections, Yuuki is very territorial, emitting a dangerous aura whenever Yume is doing something fun without her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Haruka Nishida|\u897f\u7530 \u306f\u308b\u304b|Nishida Haruka}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yui Horie]]}}\n:Haruka is a mature blue-haired girl who wears glasses. She is an avid drinker of [[sake]], and as such is often drunk.  She attends college, studying bio-fermentation, and creates numerous different beverages from biologic substances (the resulting concoction almost always being alcoholic). She is a self-proclaimed [[lolita complex|lolicon]] with a fetish for young girls under 15, often making various advances on Kana, who fears her greatly in this regard.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hinata Azuma|\u6771 \u3072\u306a\u305f|Azuma Hinata}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Eri Kitamura]]}}\n:Hinata is a carefree girl who likes to gamble or invest through various means, such as [[Horseracing#Betting|Horseracing]] and the [[stock market]], but is otherwise hesitant about spending money on things such as [[cotton candy]] at a [[Japanese festivals|festival]], claiming it to be \"just a bunch of sugar\".  She has attempted to join a college numerous times, but has failed entrance exams twice, with a third failure being predicted frequently by the others.  She is nice to Kana, occasionally helping her. Like Saki, she too will stop Haruka when she becomes invasive of Kana's space. Interesting of note is her unique usage of the masculine pronoun \"I\" (\"boku\") when referring to herself, where a female Japanese speaker would usually refer to herself using \"watashi\" or the more feminine \"atashi\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mika Kujiin|\u4e45\u5730\u9662 \u7f8e\u83ef|Kujiin Mika}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Kugimiya]]}}\n:Mika delivers newspapers at another center, although she won't admit it unless directly confronted.  She is quick to blame others, and frequently turns her mistakes into inconveniences.  When she becomes lost during a route, she literally runs into Kana, then forgives her by \"allowing\" her to escort her to her next stop, later becoming friends. She seems to have a crush on Kana, and gets riled up at the thought of Kana having a boyfriend. In the manga, Mika has feelings for Kana and Kana in turn has strange feelings for Mika like the enjoyment of seeing Mika wallow in nervous waiting.\n\n===Other characters===\n\n;{{Nihongo|Marimo|\u307e\u308a\u3082|Marimo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Takahashi]]}}\n:Marimo is a minor character who appears in the eighth and twelfth episodes.  She is a former Fuhshin Gazette employee before she graduated from college, and has a reputation as the worst employee the newspaper company ever had. Nevertheless, she was well liked by everyone. She and Saki shared a special friendship, although Saki rarely likes to bring it up.

Everyone else living at the office are all charming, self-assertive [[bish\u014djo]].\n\nThe manga follows Kana\u2019s daily life in the fast-paced yet joyous environment.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Kana Nakamachi|\u4e2d\u753a \u304b\u306a|Nakamachi Kana}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Aki Toyosaki]]}}\n:Kana is the [[main protagonist]] of the story, a young girl of thirteen years old. After the death of her parents, she is an orphan living with her grandmother.  At the beginning of the story her grandmother also passes away. When repo-men come to repossess the grandmother's belongings, Kana assumes she is being repossessed too and runs away. Her search for a new lodging leads her to the Fuhshin Gazette, where she now lives.\n:Kana is a particularly soft spoken and shy girl who also gets frightened a lot, particularly in the presence of Haruka. She also tends to generally overreact to things she doesn't quite understand and frequently misinterprets them. Having lost her grandma, she sometimes gets rather lonely whenever she realizes she will inevitably have to leave the Fuhshin Gazette. However, she is willing to prove herself and do what she needs to help the paper. Although she is sometimes clumsy and not generally skilled at various things, she is rather good at cooking.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Saki Amano|\u5929\u91ce \u54b2\u5983|Amano Saki}}\n:{{Voiced by|Kaoru Mizuhara}}\n:Saki is the assistant chief of Fuhshin Gazette, despite still being in elementary school.  She is the only \"serious\" one of the group, and frequently reprimands the other girls when they neglect their duties.  However, she often helps Kana with her problems, including stepping in when Haruka becomes too invasive, and is also prone to giving spontaneous rewards to everyone else, even though she always justifies her actions in the format of \"We were (fill in the blank), anyway.\" Although having a mental disposition of a mature adult, she will sometimes act like a polite child in order to befriend classmates and convince their parents to buy subscriptions.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yume Kitaoka|\u5317\u5ca1 \u3086\u3081|Kitaoka Yume}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ryou Hirohashi]]}}\n:Yume is an energetic girl with a taste for sweet things.  For the most part, she is carefree and consistently in a good mood, sometimes to the point of annoyance in people around her.  She is a student at a [[patisserie]] academy, and, whenever cooking, often adds far too much sugar than what the recipe calls for (such as when she added two bags of sugar to a dish of [[curry]]).  She and Yuuki are a couple, albeit an odd one.  She is obsessed with doing everything with Yuuki, and is severely disappointed when they are denied the opportunity.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuuki Minami|\u5357 \u3086\u3046\u304d|Minami Y\u016bki}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Aya Endo]]}}\n:Yuuki is a tall shy girl and Yume's girlfriend and soulmate.  Her emotional state is usually placid, except when Yume is doing something with someone else without her.  She and Yume share an expressive [[Yuri (genre)|yuri]] love, even kissing in public occasionally. When it comes to Yume's affections, Yuuki is very territorial, emitting a dangerous aura whenever Yume is doing something fun without her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Haruka Nishida|\u897f\u7530 \u306f\u308b\u304b|Nishida Haruka}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yui Horie]]}}\n:Haruka is a mature blue-haired girl who wears glasses. She is an avid drinker of [[sake]], and as such is often drunk.  She attends college, studying bio-fermentation, and creates numerous different beverages from biologic substances (the resulting concoction almost always being alcoholic). She is a self-proclaimed [[lolita complex|lolicon]] with a fetish for young girls under 15, often making various advances on Kana, who fears her greatly in this regard.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hinata Azuma|\u6771 \u3072\u306a\u305f|Azuma Hinata}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Eri Kitamura]]}}\n:Hinata is a carefree girl who likes to gamble or invest through various means, such as [[Horseracing#Betting|Horseracing]] and the [[stock market]], but is otherwise hesitant about spending money on things such as [[cotton candy]] at a [[Japanese festivals|festival]], claiming it to be \"just a bunch of sugar\".  She has attempted to join a college numerous times, but has failed entrance exams twice, with a third failure being predicted frequently by the others.  She is nice to Kana, occasionally helping her. Like Saki, she too will stop Haruka when she becomes invasive of Kana's space. Interesting of note is her unique usage of the masculine pronoun \"I\" (\"boku\") when referring to herself, where a female Japanese speaker would usually refer to herself using \"watashi\" or the more feminine \"atashi\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mika Kujiin|\u4e45\u5730\u9662 \u7f8e\u83ef|Kujiin Mika}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Kugimiya]]}}\n:Mika delivers newspapers at another center, although she won't admit it unless directly confronted.  She is quick to blame others, and frequently turns her mistakes into inconveniences.  When she becomes lost during a route, she literally runs into Kana, then forgives her by \"allowing\" her to escort her to her next stop, later becoming friends. She seems to have a crush on Kana, and gets riled up at the thought of Kana having a boyfriend. In the manga, Mika has feelings for Kana and Kana in turn has strange feelings for Mika like the enjoyment of seeing Mika wallow in nervous waiting.\n\n===Other characters===\n\n;{{Nihongo|Marimo|\u307e\u308a\u3082|Marimo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Takahashi]]}}\n:Marimo is a minor character who appears in the eighth and twelfth episodes.  She is a former Fuhshin Gazette employee before she graduated from college, and has a reputation as the worst employee the newspaper company ever had. Nevertheless, she was well liked by everyone. She and Saki shared a special friendship, although Saki rarely likes to bring it up. Following her work at Fuhshin Gazette, she lives off of odd jobs, such as selling vegetables in the flea market for outrageously cheap prices.  When she is not working, she will, according to her words, \"go where the wind takes her, where her mood takes her\".\n\n;{{nihongo|Fumi|\u6587}}\n:{{animevoices|Yumika Osaka}}\n:Kana and Mika's friend and classmate.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nao|\u76f4}}\n:{{animevoices|Momoko Ohara}}\n:Kana and Mika's other friend and classmate.\n\n;{{nihongo|\u014ctsuka|\u5927\u585a}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Asami Shimoda]]}}\n:Another classmate and friend of Kana and Mika.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Bunta|\u3076\u3093\u305f|Bunta}}\n:Bunta is a stray cat that hangs around the Fuhshin Gazette. She is treated as a member of the family, and is often a form of encouragement for Kana.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kaniko Echizen|\u8d8a\u524d \u304b\u306b\u3053|Echizen Kaniko}}\n:Kaniko is a robotic representation of the manga artist, Shoko Iwami, who appears in [[omake]] chapters of the manga and as a [[Wipe (transition)|transition effect]] that spouts nonsensical things in the anime.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Ken|\u30b1\u30f3}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Yuka Iguchi]]}}\n:A friend and classmate of Saki.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\nThe original manga by Shoko Iwami began serialization in [[Houbunsha]]'s ''Manga Time Kirara Max'' magazine from April 19, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dokidokivisual.com/magazine/max/book/index.php?mid=18|script-title=ja:\u307e\u3093\u304c\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u304d\u3089\u3089\uff2d\uff21\uff38 2007\u5e746\u6708\u53f7|accessdate=2016-04-08|language=Japanese}}</ref> Four [[tank\u014dbon]] volumes have been released so far:\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n | OneLanguage = yes\n | Width       = 50%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 1\n | RelDate         = September 2008<ref>{{cite book | last=Iwami | first=Shoko | authorlink=Shoko Iwami |date=September 2008 |  title=Kanamemo volume 1 | publisher=[[Houbunsha]]| isbn=978-4-8322-7725-0}}</ref>\n | ISBN            = 978-4-8322-7725-0\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 2\n | RelDate         = April 2009<ref>{{cite book | last=Iwami | first=Shoko | authorlink=Shoko Iwami |date=April 2009 |  title=Kanamemo volume 2 | publisher=[[Houbunsha]]| isbn=978-4-8322-7791-5}}</ref>\n | ISBN            = 978-4-8322-7791-5\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 3\n | RelDate         = October 2009<ref>{{cite book | last=Iwami | first=Shoko | authorlink=Shoko Iwami |date=October 2009 |  title=Kananemo volume 3 | publisher=[[Houbunsha]]| isbn=978-4-8322-7844-8}}</ref>\n | ISBN            = 978-4-8322-7844-8 \n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 4\n | RelDate         = November 2010<ref>{{cite book | last=Iwami | first=Shoko | authorlink=Shoko Iwami |date=November 2010 |  title=Kanamemo volume 4 | publisher=[[Houbunsha]]| isbn=978-4-8322-7960-5}}</ref>\n | ISBN            = 978-4-8322-7960-5\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list/footer}}\n\n===Anime===\nAn anime television adaptation by [[Feel (company)|Feel]] was announced in the March 2009 issue of Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Max magazine.

In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor. She has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6220 Hollywood Blvd. Hayes is also in the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaterhalloffame.org/members.html#H|title=Members of the American Theater Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHayes was a Catholic<ref>Hayes, Helen.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]]. [[Clive Barnes]] wrote, \"She epitomizes flustered charm almost as if it were a style of acting ... She is one of those actors ... where to watch how she is doing something is almost as pleasurable as what she is doing.\"<ref>Barnes, Clive. \"Stage:Unseen White Rabbit Returns:James Stewart Stars in Phoenix's 'Harvey'\", ''The New York Times'', February 25, 1970, p.41</ref> She spent most of her last years writing and raising money for organizations that fight asthma.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:SHAKESPEARE CENTER DEDICATION HELEN HAYES 4 small.jpg|thumb|upright|Riverside Shakespeare Company Shakespeare Center Dedication with Helen Hayes, 1982.]]\nHayes was a generous donor of time and money to a number of causes and organizations, including the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] of New York City. Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

It was originally serialized by [[Kodansha]] from January 1997 to July 2000 in the magazine ''[[Weekly Morning]]'', and later collected in 17 volumes. The story follows Jun Fudo, a teacher who can transform into the powerful Devil Lady and protects humanity from devil beasts and their creations.\n\nThe manga was adapted into a twenty-six episode [[anime]] series by [[TMS Entertainment]] in 1998\u22121999, which was released in the US by [[ADV Films]] in 2003\u20132004, and later available through streaming by Midnight Pulp. A manga crossover with ''[[Cutie Honey]]'', another Nagai series, was published in 2013 under the title ''Cutie Honey vs. Devilman Lady''.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Manga===\nSet in Japan after the events of ''[[Devilman]]'', the story follows Jun Fudo, a teacher and former athlete who lives alone with her younger brother, Hikaru, while their father is away in the United States. For reasons unknown to her, Jun begins to experience unusual nightmares which cause her to have animalistic sexual urges. One day, she and students from the tennis club go on an outdoor trip, and are attacked by unusually large bats and forced to flee to their [[chalet]]. A group of demons, disguised as human martial artists, kill and eat the male students and rape the female students. While being raped, Jun feels her soul being ripped apart, and transforms into a Devilman. She protects the surviving girls and kills the demons with her newfound strength, after which a mysterious woman named Lan Asuka appears and says she was the one who awakened the beast within Jun.\n\nConfused by her transformation, Lan Asuka, and her father's sudden appearance and experience, things became too complicated for Jun to understand. Through Professor Fudo's knowledge, he tells a tale of a strange [[phenomenon]] that occurred in shantytowns years ago. It was known as the \"Devil Beast Syndrome\" in which its inhabitants would transform into demons and rape women before eating them with no memories or intelligence of their previous lives and additionally giving them enhanced strength with other abilities.\n\nProfessor Fudo does not believe that their \"Devil Beast Syndrome\" transformation was supernatural, but was actually the next stage of human evolution, calling it \"Nature's way of dealing with mankind's overpopulation\". He also says that few people were genetically engineered to retain their conscience should the \"Devil Beast Syndrome\" occur in them, Jun being one of them. With Jun now becoming the Devilman Lady, she fights for the sake of humanity to protect them from the devil beasts and their creations.\n\nJun, along with Asuka, fight several demons and become close friends. One day Jun investigates the Grumech Embassy she is put through a demonic ritual that opens the Gates of Hell and Jun falls to Hell. Here she meets a mysterious man who introduces himself as Akira Fudo. Jun recognizes Akira to be the man who she saw before in her visions. As Akira explains he is from a past that no longer exist, as God wiped the Earth out after Akira and Satan's battle at the end of ''Devilman''. He offers to acts as guide on Jun's journey through Hell during which the two fall in love and have sex. Through their descent through Hell they also face other characters from Akira's past, including Silene/Sirene and Kaim. Once they reach the lowest point of Hell, they realize that the demon king is there frozen in ice, but Satan is nowhere to be found. On their way back Akira tells Jun about his past with Satan. However, when they reach the surface, Akira cannot follow Jun to the world. She promises to never forget him and leaves.\n\nAfter Jun returns to world several things change, parts of the past is altered. Events that led her falling to Hell are missing. She keeps communicating with Akira through the Devilman Ghost custome she made, but she slowly forgets his name. The only person she really feels close to Asuka who revealed to be her half-sibling. She starts really opening up to her without knowing that she actually killed their mother with her supernatural powers.\n\nIn later chapters after the leader of the mysterious Cult of Dante, Ryo Utsugi awakens the great demon lord Zennon by fusing with him and releases Hell's inhabitants into the world including demons, Devilman, and humans held in Hell, chaos and carnage breaks loose on Earth once again and the great battle between God's army and demonic forces is drawing closer and closer.\n\nAsuka seduces and impregnates Jun while possessing a male form. Later revealed that he was born a male, but chose to hide himself in a female form from the eyes of God. After Jun is forced to give birth in her giant devilman form to a full grown Akira Fudo, Asuka finally reveals the truth to Jun with the help of Psycho Jenny restoring her sealed memories. The half-siblings are actually two halves of Satan who split himself in order to escape the time loop God throw him into and to be able to bring back Akira from Hell. After learning this, Jun fuses together with Asuka becoming Satan once again. Akira arrives this exact minute to witness the transformation and to greets his old friend/enemy. This time however, Akira joins Satan in his fight against God's army approaching Earth. As Satan puts it, the Akira who was reborn to Hell is different than Akira who was born to Earth, and he now understand Satan's quest against God.\n\nLeading God's army is Archangel Michael, Satan's twin. When Akira notices this, Satan describes himself and his twin as right and the left hand of God. Same powers, but different functions.\n\nWe don't get see who wins the battle between the two forces at the end. The manga end with Satan telling Akira that true hope lies on the other side of the battle as they are launching their attack. We are left with a final shot of Earth with humanity once again exterminated and the age of \"myth\" drawing upon earth once again.\n\n===Anime===\nJun Fudo is a [[supermodel]] who is idolized by many. She also has a secret that not even she knows about at first, for within her lie the genes that hold the next step in the evolution of mankind, the same blood as the beast-like superhumans that terrorize the city. Unlike the rest of them, however, Jun has managed to hold a tenuous grip onto her humanity, and she is recruited by the mysterious Lan Asuka, member of a secret organization within the government, aimed at controlling, if not eliminating, these berserk destroyers of mankind. Jun, as Devil Lady, must now exterminate her own kind, but it is unclear how much longer can she keep her sanity in a situation she never chose to begin with. The story of the anime differs significantly from the manga, despite having similar beginnings - devils are not mystical beings but the next step of humanity's evolution. Unlike the manga, Devilman does not appear.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Jun Fudo|\u4e0d\u52d5 \u30b8\u30e5\u30f3|Fudo Jun}} / Devil Lady {{Voiced by|[[Junko Iwao]]|[[Shawn Sides]]}}\n:Jun is a successful supermodel in Tokyo when the story begins. She is a quiet and timid person who seems to avoid most social interactions, with two exceptions: she is generally open with her manager and very friendly with an aspiring teen model named Kazumi. She is found by a woman named Lan Asuka, who forces her to confront a werewolf-like monster called a devil beast. As it tears into Jun, her powers awaken and she becomes a devil beast herself. She defeats the beast with her powers and reverts to her human form. Asuka speaks of her membership with a military unit known as the Human Alliance, whose purpose is to hunt down and kill all those who are affected with Devil Beast Syndrome. Asuka gives Jun an ultimatum; if Jun does not hunt for them, she will be hunted by them. Jun has no choice but to obey Asuka from that point on.<ref name=\"devil lady 1\">{{cite episode|title=\u7363|series=Devil Lady|network=Mainichi Broadcasting System|number=1|credits=TMS|airdate=October 10, 1998}}</ref> However, she finds that it is not only Asuka's ultimatum that keeps her following Asuka's orders, but also something about Asuka that she cannot defy. As the series progresses, she becomes more independent.\n\n;{{nihongo|Lan Asuka|\u30a2\u30b9\u30ab \u862d|Asuka Ran}} {{Voiced by|[[Kaoru Shimamura]]|Si\u00e2n Rees-Cleland}}\n:Asuka is the woman who scouted Jun for the Human Alliance, and is a high-ranking government official. She is a cold, aggressive, and manipulative woman, who cares nothing for the people who work for her. When she forces Jun to confront the devil beast Wolver, she has no concern for Jun's survival; her theory that Jun is a devil beast was based only on a hunch.<ref name=\"devil lady 1\" /> As the series progresses, however, even though she remains cold towards Jun, she starts to care about Jun's safety. She seems to have different intentions from her organization and does a great deal of work without their knowledge.

Her transformation into a devil beast started gradually when she was still young, as a result of her hatred for her step-father who sexually abused her. However, the devil beast had a personality of its own and would tease and mock Aoi.\n\n;Vlava\n:Vlava is the deity of a fictitious European country. He resembles a lot to the Cretan minotaur with having a head which looks like the head of a cow. When Vlava and his followers descend to hell with Jun, he meets with Jinmen and forms an alliance with him to eliminate Devilman, who is protecting Jun. He is killed by Devilman in hell. Later on in the story, he reappears on Earth and joins with Dante's Devil Beast army.\n\n;Devil Lady\n:Jun's alter ego, Devil Lady, is the exact opposite of Jun. She is loud, violent, and temperamental. Her unforgiving and aggressive nature tends to make all of her battles very graphic. As Devil Lady, all of her senses are greatly increased and she has [[night vision]]. Her ability to heal is also highly amplified, bordering on regeneration. Her strength allows her to bend and twist steel girders, without struggle. She is able to fly via large wings that unfold from her back, and she can generate high-voltage electric currents to destroy her enemies instantly and form blades of energy around her arms or elbows to neatly slice through almost anything. Her most powerful ability is the giga-effect, which allows her to become a giant and fight other devil beasts that have grown in the same regard; while in this form, she can fly, and emit electricity from her hands similar to [[Great Mazinger]]'s Thunder Break. In her empowered form, she can turn the wings on her head into razor sharp blades. Aside from the way she can retain her human conscious, her giga-effect ability is what many people and devil-beasts alike are after.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kazumi Takiura|\u6edd\u6d66 \u548c\u7f8e|Takiura Kazumi}} {{Voiced by|[[Kazusa Murai]]|Camille Chen}}\n:Kazumi is a young and aspiring teen model and fan of Jun's, who she laters meets during an audition when she entered the wrong building. They become close friends, with Jun acting as a big sister or mentor. Kazumi's parents are brutally killed by devil beasts who also try to kill Kazumi because they consider Jun a traitor and seek to punish her by targeting people close to Jun. Kazumi is later taken in by Jun, and is unaware of Jun's night life, although she strongly suspects something is wrong. As the series progresses, the relationship between Kazumi and Jun gradually progresses into a [[yuri (genre)|romantic]] one.\n\n;{{nihongo|Dr. Jason Bates|\u30b8\u30a7\u30a4\u30bd\u30f3\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30c4|''Jeison Beitsu''}} {{Voiced by|[[Ry\u016bsei Nakao]]|J. Hudson Brownlee}}\n:Bates is a scientist working at the Samuelson Labs in New Jersey, and is the current head of all Devil-beast research. He visits Japan to witness Jun's battles for this research, he expresses his views that the Devil-beasts are not evil and how he sympathizes with them. Later during Jun's battle with a Devil-beast in a [[television studio]], she is saved by Bates, a Devil-man like Jun.<ref>{{cite episode|title=\u6575|number=8|series=Devil Lady|credits=TMS|network=Mainichi Broadcasting System|airdate=29 November 1998}}</ref> Bates is the first devil beast before Jun to retain human faculties and to be used for the side of humans; while in this form, he possesses immense strength, two sharp horns on his head similar to [[Gaiking]]'s, and can gain the physical attributes of other devil beasts by consuming their blood. However, unlike Jun, initially he lacks the giga-effect ability, and he sometimes acts as though he would prefer to give in to his beast side and run amok like all of the others.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kiyoshi Maeda |\u524d\u7530 \u6e05|Maeda Kiyoshi}} {{Voiced by|[[Takumi Yamazaki]]}}\n:He is Asuka's personal secretary and also Jun's driver. Although he works for Asuka, he is more morally concerned with Jun's status not only as a human but also her demon side and he tries to help her as much as he can. As the storyline progresses, he ends up getting caught in a conspiracy that may end up getting him killed and a shocking truth is revealed as he learns more of Lan Asuka's past and the future that she will unleash.\n\n;{{nihongo|Tatsuya Yuasa|\u6e6f\u6d45 \u8fb0\u4e5f|Yuasa Tatsuya}} {{Voiced by|[[Naoya Uchida]]}}\n:Yuasa is Jun's long time modeling agent who has been there for her when she goes for auditions. He has a wife and daughter who loves him. After Jun's first devilman experience, Yuasa started to get worried about Jun. As the story progresses, Yuasa feelings for Jun grew and is falling for her.\n\n;{{nihongo|Satoru|\u30b5\u30c8\u30eb}} {{Voiced by|[[Mami Koyama]]}}\n:A child who acts as the leader and organizer of the more militant Devil-Beasts whose intention is the genocide of all humans.

Unlike other characters in the series he is not referred to by name.

His powers include morphing into a butterfly, a highly resilient body, butterfly wings, summoning crow guardians, levitation, mind control, and disabling electronics by thought.\n\n; Devil Beasts\n:Also referred to as demons and beast creatures, the devil beasts are highly evolved carnivorous predators that have evolved from humans. Devil beasts can morph into humans when not actively hunting and can become stronger by consuming them. Some devil beasts can become much larger in size, this being referred to as the giga effect in the series and is caused by chemical reactions via electrical pulses in sensory organs. \n\n===Crusaders===\nFour bird-like devil beasts commanded by Satoru in the last third of the series with each possessing the ability to control a specific element.

Jun, as a character is tougher and braver than in the original manga - she stands up for herself and does not often need others to save her, while in the manga; she is often a damsel in distress. She is also a teacher by profession.<ref>{{cite book |author=Nagai, Go |title=Devil Lady, Volume 1|year=1997 |publisher=Kodansha |chapter=Chapter 1|isbn=978-4-06-260790-2}}</ref> The character Kazumi also never appeared in the original manga, her looks are based upon the character Miki Makimura, Akira Fudo's female friend in the [[Devilman]] series.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nJun's two forms are also a tribute to both versions of ''[[Devilman]].'' While her regular sized form is similar to Devilman (including satyr-like hairy legs) as he appears in the original manga, her Giga Effect form is a tribute to the 1972 anime version. In giga mode, she is a giant as tall as classic giant robots or monsters of the 70s, sports turquoise skin and yellow eyes, and does not have any body hair, which are all elements taken from the television version of ''Devilman''.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Episodes====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #CCF\"\n! width=\"30\" | # !!

It was originally serialized by [[Kodansha]] from January 1997 to July 2000 in the magazine ''[[Weekly Morning]]'', and later collected in 17 volumes. The story follows Jun Fudo, a teacher who can transform into the powerful Devil Lady and protects humanity from devil beasts and their creations.\n\nThe manga was adapted into a twenty-six episode [[anime]] series by [[TMS Entertainment]] in 1998\u22121999, which was released in the US by [[ADV Films]] in 2003\u20132004, and later available through streaming by Midnight Pulp. A manga crossover with ''[[Cutie Honey]]'', another Nagai series, was published in 2013 under the title ''Cutie Honey vs. Devilman Lady''.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Manga===\nSet in Japan after the events of ''[[Devilman]]'', the story follows Jun Fudo, a teacher and former athlete who lives alone with her younger brother, Hikaru, while their father is away in the United States. For reasons unknown to her, Jun begins to experience unusual nightmares which cause her to have animalistic sexual urges. One day, she and students from the tennis club go on an outdoor trip, and are attacked by unusually large bats and forced to flee to their [[chalet]]. A group of demons, disguised as human martial artists, kill and eat the male students and rape the female students. While being raped, Jun feels her soul being ripped apart, and transforms into a Devilman. She protects the surviving girls and kills the demons with her newfound strength, after which a mysterious woman named Lan Asuka appears and says she was the one who awakened the beast within Jun.\n\nConfused by her transformation, Lan Asuka, and her father's sudden appearance and experience, things became too complicated for Jun to understand. Through Professor Fudo's knowledge, he tells a tale of a strange [[phenomenon]] that occurred in shantytowns years ago. It was known as the \"Devil Beast Syndrome\" in which its inhabitants would transform into demons and rape women before eating them with no memories or intelligence of their previous lives and additionally giving them enhanced strength with other abilities.\n\nProfessor Fudo does not believe that their \"Devil Beast Syndrome\" transformation was supernatural, but was actually the next stage of human evolution, calling it \"Nature's way of dealing with mankind's overpopulation\". He also says that few people were genetically engineered to retain their conscience should the \"Devil Beast Syndrome\" occur in them, Jun being one of them. With Jun now becoming the Devilman Lady, she fights for the sake of humanity to protect them from the devil beasts and their creations.\n\nJun, along with Asuka, fight several demons and become close friends. One day Jun investigates the Grumech Embassy she is put through a demonic ritual that opens the Gates of Hell and Jun falls to Hell. Here she meets a mysterious man who introduces himself as Akira Fudo. Jun recognizes Akira to be the man who she saw before in her visions. As Akira explains he is from a past that no longer exist, as God wiped the Earth out after Akira and Satan's battle at the end of ''Devilman''. He offers to acts as guide on Jun's journey through Hell during which the two fall in love and have sex. Through their descent through Hell they also face other characters from Akira\u2019s past, including Silene/Sirene and Kaim. Once they reach the lowest point of Hell, they realize that the demon king is there frozen in ice, but Satan is nowhere to be found. On their way back Akira tells Jun about his past with Satan. However, when they reach the surface, Akira cannot follow Jun to the world. She promises to never forget him and leaves.\n\nAfter Jun returns to world several things change, parts of the past is altered. Events that led her falling to Hell are missing. She keeps communicating with Akira through the Devilman Ghost custome she made, but she slowly forgets his name. The only person she really feels close to Asuka who revealed to be her half-sibling. She starts really opening up to her without knowing that she actually killed their mother with her supernatural powers.\n\nIn later chapters after the leader of the mysterious Cult of Dante, Ryo Utsugi awakens the great demon lord Zennon by fusing with him and releases Hell's inhabitants into the world including demons, Devilman, and humans held in Hell, chaos and carnage breaks loose on Earth once again and the great battle between God's army and demonic forces is drawing closer and closer.\n\nAsuka seduces and impregnates Jun while possessing a male form. Later revealed that he was born a male, but chose to hide himself in a female form from the eyes of God. After Jun is forced to give birth in her giant devilman form to a full grown Akira Fudo, Asuka finally reveals the truth to Jun with the help of Psycho Jenny restoring her sealed memories. The half-siblings are actually two halves of Satan who split himself in order to escape the time loop God throw him into and to be able to bring back Akira from Hell. After learning this, Jun fuses together with Asuka becoming Satan once again. Akira arrives this exact minute to witness the transformation and to greets his old friend/enemy. This time however, Akira joins Satan in his fight against God's army approaching Earth. As Satan puts it, the Akira who was reborn to Hell is different than Akira who was born to Earth, and he now understand Satan's quest against God.\n\nLeading God's army is Archangel Michael, Satan's twin. When Akira notices this, Satan describes himself and his twin as right and the left hand of God. Same powers, but different functions.\n\nWe don't get see who wins the battle between the two forces at the end. The manga end with Satan telling Akira that true hope lies on the other side of the battle as they are launching their attack. We are left with a final shot of Earth with humanity once again exterminated and the age of \"myth\" drawing upon earth once again.\n\n===Anime===\nJun Fudo is a [[supermodel]] who is idolized by many. She also has a secret that not even she knows about at first, for within her lie the genes that hold the next step in the evolution of mankind, the same blood as the beast-like superhumans that terrorize the city. Unlike the rest of them, however, Jun has managed to hold a tenuous grip onto her humanity, and she is recruited by the mysterious Lan Asuka, member of a secret organization within the government, aimed at controlling, if not eliminating, these berserk destroyers of mankind. Jun, as Devil Lady, must now exterminate her own kind, but it is unclear how much longer can she keep her sanity in a situation she never chose to begin with. The story of the anime differs significantly from the manga, despite having similar beginnings - devils are not mystical beings but the next step of humanity's evolution. Unlike the manga, Devilman does not appear.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Jun Fudo|\u4e0d\u52d5 \u30b8\u30e5\u30f3|Fudo Jun}} / Devil Lady {{Voiced by|[[Junko Iwao]]|[[Shawn Sides]]}}\n:Jun is a successful supermodel in Tokyo when the story begins. She is a quiet and timid person who seems to avoid most social interactions, with two exceptions: she is generally open with her manager and very friendly with an aspiring teen model named Kazumi. She is found by a woman named Lan Asuka, who forces her to confront a werewolf-like monster called a devil beast. As it tears into Jun, her powers awaken and she becomes a devil beast herself. She defeats the beast with her powers and reverts to her human form. Asuka speaks of her membership with a military unit known as the Human Alliance, whose purpose is to hunt down and kill all those who are affected with Devil Beast Syndrome. Asuka gives Jun an ultimatum; if Jun does not hunt for them, she will be hunted by them. Jun has no choice but to obey Asuka from that point on.<ref name=\"devil lady 1\">{{cite episode|title=\u7363|series=Devil Lady|network=Mainichi Broadcasting System|number=1|credits=TMS|airdate=October 10, 1998}}</ref> However, she finds that it is not only Asuka's ultimatum that keeps her following Asuka's orders, but also something about Asuka that she cannot defy. As the series progresses, she becomes more independent.\n\n;{{nihongo|Lan Asuka|\u30a2\u30b9\u30ab \u862d|Asuka Ran}} {{Voiced by|[[Kaoru Shimamura]]|Si\u00e2n Rees-Cleland}}\n:Asuka is the woman who scouted Jun for the Human Alliance, and is a high-ranking government official. She is a cold, aggressive, and manipulative woman, who cares nothing for the people who work for her. When she forces Jun to confront the devil beast Wolver, she has no concern for Jun's survival; her theory that Jun is a devil beast was based only on a hunch.<ref name=\"devil lady 1\" /> As the series progresses, however, even though she remains cold towards Jun, she starts to care about Jun's safety. She seems to have different intentions from her organization and does a great deal of work without their knowledge. She was born in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], United States to an American mother and a Japanese father.<ref name=\"yuricon\">[http://okazu.yuricon.com/2004/05/28/yuri-anime-devilman-lady/ Yuri Anime> Devilman Lady] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003557/http://okazu.yuricon.com/2004/05/28/yuri-anime-devilman-lady/ |date=2016-03-04 }}. ''Yurikon LLC''. 2004-05-28. Retrieved 2014-04-23.</ref> At the end of the anime, it is revealed that she is intersex and a powerful Devil Beast herself, who engineered the hunt for the Devil Beasts only to weed out the competition for when she can take over the world. She is mostly a female equivalent of Ryo from Devilman, but unlike him, is not a fallen angel.\n \n;{{nihongo|Akira Fudo|\u4e0d\u52d5 \u660e|Fudo Akira}} / Devilman / Devil Mask\n:Akira Fudo appears for the first time as an ethereal being in Lan Asuka's room accusing her that she was the reincarnation of Satan. Jun later meets him in Hell as Devilman, and he joins with her in the fight against Ryo. He only appears in the manga, but the supporting character Takeshi Maki is based on Akira Fudo, though.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ryo Utsugi|\u5b87\u6d25\u6728 \u6dbc|Utsugi Ry\u014d}} / Dante\n:In this storyline, Ryo Utsugi is the re-incarnation of the Italian poet Dante Alighieri. Only appears in the manga.\n\n;{{nihongo|Aoi Kurosaki|\u9ed2\u5d0e \u3042\u304a\u3044|Kurosaki Aoi}}\n:Aoi Kurosaki makes her first appearance in the 3rd Volume of the manga and she is described as Jun's mortal enemy while competing for the Olympics, as no matter how hard Jun tries to win, Aoi is faster. However, she is actually in love with Jun and the only way she thinks to express it is through rivalry. Her transformation into a devil beast started gradually when she was still young, as a result of her hatred for her step-father who sexually abused her. However, the devil beast had a personality of its own and would tease and mock Aoi.\n\n;Vlava\n:Vlava is the deity of a fictitious European country. He resembles a lot to the Cretan minotaur with having a head which looks like the head of a cow. When Vlava and his followers descend to hell with Jun, he meets with Jinmen and forms an alliance with him to eliminate Devilman, who is protecting Jun. He is killed by Devilman in hell. Later on in the story, he reappears on Earth and joins with Dante's Devil Beast army.\n\n;Devil Lady\n:Jun's alter ego, Devil Lady, is the exact opposite of Jun. She is loud, violent, and temperamental. Her unforgiving and aggressive nature tends to make all of her battles very graphic. As Devil Lady, all of her senses are greatly increased and she has [[night vision]]. Her ability to heal is also highly amplified, bordering on regeneration. Her strength allows her to bend and twist steel girders, without struggle. She is able to fly via large wings that unfold from her back, and she can generate high-voltage electric currents to destroy her enemies instantly and form blades of energy around her arms or elbows to neatly slice through almost anything. Her most powerful ability is the giga-effect, which allows her to become a giant and fight other devil beasts that have grown in the same regard; while in this form, she can fly, and emit electricity from her hands similar to [[Great Mazinger]]'s Thunder Break. In her empowered form, she can turn the wings on her head into razor sharp blades. Aside from the way she can retain her human conscious, her giga-effect ability is what many people and devil-beasts alike are after.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kazumi Takiura|\u6edd\u6d66 \u548c\u7f8e|Takiura Kazumi}} {{Voiced by|[[Kazusa Murai]]|Camille Chen}}\n:Kazumi is a young and aspiring teen model and fan of Jun's, who she laters meets during an audition when she entered the wrong building. They become close friends, with Jun acting as a big sister or mentor. Kazumi's parents are brutally killed by devil beasts who also try to kill Kazumi because they consider Jun a traitor and seek to punish her by targeting people close to Jun. Kazumi is later taken in by Jun, and is unaware of Jun's night life, although she strongly suspects something is wrong. As the series progresses, the relationship between Kazumi and Jun gradually progresses into a [[yuri (genre)|romantic]] one.\n\n;{{nihongo|Dr. Jason Bates|\u30b8\u30a7\u30a4\u30bd\u30f3\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30c4|''Jeison Beitsu''}} {{Voiced by|[[Ry\u016bsei Nakao]]|J. Hudson Brownlee}}\n:Bates is a scientist working at the Samuelson Labs in New Jersey, and is the current head of all Devil-beast research. He visits Japan to witness Jun's battles for this research, he expresses his views that the Devil-beasts are not evil and how he sympathizes with them. Later during Jun's battle with a Devil-beast in a [[television studio]], she is saved by Bates, a Devil-man like Jun.<ref>{{cite episode|title=\u6575|number=8|series=Devil Lady|credits=TMS|network=Mainichi Broadcasting System|airdate=29 November 1998}}</ref> Bates is the first devil beast before Jun to retain human faculties and to be used for the side of humans; while in this form, he possesses immense strength, two sharp horns on his head similar to [[Gaiking]]'s, and can gain the physical attributes of other devil beasts by consuming their blood. However, unlike Jun, initially he lacks the giga-effect ability, and he sometimes acts as though he would prefer to give in to his beast side and run amok like all of the others.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kiyoshi Maeda |\u524d\u7530 \u6e05|Maeda Kiyoshi}} {{Voiced by|[[Takumi Yamazaki]]}}\n:He is Asuka's personal secretary and also Jun's driver. Although he works for Asuka, he is more morally concerned with Jun's status not only as a human but also her demon side and he tries to help her as much as he can. As the storyline progresses, he ends up getting caught in a conspiracy that may end up getting him killed and a shocking truth is revealed as he learns more of Lan Asuka's past and the future that she will unleash.\n\n;{{nihongo|Tatsuya Yuasa|\u6e6f\u6d45 \u8fb0\u4e5f|Yuasa Tatsuya}} {{Voiced by|[[Naoya Uchida]]}}\n:Yuasa is Jun's long time modeling agent who has been there for her when she goes for auditions. He has a wife and daughter who loves him. After Jun's first devilman experience, Yuasa started to get worried about Jun. As the story progresses, Yuasa feelings for Jun grew and is falling for her.\n\n;{{nihongo|Satoru|\u30b5\u30c8\u30eb}} {{Voiced by|[[Mami Koyama]]}}\n:A child who acts as the leader and organizer of the more militant Devil-Beasts whose intention is the genocide of all humans. Satoru is a clever and dangerous foe who Jun has underestimated several times. He considers Jun a traitor to his kind and he will use all of his resources to make her life a living nightmare. Unlike other characters in the series he is not referred to by name. Although he first appears in episode 3, he does not return until episode 14, assuming the role of the main antagonist up until the final episodes. His powers include morphing into a butterfly, a highly resilient body, butterfly wings, summoning crow guardians, levitation, mind control, and disabling electronics by thought.\n\n; Devil Beasts\n:Also referred to as demons and beast creatures, the devil beasts are highly evolved carnivorous predators that have evolved from humans. Devil beasts can morph into humans when not actively hunting and can become stronger by consuming them. Some devil beasts can become much larger in size, this being referred to as the giga effect in the series and is caused by chemical reactions via electrical pulses in sensory organs. \n\n===Crusaders===\nFour bird-like devil beasts commanded by Satoru in the last third of the series with each possessing the ability to control a specific element. In episode 23 all four of them fuse with Satoru to become Giga Satoru.\n\n*'''Andrus (Eagle Beast)''': first appears in episode 17 and has the elemental ability of fire.

Jun, as a character is tougher and braver than in the original manga - she stands up for herself and does not often need others to save her, while in the manga; she is often a damsel in distress. She is also a teacher by profession.<ref>{{cite book |author=Nagai, Go |title=Devil Lady, Volume 1|year=1997 |publisher=Kodansha |chapter=Chapter 1|isbn=978-4-06-260790-2}}</ref> The character Kazumi also never appeared in the original manga, her looks are based upon the character Miki Makimura, Akira Fudo's female friend in the [[Devilman]] series.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nJun's two forms are also a tribute to both versions of ''[[Devilman]].'' While her regular sized form is similar to Devilman (including satyr-like hairy legs) as he appears in the original manga, her Giga Effect form is a tribute to the 1972 anime version. In giga mode, she is a giant as tall as classic giant robots or monsters of the 70s, sports turquoise skin and yellow eyes, and does not have any body hair, which are all elements taken from the television version of ''Devilman''.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Episodes====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #CCF\"\n! width=\"30\" | # !!

{"title_page": "Addled Parliament", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{Parliaments of England 1601}}\n\nThe '''Parliament of 1614''' was the second [[Parliament of England]] of the reign of [[James VI and I]], which sat between 5 April and 7 June 1614. Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]].

[[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament were outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the summoning,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, in 1614, James summoned another parliament.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]].

Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support.

Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source.

Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the summoning,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, in 1614, James summoned another parliament.

Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]].

James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies.

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614.
