At the age of 16 he debuted for F.C. Eeklo. He could have made a career in the sport, however his elder brother [[Erik De Vlaeminck|Erik]] was having success as a pro cyclist and this persuaded Roger to try cycling.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dobbelsten|first1=Rob Van Den|title=Welk een Kampioen mijne heren'|trans-title=What a champion, gentlemen|url=http://leiden.courant.nu/issue/LD/1998-02-14/edition/0/page/41|accessdate=14 May 2015|newspaper=Leidsch Dagblad|language=Dutch|date=14 February 1998|location=Leiden, Netherlands|page=41}}</ref> He raced as a junior in 1965, gaining one win, but 1966 saw 25 victories. Roger and Erik spent their winters riding [[cyclo-cross]] and in 1968 in Luxembourg Erik became world professional champion and Roger the amateur champion on the same day. Roger eventually took the professional title in 1975.\n\nIn 1968 De Vlaeminck rode the [[Cycling at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's individual road race|road race]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in Mexico and finished 18th.<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/de/roger-de-vlaeminck-1.html |title=Roger De Vlaeminck Olympic Results |accessdate=15 September 2014 |work=sports-reference.com}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n[[File:Roger de Vlaeminck.jpg|thumb|left|De Vlaeminck attempting to defend his [[Tour of Flanders]] title in 1978|alt=A cyclist riding on a cobbled road]]\nDe Vlaeminck turned professional at the start of the 1969 season with Flandria-Declerck and won the [[Omloop \"Het Volk\"]] in his first race. De Vlaeminck's career ran parallel with [[Eddy Merckx]] and he battled for ascendancy with Merckx throughout his career. De Vlaeminck rode Paris\u2013Roubaix on 14 occasions, winning four times (1972, 1974, 1975, 1977), finished second four times, third once, fifth once, sixth once, seventh twice and abandoned only in 1980. His skill as a cyclo-cross rider made him an expert on the cobbles of northern France which the race crosses. De Vlaeminck used the early season Italian stage race [[Tirreno\u2013Adriatico]] as training for the spring classics. He dominated the race between 1972 and 1977, winning on six occasions and taking 15 stages.\n\nDe Vlaeminck is one of only three riders to have won all five '[[Classic cycle races|Monuments of Cycling]]' (i.e., [[Milan\u2013San Remo]], [[Tour of Flanders]], [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]], [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]], and the [[Giro di Lombardia]]). The other two are fellow Belgians Rik van Looy and Eddy Merckx. The only major one-day race he did not win was the [[world cycling championship|world road race championship]], his best performance was second to Dutchman [[Hennie Kuiper]] in 1975. He rode three [[Tour de France|Tours de France]], winning stage 6 in 1970 between Amiens and Valenciennes. He took the points jersey in the [[Giro d'Italia]] on three occasions as well as 22 stages overall including seven stages in [[1975 Giro d'Italia|1975]]. He took a stage win in the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] in his final season in 1984. His career lasted 15 years (he retired in 1984) and he had 257 victories.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Post-career==\n[[File:R.De Vlaeminck,E.De Wilde and L.Van Impe (2713076667).jpg|thumb|left|De Vlaeminck (left) with former professional cyclists [[Etienne De Wilde]] and [[Lucien Van Impe]] at a [[criterium]] in [[Aalst, Belgium]] in 2008|alt=Three men riding bicycles]]\nDe Vlaeminck, who lives on a farm in [[Kaprijke]], is still in cycling. He has been coaching cyclo-cross riders. In April 2004 he quit his job as coach to the John Saey-Deschacht team in Belgium to spend more time with his family, However he was tempted back to the sport in November 2004 as advisor to the Zimbabwe team as it prepared for the world championship in St. Wendel, Germany, at the end of January 2005.\n\nDe Vlaeminck is known for firm opinions about cycling and is often consulted by journalists. In particular, he criticizes the trend to have multiple leaders in a team. That, he says, means the best racers share important races between them.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} De Vlaeminck is also known for his harsh opinion of [[Tom Boonen]], calling him unworthy of equaling his Paris-Roubaix record of 4 wins, claiming cycling isn't as hard as it used to be. This led to the meme \"In den tijd van Roger De Vlaeminck ...\" (\"in the days of Roger De Vlaeminck\") where De Vlaeminck was attributed to doing all kinds of unrealistic stuff.<ref>{{cite

Vlaeminck|url=http://www.forvo.com/word/roger_de_vlaeminck/|website=[[Forvo]]|accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> born 24 August 1947) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] former professional [[racing cyclist]]. He was described by [[Rik Van Looy]] as \"The most talented and the only real classics rider of his generation\".{{sfn|Fotheringham|2003|p=63}} Nicknamed \u201c'''The Gypsy'''\u201d because he was born into a family of traveling clothiers, he is known for exploits in the cobbled classic [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]] race, but his performances in other \u201c[[Classic cycle races|Monument]]\u201d races gave him a record that few can match. His record in Paris\u2013Roubaix earned him another nickname, \u201c'''Monsieur Paris\u2013Roubaix'''\u201d (English: \u201cMr. Paris\u2013Roubaix\u201c).\n\n==Early life and amateur career==\nDe Vlaeminck was born on 24 August 1947 in the [[East Flanders]] town of [[Eeklo]],<ref name=\"cycling-archives\">{{cite web|title=Roger De Vlaeminck|url=http://www.cyclingarchives.com/coureurfiche.php?coureurid=8990|work=Cycling Archives|publisher=de Wielersite|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> His first love was football. At the age of 16 he debuted for F.C. Eeklo. He could have made a career in the sport, however his elder brother [[Erik De Vlaeminck|Erik]] was having success as a pro cyclist and this persuaded Roger to try cycling.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dobbelsten|first1=Rob Van Den|title=Welk een Kampioen mijne heren'|trans-title=What a champion, gentlemen|url=http://leiden.courant.nu/issue/LD/1998-02-14/edition/0/page/41|accessdate=14 May 2015|newspaper=Leidsch Dagblad|language=Dutch|date=14 February 1998|location=Leiden, Netherlands|page=41}}</ref> He raced as a junior in 1965, gaining one win, but 1966 saw 25 victories. Roger and Erik spent their winters riding [[cyclo-cross]] and in 1968 in Luxembourg Erik became world professional champion and Roger the amateur champion on the same day. Roger eventually took the professional title in 1975.\n\nIn 1968 De Vlaeminck rode the [[Cycling at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's individual road race|road race]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in Mexico and finished 18th.<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/de/roger-de-vlaeminck-1.html |title=Roger De Vlaeminck Olympic Results |accessdate=15 September 2014 |work=sports-reference.com}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n[[File:Roger de Vlaeminck.jpg|thumb|left|De Vlaeminck attempting to defend his [[Tour of Flanders]] title in 1978|alt=A cyclist riding on a cobbled road]]\nDe Vlaeminck turned professional at the start of the 1969 season with Flandria-Declerck and won the [[Omloop \"Het Volk\"]] in his first race. De Vlaeminck's career ran parallel with [[Eddy Merckx]] and he battled for ascendancy with Merckx throughout his career. De Vlaeminck rode Paris\u2013Roubaix on 14 occasions, winning four times (1972, 1974, 1975, 1977), finished second four times, third once, fifth once, sixth once, seventh twice and abandoned only in 1980. His skill as a cyclo-cross rider made him an expert on the cobbles of northern France which the race crosses. De Vlaeminck used the early season Italian stage race [[Tirreno\u2013Adriatico]] as training for the spring classics. He dominated the race between 1972 and 1977, winning on six occasions and taking 15 stages.\n\nDe Vlaeminck is one of only three riders to have won all five '[[Classic cycle races|Monuments of Cycling]]' (i.e., [[Milan\u2013San Remo]], [[Tour of Flanders]], [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]], [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]], and the [[Giro di Lombardia]]). The other two are fellow Belgians Rik van Looy and Eddy Merckx. The only major one-day race he did not win was the [[world cycling championship|world road race championship]], his best performance was second to Dutchman [[Hennie Kuiper]] in 1975. He rode three [[Tour de France|Tours de France]], winning stage 6 in 1970 between Amiens and Valenciennes. He took the points jersey in the [[Giro d'Italia]] on three occasions as well as 22 stages overall including seven stages in [[1975 Giro d'Italia|1975]]. He took a stage win in the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] in his final season in 1984. His career lasted 15 years (he retired in 1984) and he had 257 victories.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Post-career==\n[[File:R.De Vlaeminck,E.De Wilde and L.Van Impe (2713076667).jpg|thumb|left|De Vlaeminck (left) with former professional cyclists [[Etienne De Wilde]] and [[Lucien Van Impe]] at a [[criterium]] in [[Aalst, Belgium]] in 2008|alt=Three men riding bicycles]]\nDe Vlaeminck, who lives on a farm in [[Kaprijke]], is still in cycling. He has been coaching cyclo-cross riders. In April 2004 he quit his job as coach to the John Saey-Deschacht team in Belgium to spend more time with his family, However he was tempted back to the sport in November 2004 as advisor to the Zimbabwe team as it prepared for the world championship in St. Wendel, Germany, at the end of January 2005.\n\nDe Vlaeminck is known for firm opinions about cycling and is often consulted by journalists. In particular, he criticizes the trend to have multiple leaders in a team. That, he says, means the best racers share important races between them.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} De Vlaeminck is also known for his harsh opinion of [[Tom Boonen]], calling him unworthy of equaling his Paris-Roubaix record of 4 wins, claiming cycling isn't as hard as it used to be. This led to the meme \"In den tijd van Roger De Vlaeminck ...\" (\"in the days of Roger De Vlaeminck\") where De Vlaeminck was attributed to doing all kinds of unrealistic stuff.<ref>{{cite

The Bru can be found all over the Tripura state in India. However, they may also be found in [[Mizoram]] and [[Assam]]. They speak the Reang dialect of Bru language which is of [[Tibeto-Burman language|Tibeto-Burmese]] origin and is locally referred to as '''Kau Bru'''.\n\nIn 2018, following the Union Home Ministry's decision to give voting rights to around 30,000 people who had fled from Mizoram to Tripura in 1997 in the wake of inter-community violence, The Election Commission asked the State of Mizoram to revise its rolls for the 2018 polls and include the members of the internally-displaced community. As many as 32,876 people of the Reang tribe were set to be repatriated to Mizoram after a tripartite agreement was signed between the Centre, Tripura and Mizoram.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bru people to get voting rights: Ministry |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bru-people-to-get-voting-rights-ministry/article24334042.ece |accessdate=5 July 2018 |publisher=The Hindu}}</ref> On 16 January 2020, a quadripartite agreement was signed among the Centre, state governments of Tripura and Mizoram and Bru-Reang representatives to facilitate permanent settlement of Bru refugees from Mizoram in Tripura, benefitting around 34,000 refugees.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bru tribals from Mizoram to permanently settle in Tripura |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bru-tribals-from-mizoram-to-permanently-settle-in-tripura-pact-signed/articleshow/73306927.cms |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==The history of Bru (Reangs)==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nThe Bru are the second most populous tribe of Tripura after the Tripuris. According to the legend, a Tripuri prince who was once exiled by the King made his way, along with his followers, to the Mayani Thalang area of [[Lushai hills]] and founded a state over there. He proclaimed himself King and his descendants too ruled over the break-away state for generations. As it sometimes happens, there came a time when there was no heir to succeed to the throne, leading to anarchy in the kingdom. At around the same time, bitter feud and internal vendetta saw four chiefs of the following sub tribes Twikluha, Yongsika, Paisika, Tuibruha leave their hearth and home along with their entourages to migrate back to the state of Tripura. It was a long and difficult journey, fraught with danger and the travellers had to make more than a couple of attempts before they successfully made their way up the Dombur hill.\n\nAt the time, Mahendra Manikya ruled the kingdom of Tripura. The chiefs made many attempts to reach the King to request asylum. They approached ministers, bureaucrats, and courtiers for help in arranging a meeting with the King but with no success. By this time, they had exhausted their supplies and were rather anxious to catch the attention of the King. Finally in desperation, they breached the dam on the river Gumti where worshippers had gathered for prayers. This was a serious crime and all of them were immediately apprehended and brought before the king. The crime was a serious one and merited capital punishment. But before the King could pass his judgement, the chiefs managed to send word to the Queen Gunoboti. They begged her for help and she persuaded the King to forgive them. The chiefs swore fealty to the Queen and to the throne of Tripura and settled down in the Kingdom. Popular legend has it that the Queen even offered the chiefs breast milk, to symbolise their new parent-child relationship, in a large brass pan which was given to the chiefs along with other valuable things, carefully preserved by Reangs to date.\n\n===Historical population figures===\nIn 1971 the Reang were the second largest of the scheduled tribes in Tripura.  There were 64,722 people accounted for in the Reang tribe in Tripura that year.  In 1961 the Reang had numbered 56,597 and in 1951 they had numbered 8,471.<ref>Gan-Chaudhuri, Jagadis. ''Tripura: The Land and its People''. (Delhi: Leeladevi Publications, 1980) p. 10</ref> According to the 2001 census, there were 165,103 Reang in Tripura.<ref>http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_tripura.pdf</ref>\n\n==Occupation, culture and custom==\n\nThe Reangs are primarily an agrarian tribe. In the past, they mostly practised the '''Huk''' or '''Jhum cultivation''' like most other Tripuri tribes. However today, most of them have adopted modern agricultural practices. Many occupy high posts in the bureaucracy and a few have even started their own businesses.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Marriage system===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nThe Reang are an endogamous tribe who have had very little contact with the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] or other sub-tribe of Tripura. Recently, however{{When|date=February 2011}} inter-tribe marriages and inter-caste wedding have taken place. The marriage system is similar to other Tripuri tribe of Tripura. There is no dowry system, but the bridegroom has to spend a period of two years in the (future) father-in-law's house for  before marriage is performed{{citation needed|date= June 2018}}. There are two types of marriages;\n* Halausai.\n* Halauhih.\n\nMarriages between close relatives are not frowned upon but are no longer as frequent.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Cross-cousin marriage among the Reang is accidental. Child marriage is not allowed and widow remarriage is permitted. Recent widows are required to wait a whole year before wearing any ornaments and both widows, as well as widowers, are mandated twelve months of mourning during which they are forbidden from any form of entertainment. Remarriage is only allowed after a year of mourning. Bru society today is monogamous.\n\nMarriage is arranged through the matchmaker '''Andra''', who negotiates the bride price with the bride's parents. Marriage is settled to the satisfaction of both parties and performed by the Ochai. The marriage is celebrated simply but well in the '''Kausungmo''', where pork, [[fowl]], rice, rice beer are served. The marriage laws of the Reang are few but well defined. The Reang widower, for instance, is not permitted to marry a virgin.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} The marriage bond is very strong and men cannot divorce without the consent of their wives. If any Reang is accused of extramarital relationships and the accusations are proved true, a strict punishment and a heavy penalty is imposed on both parties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Dress and ornaments===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\n\nLike the other Tripuri, the traditional dress of the Reang is simple and plain. Men traditionally wear a hand woven loin cloth and a piece of cloth as a wrapper for the upper body. Along with this a piece of woven cloth is wrapped around the head by '''Kamsoi''' and is known as '''Kamsoi maitang'''. The women wear a long cloth called [[Mnai]], a wraparound; from the waist to down to the knees, a [[Rsa (garment)|Rsa]] covering the chest, and '''Rikatouh''' for covering the whole upper half of the body. The fabric is usually woven by the Reang women and very colourful. However modernisation has caught up with the Bru and most urban Reang no longer wear their traditional costumes.\n\nThe Reang women are very fond of personal adornment and, like other Tripuris, favour ornaments, flowers, and cosmetics. Silver ornaments, especially the necklace of silver coins, the '''Rangbauh''' have a pride of place and bestow high status. The other ornaments are '''Sanghai dunang, Nabak, Angkli, Taar, Tro, Chandraha, Beingi''', etc.\n\n===Dance and music===\nDance is an integral part of Reang life. The Hojagiri folk dance of Reang sub tribe is rather well known all over the world. 'Buisu', not 'bihu' is the most popular festival of reang tribes, naisingpara hojagiri group is the most popular groups all among \nthem, late maniram reang is the founder of naisingpara hojagiri dance group.\nhojagiri is more popular in tripura than other states.\n\n===Customs===\nMost of the disputed and differences are settled by the people of Kotor dofa, that is by the Rai and Kaskau of respective sub tribe. It is done through the customary law of the Reangs. Whenever a disputes arise in the between the member of the community, a meeting is called by the Rai. All relevant arguments are heard and then justice is done according to the principle of natural justice. Whatever verdict or punishment is pronounced in the judgment it is implemented with firm hand and payments of penalty etc. are made then and there.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Religious belief and practices==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nThe majority of the Reang belong to the [[Vaishnav]] school of [[Hinduism]] and claim [[Tripuri Kshatriya|Kshatriya]] status. A growing number of Christians, exists in both [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]].\n\nLike other [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]] people, the Reang are polytheists and believe in multiple Gods and Goddesses. At the heart of the pantheon of divinities are the [[Chaturdasa Devata|fourteen Gods and Goddess of Tripura]]. Their important festivals are the same those of prevailing in Tripura. These are, Buisi, Ker, Gonga Mtai, Goria, Chitragupra, Hojagiri, Katangi Puja, Lampra U\u00f3hthoh. Laxmi puja is the very famous puja, which is celebrate on karthik poornima, Religious observances are community-based and every family in the clan or village must contribute their share of payment or tithe known locally as '''Khain'''.\n\nAll religious festivals are arranged during an annual meeting of chiefs. In such meetings political, social, and religious matters of importance are discussed and decided by the majority.\n\nThe deities of the Reangs are similar those of other Tripuri people. These are:\n* ''Sibrai''', the supreme deity or '''Mtai Ktor'''\n* '''Tuima''', the presiding deity of river,\n* '''Mainouhma''', the goddess of paddy,\n* '''Khuluhma''', the goddess of cotton,\n* '''Goroia''', the god of wealth prosperity, well being, and war,\n* '''Kalaia''', brother of Goria,\n* '''Sangrongma''', Mother Earth,\n* '''Hathaikchuma''', the goddess of the hills,\n* '''Buraha''', the god of the jungle,\n* '''Thuhnairou''', the god of death,\n* '''Bonirou''', the god of evil spirits,\n* '''Nouhsuma''', the goddess of households\n\n===Worshipping of the deities===\nThe rituals of worship are similar to the mainstream Tripuri. An Ao'''kchai''' or priest performs all ceremonies aided by an assistant. A green bamboo pole is used to represent the deity. Different types of life stock such as fowl, pig, goat eggs, etc. are offered as sacrifice during worship. The place of worship is usually located at a distance from the main village. Offerings are dedicated in the names of the deities before the Wathop or green bamboo pole which represents the divine. However the Rangtouk and Nouhsuma pujas are held indoors inside the house only. Two earthen pots are filled with newly grown rice and at top of the pot some oval pebbles especially collected from huk are placed. The pebbles are called \"Fortune stones\". The pots ('''Rongtouh''') are decorated with the rice powder, vermilion, and garlands. Typically, one is named Mainouhgma while the other is called Khuluhgma.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Rituals on birth of a baby===\nThe birth of a baby is accompanied by many rituals. Several pujas like Kebengma, Abu suma, Khongkhonok kama, bachao kama, Mai tuma etc. are conducted for the welfare of the newborn. Fowl, prawns, and several leaves of trees are needed for these rituals. As the child grows up, a special form of worship has to be performed.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Bukhuksni the seven-guardian deities of witches are propriated with the sacrifice of a pig, four fowls, and other living beings.\n\n===Ceremony on death===\nThe Reang use cremation to dispose of the mortal remains of the dead. Obsequies are performed in three stages: maibaumi, Broksakami and Kthuinaimo.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Brouhsaomo====\nThe corpse is first bathed with the '''Chobtui''' or \"''alkali water/soap''\", and '''Mairungtwi''' that is \"''water obtained from the washing of raw rice''\". After that it is dressed with new clean '''Rikatouh''', the head is dressed with another piece of rikatouh and wrapped just like headgear. In case of a female corpse, the rnai and rsa are used. A fowl is then sacrificed at the feet of the corpse. Later, an earthen pot filled with fish and rice placed at the feat of the deceased and it is followed by dance rituals through the night. Rice beer is distributed to all mourners except the family members of the deceased.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The next morning the body is placed on a pyre and cremated.\n\n====Kthoinaimo====\n'''Laotou''' or the deceased soul remains under the control of the '''Sisi Manji''' the son of Buraha, for a year and it is said that Sisi Manji is the protector of the soul. On the day of the Kathainaimi, the widow offers dried rice, meat, fish, fruits, and wine in the name of Laotau and Sisi Manji on the '''smangnouh''' and then takes the burnt bones or ashes to the '''charainouh'''. It is worshiped for over a period of one year or until the next hangrai, when it is immersed in any river or in Gomati River at Dumbur. \nIn short the religious culture of the Reang is similar to that of other Tripuri of Tripura.\n\n==Reang Refugees==\n\nSince 1997, tens of thousands of Reangs are living as refugees in Tripura and Assam.<ref>https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/living-in-camps-thousands-of-bruraeng-children-in-tripura-have-never-heard-of-school/1348536</ref> However, the number has declined (from 50,000 plus to 28,686 as of 2017) as a result of voluntary repatriation to Mizoram, extremely low birth rates (only 6,685 of the 28,686 refugees are below 18 years of age) and high death rates.<ref>https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Devising%20Pathways%20for%20Appropriate%20Repatriation.pdf</ref> The Tripura government has acknowledged that among the refugees the number of deaths is more than the number of births (during 1997-00, there were a total of 1,595 births and 1,670 deaths).<ref>http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/92967/14/14_chapter%206.pdf</ref> According to the Bru Refugee Committee, in 1997 a total of 35,822 individuals were living as refugees (out of them 6,166 being minors).<ref>http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/92967/14/14_chapter%206.pdf</ref> The only organization which has provided support for the refugees is the [[Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram|Akhil Bharatiya Vanbasi Kalyan Ashram]].<ref>http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/92967/14/14_chapter%206.pdf</ref>\n\nVoting rights for Reang refugees are under threat, as the Mizo NGOs have constantly opposed their participation in the election process. Out of the 40 assembly constituencies, Reangs are a majority in two (50% in Mamit, 68% in Hachhek, 27% in Thorang), and in combination with the Chakmas (5% in Mamit, 30% in Thorang, 80% in West Tuipui and 98% in Tuichawng), they have a small chance to win one or more seats.\n\n==Death in Refugee camps ==\n\nDisplaced Brus from Mizoram have claimed that four members of the community, including a four-month-old infant, had died of starvation at the refugee camps in Tripura. Mizorum Bru Displanced People's Forum (MBDPF) said four had died because the refugees were running out of food. Hunger has forced them to resort to a road blockade, the forum added.<ref>https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/brus-claim-starvation-as-4-die-in-tripura-camps/article29881577.ece</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Scheduled tribes of India}}\n{{Hill tribes of Northeast India}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Tripura]]\n[[Category:Mizoram]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Tripura]]\n[[Category:Languages of Bangladesh]]\n[[Category:Kuki tribes]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Northeast India]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in South Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{rewrite|date=January 2020}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2016}}\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n|group        = Reang\n|population   = 50,000-100,000\n|languages    = [[Riang language (India)]]\n|regions      = [[Northeast India]]\n|religions    = [[Hinduism]] and [[Christianity]]             \n|related      =[[Tripuri people]], [[Bodo people]], [[Chutia people]], [[Dimasa People]], [[Bodo-Kachari]] groups\n}}\n\n'''Reang''' (aka '''Bru''' in Tripura and Mizoram) are one of the 21 [[adivasi|scheduled tribes]] of the Indian state of [[Tripura]]. The Bru can be found all over the Tripura state in India. However, they may also be found in [[Mizoram]] and [[Assam]]. They speak the Reang dialect of Bru language which is of [[Tibeto-Burman language|Tibeto-Burmese]] origin and is locally referred to as '''Kau Bru'''.\n\nIn 2018, following the Union Home Ministry's decision to give voting rights to around 30,000 people who had fled from Mizoram to Tripura in 1997 in the wake of inter-community violence, The Election Commission asked the State of Mizoram to revise its rolls for the 2018 polls and include the members of the internally-displaced community.

According to the legend, a Tripuri prince who was once exiled by the King made his way, along with his followers, to the Mayani Thalang area of [[Lushai hills]] and founded a state over there. He proclaimed himself King and his descendants too ruled over the break-away state for generations. As it sometimes happens, there came a time when there was no heir to succeed to the throne, leading to anarchy in the kingdom. At around the same time, bitter feud and internal vendetta saw four chiefs of the following sub tribes Twikluha, Yongsika, Paisika, Tuibruha leave their hearth and home along with their entourages to migrate back to the state of Tripura. It was a long and difficult journey, fraught with danger and the travellers had to make more than a couple of attempts before they successfully made their way up the Dombur hill.\n\nAt the time, Mahendra Manikya ruled the kingdom of Tripura. The chiefs made many attempts to reach the King to request asylum. They approached ministers, bureaucrats, and courtiers for help in arranging a meeting with the King but with no success. By this time, they had exhausted their supplies and were rather anxious to catch the attention of the King. Finally in desperation, they breached the dam on the river Gumti where worshippers had gathered for prayers. This was a serious crime and all of them were immediately apprehended and brought before the king. The crime was a serious one and merited capital punishment. But before the King could pass his judgement, the chiefs managed to send word to the Queen Gunoboti. They begged her for help and she persuaded the King to forgive them. The chiefs swore fealty to the Queen and to the throne of Tripura and settled down in the Kingdom. Popular legend has it that the Queen even offered the chiefs breast milk, to symbolise their new parent-child relationship, in a large brass pan which was given to the chiefs along with other valuable things, carefully preserved by Reangs to date.\n\n===Historical population figures===\nIn 1971 the Reang were the second largest of the scheduled tribes in Tripura.  There were 64,722 people accounted for in the Reang tribe in Tripura that year.  In 1961 the Reang had numbered 56,597 and in 1951 they had numbered 8,471.<ref>Gan-Chaudhuri, Jagadis. ''Tripura: The Land and its People''. (Delhi: Leeladevi Publications, 1980) p. 10</ref> According to the 2001 census, there were 165,103 Reang in Tripura.<ref>http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_tripura.pdf</ref>\n\n==Occupation, culture and custom==\n\nThe Reangs are primarily an agrarian tribe. In the past, they mostly practised the '''Huk''' or '''Jhum cultivation''' like most other Tripuri tribes. However today, most of them have adopted modern agricultural practices. Many occupy high posts in the bureaucracy and a few have even started their own businesses.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Marriage system===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nThe Reang are an endogamous tribe who have had very little contact with the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] or other sub-tribe of Tripura. Recently, however{{When|date=February 2011}} inter-tribe marriages and inter-caste wedding have taken place. The marriage system is similar to other Tripuri tribe of Tripura. There is no dowry system, but the bridegroom has to spend a period of two years in the (future) father-in-law's house for  before marriage is performed{{citation needed|date= June 2018}}. There are two types of marriages;\n* Halausai.\n* Halauhih.\n\nMarriages between close relatives are not frowned upon but are no longer as frequent.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Cross-cousin marriage among the Reang is accidental. Child marriage is not allowed and widow remarriage is permitted. Recent widows are required to wait a whole year before wearing any ornaments and both widows, as well as widowers, are mandated twelve months of mourning during which they are forbidden from any form of entertainment. Remarriage is only allowed after a year of mourning. Bru society today is monogamous.\n\nMarriage is arranged through the matchmaker '''Andra''', who negotiates the bride price with the bride's parents. Marriage is settled to the satisfaction of both parties and performed by the Ochai. The marriage is celebrated simply but well in the '''Kausungmo''', where pork, [[fowl]], rice, rice beer are served. The marriage laws of the Reang are few but well defined. The Reang widower, for instance, is not permitted to marry a virgin.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} The marriage bond is very strong and men cannot divorce without the consent of their wives. If any Reang is accused of extramarital relationships and the accusations are proved true, a strict punishment and a heavy penalty is imposed on both parties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Dress and ornaments===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}} \n\nLike the other Tripuri, the traditional dress of the Reang is simple and plain. Men traditionally wear a hand woven loin cloth and a piece of cloth as a wrapper for the upper body. Along with this a piece of woven cloth is wrapped around the head by '''Kamsoi''' and is known as '''Kamsoi maitang'''. The women wear a long cloth called [[Mnai]], a wraparound; from the waist to down to the knees, a [[Rsa (garment)|Rsa]] covering the chest, and '''Rikatouh''' for covering the whole upper half of the body. The fabric is usually woven by the Reang women and very colourful. However modernisation has caught up with the Bru and most urban Reang no longer wear their traditional costumes.\n\nThe Reang women are very fond of personal adornment and, like other Tripuris, favour ornaments, flowers, and cosmetics. Silver ornaments, especially the necklace of silver coins, the '''Rangbauh''' have a pride of place and bestow high status. The other ornaments are '''Sanghai dunang, Nabak, Angkli, Taar, Tro, Chandraha, Beingi''', etc.\n\n===Dance and music===\nDance is an integral part of Reang life. The Hojagiri folk dance of Reang sub tribe is rather well known all over the world. 'Buisu', not 'bihu' is the most popular festival of reang tribes, naisingpara hojagiri group is the most popular groups all among \nthem, late maniram reang is the founder of naisingpara hojagiri dance group.\nhojagiri is more popular in tripura than other states.\n\n===Customs===\nMost of the disputed and differences are settled by the people of Kotor dofa, that is by the Rai and Kaskau of respective sub tribe. It is done through the customary law of the Reangs. Whenever a disputes arise in the between the member of the community, a meeting is called by the Rai. All relevant arguments are heard and then justice is done according to the principle of natural justice. Whatever verdict or punishment is pronounced in the judgment it is implemented with firm hand and payments of penalty etc. are made then and there.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Religious belief and practices==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nThe majority of the Reang belong to the [[Vaishnav]] school of [[Hinduism]] and claim [[Tripuri Kshatriya|Kshatriya]] status. A growing number of Christians, exists in both [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]].\n\nLike other [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]] people, the Reang are polytheists and believe in multiple Gods and Goddesses. At the heart of the pantheon of divinities are the [[Chaturdasa Devata|fourteen Gods and Goddess of Tripura]]. Their important festivals are the same those of prevailing in Tripura. These are, Buisi, Ker, Gonga Mtai, Goria, Chitragupra, Hojagiri, Katangi Puja, Lampra U\u00f3hthoh. Laxmi puja is the very famous puja, which is celebrate on karthik poornima, Religious observances are community-based and every family in the clan or village must contribute their share of payment or tithe known locally as '''Khain'''.\n\nAll religious festivals are arranged during an annual meeting of chiefs. In such meetings political, social, and religious matters of importance are discussed and decided by the majority.\n\nThe deities of the Reangs are similar those of other Tripuri people. These are:\n* ''Sibrai''', the supreme deity or '''Mtai Ktor'''\n* '''Tuima''', the presiding deity of river,\n* '''Mainouhma''', the goddess of paddy,\n* '''Khuluhma''', the goddess of cotton,\n* '''Goroia''', the god of wealth prosperity, well being, and war,\n* '''Kalaia''', brother of Goria,\n* '''Sangrongma''', Mother Earth,\n* '''Hathaikchuma''', the goddess of the hills,\n* '''Buraha''', the god of the jungle,\n* '''Thuhnairou''', the god of death,\n* '''Bonirou''', the god of evil spirits,\n* '''Nouhsuma''', the goddess of households\n\n===Worshipping of the deities===\nThe rituals of worship are similar to the mainstream Tripuri. An Ao'''kchai''' or priest performs all ceremonies aided by an assistant. A green bamboo pole is used to represent the deity. Different types of life stock such as fowl, pig, goat eggs, etc. are offered as sacrifice during worship. The place of worship is usually located at a distance from the main village. Offerings are dedicated in the names of the deities before the Wathop or green bamboo pole which represents the divine. However the Rangtouk and Nouhsuma pujas are held indoors inside the house only. Two earthen pots are filled with newly grown rice and at top of the pot some oval pebbles especially collected from huk are placed. The pebbles are called \"Fortune stones\". The pots ('''Rongtouh''') are decorated with the rice powder, vermilion, and garlands. Typically, one is named Mainouhgma while the other is called Khuluhgma.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Rituals on birth of a baby===\nThe birth of a baby is accompanied by many rituals. Several pujas like Kebengma, Abu suma, Khongkhonok kama, bachao kama, Mai tuma etc. are conducted for the welfare of the newborn. Fowl, prawns, and several leaves of trees are needed for these rituals. As the child grows up, a special form of worship has to be performed.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Bukhuksni the seven-guardian deities of witches are propriated with the sacrifice of a pig, four fowls, and other living beings.\n\n===Ceremony on death===\nThe Reang use cremation to dispose of the mortal remains of the dead. Obsequies are performed in three stages: maibaumi, Broksakami and Kthuinaimo.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Brouhsaomo====\nThe corpse is first bathed with the '''Chobtui''' or \"''alkali water/soap''\", and '''Mairungtwi''' that is \"''water obtained from the washing of raw rice''\". After that it is dressed with new clean '''Rikatouh''', the head is dressed with another piece of rikatouh and wrapped just like headgear. In case of a female corpse, the rnai and rsa are used. A fowl is then sacrificed at the feet of the corpse. Later, an earthen pot filled with fish and rice placed at the feat of the deceased and it is followed by dance rituals through the night. Rice beer is distributed to all mourners except the family members of the deceased.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The next morning the body is placed on a pyre and cremated.\n\n====Kthoinaimo====\n'''Laotou''' or the deceased soul remains under the control of the '''Sisi Manji''' the son of Buraha, for a year and it is said that Sisi Manji is the protector of the soul. On the day of the Kathainaimi, the widow offers dried rice, meat, fish, fruits, and wine in the name of Laotau and Sisi Manji on the '''smangnouh''' and then takes the burnt bones or ashes to the '''charainouh'''. It is worshiped for over a period of one year or until the next hangrai, when it is immersed in any river or in Gomati River at Dumbur. \nIn short the religious culture of the Reang is similar to that of other Tripuri of Tripura.\n\n==Reang Refugees==\n\nSince 1997, tens of thousands of Reangs are living as refugees in Tripura and Assam.<ref>https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/living-in-camps-thousands-of-bruraeng-children-in-tripura-have-never-heard-of-school/1348536</ref> However, the number has declined (from 50,000 plus to 28,686 as of 2017) as a result of voluntary repatriation to Mizoram, extremely low birth rates (only 6,685 of the 28,686 refugees are below 18 years of age) and high death rates.<ref>https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Devising%20Pathways%20for%20Appropriate%20Repatriation.pdf</ref> The Tripura government has acknowledged that among the refugees the number of deaths is more than the number of births (during 1997-00, there were a total of 1,595 births and 1,670 deaths).<ref>http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/92967/14/14_chapter%206.pdf</ref> According to the Bru Refugee Committee, in 1997 a total of 35,822 individuals were living as refugees (out of them 6,166 being minors).<ref>http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/92967/14/14_chapter%206.pdf</ref> The only organization which has provided support for the refugees is the [[Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram|Akhil Bharatiya Vanbasi Kalyan Ashram]].<ref>http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/92967/14/14_chapter%206.pdf</ref>\n\nVoting rights for Reang refugees are under threat, as the Mizo NGOs have constantly opposed their participation in the election process.

Rick is a natural leader, someone his fellow survivors will turn to in a crisis, confident in his guidance, even when he at times doubts himself. His overwhelming need to do the right thing and protect those who can't protect themselves may pull him away from his family, causing cracks of tension within his marriage with Lori and his relationship with his son, Carl. Frustrated about leading his group and keeping them safe, Rick gradually changes into a darker person.\n\nEventually, he breaks down once again, following the deaths of Glenn and Abraham, and the overshadowing presence of Negan \u2014 the series' central antagonist in season six and seven. Throughout season seven, Rick slowly regains his footing and then starts preparing for an all-out war against Negan and the Saviors. However, before the war is over, Carl dies when a walker bites him with his last wish being for his father to find a way to forgive Negan and even join forces with him so that a large, strong community can live in peace, safe from walkers. Rick is then torn between his desire for revenge and his son's final wish for reconciliation. At the end of season eight, Rick manages to find a middle ground by almost, but not quite killing Negan and deciding to keep him locked inside a [[prison cell]] in Alexandria, thus ending the war.\n\nWhen Rick and the communities decide to build a bridge the following season, chaos erupts with the rebellious, remaining Saviors and conflict with members of Rick's group who believe Negan should die in retribution for brutally murdering Glenn and Abraham. In the midst of the conflict, Rick is critically wounded, the bridge is blown up, and Rick is presumed dead. However, unbeknownst to Michonne, Daryl, and the rest of the community, a nearly dead Rick is discovered by Jadis, who arranges him to be taken off in a helicopter with her to an unknown destination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick-grimes-will-return-series-tv-movies/ |title=\u2018Walking Dead': Andrew Lincoln and Rick Grimes Will Return in a Series of TV Movies |last=Owen |first=Phil |work=[[TheWrap]] |date=November 4, 2018 |accessdate=March 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/04/walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick-grimes-movies/ |title=Andrew Lincoln to return for The Walking Dead movies |last=Ross |first=Dalton |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 4, 2018 |accessdate=March 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shane Walsh===\n{{further|Shane Walsh (The Walking Dead)}}\n[[File:Crop of Jon Bernthal by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Jon Bernthal]]]]\n\n'''Shane Walsh''', portrayed by [[Jon Bernthal]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Emmys 2012: 'The Walking Dead's' Jon Bernthal on Killing Characters, Challenging Scenes and the Ending Nobody Saw |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/emmys-2012-walking-dead-jon-bernthal-338851 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012101854/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/emmys-2012-walking-dead-jon-bernthal-338851 |archive-date=October 12, 2016}}</ref> is a former sheriff's deputy from a small Georgia town. He was Rick's partner in the sheriff's department and his best friend since high school.\n\nAfter the walkers begin to take over, Shane goes to visit Rick in the hospital, where he has lain in a coma since being shot. He cannot save Rick (and he also welcomes this opportunity to take Rick's place with Lori and Carl), but he blocks the hospital door with a gurney and hopes Rick will die quietly of natural causes. Until Rick's recovery and reappearance, Shane led the group of Atlanta survivors and was Lori's lover. His fixation on Lori becomes very obsessive and deranged, though he tries to acclimate to the reality of Rick as leader of the group and Lori's rightful husband. Additionally, Shane shows a ruthless side, allowing Otis to be killed by walkers so that he can escape. Rick eventually confronts him for all his atrocities, but even so he forgives him. Later, Shane formulates a plan to kill Rick but fails. Rick ends his life with a [[knife]] in the chest and Carl then ends his reanimation.\n\n===Lori Grimes===\n{{further|Lori Grimes}}\n[[File:Sarah Wayne Callies Comic-Con 4, 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Sarah Wayne Callies]]]]\n\n'''Lori Grimes''', portrayed by [[Sarah Wayne Callies]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive: Sarah Wayne Callies Joins 'Walking Dead' |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2010/04/30/sarah-wayne-callies-lands-walking-dead-lead |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212120045/http://www.ew.com/article/2010/04/30/sarah-wayne-callies-lands-walking-dead-lead |archive-date=February 12, 2016}}</ref> is Rick's wife, and Carl and Judith's mother. In the first season, Lori believes that Rick has died in the hospital from a [[gunshot wound]], while the walkers are taking over, creating chaos and forcing Lori and Carl to run, under the protection of Shane. A few episodes later, they find out Rick is alive. When Rick reunites with Lori, this attracts the harassment of Shane who gradually becomes more and more hostile even when he knows that she is expecting a child of his. Eventually, Rick manages to learn about this event afterwards. From their escape from Hershel's farm to their endeavor to take up residence at a prison, Lori becomes increasingly estranged from Rick and Carl, which she blames on herself; she becomes worried about her baby's survival. In \"[[Killer Within]]\", when she goes into labor during an unexpected walker attack, Lori convinces Maggie to give her a [[Caesarean section|C-section]], despite the fact that it will prove fatal for her. Lori then dies giving birth and Carl is forced to shoot her to prevent reanimation; this breaks Rick into an emotional state.\n\n===Andrea===\n{{further|Andrea (The Walking Dead)}}\n[[File:Laurie Holden 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Laurie Holden]]]]\n\n'''Andrea''', portrayed by [[Laurie Holden]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Laurie Holden Interview THE WALKING DEAD |url=http://collider.com/laurie-holden-interview-the-walking-dead/ |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |date=December 1, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512145353/http://collider.com/laurie-holden-interview-the-walking-dead/ |archive-date=May 12, 2016}}</ref> is a former [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] [[lawyer|attorney]] who is extremely protective of her younger sister Amy. Following Amy's death, she considers [[suicide]], but decides to remain with the group.\n\nWith the others, they find a farm owned by Hershel Greene. At the farm, she continued to confide and seek comfort in Dale, and gains survivalist skills through Shane. After escaping Hershel's overrun farm, she is rescued by Michonne and is brought by Merle to Woodbury, where she begins a romantic relationship with The Governor.\n\nShe is eventually [[Crossfire#\"Caught in the crossfire\"|caught in the crossfire]] between Rick and The Governor, and attempts to mend relations, but later turns on The Governor after learning that he intends to attack the prison. Afterwards, Andrea leaves Woodbury and reaches the prison perimeter, but is secretly followed and tackled by The Governor, who then returns her to Woodbury. She is then locked in his [[torture chamber]], gagged and bound to a [[dental engine|dental chair]], with an undead Milton. However, before she is able to free herself, the reanimated Milton bites her. After the failed attempt to attack the prison by The Governor, a nearly dead Andrea is found by Rick, Daryl, Michonne, and Tyreese where she makes amends before taking her own life with Michonne by her side.\n\n===Dale Horvath===\n{{further|Dale Horvath}}\n[[File:Jeffrey DeMunn 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Jeffrey DeMunn]]]]\n\n'''Dale Horvath''', portrayed by [[Jeffrey DeMunn]],<ref>{{cite web |title=''The Green Mile''{{'}}s Jeffrey DeMunn Joins ''The Walking Dead'' |url=http://www.cbr.com/the-green-miles-jeffrey-demunn-joins-the-walking-dead/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009135804/http://www.cbr.com/the-green-miles-jeffrey-demunn-joins-the-walking-dead/ |archive-date=October 9, 2016}}</ref> is an older man and former [[automobile salesperson|car salesman]]. His age, calm affect, worldly experience, and RV provide the nucleus around which the small community of survivors has formed. He is wise, and the respected elder of the group. He is also rather feisty and not afraid to speak his mind or call others out for mistakes in judgment. Dale manages to talk Andrea out of a [[suicide]] attempt by putting himself at risk, as well.\n\nDale becomes wary of Shane, after witnessing that Shane contemplated assassinating Rick beforehand as well as guessing that Shane killed Otis while retrieving medical supplies for Carl.

Before the war against the Saviors, Carl hatches a daring plan to infiltrate the Sanctuary and kill Negan; however, they end up forming an interesting relationship as Negan tries his best to bond with the youngling. Negan is hugely impressed with Carl's determination, and frequently makes comparisons between Carl and Rick. Nonetheless, Negan never hesitates to endanger Carl's life, first by ordering Rick to [[amputation|amputate]] his arm; however, just as Rick is about to go through with it, Negan stops him, believing Rick to now be submissive.

Maggie by this time has made the Hilltop her home. She has become a widow, with Glenn being bludgeoned to death by Negan with his barbed wired baseball bat he calls \"Lucille\".

After one final betrayal by Gregory is one too many, Maggie decides to make an example of Gregory (and eliminate his trouble-making once and for all) by hanging him.

Over the course of the season, the characters slowly come to realize that Shane murdered Otis despite his lies which Shane eventually confesses to when directly confronted by Rick (\"[[18 Miles Out]]\").\n* '''Jimmy''', portrayed by [[James Allen McCune]], is Beth's seventeen-year-old boyfriend who resides at the Greene Family Farm. He is shown to be eager to have a gun and attempts to get one from Rick without Hershel's permission. He successfully rescues Rick and Carl from the barn when walkers overrun the farm, but is killed and devoured slowly when walkers overrun the RV (\"[[Beside the Dying Fire]]\").\n* '''Patricia''', portrayed by [[Jane McNeill]], is a middle-aged woman who resides at the Greene Family Farm along with her husband Otis. She has some limited medical skills, suggesting she was Hershel's veterinary technician, as she can administer I.V.'s, stitch superficial wounds, and prepare for surgeries, though not perform them herself. She is a quiet, but helpful individual, and shown to be greatly concerned with Otis' well-being. Patricia is deeply distraught over Otis' death. After his funeral, she befriends Lori and Carol, though she exhibits depressed behavior. She is killed by walkers while attempting to escape the farm (\"[[Beside the Dying Fire]]\").\n\n===The Living===\n'''The Living''', first appearing in \"[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]]\", is a hostile group of bandits and manipulators who are heavily armed with [[automatic firearm|automatic weaponry]]. Few members of the group appeared on screen, except for the scouting members that encountered Rick's group. They are the first antagonistic group encountered in the series and the only one with an unknown status.\n\n[[File:Michael Zegen (Mad Men).jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Michael Zegen]]]]\n\n* '''Randall Culver''', portrayed by [[Michael Zegen]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Patrick |first=Andy |title=Walking Dead's Michael Zegen Eulogizes [Spoiler] |url=http://tvline.com/2012/03/14/the-walking-dead-michael-zegen-season-2/ |work=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=March 14, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923022524/http://tvline.com/2012/03/14/the-walking-dead-michael-zegen-season-2/ |archive-date=September 23, 2016}}</ref> is a young member of Dave and Tony's group. He attended the same high school as Maggie and recently lost his mother (presumably when the outbreak broke out). When he impales his leg on a fence, Rick, Glenn, and Hershel rescue him, despite his having shot at them (\"[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]]\"). When they realize Randall's group may be dangerous, Rick and Shane disagree about whether to keep him alive or kill him though Randall claims to not be like the rest. At one point, the two men attempt to abandon him around twenty miles away only to learn that Randall knows Maggie and thus where the farm is, and they are then forced to work with Randall to escape. Though Rick later decides to execute Randall, the intervention of Carl and Dale Horvath's subsequent death change his mind. Shane ultimately brings Randall out into the woods and snaps his neck. Glenn and Daryl later discover Randall as a walker, and Glenn impales him through the head with a machete. Randall's reanimation without being bitten alongside Shane's brings to light the fact that everyone is infected and will turn no matter how they die.\n\n[[File:Michael Raymond-James 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Michael Raymond-James]]]]\n\n* '''Dave and Tony''', portrayed by [[Michael Raymond-James]] and Aaron Munoz,<ref>{{cite web |title='Walking Dead' casts two more |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-walking-dead/news/a362110/true-blood-michael-raymond-james-joins-the-walking-dead/ |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=January 25, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923080822/http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-walking-dead/news/a362110/true-blood-michael-raymond-james-joins-the-walking-dead/ |archive-date=September 23, 2016}}</ref> are from Pennsylvania and are with a group of thirty armed men. They encounter Rick, Hershel, and Glenn in a bar (\"[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]]\"). During a conversation, Dave mentions that Tony went \"to college\" for two years. Tony then walks over to a corner and urinates on the floor. After Rick refuses them safe harbor at the farm, Dave reaches for his handgun, giving away an ambush. After Rick kills Dave in self-defense, he spins around and shoots Tony in the right shoulder and stomach, before Tony can fire the gun he has raised. As Tony slumps against the wall, Rick kills him by shooting him in the head. Rick then takes Tony's gun and some shells from his pocket, while Glenn takes Dave's handgun. Rick, Hershel, and Glenn leave Dave and Tony's corpses in the bar when they flee the town.\n* '''Sean''', portrayed by Keedar Whittle, is a survivor from Dave and Tony's group. After the rest of Dave and Tony's gang had heard gunshots, they asked the survivors inside the bar if they have seen their friends (\"[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]]\"). Rick answers that they're both dead, which causes a shoot-out to erupt between the two groups. During the shootout, Hershel shoots him in the chest. He survives, After several minutes of moaning in agony and calling for help on the ground, Sean is ultimately devoured by the advancing Walkers attracted by the sounds of gunshots. Hershel attempted to save Sean by shooting the nearest walkers, but more arrived and ultimately overran him. The remains of Sean's reanimation is unknown.\n* '''Nate''', portrayed by Phillip DeVona, is a member of Dave and Tony's group who waits outside the bar in his car during the shootout. As walkers approach and Sean is killed, Nate drives off, leaving Randall behind. Nate's status is currently unknown.\n\n===The Prison===\n{{further|The Prisoners (The Walking Dead)}}\n\nFive inmates in the prison survived the outbreak, locked up in the [[prison commissary|canteen]] for ten months in the West Georgia Correctional Facility. Until released from the canteen by Rick's group, they were unaware of the walker plague that wiped out a large percentage of the population. Rick tells them they can live in a separate cell block. Although two of them ultimately join Rick's group, they all eventually die.\n\n* '''Andrew''', portrayed by [[Markice Moore]], is a character from the comics, and an inmate-survivor at the prison and Tomas' right-hand man. When Rick kills Tomas, Andrew attacks Rick, after which Andrew flees and ends up in a courtyard, surrounded by walkers, where Rick locks him in. However, in \"[[Killer Within]]\", Andrew is shown to have survived and attempts to sabotage the prison, which leads to the deaths of Lori and T-Dog. Andrew eventually gets into a confrontation with Rick, successfully disarming him. He then orders Oscar to shoot Rick, but Oscar instead shoots Andrew dead.\n\n[[File:Lew Temple 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Lew Temple]]]]\n\n* '''Axel''', portrayed by [[Lew Temple]],<ref>{{cite web |title='Walking Dead': Lew Temple talks about Axel shocker |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/02/17/walking-dead-lew-temple-axel |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118091338/http://www.ew.com/article/2013/02/17/walking-dead-lew-temple-axel |archive-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref> is a character from the comics, and an inmate-survivor at the prison who was jailed for armed robbery. He initially leads others to believe he was in for a narcotics conviction. He appears to be much kinder than his fellow inmates and tends to calm things down. After Tomas' attempt at killing Rick, he and Oscar are accused of collaborating with Tomas and Andrew to kill Rick and his group. After Rick's group dispatches with Tomas and Andrew, Rick's group holds Axel and Oscar at gunpoint. After Axel begs for mercy and pleads that he and Oscar were not in on Tomas' plan, Rick decides to spare him and Oscar and allow them to live in another cell block. Axel later pleads with Rick to let him and Oscar join Rick's group, but his request is denied. After helping the group clear out walkers that Andrew induced to invade the prison, Axel and Oscar are finally accepted into the group. Axel becomes close friends with Carol; as he amuses her with tales about his previous life, he is unexpectedly shot in the head by The Governor, in the opening volley of The Governor's attack on the prison. Carol uses Axel's body as a shield from the assault. In a later episode, Daryl tells Andrea that everybody liked Axel and that he was part of the group. Axel was the last surviving prison inmate.\n\n[[File:Theodus Crane 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Theodus Crane]]]]\n\n* '''Big Tiny''', portrayed by [[Theodus Crane]], is a large inmate-survivor at the prison. He is the muscle of the group, but appears to be gentler and more reasonable than some other group members (such as Tomas and Andrew). While clearing out the cell block, he disobeys Rick's admonition to stick together, and a walker scratches his shoulder blade. While trying to convince the others the scratch has no effect on him, Tomas unexpectedly and brutally smashes his head repeatedly with a blunt instrument, killing him, much to the others' horror.\n\n[[File:Vincent M. Ward.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Vincent M. Ward]]]]\n\n* '''Oscar''', portrayed by [[Vincent M. Ward]], is an inmate-survivor at the prison who is jailed for breaking and entering. He refuses to beg for his life after being accused of associating with Tomas and tells Rick he can shoot him and Axel if he wants. Rick spares Oscar and allows him and Axel to move to a separate cell block. After being denied entry into Rick's group, and before Andrew induces a walker invasion, Oscar decides to leave the prison. He gains Rick's trust after shooting Andrew, who was trying to kill Rick, and then giving Rick the gun. Oscar soon becomes a vital member of the group and demonstrates proficiency in killing walkers, as well as a fondness for bedroom slippers. During the rescue mission to save Glenn and Maggie, Oscar is shot and killed by a Woodbury soldier, while helping Maggie over the blockade wall.\n\n[[File:Nick Gomez.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Nick Gomez (actor)|Nick Gomez]]]]\n\n* '''Tomas''', portrayed by [[Nick Gomez (actor)|Nick Gomez]], is the leader of the five inmate-survivors at the prison and feared by the others. He is the only prisoner who appears to be violent and hostile towards the new group; he claims the prison belongs to him and orders Rick's group to leave. He and Rick eventually strike an agreement that Rick's group will help them clear another cell block to live in, in exchange for half of the pantry's stores of food. Tomas first proves he is untrustworthy when he later tries, unsuccessfully, to renege on that deal. While clearing out walkers, Tomas violently kills Big Tiny after Tiny is injured by a walker, and Tomas shows no remorse. Tomas then makes two attempts on Rick's life, forcing Rick to kill him.\n\n===Woodbury===\n'''Woodbury''', first appearing in \"[[Walk with Me (The Walking Dead)|Walk with Me]]\", is a town in Georgia of which a few streets have been walled off to keep the town operating. It is led by Philip Blake, who has adopted the nickname \"The Governor\" from the townspeople. Woodbury had a population of close to eighty people at the time of Andrea and Michonne's arrival, but due to various factors (such as the prison group's attack on the town and The Governor's slaughter of nearly his entire army), the population dwindles dramatically throughout the third season. Robert Kirkman later confirmed that any and all Woodbury characters, who were not brought to the prison are deceased. The remaining population of Woodbury at the prison community dwindles further throughout the fourth season as a result of the spreading of the flu. As of \"[[Inmates (The Walking Dead)|Inmates]]\", nearly every resident of Woodbury is confirmed to be deceased, as the bus is apparently overwhelmed and everyone on board becomes zombified (and later put down by Maggie, Bob, and Sasha). It has been confirmed that any other Woodbury resident (except Jeanette) not seen dying either on the bus or at the prison is deceased nonetheless. Thus, the entire population of Woodbury is confirmed to be dead.\n\n====Soldiers====\n* '''Crowley''', portrayed by Arthur Bridgers, is one of The Governor's enforcers. In \"[[Hounded (The Walking Dead)|Hounded]]\", after Michonne leaves Woodbury, Merle leads a team to track her down and kill her; however, and Michonne decapitates him. Merle then has Gargulio put Crowley down before he turns.\n* '''Gargulio''', portrayed by Dave Davis, is a new soldier to the Woodbury army, tasked with participating with Merle's posse to track down and kill Michonne after she leaves Woodbury. Merle forces Gargulio to shoot Crowley in the head, to prevent him from reanimating. Merle shoots Gargulio dead for disagreeing with Merle's plan to give up on finding Michonne, but to tell The Governor they killed her.\n* '''Haley''', portrayed by [[Alexa Nikolas]], is one of The Governor's enforcers tasked with protecting Woodbury's wall. She teaches Andrea how to use a bow and arrows, and tells Andrea she had to kill her father and brother when they turned. She gets angry when Andrea crosses the wall (breaking The Governor's rules) and at Andrea's delight in killing a \"biter\". Maggie shoots and kills Haley when Maggie and Rick storm Woodbury to save the Dixon brothers.\n\n[[File:Melissa Ponzio by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Melissa Ponzio]]]]\n\n* '''Karen''', portrayed by [[Melissa Ponzio]],<ref>{{cite web |title='The Walking Dead' Beefs Up Cast For Season 4 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/the-walking-dead-season-4-promotes-three-stars_n_3010590.html?ir=Entertainment |work=[[HuffPost]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=April 3, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323060005/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/the-walking-dead-season-4-promotes-three-stars_n_3010590.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment&ir=Entertainment |archive-date=March 23, 2016}}</ref> is one of The Governor's enforcers tasked with protecting Woodbury's wall. She is seen trying to leave Woodbury when conditions worsen, and she becomes angry when Noah is forced to join Woodbury's army. She is among The Governor's soldiers, who attack and fail to take over the prison. When the army rebels against returning to the prison, The Governor shoots all of them, except his top henchmen (Martinez and Shumpert), and Karen, who hides under a body and survives. She is found hiding in a truck by Rick, Daryl, and Michonne, and is among the Woodbury citizens, who are taken to the prison. In the beginning of the fourth season, she has started a relationship with Tyreese. When an influenza outbreak spreads throughout the prison, Karen begins to get sick and is [[quarantine]]d until she gets better. However, Carol kills Karen and burns her body in an attempt to keep the virus from spreading.\n\n[[File:Jose Pablo Cantillo 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Jose Pablo Cantillo]]]]\n\n* '''[[Caesar Martinez (The Walking Dead)|Caesar Martinez]]''', portrayed by [[Jose Pablo Cantillo]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive Interview: The Walking Dead's Jose Pablo Cantillo |url=https://undeadwalking.com/2015/07/02/exclusive-interview-the-walking-deads-jose-pablo-cantillo/ |publisher=Undead Walking |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=July 2, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009155424/https://undeadwalking.com/2015/07/02/exclusive-interview-the-walking-deads-jose-pablo-cantillo/ |archive-date=October 9, 2016}}</ref> is one of The Governor's enforcers. He becomes The Governor's most trusted enforcer after Merle defects. Martinez is a [[sharpshooter]] who favors a baseball bat. He is also shown wearing a baseball jersey bearing the number 23. In \"[[Arrow on the Doorpost]]\", he reveals to Daryl that walkers killed his wife and children when the outbreak began. Merle, who acts as Martinez's sparring partner in Woodbury's [[gladiator]]-style tournaments, refers to him both as \"Brownie\" and \"Bro\" in the same conversation because Merle was a redneck and junkie (\"[[Say the Word (The Walking Dead)|Say the Word]]\"). Martinez assists in all of The Governor's attacks against the prison, although he is shocked when The Governor massacres his own army (\"[[Welcome to the Tombs]]\"). Because Martinez and Shumpert<!--AMC documents this character's name: it is Shumpert (see the linked reference). \"Bowman\" is merely a descriptor. Do not disrespect the character by changing the name to Bowman.--> did not disobey him in that episode, The Governor spares them, and together, the three depart. In \"[[Live Bait (The Walking Dead)|Live Bait]]\", which reveals what occurred to the trio after The Governor slaughtered the Woodbury army, Martinez puts down a walker, who approaches The Governor and seems to have fallen into in an indifferent stupor. The next morning, The Governor awakens to find Martinez and Shumpert have abandoned him to fend for himself. Martinez and The Governor reunite when Martinez finds him in the pit trap. As revealed in \"[[Dead Weight (The Walking Dead)|Dead Weight]]\", Martinez has established himself as the leader of his group, with seconds-in-commands Pete and Mitch Dolgen. Martinez is comforted by The Governor's having apparently changed his ways (evidenced by his having started over with a new family). While playing [[golf]] with The Governor, Martinez reveals that Shumpert had died and admits to his worries about keeping the group safe. After Martinez proposes sharing leadership with him, The Governor strikes him down and feeds him to a pit of walkers.\n* '''Noah''', portrayed by Parker Wierling, is one of The Governor's enforcers. He is an adolescent who has severe [[asthma]]. The Governor enrolls Noah in his army despite his youth and infirmity. Karen and Andrea try to stop this from happening but fail. It is not made clear whether or not Noah is among The Governor's army that attacks the prison. In an interview with [[MTV]], [[Melissa Ponzio]] (Karen) confirmed that Noah is not Karen's son (as some viewers believed) and that The Governor killed him off-screen.{{citation needed |date=November 2013}}\n\n[[File:MCCC 15 - E Roger Mitchell (17905054050).jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[E. Roger Mitchell]]]]\n\n* '''Paul''', portrayed by [[E. Roger Mitchell]], is one of The Governor's enforcers tasked with protecting the wall. He tries to break out of Woodbury when conditions worsen. He is among The Governor's men, who attack the prison and retreat when Rick's group overwhelms them. The Governor shoots and kills Paul when Paul protests against returning to attack the prison.\n* '''Shumpert''' (also known as \"'''The Bowman'''\")<!--AMC documents this character's name: it is Shumpert (see the linked reference). \"Bowman\" is merely a descriptor. Do not disrespect the character by changing the name to Bowman.-->, portrayed by Travis Love, is one of The Governor's enforcers. Like Daryl, his weapon of choice is a crossbow (hence, some fans who do not know his name sometimes refer to Shumpert as \"'''The Bowman'''\" or \"'''Bowman'''\"), although (also like Daryl) he is a marksman. Shumpert participates in The Governor's attacks on the prison. When the second attack ends in failure and the army decides not to return to the prison, The Governor guns down the Woodbury soldiers, sparing only his allies Shumpert and Martinez, although the two are visibly stunned by the slaughter. The three then drive off together. Shumpert and Martinez make camp with The Governor, then abandon him and form a group of their own. When The Governor joins Martinez's Camp, Martinez discloses to him that Shumpert had become depressed and reckless following the massacre, and was bitten by a walker, forcing Martinez to put him down.\n* '''Tim''', portrayed by [[Lawrence Kao]], is one of The Governor's enforcers. Despite Tim's youth, The Governor had trained him to kill both the undead and living. He also rakes The Governor's lawn and referees Woodbury's gladiator tournament. In \"[[Hounded (The Walking Dead)|Hounded]]\", after Michonne leaves Woodbury, Merle leads a team to find her. However, she gets the drop on them and fatally stabs Tim in the chest. Merle later prevents Tim from becoming a walker by stabbing him in the brain.\n* '''Jody''', portrayed by Tanner Holland, is one of the Woodbury citizens, who participate in the attack on the prison, but are defeated. He however is not killed by The Governor in the shootout. Jody gets separated from everyone else and instead finds Carl, Hershel, Beth, and Judith. Carl shoots him dead after Jody moves towards them and tries to hand them his weapon after he was told to drop it.\n\n====Civilians====\n* '''Penny Blake''', portrayed by Kylie Szymanski, is The Governor's zombified daughter whom he has kept locked in a closet in his house. He feeds her fresh meat and tenderly grooms her. Michonne finds her in a cage and lets her out, but is shocked when pulling the bag off Penny's head reveals she is a walker. The Governor pleads with Michonne not to harm Penny, but Michonne kills her anyway, thus sending The Governor into a rage.\n* '''Eileen''', portrayed by Meaghan Caddy, is a Woodbury resident who is pregnant. She has her baby sometime before the events of \"[[Welcome to the Tombs]]\".\n* '''Mr. Jacobson''', portrayed by Randy Woods, is a Woodbury resident often seen around the town. Following the disbanding of Woodbury, he and the other remaining Woodbury residents are taken by Rick's group on a bus to the prison. About seven months afterwards, an [[influenza]] outbreak sweeps through the prison community, and Mr. Jacobson becomes infected. He loses his battle with the flu and is put down in private by Glenn after reanimating (so as to not dishearten the other sick community residents in quarantine).\n* '''Jeanette''', portrayed by Sherry Richards, is a newcomer to the prison community, who was brought there along with the other remaining residents of Woodbury. Carol brings her with the other sick residents of the community to Cell Block A to be quarantined. Jeanette insists that she is not sick and her allergies are only acting up, but Carol does not believe her, and makes her enter anyway. She is probably treated when Daryl's group returns with medicine. Jeanette is among the prison inhabitants, who escape the prison on the bus when The Governor attacks the compound. As of \"[[Too Far Gone (The Walking Dead)|Too Far Gone]]\", Jeanette is the only named Woodbury character, who is confirmed alive. Quite possibly, Jeanette died on the bus after the attack walkers. However, when Maggie, Sasha and Bob come across the bus, Jeanette is not seen as a walker or corpse.\n\n[[File:Dallas Roberts (44159186012).jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Dallas Roberts]]]]\n\n* '''[[Milton Mamet]]''', portrayed by [[Dallas Roberts]],<ref>{{cite web |title='Walking Dead' Postmortem: Dallas Roberts on Milton's Twisted Fate |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-season-three-finale-spoilers-milton-dallas-roberts-431877 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501193411/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-season-three-finale-spoilers-milton-dallas-roberts-431877 |archive-date=May 1, 2017}}</ref> is a scientist who serves as one of The Governor's right-hand men. He knew Philip Blake before Philip became \"The Governor\" and thus had a long-term relationship with him. Although Milton has allied himself with The Governor, he seems to disagree with The Governor's violent and unethical methods. He studies the decapitated bodies of Michonne's pair of walkers and researches the possibility of appealing to Michael Coleman's humanity, after Coleman dies and reanimates. Milton later helps Andrea escape to go try to make peace with Rick, and accompanies The Governor to a [[peace conference|peace meeting]] with Rick (\"[[Arrow on the Doorpost]]\"). He expresses misgivings about The Governor's methods when he learns The Governor plans to kill everyone at the prison except for Michonne. Milton later tells Andrea to escape and, it is implied, he burns the captured walkers The Governor planned to use against the prison group. The Governor realizes that Milton revealed his plan to Andrea, and this causes a rift in Milton and The Governor's relationship. When Milton challenges The Governor to give up the war and forego avenging Michonne's vanquishing of zombified Penny, The Governor restrains and badly beats Milton for his betrayal. He then tasks Milton to kill Andrea, but Milton instead attacks The Governor, who then stabs Milton, mortally wounding him. The Governor locks Milton in the torture chamber with Andrea, deciding to let the reanimated Milton eat her. However, Milton attempts to assist Andrea by planting a pair of pliers within her reach with which to free herself and stab the zombified Milton in the head. Andrea fails to free herself in time, and a zombified Milton bites her before she puts him down. Rick's group later finds his body with a bitten, but alive, Andrea.\n* '''Ms. McLeod''', portrayed by Lucie O'Ferrall, is an elderly Woodbury resident who is too arthritic to join The Governor's militia. She is seen getting off the bus at the prison and is not seen after \"[[Welcome to the Tombs]]\". A sick Ms. McLeod is seen running down the stairs in \"[[Infected (The Walking Dead)|Infected]]\" and later quarantined in [[death row]]. However, she gets killed when the sick people start to reanimate as walkers.\n* '''Rowan''', portrayed by Lindsay Abernathy, is a Woodbury resident who guides newcomers Andrea and Michonne around the town after they have recovered from being on the road, and she defends The Governor's enforcers when Andrea complains about seeing a walker \"strung up like a Christmas ornament\". Rowan is shown to have a sexual relationship with The Governor. She gets killed when Rick and Maggie attack Woodbury at the arena.\n\n[[File:Donzaleigh Abernathy speaker at Virginia Military Institute.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Donzaleigh Abernathy]]]]\n\n* '''Dr. Stevens''', portrayed by [[Donzaleigh Abernathy]], is Woodbury's physician. She cares for Andrea, Michonne, and Welles after The Governor has brought them in, for the Woodbury victims injured in the battle with Rick's group, and for The Governor after his fight with Michonne.\n\n===Prison Newcomers===\nAfter The Governor executes most of the able-bodied Woodbury residents, who had been members of his [[militia]], only the children and elderly townspeople remain at Woodbury (under the watchful eye of Tyreese and Sasha). After Andrea's suicide due to being bitten, Rick and his group return to the prison with the remaining Woodbury survivors (including Tyreese, Sasha, Eryn, Jeanette, Karen, and Ms. McLeod), swelling the prison's population from the original ten to around thirty. Six to seven months afterwards, numerous other survivors have joined the prison community, from various locations and backgrounds. Some of those people include Lizzie Samuels, Mika Samuels, and Ryan Samuels. The compound is initially peaceful and thriving until an [[influenza]] [[epidemic]] spreads throughout the community and infects numerous residents, killing many of those stricken. However, the issue is resolved after a scouting group returns with medicine. Shortly afterwards, The Governor returns with a new militia and executes the captive Hershel, igniting a firefight between the two groups. This battle leads to the fall of the prison community after The Governor tears down the fences. As a result of the flu and The Governor's assault, the numbers dwindle significantly. The escaping newcomers are found dead on the public transport bus for the prison, while five other newcomers remain alive. Lizzie and Mika are later killed, as well as Bob, and eventually Tyreese. Sasha is the last prison newcomer to hold out, but she eventually dies after taking a [[suicide pill]] given to her by Eugene. She eventually becomes a walker, and attacks Negan and his men. Afterwards, Sasha is put down by Maggie.\n\n* '''David''', portrayed by Brandon Carroll, is a newcomer to the prison community who Karen in \"[[Infected (The Walking Dead)|Infected]]\" says is from \"the Decatur group\". In \"[[30 Days Without an Accident]]\", he is seen alongside Karen, killing walkers behind the prison fence. In \"Infected\", David falls ill during the flu outbreak at the prison and is quarantined along with others (such as Karen) in Cell Block A. The next morning, Tyreese discovers that at some point David and Karen were killed by an unknown individual and their bodies dragged out to the courtyard and burned. It is later revealed that it was Carol, who killed them in order to prevent the disease from spreading further and to put them out of their misery. Tyreese later buries David and Karen next to one another.\n* '''Julio''', portrayed by Santiago Cirlio, is a newcomer to the prison community and a mechanic. He falls ill and is placed in quarantine in Cell Block A. Twice he observes the chaos in Cell Block A as Hershel attempts to deal with it. He attempts to escape the prison on the bus, but he is killed right behind Glenn and Maggie, when The Governor's militia attacks the prison.\n* '''Luke''', portrayed by Luke Donaldson, is a young resident of the prison community and seen attending Carol's storytime sessions (which are later revealed to be covert self-defense classes for the children). Daryl saves him from an advancing walker during the breach on Cell Block D. When The Governor attacks the prison, he escapes with the children and Tyreese. Beth and Daryl later discover bodies being eaten. They assume it is Luke and Molly's by seeing Luke's shoe next to the pile, though they could be alive.\n* '''Molly''', portrayed by Kennedy Brice, is a young survivor who joins the prison community. She attends Carol's storytime session, which is a covert lesson on self-defense for the children. Karen saves Molly during the walker breach in Cell Block D. When The Governor attacks the prison, Molly escapes with the children and Tyreese. Beth and Daryl later discover two bodies being devoured by a group of walkers, assuming it is Luke and Molly's by seeing Luke's shoe, though they could be alive.\n\n[[File:Vincent Martella 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Vincent Martella]]]]\n\n* '''Patrick''', portrayed by [[Vincent Martella]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Vincent Martella, aka Patrick from The Walking Dead |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/10/interview-with-vincent-martella-aka-patrick-from-t.html |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009152526/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/10/interview-with-vincent-martella-aka-patrick-from-t.html |archive-date=October 9, 2016}}</ref> is a new arrival in the prison community. He is around Carl's age and is one of his close friends. Patrick asks to be excused during Carol's storytime session, on the grounds that he is suddenly not feeling well. He dies abruptly later that night and reanimates. A reanimated Patrick bites a sleeping survivor in his cell, which causes the latter to reanimate and ultimately brings about a full-scale attack on Cell Block D. Daryl puts Patrick down once the attack subsides. Patrick is responsible for the deaths of several people before he is put down. Patrick is determined to have died from an aggressive strain of [[influenza]] which soon begins to befall the rest of the prison.\n\n[[File:Brighton Sharbino 2 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Brighton Sharbino]]]]\n\n* '''[[Lizzie and Mika Samuels|Lizzie Samuels]]''', portrayed by [[Brighton Sharbino]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview \u2013 Brighton Sharbino of The Walking Dead |url=http://crypticrock.com/interview-brighton-sharbino-of-the-walking-dead/ |publisher=CrypticRock |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009205827/http://crypticrock.com/interview-brighton-sharbino-of-the-walking-dead/ |archive-date=October 9, 2016}}</ref> is Ryan's daughter and Mika's sister. She was first seen with other children naming zombies, and later at storytime. During the outbreak her father is bitten, and before dying he asks Carol to look after his daughters. Lizzie expresses intentions to stab his corpse in the head to prevent renanimation, but is emotionally unable to. Carol later tells her she is weak and needs to toughen up. Lizzie later gets the flu and is forced into quarantine. Carol is disturbed by Lizzie's apparently personal connection with walkers. When some infected residents succumb to the virus and reanimate, Lizzie rescues Glenn from a walker by leading it away. After being treated with medicine, she plays with Glenn's blood.

She and Mika rescue Tyreese from two of The Governor's soldiers, after which she escapes with the children and Tyreese. Lizzie, Mika, Tyreese, and Judith get separated from Molly and Luke. Lizzie also is very sure Sasha is dead. She also shows a disliking towards Tyreese. After Lizzie kills Mika, Carol and Tyreese realize that she is too psychotic to be kept around & had to be executed in order for Judith to be safe, so Carol leads her out to the fields to look at the flowers, and as Lizzie tried to apologize for having threatened Carol and Tyreese, Carol executed her.\n\n[[File:Kyla Kenedy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Kyla Kenedy]]]]\n\n* '''[[Lizzie and Mika Samuels|Mika Samuels]]''', portrayed by [[Kyla Kenedy]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive Q&A with The Walking Dead Season 4's Kyla Kenedy - Daily Dead |url=http://dailydead.com/exclusive-qa-walking-dead-season-4s-kyla-kenedy/ |publisher=Daily Dead |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=February 3, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010065026/http://dailydead.com/exclusive-qa-walking-dead-season-4s-kyla-kenedy/ |archive-date=October 10, 2016}}</ref> is Ryan's daughter and Lizzie's sister.

The surviving Chamblers later set off with The Governor (who has said his name is \"Brian Hariot\") to seek shelter elsewhere following the death of David, but The Governor's actions lead to Lilly and Meghan's deaths.\n\n* '''David Chambler''', portrayed by [[Danny Vinson]], is Lilly and Tara's father and Meghan's grandfather. He and Meghan frequently play board games with each other so that Meghan can be preoccupied and distracted from the frightening world around her. David has stage-4 [[lung cancer]] and is rapidly approaching his moment of death. Knowing this, Lilly sends The Governor (\"Brian Heriot\") to a nearby assisted living facility to obtain oxygen tanks to help keep David alive for as long as possible, even if for just a few more hours. Early the next day, David succumbs to his cancer and dies. After he has lain lifeless in bed for several hours, his family and \"Brian\" enter his bedroom to say goodbye to him. David then suddenly reanimates and grabs Tara. He almost bites her, but \"Brian\" smashes David's head several times with one of his oxygen tanks, until he finally succumbs.

She is initially somewhat hostile towards The Governor (\"Brian Heriot\") and reluctantly allows him to take refuge in her family's building. She slowly comes to trust him, especially after he risks going to a walker-overrun assisted living facility to retrieve oxygen tanks for David, who is suffering from stage-4 lung cancer and will soon die (which she knows will be especially devastating to Meghan). When \"Brian\" kills the reanimated David, Lilly appears to be upset for a brief while, but soon comes to terms with what happened. After David's burial, the four of them depart in search of other shelter. They spend the night sleeping in a catering truck, and Lilly and \"Brian\" lay awake talking to each other. Slowly, they then begin to have sex. When the truck fails to start, the group abandons it and wanders on the road, until a swarm of walkers forces them to flee. They arrive at an open field, only to be stopped once again, when \"Brian\" and Meghan fall into a pitfall trap containing several walkers, all of which \"Brian\" kills before they can do any harm. Lilly and her family join Martinez's Camp. She is initially against The Governor's attacking the prison, but he assures her that she and Meghan will be safe. She and her daughter are left near a river; however, Meghan is bitten by a walker and dies. Lilly brings Meghan's corpse to the prison, where she witnesses The Governor decapitate Hershel and shoot Meghan in the head. After the battle ends, a bitter Lilly walks up to the dying Governor and shoots him in the head. Tara later mentions to Glenn that she witnessed Lilly become overwhelmed by walkers following the assault on the prison. She was eaten by walkers\n* '''Meghan Chambler''', portrayed by Meyrick Murphy, is the young daughter of Lilly, the niece of Tara, and the granddaughter of David. She frequently plays board games with David in order to escape what is happening around her. She and The Governor (\"Brian Heriot\") bond while playing [[chess]], and she asks about his eyepatch. (Albeit somewhat vaguely) \"Brian\" tells Meghan the story of how he had tried to protect Penny, but was ultimately unable to save her. The close bond between Meghan and \"Brian\" is briefly broken after \"Brian\" kills the undead David, who had died hours before of stage-4 lung cancer. She, Lilly, Tara, and \"Brian\" leave the apartment after David's burial, and Meghan continues to isolate herself from \"Brian\". However, her trust in him is regained after he saves her from a swarm of walkers that forces the group to flee. While running with Meghan in his arms, \"Brian\" falls into a pitfall trap full of walkers. \"Brian\" successfully kills all of them, while Meghan cowers in a corner, holding her doll, and \"Brian\" promises Meghan that he will never let anything happen to her. She is bitten by a walker in \"[[Too Far Gone (The Walking Dead)|Too Far Gone]]\" and dies, after which The Governor shoots her in the head.\n\n===Martinez's Camp===\n'''Martinez's Camp''', also known as the '''River Camp''', first appearing in \"[[Dead Weight (The Walking Dead)|Dead Weight]]\", is a campsite located within rural Georgia on an open field, containing over thirty survivors. It is led by Caesar Martinez until being briefly succeeded by Pete Dolgen and then by a brainwashed Governor, who causes their downfall. The group consists [[veteran]] [[soldier]]s, former members of the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]], and [[civilian]]s. Overall, they are a self-taught militia who try to survive at all costs. After The Governor secretly kills Caesar and Pete, he gives a speech to the majority of the camp survivors about the prison and its inhabitants, persuading them to force the prison community residents to give up the prison. However, all members (except Tara) of The Governor's newly formed militia are killed by the prison defenders and swarming walkers.\n\n[[File:Juliana Harkavy, 2017 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Juliana Harkavy]]]]\n\n* '''Alisha''', portrayed by [[Juliana Harkavy]], is a former [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] member who is recruited by Martinez's Camp sometime in the six- to seven-month timespan between seasons three and four. She strikes up a friendship with Tara, which quickly becomes a full-on romantic relationship. The two remain inseparable once they begin dating; Alisha even flees with Tara, her family, and The Governor after The Governor's insistence that he and the Chamblers leave the camp. However, after encountering a roadblock consisting of walkers stuck waist-deep in mud, The Governor returns the group to Martinez's Camp. Alisha participates in the attack on the prison (\"[[Too Far Gone (The Walking Dead)|Too Far Gone]]\"), but is later shot between the eyes by Lizzie Samuels. Her death, along with Lilly's and Meghan's, sends Tara into a state of depression for a long time.\n\n[[File:Kirk acevedo 2018 MCCC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Kirk Acevedo]]]]\n\n* '''Mitch Dolgen''', portrayed by [[Kirk Acevedo]], is a member of Martinez's Camp who with his brother Pete is second-in-command after Martinez. Mitch, like his brother, was in the army when the walker outbreak occurred; Mitch was a tank specialist, who said he left the army base in his tank. In \"[[Dead Weight (The Walking Dead)|Dead Weight]]\", while on a supply run with Pete and The Governor (then known as \"Brian Heriot\"), Mitch wants to raid another camp they encounter, but his brother disagrees. After \"Brian\" kills Martinez and Pete, he enters Mitch's trailer at gunpoint, advises that he killed Pete and explains why, and convinces Mitch to follow his lead which Mitch, though resentful of \"Brian\" killing his brother, sees his point and accepts. Mitch participates in \"Brian's\" attack on the prison (\"[[Too Far Gone (The Walking Dead)|Too Far Gone]]\"), operating a tank and destroying much of the prison. Daryl is able to reach the tank and drops a grenade down the barrel of the tank's main gun, forcing Mitch to escape before the grenade blows up the tank. Mitch turns around, exhausted and defeated, and Daryl shoots and kills him with his crossbow.\n\n[[File:Enver Gjokaj.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Enver Gjokaj]]]]\n\n* '''Pete Dolgen''', portrayed by [[Enver Gjokaj]], is Mitch's brother and a member of Martinez's Camp. After Martinez's death at the hands of The Governor (now known as \"Brian\"), Pete steps up as the group's [[de facto]] leader (which causes unrest amongst many members of the camp). While on a supply run with Mitch and \"Brian\", Pete thwarts Mitch's desire to raid a camp they encounter in the woods, as Pete is unwilling to rob the group and prefers to find supplies another way. Unwilling to follow a leader, who is unwilling to do whatever's necessary for the group to \"survive\", \"Brian\" murders Pete by stabbing him in Pete's trailer. He then dumps the body in the nearby lake. Brian later returns to find Pete's undead body submerged and anchored at the bottom of the lake.\n\n===The Claimers===\n'''The Claimers''', first appearing in \"[[Claimed]]\", is a dangerous group of heavily armed men who raid homes in order to search for supplies and weapons. Over time however, the group gradually descends into a sinister lifestyle where they eventually became a group of marauders. They begin to commit numerous horrific actions which include murdering innocent survivors, savagely raping several women, and sadistically hunting their victims.\n\n* '''Billy''', portrayed by Eric Mendenhall, is a member of the Claimers. He is killed by Daryl during their fight with Rick's group.\n* '''Dan''', portrayed by Keith Brooks, is a member of the Claimers whom, during the assault on Rick's group, grabs Carl with the intention of [[Rape|raping]] him. He is the last-surviving Claimer, and following the killing of the rest of the Claimers, he is stabbed to death by Rick in retribution for his attempted rape of Carl.\n* '''Harley''', portrayed by [[J. D. Evermore]], is a member of the Claimers who is shot dead by Michonne after the deaths of Joe and Tony.\n\n[[File:Jeff Kober 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Jeff Kober]]]]\n\n* '''Joe''', portrayed by [[Jeff Kober]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The Walking Dead Season 4: Jeff Kober Talks Joe's \"Very Special Death\" {{!}} Wetpaint, Inc. |url=http://www.wetpaint.com/jeff-kober-joe-special-death-826588/ |publisher=[[Wetpaint]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=May 8, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004182850/http://www.wetpaint.com/jeff-kober-joe-special-death-826588/ |archive-date=October 4, 2016}}</ref> is the leader of the Claimers, first seen by Rick on the porch of the house that they were raiding in \"[[Claimed]]\". He later appears in \"[[Alone (The Walking Dead)|Alone]]\", when his group finds Daryl exhausted on the road after he is separated from Beth. Despite a close encounter with Daryl punching Joe and almost shooting him, Joe is impressed by Daryl's use of a crossbow and decides to recruit him. Joe's group eventually catches Rick, Michonne and Carl, with the intent to avenge Lou's death. During the ensuing fight, Joe ignores Ricks request and joyfully informs him that he will personally kill him after Daryl is beaten to death, and Michonne and Carl are raped and killed which will put an end to their conflict. As Joe is laughing sadistically, Rick head-butts Joe causing him to shoot his gun in reflex (and missing). Rick then punches Joe in the face. Joe quickly counters Rick's punch and knocks Rick to the ground and proceeds to kick him while he is down. Joe grabs Rick and locks him tightly. Joe taunts Rick, Rick kills Joe by ripping his jugular out with his teeth. Joe's entire group are then killed by Rick, Daryl and Michonne seconds later after being distracted by Joe's death.\n* '''Len''', portrayed by Marcus Hester, first appears when the Claimers raid a large house where Rick is hiding. Rick is forced to hide under the bed he was sleeping on. Another member of the group, Tony, chooses to sleep on the bed, leaving Rick trapped. Len enters the room and wakes up Tony. He demands that he be given the bed, but when Tony refuses and says it is claimed, Len knocks him out of the bed and strangles him into unconsciousness before taking the bed for himself. After framing Daryl for stealing his half of a rabbit, leading the group to question his honesty, Len is severely beaten before being killed by an unspecified member of the group. His bloodied corpse, with an arrow in his forehead, is discovered outside by Daryl as they leave the warehouse they had spent the night in.\n* '''Lou''', portrayed by Scott Dale, is a slightly overweight member of the Claimers who is discovered in the bathroom by Rick after he escapes from hiding under the bed. In order to stay hidden and undetected by the other members of the group, Rick quickly fights Lou and ultimately begins strangling him to ensure his escape. Although Lou attempts to grab a pair of scissors on the nearby counter to stab Rick with, Rick continues to strangle him to death before escaping out the window. Shortly afterwards, Lou's reanimation provides a distraction for Joe and the other members as Rick escapes and regroups with Carl and Michonne, who were just outside the house. Lou's death is the primary reason that Joe and his group are actively pursuing Rick, tracking him along the train tracks to Terminus.\n* '''Tony''', portrayed by Davi Jay, is the member of the Claimers that is responsible for Rick becoming trapped, when he takes a nap on the bed that Rick is hiding under. When Len comes into the room and tries to take the bed, Tony says that it is claimed, prompting Len to knock him to the floor. While he is being strangled into unconsciousness, he sees Rick under the bed, but is unable to warn Len before he passes out. During the fight between Joe's group and Rick's group, Tony is shot dead by Michonne after being distracted by Rick killing Joe.\n\n===Terminus===\n'''Terminus''' is a sanctuary that is first mentioned in the second half of the fourth season over a radio broadcast heard by Daryl, Michonne, Tyreese, and Bob while driving in Zach's car. After the fall of the prison, the small factions of prison residents, who survive the assault find the signs directing survivors towards Terminus, and each group slowly begins to make its way there. The exact location of Terminus is finally revealed in \"[[Us (The Walking Dead)|Us]]\", where it appears to be a relatively vibrant, well-secured settlement, but in actuality hides a dark and brutal secret. It is later confirmed that Terminus is indeed a cannibalistic group, where they kill and then carve up any new arrivals that refuse to join them or prove to be a threat. After Terminus is destroyed by Carol's siege in \"[[No Sanctuary (The Walking Dead)|No Sanctuary]]\", only six residents survive and escape, becoming known as '''The Hunters'''.\n\n* '''Alex''', portrayed by [[Tate Ellington]], is the brother of Gareth and shows Rick's group around Terminus. He is held hostage after Rick becomes suspicious about the clothes the residents are wearing. Alex then tries to reason with Rick and the others to let him go, but is accidentally shot shortly after by Mary as she tried to kill Rick.\n\n[[File:Denise Crosby by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Denise Crosby]]]]\n\n* '''Mary''', portrayed by [[Denise Crosby]], is the mother of Gareth and Alex who greets Glenn, Maggie, Sasha, Bob, Tara, Abraham, Eugene and Rosita when they arrive at Terminus. After Carol attacks Terminus to rescue Rick's group, she encounters Mary. Carol holds Mary at gunpoint, demanding to know where the group is holding Rick and the others. Mary explains that Terminus originally was a sanctuary, but it became a place where they would lure people to take their possessions and ultimately, eat them. Carol shoots her in the leg and allows a group of walkers to devour the crippled Mary. In \"[[Coda (The Walking Dead)|Coda]]\", Gabriel discovers Mary's bible at the Hunters' campsite outside the elementary school, with the inscription \"Mary B\". on the first page.\n\n===The Hunters===\nAfter Carol destroys Terminus, Gareth and his people begin to hunt for Rick's group in order to take revenge, now known as '''The Hunters'''.\n\n* '''Albert''', portrayed by Benjamin Papac, is one of the Hunters who is killed in the church when he and Mike are immediately shot through the head.\n* '''Martin''', portrayed by [[Chris Coy]], is one of the few survivors of Terminus after it is destroyed by Carol's siege. He is first discovered by Carol and Tyreese while he is alone on a scouting mission, and they overhear him talking on the radio about the hostages that Terminus has just taken. When they realize that he has kidnapped Michonne and Carl, they take him hostage in a small, abandoned cabin. While Carol leaves to attack Terminus, Tyreese stays with Judith to watch over a restrained Martin. During his captivity, Martin continues to lecture Tyreese about how the idea of \"good vs. evil\" means nothing in this world, and that if people like Tyreese try to be nice, they will not survive. Later, as the cabin is overrun by walkers and Tyreese is keeping watch, Martin breaks free and grabs Judith, ordering Tyreese outside. However, Tyreese overpowers the walkers, breaks back inside, and knocks Martin unconscious, refusing to kill him. Martin then reappears with Gareth and 4 other Terminus survivors after they kidnap Bob, and then sneak into the church to kill the members of Rick's group. When Rick and the others ambush them, Martin is the last to drop his weapon after Gareth orders him to surrender. Martin is then stabbed to death by Sasha when Gareth and the others are slaughtered by Rick's group. Later, when Tyreese is dying of a walker bite, Martin is the first person to appear to Tyreese as a hallucination, where he mockingly tells Tyreese that he will die because he still tried to be a \"good guy\", and that many of the recent failures were because of his refusal to kill Martin.\n* '''Mike''', portrayed by Chris Burns, is one of the Hunters who is killed in the church when he and Albert are immediately shot through the head.\n* '''Theresa''', portrayed by April Billingsley, is one of the Hunters who is killed in their attempted siege on the church when Michonne bashes her skull in with the butt of her [[rifle]].\n* '''Greg''', portrayed by Travis Young, is one of the Hunters who is killed in the church when Abraham bludgeons him to death with the butt of his rifle.\n\n===Grady Memorial Hospital===\n'''[[Grady Memorial Hospital]]''', first appearing in \"[[Slabtown (The Walking Dead)|Slabtown]]\", is revealed to be the home of a sheltered group of survivors, who believe that military assistance will eventually come to them after a certain period of time. The hospital is run under a strict authoritarian regime by a group of corrupt police officers.\n\n* '''Dr. Steven Edwards''', portrayed by [[Erik Jensen (actor)|Erik Jensen]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Erik Jensen Talks The Walking Dead, the Conflicted Dr. Edwards, Geeking Out, and Guinea Pigs [EXCLUSIVE Interview] {{!}} TV Geek Talk |url=https://tvgeektalk.com/news/erik-jensen-talks-the-walking-dead-the-conflicted-dr-edwards-geeking-out-and-guinea-pigs-exclusive-interview/ |publisher=TV Geek Talk |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095331/https://tvgeektalk.com/news/erik-jensen-talks-the-walking-dead-the-conflicted-dr-edwards-geeking-out-and-guinea-pigs-exclusive-interview/ |archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> is the hospital's sole doctor who has a polite but nervous demeanor to him. He noticeably disapproves of the harsh methods by which Officers Lerner and Gorman run the hospital, but despite his objections, his position is valued by the officers as the only medical professional on hand. He initially cares for Beth as she recovers and does his best to protect her from the officers, saying that he refuses to leave because, as ruthless as the officers are, it is still better inside the hospital than out in the real world. However, Beth grows suspicious of him when he tells her to give the drug [[Clozapine]] to Gavin Trevitt, a patient, who is also a doctor, as the drug ends up killing him. Although Dr. Edwards insists that he actually said Clonazepam, Beth is certain that he told her the name of the wrong drug on purpose. She accuses him of having the other doctor poisoned in order to retain his valued status as the only doctor, which he denies. He later helps Beth save Carol's life by telling her which medication she will need to give Carol. After the deaths of Beth and Lerner, Edwards offers to let Rick's group stay at the hospital, but Rick refuses.\n* '''Officer Gorman''', portrayed by [[Cullen Moss]], is Officer Lerner's second-in-command and one of the officers who saved Beth. Although he appears to have a more polite demeanor during his initial introduction, Beth quickly discovers that his idea of being repaid for his services is sexual relations with the female patients, as he has already apparently [[rape]]d Joan. He makes similar advances towards Beth, finally catching her alone in Lerner's office where, unbeknownst to him, Joan has committed [[suicide]] and is about to turn. There, he finally begins to force himself on Beth, attempting to blackmail her with her attempt to steal a key from Lerner's office, and just as he moves in, Beth hits him in the back of the head with a glass bottle. When he falls to the floor, the reanimated Joan instantly crawls onto him and kills him by biting his neck while Beth escapes.\n\n[[File:Keisha Castle-Hughes at TIFF 2009 (headshot).jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Keisha Castle-Hughes]]]]\n\n* '''Joan''', portrayed by [[Keisha Castle-Hughes]], is female patient who attempts to escape the hospital, only to be bitten in the arm by a walker. When she is brought back inside by Officer Lerner, Lerner demands that Dr. Edwards save her by amputating her arm with a metal wire. Joan refuses to be rescued and demands that they let her die, but Lerner, with Beth's reluctant help, manages to restrain her long enough for Dr. Edwards to amputate the arm. Later, while Beth is cleaning Joan's room, Joan tells her more about the dark secrets behind the leadership of the hospital, including Officer Gorman's treatment of female patients. Later, as Beth breaks into Lerner's office to find the key to the elevator shaft, she discovers that Joan has also already broken in and committed [[suicide]] by reopening the amputation wound. Beth uses Joan's death to her advantage by allowing the reanimated Joan to kill Officer Gorman.\n\n[[File:Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez]]]]\n\n* '''Sgt. Bob Lamson''', portrayed by [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez]], is one of the two officers who is captured by Noah's trap, along with Officer Shepherd. He comes forward and tries to convince Rick and the group that he is the best one to talk to Officer Lerner when they make the hostage exchange, saying he has known her for eight years. Later, as they prepare to leave for the exchange, he reveals that his name is Bob, noticeably startling Sasha, who was left to watch him. While alone with her, he explains how he is alive because another officer was sent out to respond to a call that he should have taken, and that officer is now a walker in the parking lot. Sasha offers to put the walker down for him in order to alleviate his guilt, but just as she prepares to take the shot, Lamson knocks her unconscious and flees the building. However, he does not get far before Rick runs him down in a police car and shoots him in the head.\n* '''Officer Dawn Lerner''', portrayed by [[Christine Woods]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Meet the new 'Walking Dead' cop from hell, who claims she is a 'hero' |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/11/02/walking-dead-dawn-lerner-christine-woods |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918154311/http://www.ew.com/article/2014/11/02/walking-dead-dawn-lerner-christine-woods |archive-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref> is the strict leader of the hospital, enforcing the rules with her group of fellow officers (who are the only occupants of the hospital to possess weapons). She believes that everyone must contribute to \"the greater good\" and keep the hospital operation running long enough for the military to come save them, and often uses this mentality as a form of guilt in order to persuade those that they capture into doing work for the hospital once they recover. Though she is aware of Gorman's treatment of female patients, she does little to stop it. Lerner also treats the patients cruelly herself, repeatedly taking out her anger on Beth by striking her for the slightest mistakes or misunderstandings. Despite Beth's attempts to convince her that help will never come, Lerner refuses to believe it and insists that things will get better eventually, and it is far better to live under her rule than in the wilderness outside. Though she is furious at Beth for (as Lerner believes) killing Gorman and Joan as well as aiding Noah in his escape, she still refuses to kill or exile Beth, as she needs the extra help around the hospital. Though she tries to develop a bond with Beth, Beth is ultimately convinced that Lerner will never change, and her vision of a better future clouds her reasonable judgment. In the prisoner exchange at the end of \"[[Coda (The Walking Dead)|Coda]]\", when Beth stabs Lerner in the shoulder with a pair of scissors, Lerner reacts impulsively in a moment of shock and her gun discharges, firing a single bullet directly through Beth's head and killing her instantly. Although Lerner pleads for mercy, Daryl shoots her directly in the forehead immediately afterward.\n* '''Officer Licari''', portrayed by Christopher Matthew Cook, is one of the police officers working at the hospital under Officer Lerner.

He tells Beth that both he and his father were discovered by the group while the two of them were being surround by walkers, and their rescuers said that they could only save one of them. For this reason alone, Noah displays strong distaste for the officers almost immediately, saying that with their weapons and manpower, they likely could have saved his father as well. When Beth accidentally kills Dr. Gavin Trevitt by giving him the wrong medication, Noah takes the blame by saying that while he was cleaning, he knocked over a ventilation system and caused Trevitt to flatline. For this, Officers Dawn Lerner and Gorman take him out into the hall and beat him. Beth later apologizes, only for Noah to insist that he is fine and has been through worse. Nevertheless, Beth decides to form a plan for her and Noah to escape. They use the elevator shaft, which has served as a body disposal chute, and with a long chord of sheets tied together, they both make it down, although Noah loses his grip and falls, spraining one ankle. They both manage to make it outside, where Beth fends off several walkers with a handgun. Although Beth is stopped and restrained by the officers, Noah manages to make it to the outer gate and slips through, running off after he and Beth exchange a final glance.

In \"[[Coda (The Walking Dead)|Coda]]\", he stands up to Lerner and accuses her of cracking under the pressure of leadership, claiming that she is no longer fit to run the hospital. Although she pulls her gun on him, he manages to disarm her, and they fight in the hallway before Beth pushes him into the elevator shaft to his death.\n* '''Percy''', portrayed by Marc Gowan, is an elderly patient at the hospital.

Rick is a natural leader, someone his fellow survivors will turn to in a crisis, confident in his guidance, even when he at times doubts himself. His overwhelming need to do the right thing and protect those who can't protect themselves may pull him away from his family, causing cracks of tension within his marriage with Lori and his relationship with his son, Carl. Frustrated about leading his group and keeping them safe, Rick gradually changes into a darker person.\n\nEventually, he breaks down once again, following the deaths of Glenn and Abraham, and the overshadowing presence of Negan \u2014 the series' central antagonist in season six and seven. Throughout season seven, Rick slowly regains his footing and then starts preparing for an all-out war against Negan and the Saviors. However, before the war is over, Carl dies when a walker bites him with his last wish being for his father to find a way to forgive Negan and even join forces with him so that a large, strong community can live in peace, safe from walkers. Rick is then torn between his desire for revenge and his son's final wish for reconciliation. At the end of season eight, Rick manages to find a middle ground by almost, but not quite killing Negan and deciding to keep him locked inside a [[prison cell]] in Alexandria, thus ending the war.\n\nWhen Rick and the communities decide to build a bridge the following season, chaos erupts with the rebellious, remaining Saviors and conflict with members of Rick's group who believe Negan should die in retribution for brutally murdering Glenn and Abraham. In the midst of the conflict, Rick is critically wounded, the bridge is blown up, and Rick is presumed dead. However, unbeknownst to Michonne, Daryl, and the rest of the community, a nearly dead Rick is discovered by Jadis, who arranges him to be taken off in a helicopter with her to an unknown destination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick-grimes-will-return-series-tv-movies/ |title=\u2018Walking Dead': Andrew Lincoln and Rick Grimes Will Return in a Series of TV Movies |last=Owen |first=Phil |work=[[TheWrap]] |date=November 4, 2018 |accessdate=March 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/04/walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick-grimes-movies/ |title=Andrew Lincoln to return for The Walking Dead movies |last=Ross |first=Dalton |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 4, 2018 |accessdate=March 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shane Walsh===\n{{further|Shane Walsh (The Walking Dead)}}\n[[File:Crop of Jon Bernthal by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Jon Bernthal]]]]\n\n'''Shane Walsh''', portrayed by [[Jon Bernthal]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Emmys 2012: 'The Walking Dead's' Jon Bernthal on Killing Characters, Challenging Scenes and the Ending Nobody Saw |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/emmys-2012-walking-dead-jon-bernthal-338851 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012101854/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/emmys-2012-walking-dead-jon-bernthal-338851 |archive-date=October 12, 2016}}</ref> is a former sheriff's deputy from a small Georgia town. He was Rick's partner in the sheriff's department and his best friend since high school.\n\nAfter the walkers begin to take over, Shane goes to visit Rick in the hospital, where he has lain in a coma since being shot. He cannot save Rick (and he also welcomes this opportunity to take Rick's place with Lori and Carl), but he blocks the hospital door with a gurney and hopes Rick will die quietly of natural causes. Until Rick's recovery and reappearance, Shane led the group of Atlanta survivors and was Lori's lover. His fixation on Lori becomes very obsessive and deranged, though he tries to acclimate to the reality of Rick as leader of the group and Lori's rightful husband. Additionally, Shane shows a ruthless side, allowing Otis to be killed by walkers so that he can escape. Rick eventually confronts him for all his atrocities, but even so he forgives him. Later, Shane formulates a plan to kill Rick but fails. Rick ends his life with a [[knife]] in the chest and Carl then ends his reanimation.\n\n===Lori Grimes===\n{{further|Lori Grimes}}\n[[File:Sarah Wayne Callies Comic-Con 4, 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Sarah Wayne Callies]]]]\n\n'''Lori Grimes''', portrayed by [[Sarah Wayne Callies]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive: Sarah Wayne Callies Joins 'Walking Dead' |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2010/04/30/sarah-wayne-callies-lands-walking-dead-lead |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212120045/http://www.ew.com/article/2010/04/30/sarah-wayne-callies-lands-walking-dead-lead |archive-date=February 12, 2016}}</ref> is Rick's wife, and Carl and Judith's mother. In the first season, Lori believes that Rick has died in the hospital from a [[gunshot wound]], while the walkers are taking over, creating chaos and forcing Lori and Carl to run, under the protection of Shane. A few episodes later, they find out Rick is alive. When Rick reunites with Lori, this attracts the harassment of Shane who gradually becomes more and more hostile even when he knows that she is expecting a child of his. Eventually, Rick manages to learn about this event afterwards. From their escape from Hershel's farm to their endeavor to take up residence at a prison, Lori becomes increasingly estranged from Rick and Carl, which she blames on herself; she becomes worried about her baby's survival. In \"[[Killer Within]]\", when she goes into labor during an unexpected walker attack, Lori convinces Maggie to give her a [[Caesarean section|C-section]], despite the fact that it will prove fatal for her. Lori then dies giving birth and Carl is forced to shoot her to prevent reanimation; this breaks Rick into an emotional state.\n\n===Andrea===\n{{further|Andrea (The Walking Dead)}}\n[[File:Laurie Holden 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Laurie Holden]]]]\n\n'''Andrea''', portrayed by [[Laurie Holden]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Laurie Holden Interview THE WALKING DEAD |url=http://collider.com/laurie-holden-interview-the-walking-dead/ |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |date=December 1, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512145353/http://collider.com/laurie-holden-interview-the-walking-dead/ |archive-date=May 12, 2016}}</ref> is a former [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] [[lawyer|attorney]] who is extremely protective of her younger sister Amy. Following Amy's death, she considers [[suicide]], but decides to remain with the group.\n\nWith the others, they find a farm owned by Hershel Greene. At the farm, she continued to confide and seek comfort in Dale, and gains survivalist skills through Shane. After escaping Hershel's overrun farm, she is rescued by Michonne and is brought by Merle to Woodbury, where she begins a romantic relationship with The Governor.\n\nShe is eventually [[Crossfire#\"Caught in the crossfire\"|caught in the crossfire]] between Rick and The Governor, and attempts to mend relations, but later turns on The Governor after learning that he intends to attack the prison. Afterwards, Andrea leaves Woodbury and reaches the prison perimeter, but is secretly followed and tackled by The Governor, who then returns her to Woodbury. She is then locked in his [[torture chamber]], gagged and bound to a [[dental engine|dental chair]], with an undead Milton. However, before she is able to free herself, the reanimated Milton bites her. After the failed attempt to attack the prison by The Governor, a nearly dead Andrea is found by Rick, Daryl, Michonne, and Tyreese where she makes amends before taking her own life with Michonne by her side.\n\n===Dale Horvath===\n{{further|Dale Horvath}}\n[[File:Jeffrey DeMunn 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Jeffrey DeMunn]]]]\n\n'''Dale Horvath''', portrayed by [[Jeffrey DeMunn]],<ref>{{cite web |title=''The Green Mile''{{'}}s Jeffrey DeMunn Joins ''The Walking Dead'' |url=http://www.cbr.com/the-green-miles-jeffrey-demunn-joins-the-walking-dead/ |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009135804/http://www.cbr.com/the-green-miles-jeffrey-demunn-joins-the-walking-dead/ |archive-date=October 9, 2016}}</ref> is an older man and former [[automobile salesperson|car salesman]]. His age, calm affect, worldly experience, and RV provide the nucleus around which the small community of survivors has formed. He is wise, and the respected elder of the group. He is also rather feisty and not afraid to speak his mind or call others out for mistakes in judgment. Dale manages to talk Andrea out of a [[suicide]] attempt by putting himself at risk, as well.\n\nDale becomes wary of Shane, after witnessing that Shane contemplated assassinating Rick beforehand as well as guessing that Shane killed Otis while retrieving medical supplies for Carl.

Before the war against the Saviors, Carl hatches a daring plan to infiltrate the Sanctuary and kill Negan; however, they end up forming an interesting relationship as Negan tries his best to bond with the youngling. Negan is hugely impressed with Carl's determination, and frequently makes comparisons between Carl and Rick. Nonetheless, Negan never hesitates to endanger Carl's life, first by ordering Rick to [[amputation|amputate]] his arm; however, just as Rick is about to go through with it, Negan stops him, believing Rick to now be submissive.

Maggie by this time has made the Hilltop her home. She has become a widow, with Glenn being bludgeoned to death by Negan with his barbed wired baseball bat he calls \"Lucille\".

Over the course of the season, the characters slowly come to realize that Shane murdered Otis despite his lies which Shane eventually confesses to when directly confronted by Rick (\"[[18 Miles Out]]\").\n* '''Jimmy''', portrayed by [[James Allen McCune]], is Beth's seventeen-year-old boyfriend who resides at the Greene Family Farm. He is shown to be eager to have a gun and attempts to get one from Rick without Hershel's permission. He successfully rescues Rick and Carl from the barn when walkers overrun the farm, but is killed and devoured slowly when walkers overrun the RV (\"[[Beside the Dying Fire]]\").\n* '''Patricia''', portrayed by [[Jane McNeill]], is a middle-aged woman who resides at the Greene Family Farm along with her husband Otis. She has some limited medical skills, suggesting she was Hershel's veterinary technician, as she can administer I.V.'s, stitch superficial wounds, and prepare for surgeries, though not perform them herself. She is a quiet, but helpful individual, and shown to be greatly concerned with Otis' well-being. Patricia is deeply distraught over Otis' death. After his funeral, she befriends Lori and Carol, though she exhibits depressed behavior. She is killed by walkers while attempting to escape the farm (\"[[Beside the Dying Fire]]\").\n\n===The Living===\n'''The Living''', first appearing in \"[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]]\", is a hostile group of bandits and manipulators who are heavily armed with [[automatic firearm|automatic weaponry]]. Few members of the group appeared on screen, except for the scouting members that encountered Rick's group. They are the first antagonistic group encountered in the series and the only one with an unknown status.\n\n[[File:Michael Zegen (Mad Men).jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Michael Zegen]]]]\n\n* '''Randall Culver''', portrayed by [[Michael Zegen]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Patrick |first=Andy |title=Walking Dead's Michael Zegen Eulogizes [Spoiler] |url=http://tvline.com/2012/03/14/the-walking-dead-michael-zegen-season-2/ |work=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=March 14, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923022524/http://tvline.com/2012/03/14/the-walking-dead-michael-zegen-season-2/ |archive-date=September 23, 2016}}</ref> is a young member of Dave and Tony's group. He attended the same high school as Maggie and recently lost his mother (presumably when the outbreak broke out). When he impales his leg on a fence, Rick, Glenn, and Hershel rescue him, despite his having shot at them (\"[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]]\"). When they realize Randall's group may be dangerous, Rick and Shane disagree about whether to keep him alive or kill him though Randall claims to not be like the rest. At one point, the two men attempt to abandon him around twenty miles away only to learn that Randall knows Maggie and thus where the farm is, and they are then forced to work with Randall to escape. Though Rick later decides to execute Randall, the intervention of Carl and Dale Horvath's subsequent death change his mind. Shane ultimately brings Randall out into the woods and snaps his neck. Glenn and Daryl later discover Randall as a walker, and Glenn impales him through the head with a machete. Randall's reanimation without being bitten alongside Shane's brings to light the fact that everyone is infected and will turn no matter how they die.\n\n[[File:Michael Raymond-James 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Michael Raymond-James]]]]\n\n* '''Dave and Tony''', portrayed by [[Michael Raymond-James]] and Aaron Munoz,<ref>{{cite web |title='Walking Dead' casts two more |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-walking-dead/news/a362110/true-blood-michael-raymond-james-joins-the-walking-dead/ |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=January 25, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923080822/http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-walking-dead/news/a362110/true-blood-michael-raymond-james-joins-the-walking-dead/ |archive-date=September 23, 2016}}</ref> are from Pennsylvania and are with a group of thirty armed men. They encounter Rick, Hershel, and Glenn in a bar (\"[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]]\"). During a conversation, Dave mentions that Tony went \"to college\" for two years. Tony then walks over to a corner and urinates on the floor. After Rick refuses them safe harbor at the farm, Dave reaches for his handgun, giving away an ambush. After Rick kills Dave in self-defense, he spins around and shoots Tony in the right shoulder and stomach, before Tony can fire the gun he has raised. As Tony slumps against the wall, Rick kills him by shooting him in the head. Rick then takes Tony's gun and some shells from his pocket, while Glenn takes Dave's handgun. Rick, Hershel, and Glenn leave Dave and Tony's corpses in the bar when they flee the town.\n* '''Sean''', portrayed by Keedar Whittle, is a survivor from Dave and Tony's group. After the rest of Dave and Tony's gang had heard gunshots, they asked the survivors inside the bar if they have seen their friends (\"[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]]\"). Rick answers that they're both dead, which causes a shoot-out to erupt between the two groups. During the shootout, Hershel shoots him in the chest. He survives, After several minutes of moaning in agony and calling for help on the ground, Sean is ultimately devoured by the advancing Walkers attracted by the sounds of gunshots. Hershel attempted to save Sean by shooting the nearest walkers, but more arrived and ultimately overran him. The remains of Sean's reanimation is unknown.\n* '''Nate''', portrayed by Phillip DeVona, is a member of Dave and Tony's group who waits outside the bar in his car during the shootout. As walkers approach and Sean is killed, Nate drives off, leaving Randall behind. Nate's status is currently unknown.\n\n===The Prison===\n{{further|The Prisoners (The Walking Dead)}}\n\nFive inmates in the prison survived the outbreak, locked up in the [[prison commissary|canteen]] for ten months in the West Georgia Correctional Facility. Until released from the canteen by Rick's group, they were unaware of the walker plague that wiped out a large percentage of the population. Rick tells them they can live in a separate cell block. Although two of them ultimately join Rick's group, they all eventually die.\n\n* '''Andrew''', portrayed by [[Markice Moore]], is a character from the comics, and an inmate-survivor at the prison and Tomas' right-hand man. When Rick kills Tomas, Andrew attacks Rick, after which Andrew flees and ends up in a courtyard, surrounded by walkers, where Rick locks him in. However, in \"[[Killer Within]]\", Andrew is shown to have survived and attempts to sabotage the prison, which leads to the deaths of Lori and T-Dog. Andrew eventually gets into a confrontation with Rick, successfully disarming him. He then orders Oscar to shoot Rick, but Oscar instead shoots Andrew dead.\n\n[[File:Lew Temple 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Lew Temple]]]]\n\n* '''Axel''', portrayed by [[Lew Temple]],<ref>{{cite web |title='Walking Dead': Lew Temple talks about Axel shocker |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/02/17/walking-dead-lew-temple-axel |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118091338/http://www.ew.com/article/2013/02/17/walking-dead-lew-temple-axel |archive-date=November 18, 2016}}</ref> is a character from the comics, and an inmate-survivor at the prison who was jailed for armed robbery. He initially leads others to believe he was in for a narcotics conviction. He appears to be much kinder than his fellow inmates and tends to calm things down. After Tomas' attempt at killing Rick, he and Oscar are accused of collaborating with Tomas and Andrew to kill Rick and his group. After Rick's group dispatches with Tomas and Andrew, Rick's group holds Axel and Oscar at gunpoint. After Axel begs for mercy and pleads that he and Oscar were not in on Tomas' plan, Rick decides to spare him and Oscar and allow them to live in another cell block. Axel later pleads with Rick to let him and Oscar join Rick's group, but his request is denied. After helping the group clear out walkers that Andrew induced to invade the prison, Axel and Oscar are finally accepted into the group. Axel becomes close friends with Carol; as he amuses her with tales about his previous life, he is unexpectedly shot in the head by The Governor, in the opening volley of The Governor's attack on the prison. Carol uses Axel's body as a shield from the assault. In a later episode, Daryl tells Andrea that everybody liked Axel and that he was part of the group. Axel was the last surviving prison inmate.\n\n[[File:Theodus Crane 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Theodus Crane]]]]\n\n* '''Big Tiny''', portrayed by [[Theodus Crane]], is a large inmate-survivor at the prison. He is the muscle of the group, but appears to be gentler and more reasonable than some other group members (such as Tomas and Andrew). While clearing out the cell block, he disobeys Rick's admonition to stick together, and a walker scratches his shoulder blade. While trying to convince the others the scratch has no effect on him, Tomas unexpectedly and brutally smashes his head repeatedly with a blunt instrument, killing him, much to the others' horror.\n\n[[File:Vincent M. Ward.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Vincent M. Ward]]]]\n\n* '''Oscar''', portrayed by [[Vincent M. Ward]], is an inmate-survivor at the prison who is jailed for breaking and entering. He refuses to beg for his life after being accused of associating with Tomas and tells Rick he can shoot him and Axel if he wants. Rick spares Oscar and allows him and Axel to move to a separate cell block. After being denied entry into Rick's group, and before Andrew induces a walker invasion, Oscar decides to leave the prison. He gains Rick's trust after shooting Andrew, who was trying to kill Rick, and then giving Rick the gun. Oscar soon becomes a vital member of the group and demonstrates proficiency in killing walkers, as well as a fondness for bedroom slippers. During the rescue mission to save Glenn and Maggie, Oscar is shot and killed by a Woodbury soldier, while helping Maggie over the blockade wall.\n\n[[File:Nick Gomez.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Nick Gomez (actor)|Nick Gomez]]]]\n\n* '''Tomas''', portrayed by [[Nick Gomez (actor)|Nick Gomez]], is the leader of the five inmate-survivors at the prison and feared by the others. He is the only prisoner who appears to be violent and hostile towards the new group; he claims the prison belongs to him and orders Rick's group to leave. He and Rick eventually strike an agreement that Rick's group will help them clear another cell block to live in, in exchange for half of the pantry's stores of food. Tomas first proves he is untrustworthy when he later tries, unsuccessfully, to renege on that deal. While clearing out walkers, Tomas violently kills Big Tiny after Tiny is injured by a walker, and Tomas shows no remorse. Tomas then makes two attempts on Rick's life, forcing Rick to kill him.\n\n===Woodbury===\n'''Woodbury''', first appearing in \"[[Walk with Me (The Walking Dead)|Walk with Me]]\", is a town in Georgia of which a few streets have been walled off to keep the town operating. It is led by Philip Blake, who has adopted the nickname \"The Governor\" from the townspeople. Woodbury had a population of close to eighty people at the time of Andrea and Michonne's arrival, but due to various factors (such as the prison group's attack on the town and The Governor's slaughter of nearly his entire army), the population dwindles dramatically throughout the third season. Robert Kirkman later confirmed that any and all Woodbury characters, who were not brought to the prison are deceased. The remaining population of Woodbury at the prison community dwindles further throughout the fourth season as a result of the spreading of the flu. As of \"[[Inmates (The Walking Dead)|Inmates]]\", nearly every resident of Woodbury is confirmed to be deceased, as the bus is apparently overwhelmed and everyone on board becomes zombified (and later put down by Maggie, Bob, and Sasha). It has been confirmed that any other Woodbury resident (except Jeanette) not seen dying either on the bus or at the prison is deceased nonetheless. Thus, the entire population of Woodbury is confirmed to be dead.\n\n====Soldiers====\n* '''Crowley''', portrayed by Arthur Bridgers, is one of The Governor's enforcers. In \"[[Hounded (The Walking Dead)|Hounded]]\", after Michonne leaves Woodbury, Merle leads a team to track her down and kill her; however, and Michonne decapitates him. Merle then has Gargulio put Crowley down before he turns.\n* '''Gargulio''', portrayed by Dave Davis, is a new soldier to the Woodbury army, tasked with participating with Merle's posse to track down and kill Michonne after she leaves Woodbury. Merle forces Gargulio to shoot Crowley in the head, to prevent him from reanimating. Merle shoots Gargulio dead for disagreeing with Merle's plan to give up on finding Michonne, but to tell The Governor they killed her.\n* '''Haley''', portrayed by [[Alexa Nikolas]], is one of The Governor's enforcers tasked with protecting Woodbury's wall. She teaches Andrea how to use a bow and arrows, and tells Andrea she had to kill her father and brother when they turned. She gets angry when Andrea crosses the wall (breaking The Governor's rules) and at Andrea's delight in killing a \"biter\". Maggie shoots and kills Haley when Maggie and Rick storm Woodbury to save the Dixon brothers.\n\n[[File:Melissa Ponzio by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Melissa Ponzio]]]]\n\n* '''Karen''', portrayed by [[Melissa Ponzio]],<ref>{{cite web |title='The Walking Dead' Beefs Up Cast For Season 4 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/the-walking-dead-season-4-promotes-three-stars_n_3010590.html?ir=Entertainment |work=[[HuffPost]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=April 3, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323060005/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/the-walking-dead-season-4-promotes-three-stars_n_3010590.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment&ir=Entertainment |archive-date=March 23, 2016}}</ref> is one of The Governor's enforcers tasked with protecting Woodbury's wall. She is seen trying to leave Woodbury when conditions worsen, and she becomes angry when Noah is forced to join Woodbury's army. She is among The Governor's soldiers, who attack and fail to take over the prison. When the army rebels against returning to the prison, The Governor shoots all of them, except his top henchmen (Martinez and Shumpert), and Karen, who hides under a body and survives. She is found hiding in a truck by Rick, Daryl, and Michonne, and is among the Woodbury citizens, who are taken to the prison. In the beginning of the fourth season, she has started a relationship with Tyreese. When an influenza outbreak spreads throughout the prison, Karen begins to get sick and is [[quarantine]]d until she gets better. However, Carol kills Karen and burns her body in an attempt to keep the virus from spreading.\n\n[[File:Jose Pablo Cantillo 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Jose Pablo Cantillo]]]]\n\n* '''[[Caesar Martinez (The Walking Dead)|Caesar Martinez]]''', portrayed by [[Jose Pablo Cantillo]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive Interview: The Walking Dead's Jose Pablo Cantillo |url=https://undeadwalking.com/2015/07/02/exclusive-interview-the-walking-deads-jose-pablo-cantillo/ |publisher=Undead Walking |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=July 2, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009155424/https://undeadwalking.com/2015/07/02/exclusive-interview-the-walking-deads-jose-pablo-cantillo/ |archive-date=October 9, 2016}}</ref> is one of The Governor's enforcers. He becomes The Governor's most trusted enforcer after Merle defects. Martinez is a [[sharpshooter]] who favors a baseball bat. He is also shown wearing a baseball jersey bearing the number 23. In \"[[Arrow on the Doorpost]]\", he reveals to Daryl that walkers killed his wife and children when the outbreak began. Merle, who acts as Martinez's sparring partner in Woodbury's [[gladiator]]-style tournaments, refers to him both as \"Brownie\" and \"Bro\" in the same conversation because Merle was a redneck and junkie (\"[[Say the Word (The Walking Dead)|Say the Word]]\"). Martinez assists in all of The Governor's attacks against the prison, although he is shocked when The Governor massacres his own army (\"[[Welcome to the Tombs]]\"). Because Martinez and Shumpert<!--AMC documents this character's name: it is Shumpert (see the linked reference). \"Bowman\" is merely a descriptor. Do not disrespect the character by changing the name to Bowman.--> did not disobey him in that episode, The Governor spares them, and together, the three depart. In \"[[Live Bait (The Walking Dead)|Live Bait]]\", which reveals what occurred to the trio after The Governor slaughtered the Woodbury army, Martinez puts down a walker, who approaches The Governor and seems to have fallen into in an indifferent stupor. The next morning, The Governor awakens to find Martinez and Shumpert have abandoned him to fend for himself. Martinez and The Governor reunite when Martinez finds him in the pit trap. As revealed in \"[[Dead Weight (The Walking Dead)|Dead Weight]]\", Martinez has established himself as the leader of his group, with seconds-in-commands Pete and Mitch Dolgen. Martinez is comforted by The Governor's having apparently changed his ways (evidenced by his having started over with a new family). While playing [[golf]] with The Governor, Martinez reveals that Shumpert had died and admits to his worries about keeping the group safe. After Martinez proposes sharing leadership with him, The Governor strikes him down and feeds him to a pit of walkers.\n* '''Noah''', portrayed by Parker Wierling, is one of The Governor's enforcers. He is an adolescent who has severe [[asthma]]. The Governor enrolls Noah in his army despite his youth and infirmity. Karen and Andrea try to stop this from happening but fail. It is not made clear whether or not Noah is among The Governor's army that attacks the prison. In an interview with [[MTV]], [[Melissa Ponzio]] (Karen) confirmed that Noah is not Karen's son (as some viewers believed) and that The Governor killed him off-screen.{{citation needed |date=November 2013}}\n\n[[File:MCCC 15 - E Roger Mitchell (17905054050).jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[E. Roger Mitchell]]]]\n\n* '''Paul''', portrayed by [[E. Roger Mitchell]], is one of The Governor's enforcers tasked with protecting the wall. He tries to break out of Woodbury when conditions worsen. He is among The Governor's men, who attack the prison and retreat when Rick's group overwhelms them. The Governor shoots and kills Paul when Paul protests against returning to attack the prison.\n* '''Shumpert''' (also known as \"'''The Bowman'''\")<!--AMC documents this character's name: it is Shumpert (see the linked reference). \"Bowman\" is merely a descriptor. Do not disrespect the character by changing the name to Bowman.-->, portrayed by Travis Love, is one of The Governor's enforcers. Like Daryl, his weapon of choice is a crossbow (hence, some fans who do not know his name sometimes refer to Shumpert as \"'''The Bowman'''\" or \"'''Bowman'''\"), although (also like Daryl) he is a marksman. Shumpert participates in The Governor's attacks on the prison. When the second attack ends in failure and the army decides not to return to the prison, The Governor guns down the Woodbury soldiers, sparing only his allies Shumpert and Martinez, although the two are visibly stunned by the slaughter. The three then drive off together. Shumpert and Martinez make camp with The Governor, then abandon him and form a group of their own. When The Governor joins Martinez's Camp, Martinez discloses to him that Shumpert had become depressed and reckless following the massacre, and was bitten by a walker, forcing Martinez to put him down.\n* '''Tim''', portrayed by [[Lawrence Kao]], is one of The Governor's enforcers. Despite Tim's youth, The Governor had trained him to kill both the undead and living. He also rakes The Governor's lawn and referees Woodbury's gladiator tournament. In \"[[Hounded (The Walking Dead)|Hounded]]\", after Michonne leaves Woodbury, Merle leads a team to find her. However, she gets the drop on them and fatally stabs Tim in the chest. Merle later prevents Tim from becoming a walker by stabbing him in the brain.\n* '''Jody''', portrayed by Tanner Holland, is one of the Woodbury citizens, who participate in the attack on the prison, but are defeated. He however is not killed by The Governor in the shootout. Jody gets separated from everyone else and instead finds Carl, Hershel, Beth, and Judith. Carl shoots him dead after Jody moves towards them and tries to hand them his weapon after he was told to drop it.\n\n====Civilians====\n* '''Penny Blake''', portrayed by Kylie Szymanski, is The Governor's zombified daughter whom he has kept locked in a closet in his house. He feeds her fresh meat and tenderly grooms her. Michonne finds her in a cage and lets her out, but is shocked when pulling the bag off Penny's head reveals she is a walker. The Governor pleads with Michonne not to harm Penny, but Michonne kills her anyway, thus sending The Governor into a rage.\n* '''Eileen''', portrayed by Meaghan Caddy, is a Woodbury resident who is pregnant. She has her baby sometime before the events of \"[[Welcome to the Tombs]]\".\n* '''Mr. Jacobson''', portrayed by Randy Woods, is a Woodbury resident often seen around the town. Following the disbanding of Woodbury, he and the other remaining Woodbury residents are taken by Rick's group on a bus to the prison. About seven months afterwards, an [[influenza]] outbreak sweeps through the prison community, and Mr. Jacobson becomes infected. He loses his battle with the flu and is put down in private by Glenn after reanimating (so as to not dishearten the other sick community residents in quarantine).\n* '''Jeanette''', portrayed by Sherry Richards, is a newcomer to the prison community, who was brought there along with the other remaining residents of Woodbury. Carol brings her with the other sick residents of the community to Cell Block A to be quarantined. Jeanette insists that she is not sick and her allergies are only acting up, but Carol does not believe her, and makes her enter anyway. She is probably treated when Daryl's group returns with medicine. Jeanette is among the prison inhabitants, who escape the prison on the bus when The Governor attacks the compound. As of \"[[Too Far Gone (The Walking Dead)|Too Far Gone]]\", Jeanette is the only named Woodbury character, who is confirmed alive. Quite possibly, Jeanette died on the bus after the attack walkers. However, when Maggie, Sasha and Bob come across the bus, Jeanette is not seen as a walker or corpse.\n\n[[File:Dallas Roberts (44159186012).jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Dallas Roberts]]]]\n\n* '''[[Milton Mamet]]''', portrayed by [[Dallas Roberts]],<ref>{{cite web |title='Walking Dead' Postmortem: Dallas Roberts on Milton's Twisted Fate |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-season-three-finale-spoilers-milton-dallas-roberts-431877 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501193411/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-season-three-finale-spoilers-milton-dallas-roberts-431877 |archive-date=May 1, 2017}}</ref> is a scientist who serves as one of The Governor's right-hand men. He knew Philip Blake before Philip became \"The Governor\" and thus had a long-term relationship with him. Although Milton has allied himself with The Governor, he seems to disagree with The Governor's violent and unethical methods. He studies the decapitated bodies of Michonne's pair of walkers and researches the possibility of appealing to Michael Coleman's humanity, after Coleman dies and reanimates. Milton later helps Andrea escape to go try to make peace with Rick, and accompanies The Governor to a [[peace conference|peace meeting]] with Rick (\"[[Arrow on the Doorpost]]\"). He expresses misgivings about The Governor's methods when he learns The Governor plans to kill everyone at the prison except for Michonne. Milton later tells Andrea to escape and, it is implied, he burns the captured walkers The Governor planned to use against the prison group. The Governor realizes that Milton revealed his plan to Andrea, and this causes a rift in Milton and The Governor's relationship. When Milton challenges The Governor to give up the war and forego avenging Michonne's vanquishing of zombified Penny, The Governor restrains and badly beats Milton for his betrayal. He then tasks Milton to kill Andrea, but Milton instead attacks The Governor, who then stabs Milton, mortally wounding him. The Governor locks Milton in the torture chamber with Andrea, deciding to let the reanimated Milton eat her. However, Milton attempts to assist Andrea by planting a pair of pliers within her reach with which to free herself and stab the zombified Milton in the head. Andrea fails to free herself in time, and a zombified Milton bites her before she puts him down. Rick's group later finds his body with a bitten, but alive, Andrea.\n* '''Ms. McLeod''', portrayed by Lucie O'Ferrall, is an elderly Woodbury resident who is too arthritic to join The Governor's militia. She is seen getting off the bus at the prison and is not seen after \"[[Welcome to the Tombs]]\". A sick Ms. McLeod is seen running down the stairs in \"[[Infected (The Walking Dead)|Infected]]\" and later quarantined in [[death row]]. However, she gets killed when the sick people start to reanimate as walkers.\n* '''Rowan''', portrayed by Lindsay Abernathy, is a Woodbury resident who guides newcomers Andrea and Michonne around the town after they have recovered from being on the road, and she defends The Governor's enforcers when Andrea complains about seeing a walker \"strung up like a Christmas ornament\". Rowan is shown to have a sexual relationship with The Governor. She gets killed when Rick and Maggie attack Woodbury at the arena.\n\n[[File:Donzaleigh Abernathy speaker at Virginia Military Institute.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Donzaleigh Abernathy]]]]\n\n* '''Dr. Stevens''', portrayed by [[Donzaleigh Abernathy]], is Woodbury's physician. She cares for Andrea, Michonne, and Welles after The Governor has brought them in, for the Woodbury victims injured in the battle with Rick's group, and for The Governor after his fight with Michonne.\n\n===Prison Newcomers===\nAfter The Governor executes most of the able-bodied Woodbury residents, who had been members of his [[militia]], only the children and elderly townspeople remain at Woodbury (under the watchful eye of Tyreese and Sasha). After Andrea's suicide due to being bitten, Rick and his group return to the prison with the remaining Woodbury survivors (including Tyreese, Sasha, Eryn, Jeanette, Karen, and Ms. McLeod), swelling the prison's population from the original ten to around thirty. Six to seven months afterwards, numerous other survivors have joined the prison community, from various locations and backgrounds. Some of those people include Lizzie Samuels, Mika Samuels, and Ryan Samuels. The compound is initially peaceful and thriving until an [[influenza]] [[epidemic]] spreads throughout the community and infects numerous residents, killing many of those stricken. However, the issue is resolved after a scouting group returns with medicine. Shortly afterwards, The Governor returns with a new militia and executes the captive Hershel, igniting a firefight between the two groups. This battle leads to the fall of the prison community after The Governor tears down the fences. As a result of the flu and The Governor's assault, the numbers dwindle significantly. The escaping newcomers are found dead on the public transport bus for the prison, while five other newcomers remain alive. Lizzie and Mika are later killed, as well as Bob, and eventually Tyreese. Sasha is the last prison newcomer to hold out, but she eventually dies after taking a [[suicide pill]] given to her by Eugene. She eventually becomes a walker, and attacks Negan and his men. Afterwards, Sasha is put down by Maggie.\n\n* '''David''', portrayed by Brandon Carroll, is a newcomer to the prison community who Karen in \"[[Infected (The Walking Dead)|Infected]]\" says is from \"the Decatur group\". In \"[[30 Days Without an Accident]]\", he is seen alongside Karen, killing walkers behind the prison fence. In \"Infected\", David falls ill during the flu outbreak at the prison and is quarantined along with others (such as Karen) in Cell Block A. The next morning, Tyreese discovers that at some point David and Karen were killed by an unknown individual and their bodies dragged out to the courtyard and burned. It is later revealed that it was Carol, who killed them in order to prevent the disease from spreading further and to put them out of their misery. Tyreese later buries David and Karen next to one another.\n* '''Julio''', portrayed by Santiago Cirlio, is a newcomer to the prison community and a mechanic. He falls ill and is placed in quarantine in Cell Block A. Twice he observes the chaos in Cell Block A as Hershel attempts to deal with it. He attempts to escape the prison on the bus, but he is killed right behind Glenn and Maggie, when The Governor's militia attacks the prison.\n* '''Luke''', portrayed by Luke Donaldson, is a young resident of the prison community and seen attending Carol's storytime sessions (which are later revealed to be covert self-defense classes for the children). Daryl saves him from an advancing walker during the breach on Cell Block D. When The Governor attacks the prison, he escapes with the children and Tyreese. Beth and Daryl later discover bodies being eaten. They assume it is Luke and Molly's by seeing Luke's shoe next to the pile, though they could be alive.\n* '''Molly''', portrayed by Kennedy Brice, is a young survivor who joins the prison community. She attends Carol's storytime session, which is a covert lesson on self-defense for the children. Karen saves Molly during the walker breach in Cell Block D. When The Governor attacks the prison, Molly escapes with the children and Tyreese. Beth and Daryl later discover two bodies being devoured by a group of walkers, assuming it is Luke and Molly's by seeing Luke's shoe, though they could be alive.\n\n[[File:Vincent Martella 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Vincent Martella]]]]\n\n* '''Patrick''', portrayed by [[Vincent Martella]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Vincent Martella, aka Patrick from The Walking Dead |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/10/interview-with-vincent-martella-aka-patrick-from-t.html |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009152526/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/10/interview-with-vincent-martella-aka-patrick-from-t.html |archive-date=October 9, 2016}}</ref> is a new arrival in the prison community. He is around Carl's age and is one of his close friends. Patrick asks to be excused during Carol's storytime session, on the grounds that he is suddenly not feeling well. He dies abruptly later that night and reanimates. A reanimated Patrick bites a sleeping survivor in his cell, which causes the latter to reanimate and ultimately brings about a full-scale attack on Cell Block D. Daryl puts Patrick down once the attack subsides. Patrick is responsible for the deaths of several people before he is put down. Patrick is determined to have died from an aggressive strain of [[influenza]] which soon begins to befall the rest of the prison.\n\n[[File:Brighton Sharbino 2 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Brighton Sharbino]]]]\n\n* '''[[Lizzie and Mika Samuels|Lizzie Samuels]]''', portrayed by [[Brighton Sharbino]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview \u2013 Brighton Sharbino of The Walking Dead |url=http://crypticrock.com/interview-brighton-sharbino-of-the-walking-dead/ |publisher=CrypticRock |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009205827/http://crypticrock.com/interview-brighton-sharbino-of-the-walking-dead/ |archive-date=October 9, 2016}}</ref> is Ryan's daughter and Mika's sister. She was first seen with other children naming zombies, and later at storytime. During the outbreak her father is bitten, and before dying he asks Carol to look after his daughters. Lizzie expresses intentions to stab his corpse in the head to prevent renanimation, but is emotionally unable to. Carol later tells her she is weak and needs to toughen up. Lizzie later gets the flu and is forced into quarantine. Carol is disturbed by Lizzie's apparently personal connection with walkers. When some infected residents succumb to the virus and reanimate, Lizzie rescues Glenn from a walker by leading it away. After being treated with medicine, she plays with Glenn's blood.

She and Mika rescue Tyreese from two of The Governor's soldiers, after which she escapes with the children and Tyreese. Lizzie, Mika, Tyreese, and Judith get separated from Molly and Luke. Lizzie also is very sure Sasha is dead. She also shows a disliking towards Tyreese. After Lizzie kills Mika, Carol and Tyreese realize that she is too psychotic to be kept around & had to be executed in order for Judith to be safe, so Carol leads her out to the fields to look at the flowers, and as Lizzie tried to apologize for having threatened Carol and Tyreese, Carol executed her.\n\n[[File:Kyla Kenedy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Kyla Kenedy]]]]\n\n* '''[[Lizzie and Mika Samuels|Mika Samuels]]''', portrayed by [[Kyla Kenedy]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive Q&A with The Walking Dead Season 4's Kyla Kenedy - Daily Dead |url=http://dailydead.com/exclusive-qa-walking-dead-season-4s-kyla-kenedy/ |publisher=Daily Dead |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=February 3, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010065026/http://dailydead.com/exclusive-qa-walking-dead-season-4s-kyla-kenedy/ |archive-date=October 10, 2016}}</ref> is Ryan's daughter and Lizzie's sister.

The surviving Chamblers later set off with The Governor (who has said his name is \"Brian Hariot\") to seek shelter elsewhere following the death of David, but The Governor's actions lead to Lilly and Meghan's deaths.\n\n* '''David Chambler''', portrayed by [[Danny Vinson]], is Lilly and Tara's father and Meghan's grandfather. He and Meghan frequently play board games with each other so that Meghan can be preoccupied and distracted from the frightening world around her. David has stage-4 [[lung cancer]] and is rapidly approaching his moment of death. Knowing this, Lilly sends The Governor (\"Brian Heriot\") to a nearby assisted living facility to obtain oxygen tanks to help keep David alive for as long as possible, even if for just a few more hours. Early the next day, David succumbs to his cancer and dies. After he has lain lifeless in bed for several hours, his family and \"Brian\" enter his bedroom to say goodbye to him. David then suddenly reanimates and grabs Tara. He almost bites her, but \"Brian\" smashes David's head several times with one of his oxygen tanks, until he finally succumbs.

She is initially somewhat hostile towards The Governor (\"Brian Heriot\") and reluctantly allows him to take refuge in her family's building. She slowly comes to trust him, especially after he risks going to a walker-overrun assisted living facility to retrieve oxygen tanks for David, who is suffering from stage-4 lung cancer and will soon die (which she knows will be especially devastating to Meghan). When \"Brian\" kills the reanimated David, Lilly appears to be upset for a brief while, but soon comes to terms with what happened. After David's burial, the four of them depart in search of other shelter. They spend the night sleeping in a catering truck, and Lilly and \"Brian\" lay awake talking to each other. Slowly, they then begin to have sex. When the truck fails to start, the group abandons it and wanders on the road, until a swarm of walkers forces them to flee. They arrive at an open field, only to be stopped once again, when \"Brian\" and Meghan fall into a pitfall trap containing several walkers, all of which \"Brian\" kills before they can do any harm. Lilly and her family join Martinez's Camp. She is initially against The Governor's attacking the prison, but he assures her that she and Meghan will be safe. She and her daughter are left near a river; however, Meghan is bitten by a walker and dies. Lilly brings Meghan's corpse to the prison, where she witnesses The Governor decapitate Hershel and shoot Meghan in the head. After the battle ends, a bitter Lilly walks up to the dying Governor and shoots him in the head. Tara later mentions to Glenn that she witnessed Lilly become overwhelmed by walkers following the assault on the prison. She was eaten by walkers\n* '''Meghan Chambler''', portrayed by Meyrick Murphy, is the young daughter of Lilly, the niece of Tara, and the granddaughter of David. She frequently plays board games with David in order to escape what is happening around her. She and The Governor (\"Brian Heriot\") bond while playing [[chess]], and she asks about his eyepatch. (Albeit somewhat vaguely) \"Brian\" tells Meghan the story of how he had tried to protect Penny, but was ultimately unable to save her. The close bond between Meghan and \"Brian\" is briefly broken after \"Brian\" kills the undead David, who had died hours before of stage-4 lung cancer. She, Lilly, Tara, and \"Brian\" leave the apartment after David's burial, and Meghan continues to isolate herself from \"Brian\". However, her trust in him is regained after he saves her from a swarm of walkers that forces the group to flee. While running with Meghan in his arms, \"Brian\" falls into a pitfall trap full of walkers. \"Brian\" successfully kills all of them, while Meghan cowers in a corner, holding her doll, and \"Brian\" promises Meghan that he will never let anything happen to her. She is bitten by a walker in \"[[Too Far Gone (The Walking Dead)|Too Far Gone]]\" and dies, after which The Governor shoots her in the head.\n\n===Martinez's Camp===\n'''Martinez's Camp''', also known as the '''River Camp''', first appearing in \"[[Dead Weight (The Walking Dead)|Dead Weight]]\", is a campsite located within rural Georgia on an open field, containing over thirty survivors. It is led by Caesar Martinez until being briefly succeeded by Pete Dolgen and then by a brainwashed Governor, who causes their downfall. The group consists [[veteran]] [[soldier]]s, former members of the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]], and [[civilian]]s. Overall, they are a self-taught militia who try to survive at all costs. After The Governor secretly kills Caesar and Pete, he gives a speech to the majority of the camp survivors about the prison and its inhabitants, persuading them to force the prison community residents to give up the prison. However, all members (except Tara) of The Governor's newly formed militia are killed by the prison defenders and swarming walkers.\n\n[[File:Juliana Harkavy, 2017 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Juliana Harkavy]]]]\n\n* '''Alisha''', portrayed by [[Juliana Harkavy]], is a former [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] member who is recruited by Martinez's Camp sometime in the six- to seven-month timespan between seasons three and four. She strikes up a friendship with Tara, which quickly becomes a full-on romantic relationship. The two remain inseparable once they begin dating; Alisha even flees with Tara, her family, and The Governor after The Governor's insistence that he and the Chamblers leave the camp. However, after encountering a roadblock consisting of walkers stuck waist-deep in mud, The Governor returns the group to Martinez's Camp. Alisha participates in the attack on the prison (\"[[Too Far Gone (The Walking Dead)|Too Far Gone]]\"), but is later shot between the eyes by Lizzie Samuels. Her death, along with Lilly's and Meghan's, sends Tara into a state of depression for a long time.\n\n[[File:Kirk acevedo 2018 MCCC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Kirk Acevedo]]]]\n\n* '''Mitch Dolgen''', portrayed by [[Kirk Acevedo]], is a member of Martinez's Camp who with his brother Pete is second-in-command after Martinez. Mitch, like his brother, was in the army when the walker outbreak occurred; Mitch was a tank specialist, who said he left the army base in his tank. In \"[[Dead Weight (The Walking Dead)|Dead Weight]]\", while on a supply run with Pete and The Governor (then known as \"Brian Heriot\"), Mitch wants to raid another camp they encounter, but his brother disagrees. After \"Brian\" kills Martinez and Pete, he enters Mitch's trailer at gunpoint, advises that he killed Pete and explains why, and convinces Mitch to follow his lead which Mitch, though resentful of \"Brian\" killing his brother, sees his point and accepts. Mitch participates in \"Brian's\" attack on the prison (\"[[Too Far Gone (The Walking Dead)|Too Far Gone]]\"), operating a tank and destroying much of the prison. Daryl is able to reach the tank and drops a grenade down the barrel of the tank's main gun, forcing Mitch to escape before the grenade blows up the tank. Mitch turns around, exhausted and defeated, and Daryl shoots and kills him with his crossbow.\n\n[[File:Enver Gjokaj.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Enver Gjokaj]]]]\n\n* '''Pete Dolgen''', portrayed by [[Enver Gjokaj]], is Mitch's brother and a member of Martinez's Camp. After Martinez's death at the hands of The Governor (now known as \"Brian\"), Pete steps up as the group's [[de facto]] leader (which causes unrest amongst many members of the camp). While on a supply run with Mitch and \"Brian\", Pete thwarts Mitch's desire to raid a camp they encounter in the woods, as Pete is unwilling to rob the group and prefers to find supplies another way. Unwilling to follow a leader, who is unwilling to do whatever's necessary for the group to \"survive\", \"Brian\" murders Pete by stabbing him in Pete's trailer. He then dumps the body in the nearby lake. Brian later returns to find Pete's undead body submerged and anchored at the bottom of the lake.\n\n===The Claimers===\n'''The Claimers''', first appearing in \"[[Claimed]]\", is a dangerous group of heavily armed men who raid homes in order to search for supplies and weapons. Over time however, the group gradually descends into a sinister lifestyle where they eventually became a group of marauders. They begin to commit numerous horrific actions which include murdering innocent survivors, savagely raping several women, and sadistically hunting their victims.\n\n* '''Billy''', portrayed by Eric Mendenhall, is a member of the Claimers. He is killed by Daryl during their fight with Rick's group.\n* '''Dan''', portrayed by Keith Brooks, is a member of the Claimers whom, during the assault on Rick's group, grabs Carl with the intention of [[Rape|raping]] him. He is the last-surviving Claimer, and following the killing of the rest of the Claimers, he is stabbed to death by Rick in retribution for his attempted rape of Carl.\n* '''Harley''', portrayed by [[J. D. Evermore]], is a member of the Claimers who is shot dead by Michonne after the deaths of Joe and Tony.\n\n[[File:Jeff Kober 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Jeff Kober]]]]\n\n* '''Joe''', portrayed by [[Jeff Kober]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The Walking Dead Season 4: Jeff Kober Talks Joe's \"Very Special Death\" {{!}} Wetpaint, Inc. |url=http://www.wetpaint.com/jeff-kober-joe-special-death-826588/ |publisher=[[Wetpaint]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |date=May 8, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004182850/http://www.wetpaint.com/jeff-kober-joe-special-death-826588/ |archive-date=October 4, 2016}}</ref> is the leader of the Claimers, first seen by Rick on the porch of the house that they were raiding in \"[[Claimed]]\". He later appears in \"[[Alone (The Walking Dead)|Alone]]\", when his group finds Daryl exhausted on the road after he is separated from Beth. Despite a close encounter with Daryl punching Joe and almost shooting him, Joe is impressed by Daryl's use of a crossbow and decides to recruit him. Joe's group eventually catches Rick, Michonne and Carl, with the intent to avenge Lou's death. During the ensuing fight, Joe ignores Ricks request and joyfully informs him that he will personally kill him after Daryl is beaten to death, and Michonne and Carl are raped and killed which will put an end to their conflict. As Joe is laughing sadistically, Rick head-butts Joe causing him to shoot his gun in reflex (and missing). Rick then punches Joe in the face. Joe quickly counters Rick's punch and knocks Rick to the ground and proceeds to kick him while he is down. Joe grabs Rick and locks him tightly. Joe taunts Rick, Rick kills Joe by ripping his jugular out with his teeth. Joe's entire group are then killed by Rick, Daryl and Michonne seconds later after being distracted by Joe's death.\n* '''Len''', portrayed by Marcus Hester, first appears when the Claimers raid a large house where Rick is hiding. Rick is forced to hide under the bed he was sleeping on. Another member of the group, Tony, chooses to sleep on the bed, leaving Rick trapped. Len enters the room and wakes up Tony. He demands that he be given the bed, but when Tony refuses and says it is claimed, Len knocks him out of the bed and strangles him into unconsciousness before taking the bed for himself. After framing Daryl for stealing his half of a rabbit, leading the group to question his honesty, Len is severely beaten before being killed by an unspecified member of the group. His bloodied corpse, with an arrow in his forehead, is discovered outside by Daryl as they leave the warehouse they had spent the night in.\n* '''Lou''', portrayed by Scott Dale, is a slightly overweight member of the Claimers who is discovered in the bathroom by Rick after he escapes from hiding under the bed. In order to stay hidden and undetected by the other members of the group, Rick quickly fights Lou and ultimately begins strangling him to ensure his escape. Although Lou attempts to grab a pair of scissors on the nearby counter to stab Rick with, Rick continues to strangle him to death before escaping out the window. Shortly afterwards, Lou's reanimation provides a distraction for Joe and the other members as Rick escapes and regroups with Carl and Michonne, who were just outside the house. Lou's death is the primary reason that Joe and his group are actively pursuing Rick, tracking him along the train tracks to Terminus.\n* '''Tony''', portrayed by Davi Jay, is the member of the Claimers that is responsible for Rick becoming trapped, when he takes a nap on the bed that Rick is hiding under. When Len comes into the room and tries to take the bed, Tony says that it is claimed, prompting Len to knock him to the floor. While he is being strangled into unconsciousness, he sees Rick under the bed, but is unable to warn Len before he passes out. During the fight between Joe's group and Rick's group, Tony is shot dead by Michonne after being distracted by Rick killing Joe.\n\n===Terminus===\n'''Terminus''' is a sanctuary that is first mentioned in the second half of the fourth season over a radio broadcast heard by Daryl, Michonne, Tyreese, and Bob while driving in Zach's car. After the fall of the prison, the small factions of prison residents, who survive the assault find the signs directing survivors towards Terminus, and each group slowly begins to make its way there. The exact location of Terminus is finally revealed in \"[[Us (The Walking Dead)|Us]]\", where it appears to be a relatively vibrant, well-secured settlement, but in actuality hides a dark and brutal secret. It is later confirmed that Terminus is indeed a cannibalistic group, where they kill and then carve up any new arrivals that refuse to join them or prove to be a threat. After Terminus is destroyed by Carol's siege in \"[[No Sanctuary (The Walking Dead)|No Sanctuary]]\", only six residents survive and escape, becoming known as '''The Hunters'''.\n\n* '''Alex''', portrayed by [[Tate Ellington]], is the brother of Gareth and shows Rick's group around Terminus. He is held hostage after Rick becomes suspicious about the clothes the residents are wearing. Alex then tries to reason with Rick and the others to let him go, but is accidentally shot shortly after by Mary as she tried to kill Rick.\n\n[[File:Denise Crosby by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Denise Crosby]]]]\n\n* '''Mary''', portrayed by [[Denise Crosby]], is the mother of Gareth and Alex who greets Glenn, Maggie, Sasha, Bob, Tara, Abraham, Eugene and Rosita when they arrive at Terminus. After Carol attacks Terminus to rescue Rick's group, she encounters Mary. Carol holds Mary at gunpoint, demanding to know where the group is holding Rick and the others. Mary explains that Terminus originally was a sanctuary, but it became a place where they would lure people to take their possessions and ultimately, eat them. Carol shoots her in the leg and allows a group of walkers to devour the crippled Mary. In \"[[Coda (The Walking Dead)|Coda]]\", Gabriel discovers Mary's bible at the Hunters' campsite outside the elementary school, with the inscription \"Mary B\". on the first page.\n\n===The Hunters===\nAfter Carol destroys Terminus, Gareth and his people begin to hunt for Rick's group in order to take revenge, now known as '''The Hunters'''.\n\n* '''Albert''', portrayed by Benjamin Papac, is one of the Hunters who is killed in the church when he and Mike are immediately shot through the head.\n* '''Martin''', portrayed by [[Chris Coy]], is one of the few survivors of Terminus after it is destroyed by Carol's siege. He is first discovered by Carol and Tyreese while he is alone on a scouting mission, and they overhear him talking on the radio about the hostages that Terminus has just taken. When they realize that he has kidnapped Michonne and Carl, they take him hostage in a small, abandoned cabin. While Carol leaves to attack Terminus, Tyreese stays with Judith to watch over a restrained Martin. During his captivity, Martin continues to lecture Tyreese about how the idea of \"good vs. evil\" means nothing in this world, and that if people like Tyreese try to be nice, they will not survive. Later, as the cabin is overrun by walkers and Tyreese is keeping watch, Martin breaks free and grabs Judith, ordering Tyreese outside. However, Tyreese overpowers the walkers, breaks back inside, and knocks Martin unconscious, refusing to kill him. Martin then reappears with Gareth and 4 other Terminus survivors after they kidnap Bob, and then sneak into the church to kill the members of Rick's group. When Rick and the others ambush them, Martin is the last to drop his weapon after Gareth orders him to surrender. Martin is then stabbed to death by Sasha when Gareth and the others are slaughtered by Rick's group. Later, when Tyreese is dying of a walker bite, Martin is the first person to appear to Tyreese as a hallucination, where he mockingly tells Tyreese that he will die because he still tried to be a \"good guy\", and that many of the recent failures were because of his refusal to kill Martin.\n* '''Mike''', portrayed by Chris Burns, is one of the Hunters who is killed in the church when he and Albert are immediately shot through the head.\n* '''Theresa''', portrayed by April Billingsley, is one of the Hunters who is killed in their attempted siege on the church when Michonne bashes her skull in with the butt of her [[rifle]].\n* '''Greg''', portrayed by Travis Young, is one of the Hunters who is killed in the church when Abraham bludgeons him to death with the butt of his rifle.\n\n===Grady Memorial Hospital===\n'''[[Grady Memorial Hospital]]''', first appearing in \"[[Slabtown (The Walking Dead)|Slabtown]]\", is revealed to be the home of a sheltered group of survivors, who believe that military assistance will eventually come to them after a certain period of time. The hospital is run under a strict authoritarian regime by a group of corrupt police officers.\n\n* '''Dr. Steven Edwards''', portrayed by [[Erik Jensen (actor)|Erik Jensen]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Erik Jensen Talks The Walking Dead, the Conflicted Dr. Edwards, Geeking Out, and Guinea Pigs [EXCLUSIVE Interview] {{!}} TV Geek Talk |url=https://tvgeektalk.com/news/erik-jensen-talks-the-walking-dead-the-conflicted-dr-edwards-geeking-out-and-guinea-pigs-exclusive-interview/ |publisher=TV Geek Talk |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095331/https://tvgeektalk.com/news/erik-jensen-talks-the-walking-dead-the-conflicted-dr-edwards-geeking-out-and-guinea-pigs-exclusive-interview/ |archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> is the hospital's sole doctor who has a polite but nervous demeanor to him. He noticeably disapproves of the harsh methods by which Officers Lerner and Gorman run the hospital, but despite his objections, his position is valued by the officers as the only medical professional on hand. He initially cares for Beth as she recovers and does his best to protect her from the officers, saying that he refuses to leave because, as ruthless as the officers are, it is still better inside the hospital than out in the real world. However, Beth grows suspicious of him when he tells her to give the drug [[Clozapine]] to Gavin Trevitt, a patient, who is also a doctor, as the drug ends up killing him. Although Dr. Edwards insists that he actually said Clonazepam, Beth is certain that he told her the name of the wrong drug on purpose. She accuses him of having the other doctor poisoned in order to retain his valued status as the only doctor, which he denies. He later helps Beth save Carol's life by telling her which medication she will need to give Carol. After the deaths of Beth and Lerner, Edwards offers to let Rick's group stay at the hospital, but Rick refuses.\n* '''Officer Gorman''', portrayed by [[Cullen Moss]], is Officer Lerner's second-in-command and one of the officers who saved Beth. Although he appears to have a more polite demeanor during his initial introduction, Beth quickly discovers that his idea of being repaid for his services is sexual relations with the female patients, as he has already apparently [[rape]]d Joan. He makes similar advances towards Beth, finally catching her alone in Lerner's office where, unbeknownst to him, Joan has committed [[suicide]] and is about to turn. There, he finally begins to force himself on Beth, attempting to blackmail her with her attempt to steal a key from Lerner's office, and just as he moves in, Beth hits him in the back of the head with a glass bottle. When he falls to the floor, the reanimated Joan instantly crawls onto him and kills him by biting his neck while Beth escapes.\n\n[[File:Keisha Castle-Hughes at TIFF 2009 (headshot).jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Keisha Castle-Hughes]]]]\n\n* '''Joan''', portrayed by [[Keisha Castle-Hughes]], is female patient who attempts to escape the hospital, only to be bitten in the arm by a walker. When she is brought back inside by Officer Lerner, Lerner demands that Dr. Edwards save her by amputating her arm with a metal wire. Joan refuses to be rescued and demands that they let her die, but Lerner, with Beth's reluctant help, manages to restrain her long enough for Dr. Edwards to amputate the arm. Later, while Beth is cleaning Joan's room, Joan tells her more about the dark secrets behind the leadership of the hospital, including Officer Gorman's treatment of female patients. Later, as Beth breaks into Lerner's office to find the key to the elevator shaft, she discovers that Joan has also already broken in and committed [[suicide]] by reopening the amputation wound. Beth uses Joan's death to her advantage by allowing the reanimated Joan to kill Officer Gorman.\n\n[[File:Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez]]]]\n\n* '''Sgt. Bob Lamson''', portrayed by [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez]], is one of the two officers who is captured by Noah's trap, along with Officer Shepherd. He comes forward and tries to convince Rick and the group that he is the best one to talk to Officer Lerner when they make the hostage exchange, saying he has known her for eight years. Later, as they prepare to leave for the exchange, he reveals that his name is Bob, noticeably startling Sasha, who was left to watch him. While alone with her, he explains how he is alive because another officer was sent out to respond to a call that he should have taken, and that officer is now a walker in the parking lot. Sasha offers to put the walker down for him in order to alleviate his guilt, but just as she prepares to take the shot, Lamson knocks her unconscious and flees the building. However, he does not get far before Rick runs him down in a police car and shoots him in the head.\n* '''Officer Dawn Lerner''', portrayed by [[Christine Woods]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Meet the new 'Walking Dead' cop from hell, who claims she is a 'hero' |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/11/02/walking-dead-dawn-lerner-christine-woods |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918154311/http://www.ew.com/article/2014/11/02/walking-dead-dawn-lerner-christine-woods |archive-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref> is the strict leader of the hospital, enforcing the rules with her group of fellow officers (who are the only occupants of the hospital to possess weapons). She believes that everyone must contribute to \"the greater good\" and keep the hospital operation running long enough for the military to come save them, and often uses this mentality as a form of guilt in order to persuade those that they capture into doing work for the hospital once they recover. Though she is aware of Gorman's treatment of female patients, she does little to stop it. Lerner also treats the patients cruelly herself, repeatedly taking out her anger on Beth by striking her for the slightest mistakes or misunderstandings. Despite Beth's attempts to convince her that help will never come, Lerner refuses to believe it and insists that things will get better eventually, and it is far better to live under her rule than in the wilderness outside. Though she is furious at Beth for (as Lerner believes) killing Gorman and Joan as well as aiding Noah in his escape, she still refuses to kill or exile Beth, as she needs the extra help around the hospital. Though she tries to develop a bond with Beth, Beth is ultimately convinced that Lerner will never change, and her vision of a better future clouds her reasonable judgment. In the prisoner exchange at the end of \"[[Coda (The Walking Dead)|Coda]]\", when Beth stabs Lerner in the shoulder with a pair of scissors, Lerner reacts impulsively in a moment of shock and her gun discharges, firing a single bullet directly through Beth's head and killing her instantly. Although Lerner pleads for mercy, Daryl shoots her directly in the forehead immediately afterward.\n* '''Officer Licari''', portrayed by Christopher Matthew Cook, is one of the police officers working at the hospital under Officer Lerner.

He tells Beth that both he and his father were discovered by the group while the two of them were being surround by walkers, and their rescuers said that they could only save one of them. For this reason alone, Noah displays strong distaste for the officers almost immediately, saying that with their weapons and manpower, they likely could have saved his father as well. When Beth accidentally kills Dr. Gavin Trevitt by giving him the wrong medication, Noah takes the blame by saying that while he was cleaning, he knocked over a ventilation system and caused Trevitt to flatline. For this, Officers Dawn Lerner and Gorman take him out into the hall and beat him. Beth later apologizes, only for Noah to insist that he is fine and has been through worse. Nevertheless, Beth decides to form a plan for her and Noah to escape. They use the elevator shaft, which has served as a body disposal chute, and with a long chord of sheets tied together, they both make it down, although Noah loses his grip and falls, spraining one ankle. They both manage to make it outside, where Beth fends off several walkers with a handgun. Although Beth is stopped and restrained by the officers, Noah manages to make it to the outer gate and slips through, running off after he and Beth exchange a final glance.

In \"[[Coda (The Walking Dead)|Coda]]\", he stands up to Lerner and accuses her of cracking under the pressure of leadership, claiming that she is no longer fit to run the hospital. Although she pulls her gun on him, he manages to disarm her, and they fight in the hallway before Beth pushes him into the elevator shaft to his death.\n* '''Percy''', portrayed by Marc Gowan, is an elderly patient at the hospital.

Hafeez usually opens the batting and forms part of the bowling attack. He is widely regarded as one of the best all-rounders in the world, having been ranked as the top all-rounder by the [[ICC Player Rankings]] in the limited overs formats on numerous occasions. He is known for his intelligent batting but also for aggressive shot plays when needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/41434.html |title=Player Profile: Mohammad Hafeez |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> He retired from Test Cricket in December 2018, departing the ground for the final time in white clothing to a guard of honour from his teammates.\n\nHe was the fourth international player signed to the [[Caribbean Premier League]] and the first Pakistani player to be named to the new [[Twenty20]] tournament.

He has been a trusted player over the years. Hafeez scored his test career best of 224 runs against Bangladesh in 2015 at Khulna during the Dan Cake Series.\n\nIn August 2018, he was one of the thirty-three players to be awarded a central contract for the 2018\u201319 season by the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] (PCB).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcb.com.pk/press-release-detail/pcb-central-contracts-2018-19.html |title=PCB Central Contracts 2018\u201319 |work=Pakistan Cricket Board |accessdate=6 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/24301169/new-central-contracts-guarantee-earnings-boost-pakistan-players |title=New central contracts guarantee earnings boost for Pakistan players |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=6 August 2018|date=6 August 2018 }}</ref> In December 2018, during Pakistan's series [[New Zealand cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2018\u201319|against New Zealand]], Hafeez announced that he would retire from Test cricket following the conclusion of the tour, to focus on [[limited-overs cricket]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/25450138/mohammad-hafeez-retire-test-cricket-ongoing-abu-dhabi-test |title=Hafeez to retire from Test cricket after ongoing Abu Dhabi game |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=4 December 2018|date=4 December 2018 }}</ref> Hafeez said that the time was right to retire from Test cricket and that he was honoured to represent Pakistan in 55 Test matches, including captaining the side.<ref name=\"hafeez\">{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/930773 |title=Hafeez set to retire from Test cricket |work=International Cricket Council |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> {{As of|2019|1}} he is the fourth ranked ODI all rounder and 10th ranked T20I all rounder.\n\n==International career==\n{{citation needed section|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Early years: 2003\u20132006===\nHafeez, also known as The Professor, has played in Bhera and was one of several young all-rounders whom the [[Pakistani cricket team]] turned to in order to revitalize their side after their poor display in 2003 World Cup where Pakistan was out from first round. His form with both bat and ball was inconsistent and in late 2003 he was dropped from the Test squad and subsequently from the ODI side. Following strong domestic performances, as well as some consistent showings for the Pakistan A side, he remained on the fringes of a recall in 2004.\nHafeez returned to the ODI side in 2005 and despite poor form with the bat, his bowling performances were impressive. In the 2006 series held in [[Australia]], Hafeez smashed his first century for Pakistan. With Pakistan struggling to find a solid opening pair for the Test side, he was recalled for the tour of [[England]]. His return to Test cricket was made at [[The Oval]] where he scored a fluent 95. Subsequently, Hafeez retained his place in the Test squad for Pakistan's home series against the [[West Indies]] in November of that year. After getting out early despite good starts in the first two Tests, he went on to score his second Test century in the third Test in [[Karachi]].\n\n=== Recall in 2010 ===\nIn 2010 he was recalled for the third [[ICC World Twenty20]] squad. His form was poor scoring only 39 runs and taking only 2 wickets in 6 matches. However he was subsequently selected for the [[T20I]]s and the [[One Day International|ODIs]] on Pakistan's 2010 tour of England. He was the second highest Pakistani run scorer in the ODI series producing some solid opening partnerships with [[Kamran Akmal]]. Following this good form he was included in the squad that was selected to play South Africa in the [[UAE]] and he replaced disgraced skipper [[Salman Butt]] as an opening batsman in both Tests, achieving a batting average 32.50. He played in all 5 ODI matches ending up as the top run scorer and he also topped the bowling averages for the series. At the end of 2010 he was also selected for the party that would tour New Zealand and the [[West Indies]] and this resulted in him establishing himself as a regular in the Test, ODI and T20 teams.\n\nYet, for his performances in 2011, he was named in the World Test XI by the Cricinfo.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/review2011/content/story/547545.html 2011 review: ESPNcricinfo's Test and ODI XIs of 2011 | Cricket | ESPNcricinfo.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Rising through ranks===\nAgainst India on 18 March 2012 in Bangladesh at Shere Bangla National Stadium, Mirpur at the [[2012 Asia Cup]], he scored 105 off 113 balls and was involved in a 224 run partnership with [[Nasir Jamshed]], which is the best opening partnership for Pakistan against India in one day internationals. They eclipsed [[Aamer Sohail]] and [[Saeed Anwar]]'s record of 144 runs which was made in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|last=Purohit|first=Abhishek|title= Hafeez demolished India in record partnership|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/asia-cup-2012/content/current/story/557744.html|accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> During this innings, Hafeez was forced to run a lot which towards the end was hampering him due to a leg injury. Subsequently, he earned the nickname, the Snake of Sargodha, for his zigzag running pattern between the wickets. He made his 4th ODI century in March 2012 against Bangladesh at Dhaka. He also made his highest test score of 196 against Sri Lanka in the second Test at Colombo in June 2012. He is ranked number two in the ICC ODI rankings for both bowlers and all-rounders in 2012.\n\nIn December 2012, during the tour of [[Pakistani cricket team in India in 2012\u201313]], he came across as a very different and aggressive batsman and scored so brilliantly and briskely and helped Pakistan to win the first T20I and 2nd ODI with his heroics of brilliant batting and nearly chasing a mountain high target of 191 in the second T20I. His scores were 61 and 55 in first and second T20I respectively and scored 76 runs in the 2nd ODI and sharing an opening stand of 141 with [[Nasir Jamshed]] and also bowled brilliantly as always economically to help Pakistan win their first ODI series in India since 7 years. He is now considered to be the main allrounder of Pakistan Cricket team. He had a great series against Sri Lanka in Dec 2013, where he scored 122 in the first match, 140* in the third and 113* in the fourth match. Thus he became, the second batsman after [[Zaheer Abbas]] to score 3 centuries in an ODI series. Hafeez was initially selected in the Pakistan squad for the 2015 World Cup but was ruled out 6 days before the World Cup due to a calf injury. He was replaced by Nasir Jamshed.\n\nFor his performances in 2014, he was named in the World ODI XI by ICC.<ref>[[2014 LG ICC Awards#ICC ODI Team of the Year]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}}\nHe was also named in the T20I XI by Cricinfo for his performances in 2013.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/review2013/content/story/705667.html 2013 in review: The test, ODI and T20 teams of the year | Cricket News | Review 2013 | ESPNcricinfo.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==T20 captaincy record==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; width: 40%; font-size: 90%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|'''Hafeez's record as T20I captain'''\n|-\n|Format||Matches||Won||Lost||Drawn||No result||\nWin (%)\n|-\n|T20I<ref>{{cite web|title=Pakistan's Captains Record in International T20 matches|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/Pakistan/engine/records/individual/list_captains.html?class=3;id=7;type=team|publisher=([[ESPNcricinfo]])|accessdate=31 December 2016}}</ref>|||29||17||11||\u2013||\u2013\n||60.34\n|}\n\n===Captaincy===\nHe was appointed captain of the Pakistan T20 team in May 2012 and vice captain, under [[Misbah-ul-Haq]], of the ODI and Test teams. During the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]] in [[Sri Lanka]] in September 2012, Pakistan reached the semi-finals where they lost to the home side. After the tournament, there was some controversy with veteran all-rounder [[Abdul Razzaq (cricketer)|Abdul Razzaq]] who was critical of his non-selection for a number of matches. Hafeez also came into some conflict with the [[Pakistan Cricket Board|PCB]] over their view that he adopted a rather unilateral and non-consultative approach while making selection decisions. However, he was supported by the coach [[Dav Whatmore]] and both of them emphasised the poor fitness levels of many players. The PCB committee decided that they would subsequently closely monitor Hafeez's performance in this context during the coming tours to India and South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/icc-world-twenty20/news/item/198178-pcb-not-happy-with-mohammad-hafeezs-unilateral-approach|title=PCB not happy with Mohammad Hafeez's unilateral approach \u2013 NDTV Sports|last=NDTVSports.com|publisher=}}</ref>\nAs a captain, he led Pakistan to victories over South Africa, West Indies and Zimbabwe. He equalled the records of most wins as a Pakistani captain in T20 and most number of away series wins as a Pakistani captain. Under his leadership, Pakistan managed to move up to the second position in the rankings.\n\nHe also became the first Pakistani captain to hit three fifties in a row and became Pakistan's leading run scorer in T20s. After Pakistan's exit from the T20 World Championship Hafeez apologized on behalf of his team and stepped down as captain. [[Imran Khan]], Pakistan's former captain criticised this decision and advised Hafeez to stay as captain. His resignation was a rare incident in Pakistan cricket.\n\n=== Post-captaincy (2016 - present) ===\nIn March 2016, Pakistan's exit from the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after losing 3 matches caused great controversy in Pakistan, with blame shifting between Waqar Younis as well as many of the players on the team. Hafeez was accused, by Younis, of lying about his knee injury before the T20. He said it could have affected the teams poor performance. Despite bad performance during the T20I world cup 2016 Hafeez was picked for the England tour of 2016 Hafeez was out on 0 several times throughout the test series and during the ODI series in the first match he was out on 11 which then he was dropped for rest of the tour because of bad performance and not fit enough to play. After missing out of international cricket for months in which he missed the [[West Indian cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2016-17|West Indies series in the UAE]], Hafeez was then picked for the [[Pakistani cricket team in Australia in 2016-17|Australia tour 2017]] to play the ODI series. As of the first ODI match Hafeez was out on 4. For the second ODI Azhar Ali was ruled out because of injury which promoted Hafeez to captain Pakistan, Hafeez did a very good job as Pakistan won the match and first time in 12 years in Australian soil. Not only that Hafeez captaincy was appreciated but he also made 72 runs which earned him player of the match. Hafeez played an integral role in Pakistan's triumph in the Champions Trophy 2017 in England\n\nIn April 2019, he was named in [[2019 Cricket World Cup squads#Pakistan|Pakistan's squad]] for the [[2019 Cricket World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/1181318.html |title=Mohammad Amir left out of Pakistan's World Cup squad |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=18 April 2019|date=18 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/1188332 |title=Amir left out of Pakistan's World Cup squad |work=International Cricket Council |accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref> He was named man of the match in Pakistan's second match of the tournament against England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/mohammad-hafeez-man-of-the-match-in-england-vs-pakistan-world-cup-2019-clash-2208813.html |title=Mohammad Hafeez: Man of the Match in England vs Pakistan World Cup 2019 clash |work=Zee News |accessdate=3 June 2019|date=3 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==T20 franchise career==\n\nOn 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Montreal Tigers in the players' draft for the [[2018 Global T20 Canada|inaugural edition]] of the [[Global T20 Canada]] tournament.<ref name=\"Squads1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/global-t20-canada-complete-squads |title=Global T20 Canada: Complete Squads |work=SportsKeeda |accessdate=4 June 2018|date=4 June 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"Squads2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.crictracker.com/global-t20-canada-league-full-squads-announced/ |title=Global T20 Canada League \u2013 Full Squads announced |work=CricTracker |accessdate=4 June 2018|date=4 June 2018 }}</ref> In September 2018, he was named in Nangarhar's squad in the [[2018\u201319 Afghanistan Premier League|first edition]] of the [[Afghanistan Premier League]] tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crictracker.com/afghanistan-premier-league-2018-all-you-need-to-know-from-the-player-draft/ |title=Afghanistan Premier League 2018 \u2013 All you need to know from the player draft |work=CricTracker |accessdate=10 September 2018|date=10 September 2018 }}</ref> In 2019, he was named captain of Lahore Qalandars in PSL4.\n\nHe was signed by Edmonton Royals as marquee player in 2nd season of GT20 Canada in July.

Hafeez usually opens the batting and forms part of the bowling attack. He is widely regarded as one of the best all-rounders in the world, having been ranked as the top all-rounder by the [[ICC Player Rankings]] in the limited overs formats on numerous occasions. He is known for his intelligent batting but also for aggressive shot plays when needed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/41434.html |title=Player Profile: Mohammad Hafeez |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> He retired from Test Cricket in December 2018, departing the ground for the final time in white clothing to a guard of honour from his teammates.\n\nHe was the fourth international player signed to the [[Caribbean Premier League]] and the first Pakistani player to be named to the new [[Twenty20]] tournament.

He has been a trusted player over the years. Hafeez scored his test career best of 224 runs against Bangladesh in 2015 at Khulna during the Dan Cake Series.\n\nIn August 2018, he was one of the thirty-three players to be awarded a central contract for the 2018\u201319 season by the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] (PCB).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcb.com.pk/press-release-detail/pcb-central-contracts-2018-19.html |title=PCB Central Contracts 2018\u201319 |work=Pakistan Cricket Board |accessdate=6 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/24301169/new-central-contracts-guarantee-earnings-boost-pakistan-players |title=New central contracts guarantee earnings boost for Pakistan players |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=6 August 2018|date=6 August 2018 }}</ref> In December 2018, during Pakistan's series [[New Zealand cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2018\u201319|against New Zealand]], Hafeez announced that he would retire from Test cricket following the conclusion of the tour, to focus on [[limited-overs cricket]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/25450138/mohammad-hafeez-retire-test-cricket-ongoing-abu-dhabi-test |title=Hafeez to retire from Test cricket after ongoing Abu Dhabi game |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=4 December 2018|date=4 December 2018 }}</ref> Hafeez said that the time was right to retire from Test cricket and that he was honoured to represent Pakistan in 55 Test matches, including captaining the side.<ref name=\"hafeez\">{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/930773 |title=Hafeez set to retire from Test cricket |work=International Cricket Council |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> {{As of|2019|1}} he is the fourth ranked ODI all rounder and 10th ranked T20I all rounder.\n\n==International career==\n{{citation needed section|date=June 2019}}\n===Early years: 2003\u20132006===\nHafeez, also known as The Professor, has played in Bhera and was one of several young all-rounders whom the [[Pakistani cricket team]] turned to in order to revitalize their side after their poor display in 2003 World Cup where Pakistan was out from first round. His form with both bat and ball was inconsistent and in late 2003 he was dropped from the Test squad and subsequently from the ODI side. Following strong domestic performances, as well as some consistent showings for the Pakistan A side, he remained on the fringes of a recall in 2004.\nHafeez returned to the ODI side in 2005 and despite poor form with the bat, his bowling performances were impressive. In the 2006 series held in [[Australia]], Hafeez smashed his first century for Pakistan. With Pakistan struggling to find a solid opening pair for the Test side, he was recalled for the tour of [[England]]. His return to Test cricket was made at [[The Oval]] where he scored a fluent 95. Subsequently, Hafeez retained his place in the Test squad for Pakistan's home series against the [[West Indies]] in November of that year. After getting out early despite good starts in the first two Tests, he went on to score his second Test century in the third Test in [[Karachi]].\n\n=== Recall in 2010 ===\nIn 2010 he was recalled for the third [[ICC World Twenty20]] squad. His form was poor scoring only 39 runs and taking only 2 wickets in 6 matches. However he was subsequently selected for the [[T20I]]s and the [[One Day International|ODIs]] on Pakistan's 2010 tour of England. He was the second highest Pakistani run scorer in the ODI series producing some solid opening partnerships with [[Kamran Akmal]]. Following this good form he was included in the squad that was selected to play South Africa in the [[UAE]] and he replaced disgraced skipper [[Salman Butt]] as an opening batsman in both Tests, achieving a batting average 32.50. He played in all 5 ODI matches ending up as the top run scorer and he also topped the bowling averages for the series. At the end of 2010 he was also selected for the party that would tour New Zealand and the [[West Indies]] and this resulted in him establishing himself as a regular in the Test, ODI and T20 teams.\n\nYet, for his performances in 2011, he was named in the World Test XI by the Cricinfo<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/review2011/content/story/547545.html 2011 review: ESPNcricinfo's Test and ODI XIs of 2011 | Cricket | ESPNcricinfo.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.\n\n===Rising through ranks===\nAgainst India on 18 March 2012 in Bangladesh at Shere Bangla National Stadium, Mirpur at the [[2012 Asia Cup]], he scored 105 off 113 balls and was involved in a 224 run partnership with [[Nasir Jamshed]], which is the best opening partnership for Pakistan against India in one day internationals. They eclipsed [[Aamer Sohail]] and [[Saeed Anwar]]'s record of 144 runs which was made in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|last=Purohit|first=Abhishek|title= Hafeez demolished India in record partnership|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/asia-cup-2012/content/current/story/557744.html|accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> During this innings, Hafeez was forced to run a lot which towards the end was hampering him due to a leg injury. Subsequently, he earned the nickname, the Snake of Sargodha, for his zigzag running pattern between the wickets. He made his 4th ODI century in March 2012 against Bangladesh at Dhaka. He also made his highest test score of 196 against Sri Lanka in the second Test at Colombo in June 2012. He is ranked number two in the ICC ODI rankings for both bowlers and all-rounders in 2012.\n\nIn December 2012, during the tour of [[Pakistani cricket team in India in 2012\u201313]], he came across as a very different and aggressive batsman and scored so brilliantly and briskely and helped Pakistan to win the first T20I and 2nd ODI with his heroics of brilliant batting and nearly chasing a mountain high target of 191 in the second T20I. His scores were 61 and 55 in first and second T20I respectively and scored 76 runs in the 2nd ODI and sharing an opening stand of 141 with [[Nasir Jamshed]] and also bowled brilliantly as always economically to help Pakistan win their first ODI series in India since 7 years. He is now considered to be the main allrounder of Pakistan Cricket team. He had a great series against Sri Lanka in Dec 2013, where he scored 122 in the first match, 140* in the third and 113* in the fourth match. Thus he became, the second batsman after [[Zaheer Abbas]] to score 3 centuries in an ODI series. Hafeez was initially selected in the Pakistan squad for the 2015 World Cup but was ruled out 6 days before the World Cup due to a calf injury. He was replaced by Nasir Jamshed.\n\nFor his performances in 2014, he was named in the World ODI XI by ICC.<ref>[[2014 LG ICC Awards#ICC ODI Team of the Year]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2019}}\nHe was also named in the T20I XI by Cricinfo for his performances in 2013<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/review2013/content/story/705667.html 2013 in review: The test, ODI and T20 teams of the year | Cricket News | Review 2013 | ESPNcricinfo.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.\n\n==T20 captaincy record==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; width: 40%; font-size: 90%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|'''Hafeez's record as T20I captain'''\n|-\n|Format||Matches||Won||Lost||Drawn||No result||\nWin (%)\n|-\n|T20I<ref>{{cite web|title=Pakistan's Captains Record in International T20 matches|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/Pakistan/engine/records/individual/list_captains.html?class=3;id=7;type=team|publisher=([[ESPNcricinfo]])|accessdate=31 December 2016}}</ref>|||29||17||11||\u2013||\u2013\n||60.34\n|}\n\n===Captaincy===\nHe was appointed captain of the Pakistan T20 team in May 2012 and vice captain, under [[Misbah-ul-Haq]], of the ODI and Test teams. During the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]] in [[Sri Lanka]] in September 2012, Pakistan reached the semi-finals where they lost to the home side. After the tournament, there was some controversy with veteran all-rounder [[Abdul Razzaq (cricketer)|Abdul Razzaq]] who was critical of his non-selection for a number of matches. Hafeez also came into some conflict with the [[Pakistan Cricket Board|PCB]] over their view that he adopted a rather unilateral and non-consultative approach while making selection decisions. However, he was supported by the coach [[Dav Whatmore]] and both of them emphasised the poor fitness levels of many players. The PCB committee decided that they would subsequently closely monitor Hafeez's performance in this context during the coming tours to India and South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/icc-world-twenty20/news/item/198178-pcb-not-happy-with-mohammad-hafeezs-unilateral-approach|title=PCB not happy with Mohammad Hafeez's unilateral approach \u2013 NDTV Sports|last=NDTVSports.com|publisher=}}</ref>\nAs a captain, he led Pakistan to victories over South Africa, West Indies and Zimbabwe. He equalled the records of most wins as a Pakistani captain in T20 and most number of away series wins as a Pakistani captain. Under his leadership, Pakistan managed to move up to the second position in the rankings.\n\nHe also became the first Pakistani captain to hit three fifties in a row and became Pakistan's leading run scorer in T20s. After Pakistan's exit from the T20 World Championship Hafeez apologized on behalf of his team and stepped down as captain. [[Imran Khan]], Pakistan's former captain criticised this decision and advised Hafeez to stay as captain. His resignation was a rare incident in Pakistan cricket.\n\n=== Post-captaincy (2016 - present) ===\nIn March 2016, Pakistan's exit from the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after losing 3 matches caused great controversy in Pakistan, with blame shifting between Waqar Younis as well as many of the players on the team. Hafeez was accused, by Younis, of lying about his knee injury before the T20. He said it could have affected the teams poor performance. Despite bad performance during the T20I world cup 2016 Hafeez was picked for the England tour of 2016 Hafeez was out on 0 several times throughout the test series and during the ODI series in the first match he was out on 11 which then he was dropped for rest of the tour because of bad performance and not fit enough to play. After missing out of international cricket for months in which he missed the [[West Indian cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2016-17|West Indies series in the UAE]], Hafeez was then picked for the [[Pakistani cricket team in Australia in 2016-17|Australia tour 2017]] to play the ODI series. As of the first ODI match Hafeez was out on 4. For the second ODI Azhar Ali was ruled out because of injury which promoted Hafeez to captain Pakistan, Hafeez did a very good job as Pakistan won the match and first time in 12 years in Australian soil. Not only that Hafeez captaincy was appreciated but he also made 72 runs which earned him player of the match. Hafeez played an integral role in Pakistan's triumph in the Champions Trophy 2017 in England\n\nIn April 2019, he was named in [[2019 Cricket World Cup squads#Pakistan|Pakistan's squad]] for the [[2019 Cricket World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/1181318.html |title=Mohammad Amir left out of Pakistan's World Cup squad |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=18 April 2019|date=18 April 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/1188332 |title=Amir left out of Pakistan's World Cup squad |work=International Cricket Council |accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref>He was named man of the match in Pakistan's second match of the tournament against England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/mohammad-hafeez-man-of-the-match-in-england-vs-pakistan-world-cup-2019-clash-2208813.html |title=Mohammad Hafeez: Man of the Match in England vs Pakistan World Cup 2019 clash |work=Zee News |accessdate=3 June 2019|date=3 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==T20 franchise career==\n\nOn 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Montreal Tigers in the players' draft for the [[2018 Global T20 Canada|inaugural edition]] of the [[Global T20 Canada]] tournament.<ref name=\"Squads1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/global-t20-canada-complete-squads |title=Global T20 Canada: Complete Squads |work=SportsKeeda |accessdate=4 June 2018|date=4 June 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"Squads2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.crictracker.com/global-t20-canada-league-full-squads-announced/ |title=Global T20 Canada League \u2013 Full Squads announced |work=CricTracker |accessdate=4 June 2018|date=4 June 2018 }}</ref> In September 2018, he was named in Nangarhar's squad in the [[2018\u201319 Afghanistan Premier League|first edition]] of the [[Afghanistan Premier League]] tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crictracker.com/afghanistan-premier-league-2018-all-you-need-to-know-from-the-player-draft/ |title=Afghanistan Premier League 2018 \u2013 All you need to know from the player draft |work=CricTracker |accessdate=10 September 2018|date=10 September 2018 }}</ref> In 2019, he was named captain of Lahore Qalandars in PSL4.\n\nHe was signed by Edmonton Royals as marquee player in 2nd season of GT20 Canada in July.
