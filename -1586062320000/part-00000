It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006, for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month, and for [[Linux]] on [[April Fools]]. Versions for Wii and [[Windows]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris. Sonic and Elise are brought to the past and extinguish Solaris's flame, removing the god from existence and preventing the previous events from ever occurring.<ref>{{cite video game|quote='''Elise:''' This is where everything began.

It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006 and for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month. Versions for Wii and [[Windows]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris.

He plays second-in-command Guino Rinaldo, who falls in love with Camonte's sister and is murdered by him.

He was spotted by director [[Rowland Brown]], who used him to good effect, including a solo dance sequence in a substantial supporting gangster role as [[Spencer Tracy]]'s character's [[sidekick]] in ''[[Quick Millions (1931 film)|Quick Millions]]'' (1931).<ref name=\"circ\"/>\n\nThis was followed by ''[[Goldie (film)|Goldie]]'' (1931), ''[[Hush Money (1931 film)|Hush Money]]'' (1931) and the [[Eddie Cantor]] musical ''[[Palmy Days]]'' (1931).\n\nIn ''[[Taxi!]]'' (1932), starring [[James Cagney]] and [[Loretta Young]], Raft has a colorful unbilled dancing role as Cagney's competitor in a dance contest, who wins only to be knocked down by Cagney.

{"title_page": "Naturism", "text_new": "{{main|Nudity}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{short description|Movement for social nudity and naked lifestyle}}\n[[File:At the nudist beach.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A group of naturists at a nude beach in [[Crimea]], 2008]]\n'''Naturism''', or '''nudism''', is a [[cultural movement]] practising, advocating, and defending personal and social [[nudity]], most but not all of which takes place on private property. The term also refers to a lifestyle based on personal, family, or social nudity.{{sfn|Choin|2002}} Naturism may be practiced individually, within a familial or social context, or in public.\n\nEthical or philosophical nudism has a long history, with many advocates of the benefits of enjoying nature without clothing. At the turn of the 20th century, organizations emerged to promote social nudity and to establish private campgrounds and [[Naturist resort|resorts]] for that purpose. Since the 1960s, with the acceptance of public places for clothing-optional recreation, individuals who do not identify themselves as nudists have been able to casually participate in nude activities. Nude recreation opportunities vary widely around the world, from isolated places known mainly to locals to officially-designated nude beaches and parks.\n\n== Definition and lexicology ==\nThe XIV Congress of the [[International Naturist Federation]] ([[Cap d'Agde|Agde]], [[France]], 1974) defined naturism as:\n\n: a way of life in [[harmony]] with [[nature]] characterised by the practice of [[#Social_nudism|communal nudity]] with the intention of encouraging [[self-respect]], respect for others and for the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref name=\"Definition\">{{cite web|last1=Desch\u00eanes|first1=St\u00e9phane|title=The Official INF-FNI Definition of Naturism|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Official_INF-FNI_Definition_Of_Naturism.pdf |website=INF-FNI|publisher=International Naturist Federation|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany contemporary naturists and naturist organisations feel that the practice of social nudity should be asexual. For various social, cultural, and historical reasons, the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations have or present a simplified view of the relationship between naturism and sexuality. Current research has begun to explore this complex relationship.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}\n\nThe International Naturist Federation explains:\n\n: '' \"Each country has its own kind of naturism, and even each club has its own special character, for we too, human beings, have each our own character which is reflected in our surroundings.\"''{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}}{{efn|The Hannover based ''Bund f\u00fcr freies Lebensgestaltung'' wrote: \"Naturism is a new lifestyle caring for the body, the soul and the spirit in society. We live the ideal of freedom, conscious of its limits, taking up our responsibility. The expression of our will is nudity, our admission of sincerity\".}}\n\nThe usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically.{{efn|In his book, ''Cinema Au Naturel'',{{sfn|Storey|2003|p=11}} author [[Mark Storey]] states, \"two related terms that we will continually run across are ''nudist'' and ''naturist''. Although, the meanings of the two terms are virtually identical, they often have different connotations for those who prefer one to the other. In America people who believe that it is physically, socially, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually healthy to go about fully nude individually and in groups of mixed sex whenever weather permits and others are not offended generally refer to themselves as \"nudists\". In Europe such people more often than not refer to themselves as \"naturists\".}} Naturism and nudism have the same meaning in the United States,{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} but there is a clear distinction between the two terms in Great Britain.{{efn|The English version of the Agde definition was translated differently in ''Guide Mondial de Naturisme 96 97''.{{sfn|Anon|1997|p=}} ''Naturism (American \"nudism\") is a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of communal nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and the environment.''}}{{explain|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn naturist parlance, the terms \"[[wikt:textile|textile]]\" or \"textilist\" refer to non-naturist persons, behaviours or facilities (e.g. \"the textile beach starts at the flag\", \"they are a mixed couple&nbsp;&ndash; he is naturist, she is textile\").  \"Textile\" is the predominant term used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (\"textilist\" is unknown in British naturist magazines, including ''[[H&E naturist]]''), although some naturists avoid it due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations.  \"Textilist\" is said to be used interchangeably with \"textile\", but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for ''textile''.{{sfn|Mars-Jones|1991|p=152}}\n\n== Naturist places and events ==\n[[File:Fremont Solstice Parade 2007 - naked couple 03.jpg|thumb|right|Nude woman and man at 2007 [[Fremont Solstice Parade]]]]\n{{see also|Nude recreation}}\n=== Naturist facilities ===\n{{see also|Naturist resort}}\n{{see also|Nude recreation#Nude events}}\nAt naturist organised events or venues, clothing is usually optional. At naturist swimming pools or sunbathing places, however, complete nudity is expected (weather permitting). This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}\n\nFacilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members' [[naturist club]] is one that owns its own facilities. Non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, or rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\n[[File:Outdoor bathing at Jhiben Hot Spring 20121110.jpg|thumb|left|Families bathing nude at a hot spring in [[Taiwan]]]] <!-- Can we crop this to remove triangle -->\n\nThe international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs.{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}} [[Nudist colony]] is no longer a favored term, but it is used by naturists as a term of derision for landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria.\n\nA holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. A center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] card (that is, to be a member of their national organization), but some have relaxed this requirement, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers vary in size. Larger holiday centres may have swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families may visit each year.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}}\n\nA naturist resort is, to a European, an essentially urban development where naturism is the norm. [[Cap d'Agde]] in France; the naturist village of [[Charco del Palo]] on [[Lanzarote]], [[Canary Islands]]; [[Vera, Spain|Vera Playa]] in [[Spain]];<ref>{{Citation|title=Vera Playa history article |url=http://www.veraplaya.info/history.html|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> and Vritomartis{{sfn|Schneider|2009|p=41}} in [[Greece]] are examples.\n\nIn US usage, a [[naturist resort]] can mean a holiday centre.<ref name=\"PalmSprings\">{{cite web|url=http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |title=For a relaxed explanation |publisher=Sunnyfun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308025528/http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Freik\u00f6rperkultur]] (FKK)--literally translated as 'free body culture'--is the name for the general movement in [[Germany]].

Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the [[New Gymnosophy Society]].

It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 [[High Holborn]] in London, the headquarters of the [[Women's Freedom League]]. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by an \"aristocracy\" of the original members, all of whom had \"club names\" to preserve their anonymity.

After 1940 they had their own Canadian magazine, ''Sunbathing & Health'', which occasionally carried local news. Canadians had scattered groups in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, and continues today in North Vancouver, BC.,{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} and, in Ontario, the Sun Air Club.\n\nCanadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\nMost of those clubs united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in the breakup of CSA into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next decade and a half, leading to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA continues today as the American Association for Nude Recreation&nbsp;\u2013 Western Canadian Region (www.aanr-wc.com), a region of the [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) which itself was formerly known as the ASA.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\nIn 1977 the {{lang|fr|[[La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de Naturisme|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de naturisme]]}} (FQN) was founded in Quebec, by Michel Va\u00efs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet.

The term also refers to a lifestyle based on personal, family, or social nudity.{{sfn|Choin|2002}} Naturism may be practiced individually, within a familial or social context, or in public.\n\nEthical or philosophical nudism has a long history, with many advocates of the benefits of enjoying nature without clothing. At the turn of the 20th century, organizations emerged to promote social nudity and to establish private campgrounds and [[Naturist resort|resorts]] for that purpose. Since the 1960s, with the acceptance of public places for clothing-optional recreation, individuals who do not identify themselves as nudists have been able to casually participate in nude activities. Nude recreation opportunities vary widely around the world, from isolated places known mainly to locals to officially-designated nude beaches and parks.\n\n== Definition and lexicology ==\nThe XIV Congress of the [[International Naturist Federation]] ([[Cap d'Agde|Agde]], [[France]], 1974) defined naturism as:\n\n: a way of life in [[harmony]] with [[nature]] characterised by the practice of [[#Social_nudism|communal nudity]] with the intention of encouraging [[self-respect]], respect for others and for the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref name=\"Definition\">{{cite web|last1=Desch\u00eanes|first1=St\u00e9phane|title=The Official INF-FNI Definition of Naturism|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Official_INF-FNI_Definition_Of_Naturism.pdf |website=INF-FNI|publisher=International Naturist Federation|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany contemporary naturists and naturist organisations feel that the practice of social nudity should be asexual. For various social, cultural, and historical reasons, the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations have or present a simplified view of the relationship between naturism and sexuality. Current research has begun to explore this complex relationship.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}\n\nThe International Naturist Federation explains:\n\n: '' \"Each country has its own kind of naturism, and even each club has its own special character, for we too, human beings, have each our own character which is reflected in our surroundings.\"''{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}}{{efn|The Hannover based ''Bund f\u00fcr freies Lebensgestaltung'' wrote: \"Naturism is a new lifestyle caring for the body, the soul and the spirit in society. We live the ideal of freedom, conscious of its limits, taking up our responsibility. The expression of our will is nudity, our admission of sincerity\".}}\n\nThe usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically.{{efn|In his book, ''Cinema Au Naturel'',{{sfn|Storey|2003|p=11}} author [[Mark Storey]] states, \"two related terms that we will continually run across are ''nudist'' and ''naturist''. Although, the meanings of the two terms are virtually identical, they often have different connotations for those who prefer one to the other. In America people who believe that it is physically, socially, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually healthy to go about fully nude individually and in groups of mixed sex whenever weather permits and others are not offended generally refer to themselves as \"nudists\". In Europe such people more often than not refer to themselves as \"naturists\".}} Naturism and nudism have the same meaning in the United States,{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} but there is a clear distinction between the two terms in Great Britain.{{efn|The English version of the Agde definition was translated differently in ''Guide Mondial de Naturisme 96 97''.{{sfn|Anon|1997|p=}} ''Naturism (American \"nudism\") is a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of communal nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and the environment.''}}{{explain|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn naturist parlance, the terms \"[[wikt:textile|textile]]\" or \"textilist\" refer to non-naturist persons, behaviours or facilities (e.g. \"the textile beach starts at the flag\", \"they are a mixed couple&nbsp;&ndash; he is naturist, she is textile\").  \"Textile\" is the predominant term used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (\"textilist\" is unknown in British naturist magazines, including ''[[H&E naturist]]''), although some naturists avoid it due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations.  \"Textilist\" is said to be used interchangeably with \"textile\", but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for ''textile''.{{sfn|Mars-Jones|1991|p=152}}\n\n== Naturist places and events ==\n[[File:Fremont Solstice Parade 2007 - naked couple 03.jpg|thumb|right|Nude woman and man at 2007 [[Fremont Solstice Parade]]]]\n{{see also|Nude recreation}}\n=== Naturist facilities ===\n{{see also|Naturist resort}}\n{{see also|Nude recreation#Nude events}}\nAt naturist organised events or venues, clothing is usually optional. At naturist swimming pools or sunbathing places, however, complete nudity is expected (weather permitting). This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.{{sfn|Descamps|1987}}\n\nFacilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members' [[naturist club]] is one that owns its own facilities. Non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, or rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\n[[File:Outdoor bathing at Jhiben Hot Spring 20121110.jpg|thumb|left|Families bathing nude at a hot spring in [[Taiwan]]]] <!-- Can we crop this to remove triangle -->\n\nThe international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs.{{sfn|Choin|2002|p=}} [[Nudist colony]] is no longer a favored term, but it is used by naturists as a term of derision for landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria.\n\nA holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. A center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an [[International Naturist Federation|INF]] card (that is, to be a member of their national organization), but some have relaxed this requirement, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers vary in size. Larger holiday centres may have swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families may visit each year.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}} Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.{{sfn|Montananaturist.org}}\n\nA naturist resort is, to a European, an essentially urban development where naturism is the norm. [[Cap d'Agde]] in France; the naturist village of [[Charco del Palo]] on [[Lanzarote]], [[Canary Islands]]; [[Vera, Spain|Vera Playa]] in [[Spain]];<ref>{{Citation|title=Vera Playa history article |url=http://www.veraplaya.info/history.html|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> and Vritomartis{{sfn|Schneider|2009|p=41}} in [[Greece]] are examples.\n\nIn US usage, a [[naturist resort]] can mean a holiday centre.<ref name=\"PalmSprings\">{{cite web|url=http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |title=For a relaxed explanation |publisher=Sunnyfun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308025528/http://sunnyfun.com/faq.html |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Freik\u00f6rperkultur]] (FKK)--literally translated as 'free body culture'--is the name for the general movement in [[Germany]].

Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the [[New Gymnosophy Society]].

It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 [[High Holborn]] in London, the headquarters of the [[Women's Freedom League]]. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by an \"aristocracy\" of the original members, all of whom had \"club names\" to preserve their anonymity.

After 1940 they had their own Canadian magazine, ''Sunbathing & Health'', which occasionally carried local news. Canadians had scattered groups in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, and continues today in North Vancouver, BC.,{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}} and, in Ontario, the Sun Air Club.\n\nCanadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\nMost of those clubs united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in the breakup of CSA into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next decade and a half, leading to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA continues today as the American Association for Nude Recreation&nbsp;\u2013 Western Canadian Region (www.aanr-wc.com), a region of the [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) which itself was formerly known as the ASA.{{sfn|Woycke|2003|p=}}\n\nIn 1977 the {{lang|fr|[[La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de Naturisme|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de naturisme]]}} (FQN) was founded in Quebec, by Michel Va\u00efs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet.

The bishop breathes over the vessel containing the chrism, a gesture which symbolizes the Holy Spirit coming down to consecrate this oil, and recalls the actions of Jesus in John 20:22, when he breathed on the apostles and said, \"Receive the Holy Spirit...\"<ref name=Jalbert/><ref name=Baltimore>[https://www.archbalt.org/about-us/our-bishops/cardinal-obrien/articles/chism-mass.cfm \"Chrism Mass\", ''Catholic Review'', Archdiocese of Baltimore, March 27, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413153522/https://www.archbalt.org/about-us/our-bishops/cardinal-obrien/articles/chism-mass.cfm |date=13 April 2017 }}</ref>\n\nWith respect to Anglicanism, the 1979 [[Book of Common Prayer]] (p.&nbsp;307) calls for chrism to be consecrated by the bishop. In many dioceses, the consecration of chrism by the bishop may be done at a service of reaffirmation of ordination vows during Holy Week. During the Chrism Eucharist, the Bishop will bless the oils used throughout the next year for baptisms and healing. In addition, the Bishop and clergy in attendance will reaffirm their Ordination Vows.<ref name=Tennessee/>\n\n===Eastern Christianity===\n====Eastern Orthodoxy====\n[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|left|Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]])]]\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[liturgical colour]]s are brighter, white being common. On this day alone during Holy Week, the fast is relaxed to permit consumption of wine and oil.\n\nThe primary service of this day is [[Vespers]] combined with the [[Liturgy of St. Basil|Liturgy of St. Basil the Great]] at which is read the first Passion Gospel ({{bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1}}), known as the \"Gospel of the Testament\", and many of the normal hymns of the Divine Liturgy are substituted with the following [[troparion]]:\n\n<blockquote>''Of Thy Mystical Supper, O Son of God, accept me today as a communicant; for I will not speak of Thy [[Sacred Mysteries|Mystery]] to Thine enemies, neither will I give Thee a kiss like Judas. But like the [[The Good Thief (Christianity)|Thief]] will I confess Thee: Remember me, O Lord, in Thy [[Paradise|Kingdom]].''</blockquote>\n\nWhen necessary to replenish the [[Church tabernacle#Reserved sacrament|sacrament for communing the sick at a time not following a divine liturgy]], an additional [[Lamb (Liturgy)|Lamb (Host)]] is consecrated on this day, [[Intinction#Eastern Christianity|intincted]], covered, and left to dry until Holy Saturday when it is divided, completely dried with a candle flame, and the pieces placed in the [[Church tabernacle#Communion for the Sick|artophorion]].\n\nIn [[cathedral]]s and [[monasteries]] the ceremony of the [[Washing of Feet]] is normally performed.\n\nWhen there is need to [[consecrate]] more [[chrism]], that is performed by patriarchs and other heads of the various [[autocephalous]] churches.\n\n[[File:Passion Gospels - Great Thursday -- Annunciation, Toronto, 2015.JPG|right|thumb| Reading of the 12th Passion Gospel on Great and Holy Thursday]]\nIn the evening, after the Liturgy, all of the [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] are changed to black or some other dark colour, to signify the beginning of the Passion. Anticipating the Matins of Friday morning, the Holy Passion service of the reading of the '''Twelve Gospels''' is conducted. In these readings Christ's last instructions to his disciples are presented, as well as the prophecy of the drama of the Cross, Christ's prayer, and his new commandment. The twelve readings are:\n* John 13:31\u201318:1\n* John 18:1\u201329\n* Matthew 26:57\u201375\n* John 18:28\u201319:16\n* Matthew 27:3\u201332\n* Mark 15:16\u201332\n* Matthew 27:33\u201354\n* Luke 23:32\u201349\n* John 19:19\u201337\n* Mark 15:43\u201347\n* John 19:38\u201342\n* Matthew 27:62\u201366\nBeginning on Holy and Great Thursday, the [[Memorial service (Orthodox)#Lity|memorial service for the dead]] is forbidden until after [[Thomas Sunday]].\n{{clear}}\n{{Lent_calendar.svg}}\n\n=====Local customs=====\n* In Greek practice, the [[Sacrament|Mystery]] of [[Unction]] is performed on [[Holy Wednesday|Great Wednesday]] as preparation for the reception of Holy Communion on Great Thursday and Pascha, a custom that originated when Greece was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control and parish priests, being uneducated, were not permitted to hear confession, so this sacrament, by which sins are believed to be forgiven, came to be performed.\n* In Greek tradition, a procession is made during the service of the Twelve Passion Gospels. It takes place after the reading of the fifth gospel during the singing of \"Today He Who Hung\". During this procession, a large cross with the body of Christ is carried throughout the church while lights are extinguished, bells are slowly tolled, and the faithful prostrate themselves. The cross, with Christ's body hung upon it, is placed in front of the Royal Doors. The icon of Christ on the cross (sometimes with nails affixing it) is struck upon the hands and feet with a stone multiple times, and is then stood up in front of the church, where it is censed.\n* In some Slavic traditions, a lesser procession is made after the Twelve Passion Gospels immediately prior to the dismissal with an icon of Christ's crucifixion which is placed on the central icon stand, where it is censed by the clergy, and then venerated.\n\n====Oriental Orthodoxy====\n{{Empty section|date=March 2018}}\nOriental Orthodoxy including Coptic (Egyptian) and Ethiopian Orthodoxy which is under papacy of Pope Tawadros II The Copts celebrate Covenant Thursday on 16 April which is 1 week after the Catholics celebrate it. They have praises and vespers every day of week and on Thursday and Saturday they stay praising God and reading about the First Liturgy and Judas\u2019 Betrayal. On Saturday they sing praises for the Entrance of the Messiah in Hades freeing all of the faithful ones including Moses and Abraham etc.\n\n==Customs and names from around the world==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Bishop Sebouh - Washing of Feet.jpg|thumb|Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian ([[Armenian Apostolic Church]]) washing the feet of children during the Washing of Feet ceremony]]\n* If statues and crucifixes have been covered during Passion Time (the last 2 weeks of Lent, at least in the 1962 Catholic missal), the crucifix covers are allowed to be white instead of purple for Holy Thursday.\n* Maundy Thursday celebrations in the [[United Kingdom]] (also called [[Royal Maundy]]) today involve the [[Monarch]] offering \"alms\" to deserving senior citizens, one man and one woman for each year of the sovereign's age. These coins, known as [[Maundy money]] or Royal Maundy, are distributed in red and white purses, and is a custom dating back to [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. The red purse contains regular currency and is given in place of food and clothing; the white purse has money in the amount of one penny for each year of the Sovereign's age. Since 1822, rather than ordinary money, the Sovereign gives out [[Maundy money#Maundy coinage|Maundy coins]],<ref>[http://www.royalmint.com/RoyalMint/web/site/Corporate/Corp_british_coinage/Maundy_Money.asp The Royal Mint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328121720/http://www.royalmint.com/RoyalMint/web/site/Corporate/Corp_british_coinage/Maundy_Money.asp |date=28 March 2007 }}</ref> which are specially minted 1, 2, 3 and 4 penny pieces, and are legal tender. The service at which this takes place rotates around English and Welsh churches, though in 2008 it took place for the first time in [[Northern Ireland]] at [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Armagh Cathedral]]. Until the death of King [[James II of England|James II]], the [[Monarch]] would also wash the feet of the selected poor people. There is an old sketch, done from life, of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] washing people's feet on Maundy Thursday. \n* The popular [[German (language)|German]] name ''Gr\u00fcndonnerstag'' means either \"mourning Thursday\" or \"green Thursday\".<ref>The word is of medieval origin and may refer to the possible use of green vestments on this day in some regions, or to a custom of eating green salad or pancakes (cf. [http://germazope.uni-trier.de/Projects/WBB/woerterbuecher/dwb/wbgui?lemid=GG26646 Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]). The name could also derive from [[Old High German]] ''gr\u012bnan'' (\"mourn\" or \"wail\", cf. Engl. ''groan''), referring to the death of Jesus or the [[penitent]]s' return to the [[eucharist]] on this day in older times (K. K\u00fcppers, \"Gr\u00fcndonnerstag\", In ''Lexikon des Mittelalters'', vol. IV,, DTV, Munich, 2003).</ref>\n* In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the day is called ''Zelen\u00fd \u010dtvrtek'' or ''Zelen\u00fd \u0161tvrtok'' respectively, again meaning \"Green Thursday\". It is because the typical meals of this day were made of fresh, green vegetables etc. From that day there is no usage of the [[church bell]]s until [[Holy Saturday]], here called \"White Saturday\", because \"they have flown to [[Rome]]\" (a euphemism), in some regions they are replaced by groups of children walking round their village (or around the church) and making noise with wooden rattles. This is to announce to the people approaching beginning of the liturgy and call the people to the church.\n* The tradition of silent bells is found also in [[Luxembourg]]: the bells fall silent until Easter, because \"they have flown to Rome for Confession\", so children take to the streets, calling people to church with melancholy wooden rattling.<ref>Festivals of Western Europe, by Dorothy Gladys Spicer, 1958</ref>\n* In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], the day is called ''Witte Donderdag'' (White Thursday) referring to the [[liturgical colour]] of the day.\n* In [[Malta]], Holy Thursday is known as ''\u0126amis ix-Xirka'' (Communion Thursday) and the tradition of [[Seven Churches Visitation|visiting seven churches]] (see below) is called ''is-seba' visti'' or is-Sepulkri.\n* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Maundy Thursday is ''Dydd Iau Cablyd''.\n* In [[Sweden]] Maundy Thursday (sk\u00e4rtorsdagen) is connected to old folklore as the day of the witches. Young children often dress up as witches and knock on doors getting coins or candy for easter eggs.\n* In [[Bulgaria]] Maundy Thursday is called ''Veliki Chetvurtuk'' (Great Thursday), and is traditionally the day when people color their easter eggs and perform other household chores geared toward preparing for ''Razpeti Petuk'' (Crucifixion Friday), ''Velika Subota'' (Great Saturday) and ''Velikden'' (Easter Day).\n* In [[Kerala]] State in [[India]], the day is called as ''[[Pesaha]]''(\u0d2a\u0d46\u0d38\u0d39), a [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] word derived from the Aramaic or Syriac word for [[Passover]]. It is a statewide public holiday declared by the [[Government of Kerala]], given the high number of Christians in the state. The tradition of consuming ''[[Pesaha appam]]'' or ''Indariyappam'' is customary after special longer [[Holy Qurbana]], which are conducted on the or at midnight till morning in churches of Saint Thomas Christians. On the evening before Good Friday the Pesaha bread is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they use a sweet drink call ''Pesaha Paal'' made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread. On the Pesaha night the bread is steamed in a new vessel, immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out the steam so that the bread will not rise. This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members after prayers. In some families, ''Pesaha Paal'' a creamy dip made up of jaggery and coconut milk is used along with the Pesaha bread. If the family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but some of the Saint Thomas Christian neighbours share their bread with them.<ref>Sunish George J Alumkalnal, (2013). \"[https://www.nasrani.net/2012/11/11/pesaha-celebration-of-nasranis-a-socio-cultural-analysis/ Pesaha celebration of Nasranis: a sociocultural analysis].\" ''Journal of Indo Judaic studies'' '''13''', pp.&nbsp;57\u201371</ref> The Saint Thomas Christians diaspora also celebrate this day by having Holy Communion services in the parishes according to their respective liturgies. The tradition of washing feet by priests is practiced in every parish commemorating [[Jesus]] washing the feet of his disciples symbolizing humbleness.\n* In the [[Philippines]], the day is officially known as ''Huwebes Santo'' or \"Maundy Thursday\" (the term \"Holy Thursday\" is rarely used). Most businesses are closed during the [[Easter Triduum]], with shopping malls opening on Black Saturday. Terrestrial television and radio stations either go completely off-air during the Triduum or operate on shorter hours with special programming; cable channels usually retain their normal programming. Newspapers do not publish on Good Friday and Black Saturday.\n\n===Public holiday===\n[[File:ChristWashingFeet.JPG|thumb|''Christus'', by the Lutheran [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. This woodcut of {{bibleverse||John|13:14\u201317}} is from ''Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist''.]]\nMaundy Thursday is a public holiday in most countries that were part of the [[Spanish empire]] ([[Argentina]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/europe/maundy_thursday.php |title=Maundy Thursday |publisher=officeholidays.com |date= |accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref> [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]],<ref>except in the regions of Catalonia and Valencia</ref> [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]]), countries that were part of the [[Danish colonial empire]] ([[Denmark]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/turistinformation/fakta-az/helligedage.htm |title=Planning your trip_www.visitdenmark.com |publisher=VisitDenmark |date= |accessdate=13 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309021041/http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/turistinformation/fakta-az/helligedage.htm |archive-date=9 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[United States Virgin Islands]]), and in the [[Kerala]] State of [[India]].\nCertain German states declare a public holiday for public sector employees. In the UK, civil servants were traditionally granted a half-day holiday (known as \"privilege leave\") on this date, but that was abolished after 2012.\n\n===Seven Churches Visitation===\n{{main|Seven Churches Visitation}}\nThe tradition of visiting seven churches on Holy Thursday is an ancient practice, probably originating in [[Rome]].<ref name=Hill>{{Cite web |url=http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/join-7-church-visits |title=Hill, William. \"Join the 7-church visits\", Diocese of Pittsburgh, April 11, 2014 |access-date=30 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521120610/http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/join-7-church-visits |archive-date=21 May 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and occurs among the faithful in countries around the world.\n\nIn [[India]], the custom is to visit fourteen churches, one per [[Station of the Cross]]. Traditionally, this is performed on Maundy Thursday evening but is more often done on the morning of Good Friday or on any day of Lent. Usually, whole families would participate, customarily [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|fasting]] for the duration of the rite. It is also undertaken by parish devotional groups.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], the tradition is called ''[[Visita Iglesia]]'' ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]], \"church visit\"), where people visit churches to pray, usually reciting the [[Stations of the Cross]]. The Stations are often distributed amongst one, seven, or fourteen churches; the custom until the 1970s was to pray all fourteen in each church. It is a chiefly urban custom, as churches are located closer to each other in [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]], and supposedly because it originates in visiting the seven churches of [[Intramuros]] that stood until the 1945 [[Bombing of Manila]].<ref>Of the seven, only [[Manila Cathedral]] and [[San Agustin Church, Manila|San Agust\u00edn Church]] remain ''[[in situ]]'' following the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]].</ref> The original purpose of the ritual was to venerate the [[Blessed Sacrament]] in the [[Altar of Repose]] on Maundy Thursday night, but since no prayers were prescribed (apart from those for the [[Pope]]), the Stations of the Cross were recited. Some Filipino liturgists{{who|date=March 2013}}, however, have sought to revive the original vigil before the Blessed Sacrament, and have composed prayers to guide contemporary worshippers.\n\nIn [[Singapore]], the visiting of churches occurs shortly after the evening Mass of the Last Supper. Prayers at each church consist of seven repetitions of the [[Lord's Prayer]], [[Ave Maria]], and the ''[[Gloria Patri]]''. Due to the new trend of late Mass times (sometimes 7 or 8&nbsp;pm) to allow for more churchgoers, eight churches are the maximum number visited (even in the city area, where these are closer to each other than in outer residential areas) before these close at midnight. A festive atmosphere exists, with the sale of drinks, [[hot cross bun]]s and other local snacks like the traditional ''kueh ko chee''. Observant Catholics have a 'Last Supper' meal in anticipation of the next day's fast.\n\n==See also==\n{{Death of Jesus |Holy Week}}\n* [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]\n* [[Easter Triduum]]\n* [[Friday of Sorrows|Friday of Sorrows (Friday before Palm Sunday)]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[wikt:maundy|Maundy]]\n* [[Paschal cycle]]\n* [[Tenebrae (service)]]\n* [[Thursday of the Dead]]\n* [[Tristis est anima mea (responsory)]], second responsory for the Tenebrae at Maundy Thursday\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{CathEncy|wstitle=Maundy Thursday}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|Maundy Thursday}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-homily-for-chrism-mass-full-text Pope Francis, \"Homily for Chrism Mass\", ''News.va'', March 28, 2013]\n* [http://www.saintcd.com/2017/04/09/chrism-mass-its-symbols-and-their-meaning/ Cosentino, Tony. \"Chrism Mass: its Symbols and Their Meaning\", Diocese of St. Catherine's, Ontario]\n\n{{-}}\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n{{Philippine national holidays}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Thursday observances]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox liturgical days]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n[[Category:April observances]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Greece]]\n[[Category:Greek traditions]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Honduras]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Paraguay]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Peru]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Spain]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Venezuela]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Iceland]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Norway]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Christian holiday commemorating the Last Supper}}\n{{About||the 2006 film|Maundy Thursday (film)}}\n{{redirect|Holy Thursday}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{Infobox holiday\n|holiday_name = Maundy Thursday\n|image = Simon ushakov last supper 1685.jpg\n|caption = ''The Mystical Supper'', [[Icon]] by [[Simon Ushakov]] (1685)\n|nickname = Holy Thursday<br />Covenant Thursday<br />Great and Holy Thursday<br />Thursday of Mysteries<br />Sheer Thursday\n|observedby = Christians\n|date{{LASTYEAR}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{LASTYEAR}}}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{LASTYEAR}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|date{{CURRENTYEAR}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{CURRENTYEAR}} |cite=y}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{CURRENTYEAR}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|date{{NEXTYEAR}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR}}}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|date{{NEXTYEAR|2}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR|2}}}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR|2}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|observances = [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]; distribution of [[Maundy money]]\n|type = [[Christianity|Christian]] / [[Civic holiday|Civic]]\n|significance = Commemorates the [[Foot washing|Maundy]] and [[Last Supper]] of [[Jesus Christ]]\n|relatedto = [[Holy Week]]\n|frequency = annual\n|duration = 1 day\n}}\n'''Maundy Thursday''' (also known as '''Holy Thursday''', '''Covenant Thursday''', '''Great and Holy Thursday''', '''Sheer Thursday''', and '''Thursday of Mysteries''', among other names) is the Christian holy day falling on the Thursday before [[Easter]].

In the fifth century, the ceremony of the oils was transferred from the Holy Saturday Vigil to Holy Thursday during a special Mass for that purpose, distinct from the Mass of the Lord's Supper. In the decree renewing this rite [[Pope Paul VI]] said:\u201cThe Chrism Mass is one of the principal expressions of the fullness of the bishop\u2019s priesthood and signifies the closeness of the priests with him.\u201d<ref name=Baltimore/>\n[[File:BlessingChrism.jpg|thumb|Blessing Chrism]]\nThe Holy Oils are:\n* [[Chrism]] \u2013 used in the sacraments of [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation in the Catholic Church|Confirmation]] and [[Holy orders in the Catholic Church|Holy Orders]], as well as for the consecration of altars and the dedication of churches.<ref>[http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/Events/2017/album-chrismmass.aspx \"Chrism Mass 2017\", St. James Cathedral, Seattle, April 6, 2017]</ref>\n* the [[oil of catechumens]] \u2013 also used in the sacrament of Baptism, and\n* the oil of the sick \u2013 used in the rite of the [[Anointing of the Sick]]\n\nThe oil of the catechumens and chrism are used on the upcoming [[Holy Saturday]] at the [[Easter Vigil]], for the [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]] of those entering the church. While the Oil of the Catechumens and the Oil of the Sick, are simply \"blessed,\" the Sacred Chrism is \"consecrated,\". Holy chrism is a mixture of olive oil and balsam, an aromatic resin. Balsam is poured into the oil, which gives it a sweet smell intended to remind those who encounter it of the \"odor of sanctity\" to which those who are marked with it, are called to strive. The bishop breathes over the vessel containing the chrism, a gesture which symbolizes the Holy Spirit coming down to consecrate this oil, and recalls the actions of Jesus in John 20:22, when he breathed on the apostles and said, \"Receive the Holy Spirit...\"<ref name=Jalbert/><ref name=Baltimore>[https://www.archbalt.org/about-us/our-bishops/cardinal-obrien/articles/chism-mass.cfm \"Chrism Mass\", ''Catholic Review'', Archdiocese of Baltimore, March 27, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413153522/https://www.archbalt.org/about-us/our-bishops/cardinal-obrien/articles/chism-mass.cfm |date=13 April 2017 }}</ref>\n\nWith respect to Anglicanism, the 1979 [[Book of Common Prayer]] (p.&nbsp;307) calls for chrism to be consecrated by the bishop. In many dioceses, the consecration of chrism by the bishop may be done at a service of reaffirmation of ordination vows during Holy Week. During the Chrism Eucharist, the Bishop will bless the oils used throughout the next year for baptisms and healing. In addition, the Bishop and clergy in attendance will reaffirm their Ordination Vows.<ref name=Tennessee/>\n\n===Eastern Christianity===\n====Eastern Orthodoxy====\n[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|left|Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]])]]\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[liturgical colour]]s are brighter, white being common. On this day alone during Holy Week, the fast is relaxed to permit consumption of wine and oil.\n\nThe primary service of this day is [[Vespers]] combined with the [[Liturgy of St. Basil|Liturgy of St. Basil the Great]] at which is read the first Passion Gospel ({{bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1}}), known as the \"Gospel of the Testament\", and many of the normal hymns of the Divine Liturgy are substituted with the following [[troparion]]:\n\n<blockquote>''Of Thy Mystical Supper, O Son of God, accept me today as a communicant; for I will not speak of Thy [[Sacred Mysteries|Mystery]] to Thine enemies, neither will I give Thee a kiss like Judas. But like the [[The Good Thief (Christianity)|Thief]] will I confess Thee: Remember me, O Lord, in Thy [[Paradise|Kingdom]].''</blockquote>\n\nWhen necessary to replenish the [[Church tabernacle#Reserved sacrament|sacrament for communing the sick at a time not following a divine liturgy]], an additional [[Lamb (Liturgy)|Lamb (Host)]] is consecrated on this day, [[Intinction#Eastern Christianity|intincted]], covered, and left to dry until Holy Saturday when it is divided, completely dried with a candle flame, and the pieces placed in the [[Church tabernacle#Communion for the Sick|artophorion]].\n\nIn [[cathedral]]s and [[monasteries]] the ceremony of the [[Washing of Feet]] is normally performed.\n\nWhen there is need to [[consecrate]] more [[chrism]], that is performed by patriarchs and other heads of the various [[autocephalous]] churches.\n\n[[File:Passion Gospels - Great Thursday -- Annunciation, Toronto, 2015.JPG|right|thumb| Reading of the 12th Passion Gospel on Great and Holy Thursday]]\nIn the evening, after the Liturgy, all of the [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] are changed to black or some other dark colour, to signify the beginning of the Passion. Anticipating the Matins of Friday morning, the Holy Passion service of the reading of the '''Twelve Gospels''' is conducted. In these readings Christ's last instructions to his disciples are presented, as well as the prophecy of the drama of the Cross, Christ's prayer, and his new commandment. The twelve readings are:\n* John 13:31\u201318:1\n* John 18:1\u201329\n* Matthew 26:57\u201375\n* John 18:28\u201319:16\n* Matthew 27:3\u201332\n* Mark 15:16\u201332\n* Matthew 27:33\u201354\n* Luke 23:32\u201349\n* John 19:19\u201337\n* Mark 15:43\u201347\n* John 19:38\u201342\n* Matthew 27:62\u201366\nBeginning on Holy and Great Thursday, the [[Memorial service (Orthodox)#Lity|memorial service for the dead]] is forbidden until after [[Thomas Sunday]].\n{{clear}}\n{{Lent_calendar.svg}}\n\n=====Local customs=====\n* In Greek practice, the [[Sacrament|Mystery]] of [[Unction]] is performed on [[Holy Wednesday|Great Wednesday]] as preparation for the reception of Holy Communion on Great Thursday and Pascha, a custom that originated when Greece was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control and parish priests, being uneducated, were not permitted to hear confession, so this sacrament, by which sins are believed to be forgiven, came to be performed.\n* In Greek tradition, a procession is made during the service of the Twelve Passion Gospels. It takes place after the reading of the fifth gospel during the singing of \"Today He Who Hung\". During this procession, a large cross with the body of Christ is carried throughout the church while lights are extinguished, bells are slowly tolled, and the faithful prostrate themselves. The cross, with Christ's body hung upon it, is placed in front of the Royal Doors. The icon of Christ on the cross (sometimes with nails affixing it) is struck upon the hands and feet with a stone multiple times, and is then stood up in front of the church, where it is censed.\n* In some Slavic traditions, a lesser procession is made after the Twelve Passion Gospels immediately prior to the dismissal with an icon of Christ's crucifixion which is placed on the central icon stand, where it is censed by the clergy, and then venerated.\n\n====Oriental Orthodoxy====\n{{Empty section|date=March 2018}}\nOriental Orthodoxy including Coptic (Egyptian) and Ethiopian Orthodoxy which is under papacy of Pope Tawadros II The Copts celebrate Covenant Thursday on 16 April which is 1 week after the Catholics celebrate it. They have praises and vespers every day of week and on Thursday and Saturday they stay praising God and reading about the First Liturgy and Judas\u2019 Betrayal. On Saturday they sing praises for the Entrance of the Messiah in Hades freeing all of the faithful ones including Moses and Abraham etc.\n\n==Customs and names from around the world==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Bishop Sebouh - Washing of Feet.jpg|thumb|Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian ([[Armenian Apostolic Church]]) washing the feet of children during the Washing of Feet ceremony]]\n* If statues and crucifixes have been covered during Passion Time (the last 2 weeks of Lent, at least in the 1962 Catholic missal), the crucifix covers are allowed to be white instead of purple for Holy Thursday.\n* Maundy Thursday celebrations in the [[United Kingdom]] (also called [[Royal Maundy]]) today involve the [[Monarch]] offering \"alms\" to deserving senior citizens, one man and one woman for each year of the sovereign's age. These coins, known as [[Maundy money]] or Royal Maundy, are distributed in red and white purses, and is a custom dating back to [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. The red purse contains regular currency and is given in place of food and clothing; the white purse has money in the amount of one penny for each year of the Sovereign's age. Since 1822, rather than ordinary money, the Sovereign gives out [[Maundy money#Maundy coinage|Maundy coins]],<ref>[http://www.royalmint.com/RoyalMint/web/site/Corporate/Corp_british_coinage/Maundy_Money.asp The Royal Mint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328121720/http://www.royalmint.com/RoyalMint/web/site/Corporate/Corp_british_coinage/Maundy_Money.asp |date=28 March 2007 }}</ref> which are specially minted 1, 2, 3 and 4 penny pieces, and are legal tender. The service at which this takes place rotates around English and Welsh churches, though in 2008 it took place for the first time in [[Northern Ireland]] at [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Armagh Cathedral]]. Until the death of King [[James II of England|James II]], the [[Monarch]] would also wash the feet of the selected poor people. There is an old sketch, done from life, of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] washing people's feet on Maundy Thursday. \n* The popular [[German (language)|German]] name ''Gr\u00fcndonnerstag'' means either \"mourning Thursday\" or \"green Thursday\".<ref>The word is of medieval origin and may refer to the possible use of green vestments on this day in some regions, or to a custom of eating green salad or pancakes (cf. [http://germazope.uni-trier.de/Projects/WBB/woerterbuecher/dwb/wbgui?lemid=GG26646 Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]). The name could also derive from [[Old High German]] ''gr\u012bnan'' (\"mourn\" or \"wail\", cf. Engl. ''groan''), referring to the death of Jesus or the [[penitent]]s' return to the [[eucharist]] on this day in older times (K. K\u00fcppers, \"Gr\u00fcndonnerstag\", In ''Lexikon des Mittelalters'', vol. IV,, DTV, Munich, 2003).</ref>\n* In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the day is called ''Zelen\u00fd \u010dtvrtek'' or ''Zelen\u00fd \u0161tvrtok'' respectively, again meaning \"Green Thursday\". It is because the typical meals of this day were made of fresh, green vegetables etc. From that day there is no usage of the [[church bell]]s until [[Holy Saturday]], here called \"White Saturday\", because \"they have flown to [[Rome]]\" (a euphemism), in some regions they are replaced by groups of children walking round their village (or around the church) and making noise with wooden rattles. This is to announce to the people approaching beginning of the liturgy and call the people to the church.\n* The tradition of silent bells is found also in [[Luxembourg]]: the bells fall silent until Easter, because \"they have flown to Rome for Confession\", so children take to the streets, calling people to church with melancholy wooden rattling.<ref>Festivals of Western Europe, by Dorothy Gladys Spicer, 1958</ref>\n* In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], the day is called ''Witte Donderdag'' (White Thursday) referring to the [[liturgical colour]] of the day.\n* In [[Malta]], Holy Thursday is known as ''\u0126amis ix-Xirka'' (Communion Thursday) and the tradition of [[Seven Churches Visitation|visiting seven churches]] (see below) is called ''is-seba' visti'' or is-Sepulkri.\n* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Maundy Thursday is ''Dydd Iau Cablyd''.\n* In [[Sweden]] Maundy Thursday (sk\u00e4rtorsdagen) is connected to old folklore as the day of the witches. Young children often dress up as witches and knock on doors getting coins or candy for easter eggs.\n* In [[Bulgaria]] Maundy Thursday is called ''Veliki Chetvurtuk'' (Great Thursday), and is traditionally the day when people color their easter eggs and perform other household chores geared toward preparing for ''Razpeti Petuk'' (Crucifixion Friday), ''Velika Subota'' (Great Saturday) and ''Velikden'' (Easter Day).\n* In [[Kerala]] State in [[India]], the day is called as ''[[Pesaha]]''(\u0d2a\u0d46\u0d38\u0d39), a [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] word derived from the Aramaic or Syriac word for [[Passover]]. It is a statewide public holiday declared by the [[Government of Kerala]], given the high number of [[Saint Thomas Christians]] in the state. The tradition of consuming ''[[Pesaha appam]]'' or ''Indariyappam'' is customary after special longer [[Holy Qurbana]], which are conducted on the or at midnight till morning in churches of Saint Thomas Christians. On the evening before Good Friday the Pesaha bread is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they use a sweet drink made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread (can be compared to Charoset). On the Pesaha night the bread is steamed in a new vessel, immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out the steam so that the bread will not rise. This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members after prayers. In some families, a creamy dip made up of jaggery and coconut milk is used along with the Pesaha bread. If the family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but some of the Saint Thomas Christian neighbours share their bread with them.<ref>Sunish George J Alumkalnal, (2013). \"[https://www.nasrani.net/2012/11/11/pesaha-celebration-of-nasranis-a-socio-cultural-analysis/ Pesaha celebration of Nasranis: a sociocultural analysis].\" ''Journal of Indo Judaic studies'' '''13''', pp.&nbsp;57\u201371</ref> The Saint Thomas Christians diaspora also celebrate this day by having Holy Communion services in the parishes according to their respective liturgies. The tradition of washing feet by priests is practiced in every parish commemorating [[Jesus]] washing the feet of his disciples symbolizing humbleness.\n* In the [[Philippines]], the day is officially known as ''Huwebes Santo'' or \"Maundy Thursday\" (the term \"Holy Thursday\" is rarely used). Most businesses are closed during the [[Easter Triduum]], with shopping malls opening on Black Saturday. Terrestrial television and radio stations either go completely off-air during the Triduum or operate on shorter hours with special programming; cable channels usually retain their normal programming. Newspapers do not publish on Good Friday and Black Saturday.\n\n===Public holiday===\n[[File:ChristWashingFeet.JPG|thumb|''Christus'', by the Lutheran [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. This woodcut of {{bibleverse||John|13:14\u201317}} is from ''Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist''.]]\nMaundy Thursday is a public holiday in most countries that were part of the [[Spanish empire]] ([[Argentina]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/europe/maundy_thursday.php |title=Maundy Thursday |publisher=officeholidays.com |date= |accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref> [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]],<ref>except in the regions of Catalonia and Valencia</ref> [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]]), countries that were part of the [[Danish colonial empire]] ([[Denmark]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/turistinformation/fakta-az/helligedage.htm |title=Planning your trip_www.visitdenmark.com |publisher=VisitDenmark |date= |accessdate=13 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309021041/http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/turistinformation/fakta-az/helligedage.htm |archive-date=9 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[United States Virgin Islands]]), and in the [[Kerala]] State of [[India]].\nCertain German states declare a public holiday for public sector employees. In the UK, civil servants were traditionally granted a half-day holiday (known as \"privilege leave\") on this date, but that was abolished after 2012.\n\n===Seven Churches Visitation===\n{{main|Seven Churches Visitation}}\nThe tradition of visiting seven churches on Holy Thursday is an ancient practice, probably originating in [[Rome]].<ref name=Hill>{{Cite web |url=http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/join-7-church-visits |title=Hill, William. \"Join the 7-church visits\", Diocese of Pittsburgh, April 11, 2014 |access-date=30 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521120610/http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/join-7-church-visits |archive-date=21 May 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and occurs among the faithful in countries around the world.\n\nIn [[India]], the custom is to visit fourteen churches, one per [[Station of the Cross]]. Traditionally, this is performed on Maundy Thursday evening but is more often done on the morning of Good Friday or on any day of Lent. Usually, whole families would participate, customarily [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|fasting]] for the duration of the rite. It is also undertaken by parish devotional groups.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], the tradition is called ''[[Visita Iglesia]]'' ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]], \"church visit\"), where people visit churches to pray, usually reciting the [[Stations of the Cross]]. The Stations are often distributed amongst one, seven, or fourteen churches; the custom until the 1970s was to pray all fourteen in each church. It is a chiefly urban custom, as churches are located closer to each other in [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]], and supposedly because it originates in visiting the seven churches of [[Intramuros]] that stood until the 1945 [[Bombing of Manila]].<ref>Of the seven, only [[Manila Cathedral]] and [[San Agustin Church, Manila|San Agust\u00edn Church]] remain ''[[in situ]]'' following the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]].</ref> The original purpose of the ritual was to venerate the [[Blessed Sacrament]] in the [[Altar of Repose]] on Maundy Thursday night, but since no prayers were prescribed (apart from those for the [[Pope]]), the Stations of the Cross were recited. Some Filipino liturgists{{who|date=March 2013}}, however, have sought to revive the original vigil before the Blessed Sacrament, and have composed prayers to guide contemporary worshippers.\n\nIn [[Singapore]], the visiting of churches occurs shortly after the evening Mass of the Last Supper. Prayers at each church consist of seven repetitions of the [[Lord's Prayer]], [[Ave Maria]], and the ''[[Gloria Patri]]''. Due to the new trend of late Mass times (sometimes 7 or 8&nbsp;pm) to allow for more churchgoers, eight churches are the maximum number visited (even in the city area, where these are closer to each other than in outer residential areas) before these close at midnight. A festive atmosphere exists, with the sale of drinks, [[hot cross bun]]s and other local snacks like the traditional ''kueh ko chee''. Observant Catholics have a 'Last Supper' meal in anticipation of the next day's fast.\n\n==See also==\n{{Death of Jesus |Holy Week}}\n* [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]\n* [[Easter Triduum]]\n* [[Friday of Sorrows|Friday of Sorrows (Friday before Palm Sunday)]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[wikt:maundy|Maundy]]\n* [[Paschal cycle]]\n* [[Tenebrae (service)]]\n* [[Thursday of the Dead]]\n* [[Tristis est anima mea (responsory)]], second responsory for the Tenebrae at Maundy Thursday\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{CathEncy|wstitle=Maundy Thursday}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|Maundy Thursday}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-homily-for-chrism-mass-full-text Pope Francis, \"Homily for Chrism Mass\", ''News.va'', March 28, 2013]\n* [http://www.saintcd.com/2017/04/09/chrism-mass-its-symbols-and-their-meaning/ Cosentino, Tony. \"Chrism Mass: its Symbols and Their Meaning\", Diocese of St. Catherine's, Ontario]\n\n{{-}}\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n{{Philippine national holidays}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Thursday observances]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox liturgical days]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n[[Category:April observances]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Greece]]\n[[Category:Greek traditions]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Honduras]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Paraguay]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Peru]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Spain]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Venezuela]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Iceland]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Norway]]\n", "name_user": "99v", "label": "safe", "comment": "Pesaha paal is not comparable to Charoset.
