Released on May 11, 1989 through the [[Modern Records (1980)|Modern]] label, the album was recorded in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], mixed in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]], and is loosely based around the theme of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 novel ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.\n\nThe album was a commercial success. It reached number ten on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], propelled by the hit single \"[[Rooms on Fire]]\" (US #16), and achieved Platinum status for selling in excess of 1,000,000 units. The album reached number three in the United Kingdom and was certified Gold there for sales in excess of 100,000 units,{{Certification Cite Ref|type=album|refname=xyzzy|region=United Kingdom|title=The Other Side of the Mirror|artist=Stevie Nicks}} and is Nicks' highest charting album to date in various European countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK.\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the huge success of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s 1987 album ''[[Tango in the Night]]'' in the United Kingdom, ''The Other Side of the Mirror'' became Nicks' highest charting solo album there, reaching number three and spawning her first UK [[Top 40]] hit with \"[[Rooms on Fire]]\" (also #16), which Nicks performed on the [[BBC]] show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The album was certified gold in the UK for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. Her first, and so far only, solo tour of the UK and Europe (Sweden, France and the Netherlands), followed the album, as well as a tour of the United States, though Nicks has famously commented since that she has no recollection of the tours due to her increasing dependency on the prescribed tranquilizer [[Klonopin]] at that time.\n\nIn the US, \"Two Kinds of Love\" was released as a [[Single (music)|single]], featuring vocals by [[Bruce Hornsby]] and instrumental interlude by [[Kenny G]], which became Nicks' first single to fail to chart, missing both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']] and [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] charts completely. \"Long Way to Go\" gained substantial airplay, making [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart, and also made the Top 75 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], as did \"Whole Lotta Trouble\". Promotional [[music video]]s were shot for \"Rooms on Fire\" and \"Whole Lotta Trouble\".

Released on May 11, 1989 through the [[Modern Records (1980)|Modern]] label, the album was recorded in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], mixed in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]], and is loosely based around the theme of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 novel ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.\n\nThe album was a commercial success. It reached number ten on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], propelled by the hit single \"[[Rooms on Fire]]\" (US #16), and achieved Platinum status for selling in excess of 1,000,000 units. The album reached number three in the United Kingdom and was certified Gold there for sales in excess of 100,000 units,{{Certification Cite Ref|type=album|refname=xyzzy|region=United Kingdom|title=The Other Side of the Mirror|artist=Stevie Nicks}} and is Nicks' highest charting album to date in various European countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK.\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the huge success of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s 1987 album ''[[Tango in the Night]]'' in the United Kingdom, ''The Other Side of the Mirror'' became Nicks' highest charting solo album there, reaching number three and spawning her first UK [[Top 40]] hit with \"[[Rooms on Fire]]\" (also #16), which Nicks performed on the [[BBC]] show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The album was certified gold in the UK for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. Her first, and so far only, solo tour of the UK and Europe (Sweden, France and the Netherlands), followed the album, as well as a tour of the United States, though Nicks has famously commented since that she has no recollection of the tours due to her increasing dependency on the prescribed tranquilizer [[Klonopin]] at that time.\n\nIn the US, \"Two Kinds of Love\" was released as a [[Single (music)|single]], featuring vocals by [[Bruce Hornsby]] and instrumental interlude by [[Kenny G]], which became Nicks' first single to fail to chart, missing both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']] and [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] charts completely. \"Long Way to Go\" gained substantial airplay, making [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart, and also made the Top 75 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], as did \"Whole Lotta Trouble\". Promotional [[music video]]s were shot for \"Rooms on Fire\" and \"Whole Lotta Trouble\". The former was released in two slightly different edits, while the \"Whole Lotta Trouble\" video was shot during the American leg of Nicks' tour at the Summit Arena in Houston, Texas.\n\nAn earlier, instrumental version of the song \"Juliet\" (entitled \"Book of Miracles\") was released by Fleetwood Mac in 1987 as the B-side to \"[[Seven Wonders (song)|Seven Wonders]]\", while \u201cOoh My Love\u201d had been demo-ed for ''Tango in the Night'' but was ultimately shelved.

The election used the 19 [[ward (politics)|wards]] created as a result of the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the [[single transferable vote]] system a form of [[proportional representation]], with 68 Councillors being elected.\n\nThe [[2007 Aberdeenshire Council election|2007 election]] saw the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] form a coalition on the Council with the [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party]].\n\nThe 2012 election saw the SNP gain an additional 6 seats and become the largest party on the Council, supplanting the Lib Dems. The Tories retained their 14 seats on the Council and as a result became the second largest party. The Lib Dems lost half their Councillors falling from 24 to 12 seats. [[Independent (politician)|Independents]] also increased their overall numbers to 11 seats while [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] and the [[Scottish Green Party]] won seats in Aberdeenshire for the first time.\n\nFollowing the election a Tory-Lib Dem-Independent administration was formed and in 2013 they were joined by the 2 Labour members. On 8 June 2015, a new administration was formed by the SNP and a 'Progressive Alliance' between Scottish Labour and 2 Progressive Independent councilors, who had been members of the previous administration.\n\n==Results==\n\n{{Election Summary Begin|title = Aberdeenshire Local Election Result 2012}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish National Party\n  |seats      = 28\n  |gain       = 7\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = +6\n  |seats %    = 41.18\n  |votes %    = 38.89\n  |votes      = 27,336\n  |plus/minus = +4.39\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party\n  |seats      = 14\n  |gain       = 2\n  |loss       = 2\n  |net        = -\n  |seats %    = 20.59\n  |votes %    = 21.21\n  |votes      = 14,907\n  |plus/minus = +0.41\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Liberal Democrats\n  |seats      = 12\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 12\n  |net        = -12\n  |seats %    = 17.65\n  |votes %    = 15.36\n  |votes      = 10,797\n  |plus/minus = -9.84\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Independent (politician)\n  |seats      = 11\n  |gain       = 3\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +3\n  |seats %    = 16.18\n  |votes %    = 14.68\n  |votes      = 10,320\n  |plus/minus = +1.98\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Labour Party\n  |seats      = 2\n  |gain       = 2\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +2\n  |seats %    = 2.94\n  |votes %    = 6.81\n  |votes      = 4,785\n  |plus/minus = +1.41\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Green Party\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = 1\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +1\n  |seats %    = 1.47\n  |votes %    = 2.39\n  |votes      = 1,681\n  |plus/minus = +1.29\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Christian Party\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = -\n  |loss       = -\n  |net        = -\n  |seats %    = \n  |votes %    = 0.65\n  |votes      = 460\n  |plus/minus = +0.65\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n<small>'''Note:''' \"Votes\" are the first preference votes.

elections|elections]]. The election used the 19 [[ward (politics)|wards]] created as a result of the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the [[single transferable vote]] system a form of [[proportional representation]], with 68 Councillors being elected.\n\nThe [[2007 Aberdeenshire Council election|2007 election]] saw the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] form a coalition on the Council with the [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party]].\n\nThe 2012 election saw the SNP gain an additional 6 seats and become the largest party on the Council, supplanting the Lib Dems. The Tories retained their 14 seats on the Council and as a result became the second largest party. The Lib Dems lost half their Councillors falling from 24 to 12 seats. [[Independent (politician)|Independents]] also increased their overall numbers to 11 seats while [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] and the [[Scottish Green Party]] won seats in Aberdeenshire for the first time.\n\nFollowing the election a Tory-Lib Dem-Independent administration was formed and in 2013 they were joined by the 2 Labour members. On 8 June 2015, a new administration was formed by the SNP and a 'Progressive Alliance' between Scottish Labour and 2 Progressive Independent councilors, who had been members of the previous administration.\n\n==Results==\n\n{{Election Summary Begin|title = Aberdeenshire Local Election Result 2012}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish National Party\n  |seats      = 28\n  |gain       = 7\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = +6\n  |seats %    = 41.18\n  |votes %    = 38.89\n  |votes      = 27,336\n  |plus/minus = +4.39\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party\n  |seats      = 14\n  |gain       = 2\n  |loss       = 2\n  |net        = -\n  |seats %    = 20.59\n  |votes %    = 21.21\n  |votes      = 14,907\n  |plus/minus = +0.41\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Liberal Democrats\n  |seats      = 12\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 12\n  |net        = -12\n  |seats %    = 17.65\n  |votes %    = 15.36\n  |votes      = 10,797\n  |plus/minus = -9.84\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Independent (politician)\n  |seats      = 11\n  |gain       = 3\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +3\n  |seats %    = 16.18\n  |votes %    = 14.68\n  |votes      = 10,320\n  |plus/minus = +1.98\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Labour Party\n  |seats      = 2\n  |gain       = 2\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +2\n  |seats %    = 2.94\n  |votes %    = 6.81\n  |votes      = 4,785\n  |plus/minus = +1.41\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Green Party\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = 1\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +1\n  |seats %    = 1.47\n  |votes %    = 2.39\n  |votes      = 1,681\n  |plus/minus = +1.29\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Christian Party\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = -\n  |loss       = -\n  |net        = -\n  |seats %    = \n  |votes %    = 0.65\n  |votes      = 460\n  |plus/minus = +0.65\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n<small>'''Note:''' \"Votes\" are the first preference votes.

The election used the eight [[ward (politics)|wards]], created as a result of the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the [[single transferable vote]] system a form of [[proportional representation]], with 29 Councillors being elected.\n\nThe 2007 Election saw the [[Scottish National Party]] lose majority control on the Council. In their stead the Angus Alliance took over the leadership of the Council made up of all parties and groupings opposed to the SNP. Two independent councillors (one elected in 2007, the other elected at a by-election in 2011) remained outside the Angus Alliance.\n\nThe 2012 election saw the SNP gain 2 additional seats  and regain their overall majority on the Council. [[Independent (politician)|Independents]] also increased their overall numbers and became the second largest grouping while all other parties;  the [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party]], [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] and the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] lost seats. The Conservative and Unionist Party are the second largest political party represented on the council.\n\nFollowing the election the Scottish National Party formed the administration on the Council. Cllr Ian Gaul (Kirriemuir and Dean) was appointed Leader of the Council at the subsequent statutory meeting, Cllr Paul Valentine (Montrose) Depute Leader. Cllr Helen Oswald (Carnoustie and District) was elected Provost.\n\n==Election result==\n\n{{Election Summary Begin|title = Angus Local Election Result 2012}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish National Party\n  |seats      = 15\n  |gain       = 3\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = {{increase}}2\n  |seats %    = 51.72\n  |votes %    = 44.38\n  |votes      = 14,689\n  |plus/minus = {{increase}}6.08\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Independent (politician)\n  |seats      = 8\n  |gain       = 3\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = {{increase}}2\n  |seats %    = 27.59\n  |votes %    = 24.24\n  |votes      = 8,023\n  |plus/minus = {{increase}}3.34\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party\n  |seats      = 4\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = {{decrease}}1\n  |seats %    = 13.79\n  |votes %    = 17.71\n  |votes      = 5,863\n  |plus/minus = {{decrease}}1.39\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Labour Party\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = {{decrease}}1\n  |seats %    = 3.45\n  |votes %    = 7.34\n  |votes      = 2,429\n  |plus/minus = {{decrease}}4.46\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Liberal Democrats\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 2\n  |net        = {{decrease}}2\n  |seats %    = 3.45\n  |votes %    = 5.77\n  |votes      = 1,911\n  |plus/minus = {{decrease}}3.93\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n<small>'''Note:''' \"Votes\" are the first preference votes.

government]] [[2012 Scottish local elections|elections]]. The election used the eight [[ward (politics)|wards]], created as a result of the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the [[single transferable vote]] system a form of [[proportional representation]], with 29 Councillors being elected.\n\nThe 2007 Election saw the [[Scottish National Party]] lose majority control on the Council. In their stead the Angus Alliance took over the leadership of the Council made up of all parties and groupings opposed to the SNP. Two independent councillors (one elected in 2007, the other elected at a by-election in 2011) remained outside the Angus Alliance.\n\nThe 2012 election saw the SNP gain 2 additional seats  and regain their overall majority on the Council. [[Independent (politician)|Independents]] also increased their overall numbers and became the second largest grouping while all other parties;  the [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party]], [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] and the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] lost seats. The Conservative and Unionist Party are the second largest political party represented on the council.\n\nFollowing the election the Scottish National Party formed the administration on the Council. Cllr Ian Gaul (Kirriemuir and Dean) was appointed Leader of the Council at the subsequent statutory meeting, Cllr Paul Valentine (Montrose) Depute Leader. Cllr Helen Oswald (Carnoustie and District) was elected Provost.\n\n==Election result==\n\n{{Election Summary Begin|title = Angus Local Election Result 2012}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish National Party\n  |seats      = 15\n  |gain       = 3\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = {{increase}}2\n  |seats %    = 51.72\n  |votes %    = 44.38\n  |votes      = 14,689\n  |plus/minus = {{increase}}6.08\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Independent (politician)\n  |seats      = 8\n  |gain       = 3\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = {{increase}}2\n  |seats %    = 27.59\n  |votes %    = 24.24\n  |votes      = 8,023\n  |plus/minus = {{increase}}3.34\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party\n  |seats      = 4\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = {{decrease}}1\n  |seats %    = 13.79\n  |votes %    = 17.71\n  |votes      = 5,863\n  |plus/minus = {{decrease}}1.39\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Labour Party\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 1\n  |net        = {{decrease}}1\n  |seats %    = 3.45\n  |votes %    = 7.34\n  |votes      = 2,429\n  |plus/minus = {{decrease}}4.46\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Liberal Democrats\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 2\n  |net        = {{decrease}}2\n  |seats %    = 3.45\n  |votes %    = 5.77\n  |votes      = 1,911\n  |plus/minus = {{decrease}}3.93\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n<small>'''Note:''' \"Votes\" are the first preference votes.

The arrow represents [[Euclidean vector|right-pointing arrow notation or harpoons]]. [[Shorthand|Shorthand notation]]s include [[tildes]] and [[Macron (diacritic)|straight line]]s placed respectively, below or above the name of a vector.\n\nIn advanced mathematics, vector are often represented in simple italic type, like any [[variable (mathematics)|variable]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a ''vector'' was coined by [[W. R. Hamilton]] about 1843 as he revealed [[quaternion]]s, a system using vectors and scalars to span a four-dimensional space. For a quaternion ''q'' = ''a'' + ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, Hamilton used two projections: '''S''' ''q'' = ''a'', for the scalar part of ''q'', and '''V''' ''q'' = ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, the vector part. Using the modern terms ''cross product'' (\u00d7) and ''dot product'' (.), the ''quaternion product'' of two vectors ''p'' and ''q'' can be written ''pq'' = \u2013''p''.''q'' + ''p''\u00d7''q''. In 1878 [[W. K. Clifford]] severed the two products to make the quaternion operation useful for students in his textbook ''[[Elements of Dynamic]]''. Lecturing at [[Yale University]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] supplied notation for the [[scalar product]] and [[vector product]]s, which was introduced in ''[[Vector Analysis (Gibbs/Wilson)|Vector Analysis]]''.<ref>[[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] (1901) [https://archive.org/details/117714283 Vector Analysis, based on the Lectures of J. W. Gibbs] at [[Internet Archive]]</ref> \n\nIn 1891 [[Oliver Heaviside]] argued for [[Clarendon (typeface)|Clarendon]] to distinguish vectors from scalars. He criticized the use of [[Greek letters]] by Tait and [[Fraktur|Gothic letters]] by Maxwell.<ref>[[Oliver Heaviside]], ''The Electrical Journal'', Volume 28. James Gray, 1891. [https://books.google.com/books?id=we4fAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA109 109] ([https://books.google.com/books?id=nRJbAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA109 alt])</ref>\n\nIn 1912 J.B. Shaw contributed his \"Comparative Notation for Vector Expressions\" to the ''Bulletin'' of the [[Quaternion Society]].<ref>J.B. Shaw (1912) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498&view=1up&seq=410 Comparative Notation for Vector Expressions], ''Bulletin'' of the [[Quaternion Society]] via [[Hathi Trust]].</ref> Subsequently, [[Alexander Macfarlane]] described 15 criteria for clear expression with vectors in the same publication.<ref>[[Alexander Macfarlane]] (1912) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=426 A System of Notation for Vector-Analysis; with a Discussion of the Underlying Principles] from ''Bulletin of the Quaternion Society''</ref>\n\nVector ideas were advanced by [[Hermann Grassmann]] in 1841 and again in 1862 in the [[German language]]. But German mathematicians were not taken with quaternions as much as were English-speaking mathematicians. When [[Felix Klein]] was organizing the [[Klein's encyclopedia|German mathematical encyclopedia]], he assigned [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] to standardize vector notation.<ref>[[Karin Reich]] (1995) [http://www.kk.s.bw.schule.de/mathge/mehm2.htm Die Rolle Arnold Sommerfeld bei der Diskussion um die Vektorrechnung]</ref> In 1950, when [[Academic Press]] published G. Kuerti\u2019s translation of the second edition of volume 2 of ''Lectures on Theoretical Physics'' by Sommerfeld, vector notation was the subject of a footnote: \"In the original German text, vectors ''and'' their components are printed in the same Gothic types. The more usual way of making a typographical distinction between the two has been adopted for this translation.\"<ref>{{Google books|L6RmDAAAQBAJ|Mechanics of Deformable Bodies|page=10}}</ref>\n\n==Rectangular vectors==\n[[File:Rectangle Geometry Vector.svg|thumb|Rectangle]]\n[[File:Cuboid simple.svg|thumb|Rectangular cuboid]]\nA rectangular vector is a [[coordinate vector]] specified by components that define a [[rectangle]] (or [[rectangular prism]] in three dimensions, and similar shapes in greater dimensions).  The starting point and terminal point of the vector lie at opposite ends of the rectangle (or prism, etc.).\n\n===Ordered set notation===\nA rectangular vector in [[real coordinate space|<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>]] can be specified using an ordered [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of components, enclosed in either parentheses or angle brackets.\n\nIn a general sense, an ''n''-dimensional vector '''v''' can be specified in either of the following forms:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{n - 1}, v_n)</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\langle v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{n - 1}, v_n \\rangle</math>\n\nWhere ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''v''<sub>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1</sub>, ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> are the components of '''v'''.\n\n===Matrix notation===\nA rectangular vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> can also be specified as a row or column [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] containing the ordered set of components.  A vector specified as a row matrix is known as a [[row vector]]; one specified as a column matrix is known as a [[column vector]].\n\nAgain, an ''n''-dimensional vector <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> can be specified in either of the following forms using matrices:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\cdots & v_{n - 1} & v_n \\end{matrix} \\right] = \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\cdots & v_{n - 1} & v_n \\end{matrix} \\right)</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n - 1} \\\\ v_n \\end{matrix} \\right]= \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n - 1} \\\\ v_n \\end{matrix} \\right)</math>\n\nWhere ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''v''<sub>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1</sub>, ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> are the components of '''v'''. In some advanced contexts, a row and a column vector have different meaning; see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]].\n\n===Unit vector notation===\nA rectangular vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> (or fewer dimensions, such as <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> where <math>v_z</math> below is zero) can be specified as the sum of the scalar multiples of the components of the vector with the members of the standard [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>.  The basis is represented with the [[unit vector]]s <math>\\mathbf{i} = (1, 0, 0)</math>, <math>\\mathbf{j} = (0, 1, 0)</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{k} = (0, 0, 1)</math>.\n\nA three-dimensional vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be specified in the following form, using unit vector notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = v_x \\mathbf{i} + v_y \\mathbf{j} + v_z \\mathbf{k}</math>\n\nWhere <math>v_x</math>, <math>v_y</math>, and <math>v_z</math> are the scalar components of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>.  Scalar components may be positive or negative; the absolute value of a scalar component is a magnitude.\n\n==Polar vectors==\n{{distinguish|text=[[Polar vector]], a true vector, in a context where pseudo vectors or axial vectors are considered}} \n[[Image:CircularCoordinates.svg|thumb|250px|Points in the polar coordinate system with pole ''O'' and polar axis ''L''. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees, or (3,60\u00b0). In blue, the point (4,210\u00b0).]]\nThe two [[polar coordinates]] of a point in a plane may be considered as a two dimensional vector. Such a \n''polar vector'' consists of a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] (or length) and a direction (or angle). The magnitude, typically represented as ''r'', is the distance from a starting point, the [[origin (geometry)|origin]], to the point which is represented. The angle, typically represented as ''\u03b8'' (the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[theta]]), is the angle, usually measured {{shy|counter|clockwise}}, between a fixed direction, typically that of the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction from the origin to the point. The angle is typically reduced to lie within the range <math>0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi</math> radians or <math>0 \\le \\theta < 360^{\\circ}</math>.\n\nIt must be emphasized that a ''polar vector'' is not really a [[vector (mathematics)|vector]], since the [[addition]] of two polar vectors is not defined.\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nPolar vectors can be specified using either ordered pair notation (a subset of ordered set notation using only two components) or matrix notation, as with rectangular vectors.  In these forms, the first component of the vector is ''r'' (instead of ''v''<sub>1</sub>) and the second component is ''\u03b8'' (instead of ''v''<sub>2</sub>).  To differentiate polar vectors from rectangular vectors, the angle may be prefixed with the angle symbol, <math>\\angle</math>.\n\nA two-dimensional polar vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered pair or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (r, \\angle \\theta)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle r, \\angle \\theta \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r & \\angle \\theta \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''r'' is the magnitude, ''\u03b8'' is the angle, and the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>) is optional.\n\n===Direct notation===\nPolar vectors can also be specified using simplified autonomous equations that define ''r'' and ''\u03b8'' explicitly.  This can be unwieldy, but is useful for avoiding the confusion with two-dimensional rectangular vectors that arises from using ordered pair or matrix notation.\n\nA two-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units and whose direction is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0) can be specified using either of the following forms:\n\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}</math>\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}</math>\n\n==Cylindrical vectors==\n[[Image:Coord system CY 1.svg|thumb|240px|A cylindrical coordinate system with origin ''O'', polar axis ''A'', and longitudinal axis ''L''. The dot is the point with radial distance ''\u03c1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, angular coordinate ''\u03c6''&nbsp;=&nbsp;130\u00b0, and height ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.]]\nA cylindrical vector is an extension of the concept of polar vectors into three dimensions.  It is akin to an arrow in the [[cylindrical coordinate system]].  A cylindrical vector is specified by a distance in the ''xy''-plane, an angle, and a distance from the ''xy''-plane (a height).  The first distance, usually represented as ''r'' or ''\u03c1'' (the Greek letter [[rho]]), is the magnitude of the projection of the vector onto the ''xy''-plane.  The angle, usually represented as ''\u03b8'' or ''\u03c6'' (the Greek letter [[phi]]), is measured as the offset from the line collinear with the ''x''-axis in the positive direction; the angle is typically reduced to lie within the range <math>0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi</math>.  The second distance, usually represented as ''h'' or ''z'', is the distance from the ''xy''-plane to the endpoint of the vector.\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nCylindrical vectors are specified like polar vectors, where the second distance component is [[Concatenation|concatenated]] as a third component to form ordered triplets (again, a subset of ordered set notation) and matrices.  The angle may be prefixed with the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>); the distance-angle-distance combination distinguishes cylindrical vectors in this notation from spherical vectors in similar notation.\n\nA three-dimensional cylindrical vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered triplet or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (r, \\angle \\theta, h)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle r, \\angle \\theta, h \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r & \\angle \\theta & h \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\\\ h \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''r'' is the magnitude of the projection of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> onto the ''xy''-plane, ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the positive ''x''-axis and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>, and ''h'' is the height from the ''xy''-plane to the endpoint of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>.  Again, the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>) is optional.\n\n===Direct notation===\nA cylindrical vector can also be specified directly, using simplified autonomous equations that define ''r'' (or ''\u03c1''), ''\u03b8'' (or ''\u03c6''), and ''h'' (or ''z'').  Consistency should be used when choosing the names to use for the variables; ''\u03c1'' should not be mixed with ''\u03b8'' and so on.\n\nA three-dimensional vector, the magnitude of whose projection onto the ''xy''-plane is 5 units, whose angle from the positive ''x''-axis is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0), and whose height from the ''xy''-plane is 3 units can be specified in any of the following forms:\n\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  h=3</math>\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}, \\  h=3</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\phi={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  z=3</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\phi=20^{\\circ}, \\  z=3</math>\n\n==Spherical vectors==\n[[File:3D Spherical 2.svg|thumb|240px|right|Spherical coordinates (''r'', ''\u03b8'', ''\u03c6'') as often used in ''mathematics'': radial distance ''r'', azimuthal angle ''\u03b8'', and polar angle ''\u03c6''. The meanings of ''\u03b8'' and ''\u03c6'' have been swapped compared to the physics convention.]]\nA spherical vector is another method for extending the concept of polar vectors into three dimensions.  It is akin to an arrow in the [[spherical coordinate system]].  A spherical vector is specified by a magnitude, an azimuth angle, and a zenith angle.  The magnitude is usually represented as ''\u03c1''.  The azimuth angle, usually represented as ''\u03b8'', is the ({{shy|counter|clockwise}}) offset from the positive ''x''-axis.  The zenith angle, usually represented as ''\u03c6'', is the offset from the positive ''z''-axis.  Both angles are typically reduced to lie within the range from zero (inclusive) to 2''\u03c0'' (exclusive).\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nSpherical vectors are specified like polar vectors, where the zenith angle is concatenated as a third component to form ordered triplets and matrices.  The azimuth and zenith angles may be both prefixed with the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>); the prefix should be used consistently to produce the distance-angle-angle combination that distinguishes spherical vectors from cylindrical ones.\n\nA three-dimensional spherical vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered triplet or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (\\rho, \\angle \\theta, \\angle \\phi)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle \\rho, \\angle \\theta, \\angle \\phi \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} \\rho & \\angle \\theta & \\angle \\phi \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} \\rho \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\\\ \\angle \\phi \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''\u03c1'' is the magnitude, ''\u03b8'' is the azimuth angle, and ''\u03c6'' is the zenith angle.\n\n===Direct notation===\nLike polar and cylindrical vectors, spherical vectors can be specified using simplified autonomous equations, in this case for ''\u03c1'', ''\u03b8'', and ''\u03c6''.\n\nA three-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units, whose azimuth angle is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0), and whose zenith angle is ''\u03c0''/4 radians (45\u00b0) can be specified as:\n\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  \\phi={\\pi \\over 4}</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}, \\  \\phi=45^{\\circ}</math>\n\n==Operations==\nIn any given [[vector space]], the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined. [[Normed vector space]]s also define an operation known as the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] (or determination of magnitude). [[Inner product space]]s also define an operation known as the inner product.  In [[Real coordinate space|<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>]], the inner product is known as the [[dot product]].  In <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> and <math>\\mathbb{R}^7</math>, an additional operation known as the [[cross product]] is also defined.\n\n===Vector addition===\n[[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|Vector addition]] is represented with the plus sign used as an operator between two vectors.  The sum of two vectors <math>\\boldsymbol{u}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{u} + \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\n===Scalar multiplication===\n[[Scalar multiplication]] is represented in the same manners as algebraic multiplication.  A scalar beside a vector (either or both of which may be in parentheses) implies scalar multiplication.  The two common operators, a dot and a rotated cross, are also acceptable (although the rotated cross is almost never used), but they risk confusion with dot products and cross products, which operate on two vectors.  The product of a scalar ''c'' with a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented in any of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>c \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>c \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\n====Vector subtraction and scalar division====\nUsing the algebraic properties of subtraction and division, along with scalar multiplication, it is also possible to \u201csubtract\u201d two vectors and \u201cdivide\u201d a vector by a scalar.\n\nVector subtraction is performed by adding the scalar multiple of \u22121 with the second vector operand to the first vector operand.  This can be represented by the use of the minus sign as an operator. The difference between two vectors <math>\\boldsymbol{u}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented in either of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{u} + -\\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{u} - \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\nScalar division is performed by multiplying the vector operand with the numeric inverse of the scalar operand.  This can be represented by the use of the fraction bar or division signs as operators.  The quotient of a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> and a scalar ''c'' can be represented in any of the following forms:\n\n*<math>{1 \\over c} \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>{\\boldsymbol{v} \\over c}</math>\n*<math>{\\boldsymbol{v} \\div c}</math>\n\n===Norm===\nThe [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of a vector is represented with double bars on both sides of the vector.  The norm of a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented as:\n:<math>\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|</math>\n\nThe norm is also sometimes represented with single bars, like <math>|\\boldsymbol{v}|</math>, but this can be confused with [[absolute value]] (which is a type of norm).\n\n===Inner product===\nThe [[inner product space|inner product]] (also known as the scalar product, not to be confused with scalar multiplication) of two vectors is represented as an ordered pair enclosed in angle brackets.  The inner product of two vectors <math>\\boldsymbol{u}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\langle \\boldsymbol{u}, \\boldsymbol{v} \\rangle</math>\n\n====Dot product====\nIn <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, the inner product is also known as the [[dot product]].  In addition to the standard inner product notation, the dot product notation (using the dot as an operator) can also be used (and is more common).  The dot product of two vectors <math>\\boldsymbol{u}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\nIn some older literature, the dot product is implied between two vectors written side-by-side. This notation can be confused with the [[dyadic product]] between two vectors.\n\n===Cross product===\nThe [[cross product]] of two vectors (in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>) is represented using the rotated cross as an operator.

R. Hamilton]] about 1843 as he revealed [[quaternion]]s, a system using vectors and scalars to span a four-dimensional space. For a quaternion ''q'' = ''a'' + ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, Hamilton used two projections: '''S''' ''q'' = ''a'', for the scalar part of ''q'', and '''V''' ''q'' = ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, the vector part. Using the modern terms ''cross product'' (\u00d7) and ''dot product'' (.), the ''quaternion product'' of two vectors ''p'' and ''q'' can be written ''pq'' = \u2013''p''.''q'' + ''p''\u00d7''q''. In 1878 [[W. K. Clifford]] severed the two products to make the quaternion operation useful for students in his textbook ''[[Elements of Dynamic]]''. Lecturing at [[Yale University]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] supplied notation for the [[scalar product]] and [[vector product]]s, which was introduced in ''[[Vector Analysis (Gibbs/Wilson)|Vector Analysis]]''.<ref>[[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] (1901) [https://archive.org/details/117714283 Vector Analysis, based on the Lectures of J. W. Gibbs] at [[Internet Archive]]</ref> \n\nIn 1891 [[Oliver Heaviside]] argued for [[Clarendon (typeface)|Clarendon]] to distinguish vectors from scalars. He criticized the use of [[Greek letters]] by Tait and [[Fraktur|Gothic letters]] by Maxwell.<ref>[[Oliver Heaviside]], ''The Electrical Journal'', Volume 28. James Gray, 1891.

Shaw contributed his \"Comparative Notation for Vector Expressions\" to the ''Bulletin'' of the [[Quaternion Society]].<ref>J.B. Shaw (1912) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498&view=1up&seq=410 Comparative Notation for Vector Expressions], ''Bulletin'' of the [[Quaternion Society]] via [[Hathi Trust]].</ref> Subsequently, [[Alexander Macfarlane]] described 15 criteria for clear expression with vectors in the same publication.<ref>[[Alexander Macfarlane]] (1912) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=426 A System of Notation for Vector-Analysis; with a Discussion of the Underlying Principles] from ''Bulletin of the Quaternion Society''</ref>\n\nVector ideas were advanced by [[Hermann Grassmann]] in 1841 and again in 1862 in the [[German language]]. But German mathematicians were not taken with quaternions as much as were English-speaking mathematicians. When [[Felix Klein]] was organizing the [[Klein's encyclopedia|German mathematical encyclopedia]], he assigned [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] to standardize vector notation.<ref>[[Karin Reich]] (1995) [http://www.kk.s.bw.schule.de/mathge/mehm2.htm Die Rolle Arnold Sommerfeld bei der Diskussion um die Vektorrechnung]</ref> In 1950, when [[Academic Press]] published G. Kuerti\u2019s translation of the second edition of volume 2 of ''Lectures on Theoretical Physics'' by Sommerfeld, vector notation was the subject of a footnote: \"In the original German text, vectors ''and'' their components are printed in the same Gothic types. The more usual way of making a typographical distinction between the two has been adopted for this translation.\"<ref>{{Google books|L6RmDAAAQBAJ|Mechanics of Deformable Bodies|page=10}}</ref>\n\n==Rectangular vectors==\n[[File:Rectangle Geometry Vector.svg|thumb|Rectangle]]\n[[File:Cuboid simple.svg|thumb|Rectangular cuboid]]\nA rectangular vector is a [[coordinate vector]] specified by components that define a [[rectangle]] (or [[rectangular prism]] in three dimensions, and similar shapes in greater dimensions).  The starting point and terminal point of the vector lie at opposite ends of the rectangle (or prism, etc.).\n\n===Ordered set notation===\nA rectangular vector in [[real coordinate space|<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>]] can be specified using an ordered [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of components, enclosed in either parentheses or angle brackets.\n\nIn a general sense, an ''n''-dimensional vector '''v''' can be specified in either of the following forms:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{n - 1}, v_n)</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\langle v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{n - 1}, v_n \\rangle</math>\n\nWhere ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''v''<sub>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1</sub>, ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> are the components of '''v'''.\n\n===Matrix notation===\nA rectangular vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> can also be specified as a row or column [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] containing the ordered set of components.  A vector specified as a row matrix is known as a [[row vector]]; one specified as a column matrix is known as a [[column vector]].\n\nAgain, an ''n''-dimensional vector <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> can be specified in either of the following forms using matrices:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\cdots & v_{n - 1} & v_n \\end{matrix} \\right] = \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\cdots & v_{n - 1} & v_n \\end{matrix} \\right)</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n - 1} \\\\ v_n \\end{matrix} \\right]= \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n - 1} \\\\ v_n \\end{matrix} \\right)</math>\n\nWhere ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''v''<sub>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1</sub>, ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> are the components of '''v'''. In some advanced contexts, a row and a column vector have different meaning; see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]].\n\n===Unit vector notation===\nA rectangular vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> (or fewer dimensions, such as <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> where <math>v_z</math> below is zero) can be specified as the sum of the scalar multiples of the components of the vector with the members of the standard [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>.  The basis is represented with the [[unit vector]]s <math>\\mathbf{i} = (1, 0, 0)</math>, <math>\\mathbf{j} = (0, 1, 0)</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{k} = (0, 0, 1)</math>.\n\nA three-dimensional vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be specified in the following form, using unit vector notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = v_x \\mathbf{i} + v_y \\mathbf{j} + v_z \\mathbf{k}</math>\n\nWhere <math>v_x</math>, <math>v_y</math>, and <math>v_z</math> are the scalar components of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>.  Scalar components may be positive or negative; the absolute value of a scalar component is a magnitude.\n\n==Polar vectors==\n{{distinguish|text=[[Polar vector]], a true vector, in a context where pseudo vectors or axial vectors are considered}} \n[[Image:CircularCoordinates.svg|thumb|250px|Points in the polar coordinate system with pole ''O'' and polar axis ''L''. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees, or (3,60\u00b0). In blue, the point (4,210\u00b0).]]\nThe two [[polar coordinates]] of a point in a plane may be considered as a two dimensional vector. Such a \n''polar vector'' consists of a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] (or length) and a direction (or angle). The magnitude, typically represented as ''r'', is the distance from a starting point, the [[origin (geometry)|origin]], to the point which is represented. The angle, typically represented as ''\u03b8'' (the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[theta]]), is the angle, usually measured {{shy|counter|clockwise}}, between a fixed direction, typically that of the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction from the origin to the point. The angle is typically reduced to lie within the range <math>0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi</math> radians or <math>0 \\le \\theta < 360^{\\circ}</math>.\n\nIt must be emphasized that a ''polar vector'' is not really a [[vector (mathematics)|vector]], since the [[addition]] of two polar vectors is not defined.\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nPolar vectors can be specified using either ordered pair notation (a subset of ordered set notation using only two components) or matrix notation, as with rectangular vectors.  In these forms, the first component of the vector is ''r'' (instead of ''v''<sub>1</sub>) and the second component is ''\u03b8'' (instead of ''v''<sub>2</sub>).  To differentiate polar vectors from rectangular vectors, the angle may be prefixed with the angle symbol, <math>\\angle</math>.\n\nA two-dimensional polar vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered pair or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (r, \\angle \\theta)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle r, \\angle \\theta \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r & \\angle \\theta \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''r'' is the magnitude, ''\u03b8'' is the angle, and the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>) is optional.\n\n===Direct notation===\nPolar vectors can also be specified using simplified autonomous equations that define ''r'' and ''\u03b8'' explicitly.  This can be unwieldy, but is useful for avoiding the confusion with two-dimensional rectangular vectors that arises from using ordered pair or matrix notation.\n\nA two-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units and whose direction is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0) can be specified using either of the following forms:\n\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}</math>\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}</math>\n\n==Cylindrical vectors==\n[[Image:Coord system CY 1.svg|thumb|240px|A cylindrical coordinate system with origin ''O'', polar axis ''A'', and longitudinal axis ''L''. The dot is the point with radial distance ''\u03c1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, angular coordinate ''\u03c6''&nbsp;=&nbsp;130\u00b0, and height ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.]]\nA cylindrical vector is an extension of the concept of polar vectors into three dimensions.  It is akin to an arrow in the [[cylindrical coordinate system]].  A cylindrical vector is specified by a distance in the ''xy''-plane, an angle, and a distance from the ''xy''-plane (a height).  The first distance, usually represented as ''r'' or ''\u03c1'' (the Greek letter [[rho]]), is the magnitude of the projection of the vector onto the ''xy''-plane.  The angle, usually represented as ''\u03b8'' or ''\u03c6'' (the Greek letter [[phi]]), is measured as the offset from the line collinear with the ''x''-axis in the positive direction; the angle is typically reduced to lie within the range <math>0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi</math>.  The second distance, usually represented as ''h'' or ''z'', is the distance from the ''xy''-plane to the endpoint of the vector.\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nCylindrical vectors are specified like polar vectors, where the second distance component is [[Concatenation|concatenated]] as a third component to form ordered triplets (again, a subset of ordered set notation) and matrices.  The angle may be prefixed with the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>); the distance-angle-distance combination distinguishes cylindrical vectors in this notation from spherical vectors in similar notation.\n\nA three-dimensional cylindrical vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered triplet or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (r, \\angle \\theta, h)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle r, \\angle \\theta, h \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r & \\angle \\theta & h \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\\\ h \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''r'' is the magnitude of the projection of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> onto the ''xy''-plane, ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the positive ''x''-axis and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>, and ''h'' is the height from the ''xy''-plane to the endpoint of <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>.  Again, the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>) is optional.\n\n===Direct notation===\nA cylindrical vector can also be specified directly, using simplified autonomous equations that define ''r'' (or ''\u03c1''), ''\u03b8'' (or ''\u03c6''), and ''h'' (or ''z'').  Consistency should be used when choosing the names to use for the variables; ''\u03c1'' should not be mixed with ''\u03b8'' and so on.\n\nA three-dimensional vector, the magnitude of whose projection onto the ''xy''-plane is 5 units, whose angle from the positive ''x''-axis is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0), and whose height from the ''xy''-plane is 3 units can be specified in any of the following forms:\n\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  h=3</math>\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}, \\  h=3</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\phi={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  z=3</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\phi=20^{\\circ}, \\  z=3</math>\n\n==Spherical vectors==\n[[File:3D Spherical 2.svg|thumb|240px|right|Spherical coordinates (''r'', ''\u03b8'', ''\u03c6'') as often used in ''mathematics'': radial distance ''r'', azimuthal angle ''\u03b8'', and polar angle ''\u03c6''. The meanings of ''\u03b8'' and ''\u03c6'' have been swapped compared to the physics convention.]]\nA spherical vector is another method for extending the concept of polar vectors into three dimensions.  It is akin to an arrow in the [[spherical coordinate system]].  A spherical vector is specified by a magnitude, an azimuth angle, and a zenith angle.  The magnitude is usually represented as ''\u03c1''.  The azimuth angle, usually represented as ''\u03b8'', is the ({{shy|counter|clockwise}}) offset from the positive ''x''-axis.  The zenith angle, usually represented as ''\u03c6'', is the offset from the positive ''z''-axis.  Both angles are typically reduced to lie within the range from zero (inclusive) to 2''\u03c0'' (exclusive).\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nSpherical vectors are specified like polar vectors, where the zenith angle is concatenated as a third component to form ordered triplets and matrices.  The azimuth and zenith angles may be both prefixed with the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>); the prefix should be used consistently to produce the distance-angle-angle combination that distinguishes spherical vectors from cylindrical ones.\n\nA three-dimensional spherical vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered triplet or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (\\rho, \\angle \\theta, \\angle \\phi)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle \\rho, \\angle \\theta, \\angle \\phi \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} \\rho & \\angle \\theta & \\angle \\phi \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} \\rho \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\\\ \\angle \\phi \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''\u03c1'' is the magnitude, ''\u03b8'' is the azimuth angle, and ''\u03c6'' is the zenith angle.\n\n===Direct notation===\nLike polar and cylindrical vectors, spherical vectors can be specified using simplified autonomous equations, in this case for ''\u03c1'', ''\u03b8'', and ''\u03c6''.\n\nA three-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units, whose azimuth angle is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0), and whose zenith angle is ''\u03c0''/4 radians (45\u00b0) can be specified as:\n\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  \\phi={\\pi \\over 4}</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}, \\  \\phi=45^{\\circ}</math>\n\n==Operations==\nIn any given [[vector space]], the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined. [[Normed vector space]]s also define an operation known as the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] (or determination of magnitude). [[Inner product space]]s also define an operation known as the inner product.  In [[Real coordinate space|<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>]], the inner product is known as the [[dot product]].  In <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> and <math>\\mathbb{R}^7</math>, an additional operation known as the [[cross product]] is also defined.\n\n===Vector addition===\n[[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|Vector addition]] is represented with the plus sign used as an operator between two vectors.  The sum of two vectors <math>\\boldsymbol{u}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{u} + \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\n===Scalar multiplication===\n[[Scalar multiplication]] is represented in the same manners as algebraic multiplication.  A scalar beside a vector (either or both of which may be in parentheses) implies scalar multiplication.  The two common operators, a dot and a rotated cross, are also acceptable (although the rotated cross is almost never used), but they risk confusion with dot products and cross products, which operate on two vectors.  The product of a scalar ''c'' with a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented in any of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>c \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>c \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\n====Vector subtraction and scalar division====\nUsing the algebraic properties of subtraction and division, along with scalar multiplication, it is also possible to \u201csubtract\u201d two vectors and \u201cdivide\u201d a vector by a scalar.\n\nVector subtraction is performed by adding the scalar multiple of \u22121 with the second vector operand to the first vector operand.  This can be represented by the use of the minus sign as an operator. The difference between two vectors <math>\\boldsymbol{u}</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented in either of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{u} + -\\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{u} - \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\nScalar division is performed by multiplying the vector operand with the numeric inverse of the scalar operand.  This can be represented by the use of the fraction bar or division signs as operators.  The quotient of a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> and a scalar ''c'' can be represented in any of the following forms:\n\n*<math>{1 \\over c} \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n*<math>{\\boldsymbol{v} \\over c}</math>\n*<math>{\\boldsymbol{v} \\div c}</math>\n\n===Norm===\nThe [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of a vector is represented with double bars on both sides of the vector.  The norm of a vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be represented as:\n:<math>\\|\\boldsymbol{v}\\|</math>\n\nThe norm is also sometimes represented with single bars, like <math>|\\boldsymbol{v}|</math>, but this can be confused with [[absolute value]] (which is a type of norm).\n\n===Inner product===\nThe [[inner product space|inner product]] (also known as the scalar product, not to be confused with scalar multiplication) of two vectors is represented as an ordered pair enclosed in angle brackets.  The inner product of two vectors \\boldsymbol{u} and \\boldsymbol{v} would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\langle \\boldsymbol{u}, \\boldsymbol{v} \\rangle</math>\n\n====Dot product====\nIn <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, the inner product is also known as the [[dot product]].  In addition to the standard inner product notation, the dot product notation (using the dot as an operator) can also be used (and is more common).  The dot product of two vectors \\boldsymbol{u} and \\boldsymbol{v} can be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\nIn some older literature, the dot product is implied between two vectors written side-by-side. This notation can be confused with the [[dyadic product]] between two vectors.\n\n===Cross product===\nThe [[cross product]] of two vectors (in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>) is represented using the rotated cross as an operator.  The cross product of two vectors \\boldsymbol{u} and \\boldsymbol{v} would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{u} \\times \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\nBy some conventions (e.g. in France and some areas of higher mathematics) this is also denoted by a wedge,<ref>{{cite book |last=Cajori |first=Florian |title=A History of Mathematical Notations |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2011 |page=134 (Vol. 2) |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_byqAAAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA134}}</ref> which avoids confusion with the [[wedge product]] since the two are functionally equivalent in three dimensions:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{u} \\wedge \\boldsymbol{v}</math>\n\nIn some older literature, the following notation is used for the cross product between \\boldsymbol{u} and \\boldsymbol{v}:\n\n:<math>[\\boldsymbol{u},\\boldsymbol{v}]</math>\n\n==Nabla==\n{{main|Del|Nabla symbol}}\nVector notation is used with [[calculus]] through the '''Nabla operator''':\n:<math> \\mathbf{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\mathbf{j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\mathbf{k}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}</math>\nWith a scalar function ''f'', the [[gradient]] is expressed <math>\\nabla f \\ ,</math>\n\nwith a vector field, ''F'' the [[ divergence]] is expressed <math>\\nabla \\cdot F ,</math>\n\nand with a vector field, ''F'' the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] is expressed <math>\\nabla \\times F .</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[ISO 31-11#Vectors and tensors]]\n* [[Phasor]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Linear algebra}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vector Notation}}\n[[Category:Mathematical notation]]\n[[Category:Vectors (mathematics and physics)]]\n", "name_user": "Skvery", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInner product", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_notation"}
