Former leader [[Jay Park|Jaebeom]] officially left the band in early 2010.\n\nThe history of 2PM started when Korean musician [[Park Jin-young]] formed an eleven-member band known as One Day. Eventually the band was split into 2PM and a similar but independent group known as [[2AM (band)|2AM]]. 2PM debuted with the song \"10 Jeom Manjeome 10 Jeom\" ({{lang|ko|10\uc810 \ub9cc\uc810\uc5d0 10\uc810}}, lit. \"10 Points Out of 10 Points\"), which showcased their acrobatic dance styles.<ref name=\"2PM on CNB News\">{{cite web|url=http://media.paran.com/entertainment/newsview.php?dirnews=2407457&year=2008&Query=2pm |title=\uad00\uac1d\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ud638\ud761\ud558\ub294 \u2019\ud37c\ud3ec\uba3c\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc774\uadf8\ub8f9\u20192PM |date=28 September 2008 |publisher=CNB News |accessdate=31 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612153238/http://media.paran.com/entertainment/newsview.php?dirnews=2407457&year=2008&Query=2pm |archivedate=12 June 2009 |url-status=dead |language=ko }}</ref> They achieved their first number 1 single with \"Again & Again\". Both singles featured on their first studio album, ''[[01:59PM]]'', released in 2009. The band went on to release another Korean album, known as [[Hands Up (album)|''Hands Up'']], in 2011. They made their Japanese debut later that year with ''[[Republic of 2PM]]''. After more than a year, the group returned in 2013 with their third studio album ''[[Grown (album)|Grown]]''. In early September 2014, 2PM returned with their fourth studio album ''Go Crazy''. On 15 June 2015, 2PM made a comeback with their fifth studio album ''[[No.5 (2PM album)|No.5]]''.

Former leader [[Jay Park|Jaebeom]] officially left the band in early 2010.\n\nThe history of 2PM started when Korean musician [[Park Jin-young]] formed an eleven-member band known as One Day. Eventually the band was split into 2PM and a similar but independent group known as [[2AM (band)|2AM]]. 2PM debuted with the song \"10 Jeom Manjeome 10 Jeom\" ({{lang|ko|10\uc810 \ub9cc\uc810\uc5d0 10\uc810}}, lit. \"10 Points Out of 10 Points\"), which showcased their acrobatic dance styles.<ref name=\"2PM on CNB News\">{{cite web|url=http://media.paran.com/entertainment/newsview.php?dirnews=2407457&year=2008&Query=2pm |title=\uad00\uac1d\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \ud638\ud761\ud558\ub294 \u2019\ud37c\ud3ec\uba3c\uc2a4 \ubcf4\uc774\uadf8\ub8f9\u20192PM |date=28 September 2008 |publisher=CNB News |accessdate=31 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612153238/http://media.paran.com/entertainment/newsview.php?dirnews=2407457&year=2008&Query=2pm |archivedate=12 June 2009 |url-status=dead |language=ko }}</ref> They achieved their first number 1 single with \"Again & Again\". Both singles featured on their first studio album, ''[[01:59PM]]'', released in 2009. The band went on to release another Korean album, known as [[Hands Up (album)|''Hands Up'']], in 2011. They made their Japanese debut later that year with ''[[Republic of 2PM]]''. After more than a year, the group returned in 2013 with their third studio album ''[[Grown (album)|Grown]]''. In early September 2014, 2PM returned with their fourth studio album ''Go Crazy''. On 15 June 2015, 2PM made a comeback with their fifth studio album ''[[No.5 (2PM album)|No.5]]''. After much anticipation 2PM returned on 13 September 2016 with their sixth studio album ''[[Gentlemen's Game]]''.\n\nSince July 2017, the group has been on an official hiatus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kstarlive.com/Despite-His-Group-Being-in-Hiatus-Right-Now--2PM-s-Nichkhun-Touches-HOTTESTs--Hearts-with-His-Gestures-as-a-Member-6010415|title=Despite His Group Being in Hiatus Right Now, 2PM`s Nichkhun Touches HOTTESTs` Hearts with His Gestures as a Member|last=KStarLive|website=KStarLive|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-debut===\nThe members of 2PM all auditioned (except [[Nichkhun]], who was scouted)<ref name=\"background\">{{cite web|title=Riding the Korean Wave|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/leisure/leisurescoop/20260/riding-the-korean-wave|publisher=Bangkok Post|accessdate=20 July 2009|date=15 July 2009}}</ref> to become part of JYP Entertainment.

Local YMCAs deliver projects and services focused on youth development through a wide variety of youth activities, including providing athletic facilities, holding classes for a wide variety of skills, promoting Christianity, and humanitarian work.\n\nYMCA as a [[Non-governmental federation]], with each independent local YMCA affiliated with its national organization. The national organizations, in turn, are part of both an Area Alliance (Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, and Canada) and the World Alliance of YMCAs (World YMCA). Subsequently, all YMCAs are unique, while following certain shared aims, such as the [[Paris Basis]].\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Montreal - YMCA, Rue des R\u00e9collets et Rue Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne - Note - 20050324.jpg|thumb|220px|Tablet at YMCA in Montreal]]\n[[File:Sir George Williams by John Collier.jpg|thumbnail|left|Founder Sir [[George Williams (YMCA)|George Williams]]]]\n\n=== Origins ===\n{{further|George Williams (YMCA)}}\n\nYMCA was founded by George Williams and 11 friends.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jolietymca.org/blog/founders-day/|title=YMCA Founder\u2019s Day: Celebrating 170 Years \u2014 Greater Joliet Area YMCA|website=www.jolietymca.org|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> George Williams was a London [[draper]], who was typical of the young men drawn to the cities by the [[Industrial Revolution]].  \n\nThey were concerned about the lack of healthy activities for young men in major cities; the options available were usually [[taverns]] and [[brothels]]. Williams' idea grew out of meetings he held for prayer and Bible-reading among his fellow workers in a business in the city of London,<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Young Men's Christian Association |volume=28 |pages=940\u2013941}}</ref> and on 6 June 1844, he held the first meeting that led to the founding of YMCA with the purpose of \"the improving of the spiritual condition of young men engaged in the drapery, [[embroidery]], and other trades.\"<ref name=\"report\">[[#IC95|Report of the Thirteenth International Conference]]: xix</ref> [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury]] served as YMCA's first president from 1851 until his death in 1885.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of British History|last=Cannon|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780191044809|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nBy 1845, YMCA started a popular series of lectures held that went on to be held at [[Exeter Hall]], London, from 1848, and the lectures started being published the following year, with the series ran until 1865.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Journal of Victorian Culture|last=Finnegan|first=Diarmid A.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=46-64}}</ref>  \n\nYMCA was associated with [[Industrialisation]] and the movement of young people to cities to work. YMCA \"combined preaching in the streets and the distribution of religious tracts with a social ministry. Philanthropists saw them as places for wholesome recreation that would preserve youth from the temptations of alcohol, gambling, and prostitution and that would promote good citizenship.\"<ref name=\"frost\">J. William Frost, \"Part V: Christianity and Culture in America\", ''Christianity: A Social and Cultural History'', 2nd Edition, (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 1998), 476.</ref>\n\n=== Movement ===\nIn part thanks to using the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 to spread the idea of YMCA<ref name=\":3\" />, by later that year there were YMCAs in the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States.  \n\nThe idea of creating a truly global movement with an international headquarters was led by [[Henry Dunant]], Secretary of YMCA Geneva, who would later go on to found the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and win the first [[Nobel Peace Prize]].  Dunant successfully convinced YMCA Paris to organise the first YMCA World Conference. The Conference took place in August 1855, bringing together 99 young delegates from nine countries, held before the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)]]. They discussed joining together in a federation to enhance cooperation amongst individual YMCA societies. This marked the beginning of the World Alliance of YMCAs. The conference adopted the [[Paris Basis]], a common mission for all present and future national YMCAs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ymca.int/index.php?id=115 |title=Paris Basis |publisher=Ymca.int |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> Its motto was taken from the Bible, \"[[That they all may be one]]\" ([[John 17]]:21). \n\nOther ecumenical bodies, such as the World [[YWCA]], the [[World Council of Churches]], and the [[World Student Christian Federation]] have reflected elements of the Paris Basis in their founding mission statements. In 1865, the Fourth World Conference of YMCAs, held in Germany, affirmed the importance of developing the whole individual in spirit, mind, and body. The concept of physical work through sports, a new concept for the time, was also recognized as part of this \"[[muscular Christianity]]\".\n\nTwo themes resonated during the council: the need to respect the local autonomy of YMCA societies, and the purpose of YMCA: to unite all young, male Christians for the extension and expansion of the Kingdom of God. The former idea is expressed in the preamble:\n\n{{quote|The delegates of various Young Men's Christian Associations of Europe and America, assembled in Conference at Paris, the 22 August 1855 feeling that they are one in principle and in operation, recommend to their respective Societies to recognize with them the unity existing among their Associations, and while preserving a complete independence as to their particular organization and modes of action, to form a Confederation of secession on the following fundamental principle, such principle to be regarded as the basis of admission of other Societies in future.}}\n\n=== 1870s to 1910s ===\n[[File:KINO YMCA.JPG|thumb|YMCA building in [[Bratislava]], Slovakia]]\n\nYMCA was very influential during the 1870s and the 1930s, during which times it most successfully promoted \"evangelical Christianity in weekday and Sunday services, while promoting good sportsmanship in athletic contests in gyms (where [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] were invented) and swimming pools.\"<ref name=\"frost\"/>  Later in this period, and continuing on through the 20th century, YMCA had \"become interdenominational and more concerned with promoting morality and good citizenship than a distinctive interpretation of Christianity.\"<ref name=\"frost\"/>[[File:Geneve archives YMCA 2011-08-23 11 24 53 PICT4048.JPG|thumb|left|Logo of the World Alliance of YMCAs (YMCA Archive, Geneva)]]\n\nIn 1878, the World YMCA offices were established in [[Geneva]], Switzerland by Dunant. Later, in 1900, North American YMCAs, in collaboration with the World YMCA, set up centres to work with emigrants in European ports, as millions of people were leaving for the USA. In 1880, YMCA became the first national organization to adopt a strict policy of equal gender representation in committees and national boards, with Norway being the country that first adopted it.\n\nIn 1885, Camp Baldhead (later known as Camp Dudley), the first residential camp in the United States and North America, was established by George A. Sanford and Sumner F. Dudley, both of whom worked for YMCA. The camp, originally located near Orange Lake in [[New Jersey]], moved to [[Lake Wawayanda]] in Sussex County the following year, and then to the shore of [[Lake Champlain]] near [[Westport, New York]], in 1891.<ref name=\"100YrsCamping\">{{cite web|url=http://umnlib.oit.umn.edu/F/?func=find-c&ccl_term=sys%3D000433611 |title=Turner, Eugene A., Jr. ''100 Years of YMCA Camping'', YMCA of the USA, 1985 |publisher=Umnlib.oit.umn.edu |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref><ref name=\"YMCAbuildingNY\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vintpix.com/photo.php?id=137 |title=YMCA Building Photo |publisher=Vintpix.com |date=4 July 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> By 1910, YMCA was an early influence upon [[scouting]], including the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) and [[Verband Christlicher Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder|German Scouting]]. [[Edgar M.

T. Paul]] became the first Indian national general secretary of India. Paul had started rural development programs for self-reliance of marginal farmers, through co-operatives and credit societies. These programmes became very popular. He also coined the term \"rural reconstruction\", and many of the principles he developed were later incorporated into the government's nationwide community development programs. In 1923, [[Y. C. James Yen]], of YMCA China, devised the \"thousand character system\", based on pilot projects in education. The method also became very popular, and in 1923, it led to the founding of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement. In 1878, YMCA was organized inside the Jaffa Gate of the Old City of Jerusalem<ref>his</ref> and the current landmark building was dedicated by General Lord Allenby in 1933 during the British Mandate of Palestine.  \n\n=== The World Wars ===\n\nWithin ten days of the declaration of [[World War I]],  YMCA had established no fewer than 250 recreation centres, also known as huts, in the United Kingdom, and would go on to build temporary huts across Europe to support both soldiers and civilians alike, run by thousands of volunteers.

This help included helping young men leave the camps to attend Springfield College and providing youth activities in the camps. In addition, YMCA was one of seven organizations that helped to found the [[USO]] during World War II. \n\nIn Europe, YMCA international helped refugees, particularly displaced Jews.

In 1955 the first black president of the World YMCA, Charles Dunbar Sherman from Liberia, was elected. At 37 years, he was also the youngest president in World YMCA history.

It stated what had become obvious:  that a global viewpoint was more necessary. It also recognized that YMCA and its national member organizations would have to take political stands, particularly in international challenges and crises.

The national organizations, in turn, are affiliated to both an Area Alliance (Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, and Canada) and the World YMCA. The World YMCA is the highest affiliation body. Each local, national and regional YMCA is independent of each other, but local, regional and international cooperation, partnerships and collaborations are part of the organizations work. Each National Council is led by a National General Secretary, a role that is akin to that of a CEO.\n\nEver since the first World Conference in August 1855, in Paris, the World YMCA has convened a World Conference (later named World Council) every three to four years and is YMCA's highest decision making forum.

The circular emblem is made up of five segments, one for each continent. The segments are held together by small monograms of YMCA in different languages. As early as 1881, YMCA leaders believed the Movement could be truly international and united across borders. In the center is a larger monogram of X and P, [[Chi Rho|Chi and Rho]], Christ's name, as used by early Christians. An open Bible sits on top of the monogram, showing [[That they all may be one|John XVII, Verse 21, \"that they all may be one\"]]. This was to remind YMCAs that Christ is at the center of the Movement, a source of strength, hope and unity, binding them all together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ymca.int/about-us/ymca-history/ymca-logo-history/|title=YMCA Logo - History|website=World YMCA}}</ref>\n\nIn 1891 [[Luther Gulick (physician)]], a physical education director at YMCA of the USA, introduced a new emblem to represent YMCA, an inverted red triangle. Each of the triangle\u2019s sides represented 'the whole man' and a different aspect of YMCA\u2019s work as recognised by Gulick; Mind, Body and Spirit.<ref>https://infed.org/mobi/luther-halsey-gulick-recreation-physical-education-and-the-ymca/</ref> So significant was the red triangle, it would go on to become a familiar symbol of YMCA's work on the home front and around the world during WW1 and WW2. The red triangle is still used as part of many local, national and regional YMCA logos today.\n\n==Activities==\n\n=== Accommodation ===\nYMCAs around the world offer various types of accommodation. In some places this takes the form of budget accommodation available to the public such as youth hostels, or hotels which in turn generate income for other charitable activities. In England and Wales, YMCAs offer supported accommodation for vulnerable and homeless young people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymca.org.uk/about/what-we-do/accommodation|title=Accommodation|website=YMCA England & Wales|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Education and Academia ===\n\nMultiple colleges and universities have historically had connections to YMCA. [[Springfield College]], of Springfield, Massachusetts, was founded in 1885 as an international training school for YMCA Professionals, while one of the two schools that eventually became [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]\u2014[[Sir George Williams University|Sir George Williams College]]\u2014started from night courses offered at the [[Montreal]] YMCA. [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] began out of a [[Boston YMCA|YMCA in Boston]], and [[Franklin University]] began as YMCA School of Commerce. San Francisco's [[Golden Gate University]] traces its roots to the founding of YMCA Night School on 1 November 1881. [[Detroit College of Law]], now the [[Michigan State University College of Law]], was founded with a strong connection to the Detroit, Michigan YMCA. It had a 99-year lease on the site, and it was only when it expired that the college moved to [[East Lansing, Michigan]]. [[Youngstown State University]] traces its roots to the establishment of a law school by the local YMCA in 1908. The [[Nashville School of Law]] was YMCA Night Law School until November 1986, having offered law classes since 1911 and the degree of [[Juris Doctor]] since January 1927. YMCA pioneered the concept of [[wikt:night school|night school]], providing educational opportunities for people with full-time employment. Many YMCAs offer [[English as a second language|ESL]] programs, [[alternative high school]], [[day care]], and [[summer camp]] programs. In India, [[YMCA University of Science and Technology]] [[Faridabad]] was founded in 1969. It offers various program-related to science and engineering.\n\nAmerican high school students have a chance to participate in [[YMCA Youth and Government]], wherein clubs of children representing each YMCA community convene annually in their respective [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] to \"take over the State Capitol for a day.\"\n\nAmerican students in [[Title One]] public schools are sometimes eligible to join a tutoring program through YMCA called Y Learning. This program is used to help low-income students who are struggling in school complete their homework with help from tutors and receive a snack as well as a safe place to be after school. Y Learning operates under the main mission of bridging achievements gaps and providing essential resources to help underprivileged students thrive in school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymcatriangle.org/programs-services/tutoring/y-learning|title=Y Learning, standardized tutorial program {{!}} YMCA of the Triangle|website=www.ymcatriangle.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe International Coalition of YMCA Universities<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ymcauniversitiescoalition.org/|title=Coalition YMCA Universities|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref> brings together universities from all over the world, including Brazil, England, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Uruguay, USA, and Venezuela. The universities offer a wide variety of courses on different levels.\n\n=== Health and Wellbeing ===\n[[File:YMCA Association Men Cover June 1919.png|thumbnail|right|YMCA ''Association Men'' cover, June 1919]]\n\nIn 1891 [[James Naismith]], a Canadian American, invented [[Basketball]] while studying at YMCA International Training School in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] (later to be named [[Springfield College]]). Naismith had been asked to invent a new game in an attempt to interest pupils in physical exercise. The game had to be interesting, easy to learn, and easy to play indoors in winter. In 1895, [[William G. Morgan]] from YMCA of [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], invented the sport of [[Volleyball]] as a slower paced alternative sport, in which the older YMCA members could participate. In 1930, {{illm|Juan Carlos Ceriani|fr|Juan Carlos Ceriani Gravier}} from YMCA of [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, invented the sport of [[futsal]], an indoor version of [[Association football|football]], having been created in synthesis with the rules of the three indoor sports of [[American handball|handball]], basketball and [[water polo]].\n\n==== Public Health ====\nThe organization is committed to public health in different ways. It organizes fitness and wellness as well as help and awareness programs. One of the programs is the ''Diabetes Prevention Program'', where trained staff members help sick persons to make their lives healthy and active.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/at-a-ymca-near-you-a-course-for-a-diabetic-nation/|title=At a YMCA Near You, a Course for a Diabetic Nation|last=Rosenberg|first=Tina|date=2014-07-03|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n====Basketball====\nBasketball was invented at YMCA, in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a clergyman, educator and physician.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://eu.courierpress.com/story/life/2018/01/30/history-lesson-early-basketball-ymca/1077521001/\n | title =History Lesson: Early basketball at YMCA\n | last =Smith \n | first =Daniel\n | date =30 January 2018\n | website =Courier & Press\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 2 January 2018\n | quote = }}</ref> Naismith was asked to create an indoor \"athletic distraction\" to keep rowdy youth busy in the cold New England winter months. [[Luther Gulick (physician)]], the head of  Springfield YMCA, gave Naismith two weeks to come up with a game to occupy a particularly incorrigible group. Naismith decided the game had to be physically active, simple to understand and would have minimal physical roughness.\n\nThe original game was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets nailed to the balcony of Springfield YMCA. The game was an immediate hit, although originally the baskets still had their bottoms, and the ball had to be manually retrieved after each score, considerably slowing play. It was mostly a passing game, and dribbling did not become a major part of the game until much later, when the ball was improved to its present form. \n\nGulick worked with Naismith to spread the sport, chairing the Basketball Committee of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (1895\u20131905) and representing the [[United States Olympic Committee]] during the [[1908 Olympic Games]]. Naismith and his wife attended the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] when basketball was included for the first time as an Olympic event.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete Book of the Olympics|last=Loucky, Wallechinsky|first=David and Jamie|publisher=Aurum Press Limited|year=2008|isbn=|location=London|pages=399-400}}</ref> For his efforts to increase the popularity of basketball and of [[physical fitness]] in general, Gulick was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a contributor in 1959. \n\n====Volleyball====\nFour years after James Naismith invented basketball in Springfield in 1891, [[William G. Morgan]], an instructor at YMCA in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], wanted to create a game for older gentlemen which had less physical contact. He borrowed a tennis net, raised it 6 feet, 6 inches above the floor, and invented the game of \"mintonette\", which could be played by a group of any number and involved volleying a large ball over the net. An observer wisely suggested that a better name for the new sport might be \"volleyball\". \n\n====Racquetball====\nRacquetball is another YMCA invented sport. [[Joseph Sobek]] a tennis, handball and squash player who worked in a rubber manufacturing factory, was dissatisfied with the options for indoor sports in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. He could not find squash players of his caliber and he did not care particularly for handball, so in 1950 he designed a short, stringed racquet, used a children's toy rubber ball, and created rules for a new game using the handball courts. He called his new sport \"paddle rackets\". The sport really took off in the 1970s and there are an estimated 15 million players worldwide today.<ref>\"Popular sports invented at YMCA\" by Jill Fandrich, 25 May 2009</ref>\n\n=== Publishing ===\n{{Main|YMCA Press}} YMCA founded YMCA Press [[publishing house]] in Russia in 1900. It moved to Paris after [[World War I]], where it focused on providing intellectual and educational works to Russian [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s. It perhaps most famously published some of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s books whilst he was imprisoned by the Russian government.<ref name=\"Raeff1990\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/russiaabroadcult00raef_0|url-access=registration|title=Russia Abroad: A Cultural History of the Russian Emigration, 1919-1939|author=Marc Raeff|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-19-505683-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/russiaabroadcult00raef_0/page/78 78]}}</ref>\n\n=== Religious ===\n[[File:YMCA Maple Syrup.JPG|thumb|Campers at a YMCA camp in Huguenot]]\n\nThe first YMCA included Bible studies, although the organization has generally moved on to a more [[holistic]] approach to youth work. Around six years after its birth, an international YMCA conference in Paris decided that the objective of the organization should become \"[[Disciple (Christianity)|Christian discipleship]] developed through a program of religious, educational, social and physical activities\" (Binfield 1973:265).\n\n== Europe ==\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nYMCAs in England and Wales offer supported accommodation for vulnerable and homeless young people, mental health services, youth clubs, sports centres, nursery schools and family support and after school clubs. Across England and Wales YMCA supports more than 18,000 young people with homes each year,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymca.org.uk/about/what-we-do/accommodation|title=Accommodation|website=YMCA England & Wales|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> and is thus one of the largest providers of safe supported accommodation for young people. The vast majority of this accommodation is supported by a range of personal, social and educational services.\n\nThe archive of the British YMCA is housed at the [[University of Birmingham]] Special Collections. The archive of YMCA Scotland is available at the [[National Archives of Scotland]]. YMCA in the United Kingdom consists of three separate National Councils: England & Wales, Ireland, and [[Scotland]]. YMCAs in [[Wales]] joined YMCA England in 2017, leading to the National Council renaming to YMCA England & Wales.\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:CVJM Wittenberg 04.jpg|thumb|CVJM building in [[Wittenberg]]]]\nIn Germany (as well as Austria and Switzerland) YMCA is called CVJM, which stands for Christlicher Verein junger Menschen (Christian Association of Young People). Up until 1985 the organisation was called \u2018Christlicher Verein Junger M\u00e4nner\u2019 (Christian Association of Young Men), the name change reflected its activities being accessible to men and women.\n\n=== Sweden ===\nThe [[YWCA-YMCA of Sweden]] ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: '''''KFUK-KFUM Sverige''''') was established in 1966 following a merger of the YMCA of Sweden and the YWCA of Sweden. In 2011, the organization decided to use the term '''''KFUM Sverige''''' during promotion where ''M'' now stands for ''m\u00e4nniskor'' (\"people\") instead of ''m\u00e4n'' (men) as before. The YWCA-YMCA of Sweden has 40,000 members in 140 local associations. Several Swedish YWCA-YMCA associations have been successful in sport.\n<br />\n== North America ==\n\n{{Anchor|YMCA of the USA}}\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Advert section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Ymca logo 2011-06-28.png|thumb|right|International ''(above)'' and American ''(below)'' logos]]\n[[File:Ketchum Downtown YMCA, Front View.jpg|thumb|right|Ketchum Downtown YMCA of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

By 1904, there were two more branches in Mexico City and one branch established in Monterrey. In 1907, another branch in Chihuahua was set up and then one YMCA in Tampico. In Mexico, the YMCA organized physical activity, individual development, and national progress. There was advertising for YMCA programs that would help young men gain life skills and YMCA also had some activities for women. For example, an excursion to Xochimilco in 1910 featured races for boys and girls and indoor baseball for everyone. Although, the YMCA had very little influence on rural Mexico until after the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Elsey|first=Brenda|title=Futbolera|last2=Nadel|first2=Joshua|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=May 21, 2019|isbn=1477310428|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\n=== History ===\n\n==== First century ====\nThe first YMCA in North America opened in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, on 9 December 1851.\n\nThe first YMCA in the United States opened on 29 December 1851, in Boston, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1851 by Captain Thomas Valentine Sullivan (1800\u201359), an American seaman and missionary. He was influenced by the London YMCA and saw the association as an opportunity to provide a \"home away from home\" for young sailors on shore leave. The [[Boston YMCA|Boston chapter]] promoted evangelical Christianity, the cultivation of Christian sympathy, and the improvement of the spiritual, physical, and mental condition of young men. By 1853, the Boston YMCA had 1,500 members, most of whom were merchants and artisans. Hardware merchant [[Franklin W. Smith]] was the first elected president in 1855.<ref name=\"BORDER\">Howell, Benita J.: [http://www.mtsu.edu/borders/archives/14/BS_2003_archive.pdf \"Franklin Webster Smith of Boston: Architect of Tourism in Busby, Tennessee\"] Border States: Journal of the Kentucky-Tennessee American Studies Association, 2003</ref>\nMembers paid an annual membership fee to use the facilities and services of the association. Because of political, physical, and population changes in Boston during the second half of the century, the Boston YMCA established branch divisions to satisfy the needs of local neighborhoods. From its early days, the Boston YMCA offered educational classes. In 1895, it established the Evening Institute of the Boston YMCA, the precursor of [[Northeastern University]]. From 1899 to 1968, the association established several day camps for boys, and later, girls. Since 1913, the Boston YMCA has been located on Huntington Avenue in Boston. It continues to offer social, educational, and community programmes, and presently maintains 31 branches and centers. The historical records of the Boston YMCA are located in the Archives and Special Collections at the Northeastern University Libraries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m13find.htm |title=Young Men's Christian Association of Greater Boston records |publisher=Library.neu.edu |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref>\n\n[[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], had its first YMCA in 1852, a few blocks west of Charles Street with later an extensive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-style triangular structure of brick with limestone trim with two towers at the northwest and southwest ends and two smaller cupolas in the center, built by 1872\u201373 on the northwest corner of West Saratoga and [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|North Charles Streets]], the former site of the city's first Roman Catholic church (St. Peter's, 1770) and pro-cathedral (1791\u20131826), but razed in 1841. The first central Baltimore YMCA, which still stands in 2014 (but with its towers removed in the early 1900s, converted to offices in the 1910s and apartments and condos in 2001) at the northern edge of the downtown business district near Cathedral Hill and the more toney residential [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere-Mount Royal]] neighborhood with many of the city's cultural and educational institutions relocating. By 1907, three blocks further north, a cornerstone was laid for a [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux Arts/Classical Revival]] styled, seven-story building on the northeast corner of West Franklin at Cathedral Streets, across the street to the north from the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] (the old Baltimore Cathedral) of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], (1806\u201321). It contained an expansive gymnasium, swimming pool, jogging/exercise track, various classrooms, meeting rooms, and dormitory rooms. Two decades later, the city's central branch of the [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]] public circulating library system (first of its kind in America) expanded from its original \"Old Central\" a block south facing West Mulberry Street to a new block-long library facing Cathedral Street and the Cathedral/Basilica in 1931\u20131933, with distinctive department store front display windows on the sidewalk, giving the area a unique cultural and educational centrality. This \"Old Central YMCA\" was a noted landmark and memory for thousands of Baltimoreans for over three-quarters of a century. It later was converted to the present Mount Vernon Hotel and Caf\u00e9 as the Baltimore area's Central YMCA of central Maryland reorganized in the early 1980s and cut back on its various activities in the downtown area to more suburban and neighborhood centers throughout the region (although not without controversy and some alienation as the \"Old Central\" was closed). Additional YMCA work was undertaken in what was then called the \"Colored YMCA\" in the inner northwest neighborhood of [[Upton, Baltimore|Upton]] on [[Maryland Route 127|Druid Hill Avenue]] near the traditional \"Black\" Pennsylvania Avenue commercial/cultural district which were undertaken by committed then \"Negro/Colored\" residents, who persevered in the early 20th century despite very little encouragement and hardly any financial resources from the board of the Central YMCA of Baltimore.\n\nIn 1853 the Reverend [[Anthony Bowen]] founded the first YMCA for Colored Men in Washington, D.C. The renamed Anthony Bowen YMCA is still serving the U Street area of Washington. It became a part of YMCA of the city of Washington in 1947.\n\nYMCA developed the first known English as a Second Language program in the United States in response to the influx of immigrants in the 1850s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ymcagbc.org/about-y/y|title=The Y|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nStarting before the [[American Civil War]],<ref name=YMCAhistory/> YMCA provided nursing, shelter, and other support in wartime.\n\nIn 1879 Darren Blach organized the first [[Sioux]] Indian YMCA in Florida.

It deployed over 25,000 staff in military units and bases from Siberia to Egypt to France. They took over the military's morale and comfort operations worldwide. [[Irving Berlin]] wrote ''[[Yip Yip Yaphank]]'', a revue that included a song entitled \"I Can Always Find a Little Sunshine in the YMCA\".

YMCA secretaries worked to create camp committees to run programs providing educational opportunities, physical instruction, and equipment, theatrical productions and musicals. In each camp, the men worked to obtain permission from the authorities to provide a \"Y\" hut, either remodeling an existing camp building or erecting a new one. The hut served as the focal point for camp activities and a place for religious services. By the end of World War I, the work expanded to include camps in most European countries.\n\n==== Since World War II ====\n\nYMCA was associated with homosexual subculture through the middle part of the 20th century, with the athletic facilities providing cover for closeted individuals.<ref>Neumann, Caryn E. glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture.

Notable founders of YMCA Indian Guides include Harold Keltner, the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] YMCA secretary, and Joe Friday, an Ojibway hunting guide. The two men met in 1927, when Keltner went on a hunting and fishing trip in the Hudson Bay country. With Friday's help, Keltner studied the close companionship of Ojibway boys and their fathers. This is when he conceived the plan for the Indian Guides.<ref>(From a newspaper article dated 9 November 1937) http://vintagekidstuff.com/yguides/imgB5.jpg</ref> Today, Joe Friday and Harold Keltner are commemorated with patch awards honoring their legacy.

Local YMCAs deliver projects and services focused on youth development through a wide variety of youth activities, including providing athletic facilities, holding classes for a wide variety of skills, promoting Christianity, and humanitarian work.\n\nYMCA as a [[Non-governmental federation]], with each independent local YMCA affiliated with its national organization. The national organizations, in turn, are part of both an Area Alliance (Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, and Canada) and the World Alliance of YMCAs (World YMCA).

Williams' idea grew out of meetings he held for prayer and Bible-reading among his fellow workers in a business in the city of London,<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Young Men's Christian Association |volume=28 |pages=940\u2013941}}</ref> and on 6 June 1844, he held the first meeting that led to the founding of YMCA with the purpose of \"the improving of the spiritual condition of young men engaged in the drapery, [[embroidery]], and other trades.\"<ref name=\"report\">[[#IC95|Report of the Thirteenth International Conference]]: xix</ref> [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury]] served as YMCA's first president from 1851 until his death in 1885.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of British History|last=Cannon|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780191044809|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nBy 1845, YMCA started a popular series of lectures held that went on to be held at [[Exeter Hall]], London, from 1848, and the lectures started being published the following year, with the series ran until 1865.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Journal of Victorian Culture|last=Finnegan|first=Diarmid A.|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=46-64}}</ref>  \n\nYMCA was associated with [[Industrialisation]] and the movement of young people to cities to work. YMCA \"combined preaching in the streets and the distribution of religious tracts with a social ministry. Philanthropists saw them as places for wholesome recreation that would preserve youth from the temptations of alcohol, gambling, and prostitution and that would promote good citizenship.\"<ref name=\"frost\">J.

Dunant successfully convinced YMCA Paris to organise the first YMCA World Conference. The Conference took place in August 1855, bringing together 99 young delegates from nine countries, held before the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)]]. They discussed joining together in a federation to enhance cooperation amongst individual YMCA societies. This marked the beginning of the World Alliance of YMCAs. The conference adopted the [[Paris Basis]], a common mission for all present and future national YMCAs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ymca.int/index.php?id=115 |title=Paris Basis |publisher=Ymca.int |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> Its motto was taken from the Bible, \"[[That they all may be one]]\" ([[John 17]]:21). \n\nOther ecumenical bodies, such as the World [[YWCA]], the [[World Council of Churches]], and the [[World Student Christian Federation]] have reflected elements of the Paris Basis in their founding mission statements. In 1865, the Fourth World Conference of YMCAs, held in Germany, affirmed the importance of developing the whole individual in spirit, mind, and body. The concept of physical work through sports, a new concept for the time, was also recognized as part of this \"[[muscular Christianity]]\".\n\nTwo themes resonated during the council: the need to respect the local autonomy of YMCA societies, and the purpose of YMCA: to unite all young, male Christians for the extension and expansion of the Kingdom of God. The former idea is expressed in the preamble:\n\n{{quote|The delegates of various Young Men's Christian Associations of Europe and America, assembled in Conference at Paris, the 22 August 1855 feeling that they are one in principle and in operation, recommend to their respective Societies to recognize with them the unity existing among their Associations, and while preserving a complete independence as to their particular organization and modes of action, to form a Confederation of secession on the following fundamental principle, such principle to be regarded as the basis of admission of other Societies in future.}}\n\n=== 1870s to 1910s ===\n[[File:KINO YMCA.JPG|thumb|YMCA building in [[Bratislava]], Slovakia]]\n\nYMCA was very influential during the 1870s and the 1930s, during which times it most successfully promoted \"evangelical Christianity in weekday and Sunday services, while promoting good sportsmanship in athletic contests in gyms (where [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] were invented) and swimming pools.\"<ref name=\"frost\"/>  Later in this period, and continuing on through the 20th century, YMCA had \"become interdenominational and more concerned with promoting morality and good citizenship than a distinctive interpretation of Christianity.\"<ref name=\"frost\"/>[[File:Geneve archives YMCA 2011-08-23 11 24 53 PICT4048.JPG|thumb|left|Logo of the World Alliance of YMCAs (YMCA Archive, Geneva)]]\n\nIn 1878, the World YMCA offices were established in [[Geneva]], Switzerland by Dunant. Later, in 1900, North American YMCAs, in collaboration with the World YMCA, set up centres to work with emigrants in European ports, as millions of people were leaving for the USA. In 1880, YMCA became the first national organization to adopt a strict policy of equal gender representation in committees and national boards, with Norway being the country that first adopted it.\n\nIn 1885, Camp Baldhead (later known as Camp Dudley), the first residential camp in the United States and North America, was established by George A. Sanford and Sumner F. Dudley, both of whom worked for YMCA. The camp, originally located near Orange Lake in [[New Jersey]], moved to [[Lake Wawayanda]] in Sussex County the following year, and then to the shore of [[Lake Champlain]] near [[Westport, New York]], in 1891.<ref name=\"100YrsCamping\">{{cite web|url=http://umnlib.oit.umn.edu/F/?func=find-c&ccl_term=sys%3D000433611 |title=Turner, Eugene A., Jr. ''100 Years of YMCA Camping'', YMCA of the USA, 1985 |publisher=Umnlib.oit.umn.edu |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref><ref name=\"YMCAbuildingNY\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vintpix.com/photo.php?id=137 |title=YMCA Building Photo |publisher=Vintpix.com |date=4 July 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> By 1910, YMCA was an early influence upon [[scouting]], including the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) and [[Verband Christlicher Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder|German Scouting]].

T. Paul]] became the first Indian national general secretary of India. Paul had started rural development programs for self-reliance of marginal farmers, through co-operatives and credit societies. These programmes became very popular. He also coined the term \"rural reconstruction\", and many of the principles he developed were later incorporated into the government's nationwide community development programs. In 1923, [[Y. C. James Yen]], of YMCA China, devised the \"thousand character system\", based on pilot projects in education. The method also became very popular, and in 1923, it led to the founding of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement. In 1878, YMCA was organized inside the Jaffa Gate of the Old City of Jerusalem<ref>his</ref> and the current landmark building was dedicated by General Lord Allenby in 1933 during the British Mandate of Palestine.  \n\n=== The World Wars ===\n\nWithin ten days of the declaration of [[World War I]],  YMCA had established no fewer than 250 recreation centres, also known as huts, in the United Kingdom, and would go on to build temporary huts across Europe to support both soldiers and civilians alike, run by thousands of volunteers.

This help included helping young men leave the camps to attend Springfield College and providing youth activities in the camps. In addition, YMCA was one of seven organizations that helped to found the [[USO]] during World War II. \n\nIn Europe, YMCA international helped refugees, particularly displaced Jews.

The national organizations, in turn, are affiliated to both an Area Alliance (Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, and Canada) and the World YMCA. The World YMCA is the highest affiliation body. Each local, national and regional YMCA is independent of each other, but local, regional and international cooperation, partnerships and collaborations are part of the organizations work. Each National Council is led by a National General Secretary, a role that is akin to that of a CEO.\n\nEver since the first World Conference in August 1855, in Paris, the World YMCA has convened a World Conference (later named World Council) every three to four years and is YMCA's highest decision making forum. Every National Council sends a delegation who hold a number of votes, which are dependent on the financial turnover of that National Council. The World Council is \u201cresponsible for setting the policies and direction of the World YMCA, electing its Officers and Executive Committee, evaluating the work of the last four years, and deliberating on priorities for the next quadrennium\".

The circular emblem is made up of five segments, one for each continent. The segments are held together by small monograms of YMCA in different languages. As early as 1881, YMCA leaders believed the Movement could be truly international and united across borders. In the center is a larger monogram of X and P, [[Chi Rho|Chi and Rho]], Christ's name, as used by early Christians. An open Bible sits on top of the monogram, showing [[That they all may be one|John XVII, Verse 21, \"that they all may be one\"]]. This was to remind YMCAs that Christ is at the center of the Movement, a source of strength, hope and unity, binding them all together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ymca.int/about-us/ymca-history/ymca-logo-history/|title=YMCA Logo - History|website=World YMCA}}</ref>\n\nIn 1891 [[Luther Gulick (physician)]], a physical education director at YMCA of the USA, introduced a new emblem to represent YMCA, an inverted red triangle. Each of the triangle\u2019s sides represented 'the whole man' and a different aspect of YMCA\u2019s work as recognised by Gulick; Mind, Body and Spirit.<ref>https://infed.org/mobi/luther-halsey-gulick-recreation-physical-education-and-the-ymca/</ref> So significant was the red triangle, it would go on to become a familiar symbol of YMCA's work on the home front and around the world during WW1 and WW2. The red triangle is still used as part of many local, national and regional YMCA logos today.\n\n==Activities==\n\n=== Accommodation ===\nYMCAs around the world offer various types of accommodation. In some places this takes the form of budget accommodation available to the public such as youth hostels, or hotels which in turn generate income for other charitable activities. In England and Wales, YMCAs offer supported accommodation for vulnerable and homeless young people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymca.org.uk/about/what-we-do/accommodation|title=Accommodation|website=YMCA England & Wales|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Education and Academia ===\n\nMultiple colleges and universities have historically had connections to YMCA. [[Springfield College]], of Springfield, Massachusetts, was founded in 1885 as an international training school for YMCA Professionals, while one of the two schools that eventually became [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]\u2014[[Sir George Williams University|Sir George Williams College]]\u2014started from night courses offered at the [[Montreal]] YMCA. [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] began out of a [[Boston YMCA|YMCA in Boston]], and [[Franklin University]] began as YMCA School of Commerce. San Francisco's [[Golden Gate University]] traces its roots to the founding of YMCA Night School on 1 November 1881. [[Detroit College of Law]], now the [[Michigan State University College of Law]], was founded with a strong connection to the Detroit, Michigan YMCA. It had a 99-year lease on the site, and it was only when it expired that the college moved to [[East Lansing, Michigan]]. [[Youngstown State University]] traces its roots to the establishment of a law school by the local YMCA in 1908. The [[Nashville School of Law]] was YMCA Night Law School until November 1986, having offered law classes since 1911 and the degree of [[Juris Doctor]] since January 1927. YMCA pioneered the concept of [[wikt:night school|night school]], providing educational opportunities for people with full-time employment. Many YMCAs offer [[English as a second language|ESL]] programs, [[alternative high school]], [[day care]], and [[summer camp]] programs. In India, [[YMCA University of Science and Technology]] [[Faridabad]] was founded in 1969. It offers various program-related to science and engineering.\n\nAmerican high school students have a chance to participate in [[YMCA Youth and Government]], wherein clubs of children representing each YMCA community convene annually in their respective [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] to \"take over the State Capitol for a day.\"\n\nAmerican students in [[Title One]] public schools are sometimes eligible to join a tutoring program through YMCA called Y Learning. This program is used to help low-income students who are struggling in school complete their homework with help from tutors and receive a snack as well as a safe place to be after school. Y Learning operates under the main mission of bridging achievements gaps and providing essential resources to help underprivileged students thrive in school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymcatriangle.org/programs-services/tutoring/y-learning|title=Y Learning, standardized tutorial program {{!}} YMCA of the Triangle|website=www.ymcatriangle.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe International Coalition of YMCA Universities<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ymcauniversitiescoalition.org/|title=Coalition YMCA Universities|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref> brings together universities from all over the world, including Brazil, England, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Uruguay, USA, and Venezuela. The universities offer a wide variety of courses on different levels.\n\n=== Health and Wellbeing ===\n[[File:YMCA Association Men Cover June 1919.png|thumbnail|right|YMCA ''Association Men'' cover, June 1919]]\n\nIn 1891 [[James Naismith]], a Canadian American, invented [[Basketball]] while studying at YMCA International Training School in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] (later to be named [[Springfield College]]). Naismith had been asked to invent a new game in an attempt to interest pupils in physical exercise. The game had to be interesting, easy to learn, and easy to play indoors in winter. In 1895, [[William G. Morgan]] from YMCA of [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], invented the sport of [[Volleyball]] as a slower paced alternative sport, in which the older YMCA members could participate. In 1930, {{illm|Juan Carlos Ceriani|fr|Juan Carlos Ceriani Gravier}} from YMCA of [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, invented the sport of [[futsal]], an indoor version of [[Association football|football]], having been created in synthesis with the rules of the three indoor sports of [[American handball|handball]], basketball and [[water polo]].\n\n==== Public Health ====\nThe organization is committed to public health in different ways. It organizes fitness and wellness as well as help and awareness programs. One of the programs is the ''Diabetes Prevention Program'', where trained staff members help sick persons to make their lives healthy and active.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/at-a-ymca-near-you-a-course-for-a-diabetic-nation/|title=At a YMCA Near You, a Course for a Diabetic Nation|last=Rosenberg|first=Tina|date=2014-07-03|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n====Basketball====\nBasketball was invented at YMCA, in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a clergyman, educator and physician.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://eu.courierpress.com/story/life/2018/01/30/history-lesson-early-basketball-ymca/1077521001/\n | title =History Lesson: Early basketball at YMCA\n | last =Smith \n | first =Daniel\n | date =30 January 2018\n | website =Courier & Press\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 2 January 2018\n | quote = }}</ref> Naismith was asked to create an indoor \"athletic distraction\" to keep rowdy youth busy in the cold New England winter months. [[Luther Gulick (physician)]], the head of  Springfield YMCA, gave Naismith two weeks to come up with a game to occupy a particularly incorrigible group. Naismith decided the game had to be physically active, simple to understand and would have minimal physical roughness.\n\nThe original game was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets nailed to the balcony of Springfield YMCA. The game was an immediate hit, although originally the baskets still had their bottoms, and the ball had to be manually retrieved after each score, considerably slowing play. It was mostly a passing game, and dribbling did not become a major part of the game until much later, when the ball was improved to its present form. \n\nGulick worked with Naismith to spread the sport, chairing the Basketball Committee of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (1895\u20131905) and representing the [[United States Olympic Committee]] during the [[1908 Olympic Games]]. Naismith and his wife attended the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] when basketball was included for the first time as an Olympic event.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Complete Book of the Olympics|last=Loucky, Wallechinsky|first=David and Jamie|publisher=Aurum Press Limited|year=2008|isbn=|location=London|pages=399-400}}</ref> For his efforts to increase the popularity of basketball and of [[physical fitness]] in general, Gulick was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a contributor in 1959. \n\n====Volleyball====\nFour years after James Naismith invented basketball in Springfield in 1891, [[William G. Morgan]], an instructor at YMCA in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], wanted to create a game for older gentlemen which had less physical contact. He borrowed a tennis net, raised it 6 feet, 6 inches above the floor, and invented the game of \"mintonette\", which could be played by a group of any number and involved volleying a large ball over the net. An observer wisely suggested that a better name for the new sport might be \"volleyball\". \n\n====Racquetball====\nRacquetball is another YMCA invented sport. [[Joseph Sobek]] a tennis, handball and squash player who worked in a rubber manufacturing factory, was dissatisfied with the options for indoor sports in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. He could not find squash players of his caliber and he did not care particularly for handball, so in 1950 he designed a short, stringed racquet, used a children's toy rubber ball, and created rules for a new game using the handball courts. He called his new sport \"paddle rackets\". The sport really took off in the 1970s and there are an estimated 15 million players worldwide today.<ref>\"Popular sports invented at YMCA\" by Jill Fandrich, 25 May 2009</ref>\n\n=== Publishing ===\n{{Main|YMCA Press}} YMCA founded YMCA Press [[publishing house]] in Russia in 1900. It moved to Paris after [[World War I]], where it focused on providing intellectual and educational works to Russian [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s. It perhaps most famously published some of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s books whilst he was imprisoned by the Russian government.<ref name=\"Raeff1990\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/russiaabroadcult00raef_0|url-access=registration|title=Russia Abroad: A Cultural History of the Russian Emigration, 1919-1939|author=Marc Raeff|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-19-505683-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/russiaabroadcult00raef_0/page/78 78]}}</ref>\n\n=== Religious ===\n[[File:YMCA Maple Syrup.JPG|thumb|Campers at a YMCA camp in Huguenot]]\n\nThe first YMCA included Bible studies, although the organization has generally moved on to a more [[holistic]] approach to youth work. Around six years after its birth, an international YMCA conference in Paris decided that the objective of the organization should become \"[[Disciple (Christianity)|Christian discipleship]] developed through a program of religious, educational, social and physical activities\" (Binfield 1973:265).\n\n== Europe ==\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nYMCAs in England and Wales offer supported accommodation for vulnerable and homeless young people, mental health services, youth clubs, sports centres, nursery schools and family support and after school clubs. Across England and Wales YMCA supports more than 18,000 young people with homes each year,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ymca.org.uk/about/what-we-do/accommodation|title=Accommodation|website=YMCA England & Wales|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> and is thus one of the largest providers of safe supported accommodation for young people. The vast majority of this accommodation is supported by a range of personal, social and educational services.\n\nThe archive of the British YMCA is housed at the [[University of Birmingham]] Special Collections. The archive of YMCA Scotland is available at the [[National Archives of Scotland]]. YMCA in the United Kingdom consists of three separate National Councils: England & Wales, Ireland, and [[Scotland]]. YMCAs in [[Wales]] joined YMCA England in 2017, leading to the National Council renaming to YMCA England & Wales.\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:CVJM Wittenberg 04.jpg|thumb|CVJM building in [[Wittenberg]]]]\nIn Germany (as well as Austria and Switzerland) YMCA is called CVJM, which stands for Christlicher Verein junger Menschen (Christian Association of Young People). Up until 1985 the organisation was called \u2018Christlicher Verein Junger M\u00e4nner\u2019 (Christian Association of Young Men), the name change reflected its activities being accessible to men and women.\n\n=== Sweden ===\nThe [[YWCA-YMCA of Sweden]] ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: '''''KFUK-KFUM Sverige''''') was established in 1966 following a merger of the YMCA of Sweden and the YWCA of Sweden. In 2011, the organization decided to use the term '''''KFUM Sverige''''' during promotion where ''M'' now stands for ''m\u00e4nniskor'' (\"people\") instead of ''m\u00e4n'' (men) as before. The YWCA-YMCA of Sweden has 40,000 members in 140 local associations. Several Swedish YWCA-YMCA associations have been successful in sport.\n<br />\n== North America ==\n\n{{Anchor|YMCA of the USA}}\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Advert section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Ymca logo 2011-06-28.png|thumb|right|International ''(above)'' and American ''(below)'' logos]]\n[[File:Ketchum Downtown YMCA, Front View.jpg|thumb|right|Ketchum Downtown YMCA of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

It was founded in 1851 by Captain Thomas Valentine Sullivan (1800\u201359), an American seaman and missionary. He was influenced by the London YMCA and saw the association as an opportunity to provide a \"home away from home\" for young sailors on shore leave. The [[Boston YMCA|Boston chapter]] promoted evangelical Christianity, the cultivation of Christian sympathy, and the improvement of the spiritual, physical, and mental condition of young men. By 1853, the Boston YMCA had 1,500 members, most of whom were merchants and artisans. Hardware merchant [[Franklin W. Smith]] was the first elected president in 1855.<ref name=\"BORDER\">Howell, Benita J.: [http://www.mtsu.edu/borders/archives/14/BS_2003_archive.pdf \"Franklin Webster Smith of Boston: Architect of Tourism in Busby, Tennessee\"] Border States: Journal of the Kentucky-Tennessee American Studies Association, 2003</ref>\nMembers paid an annual membership fee to use the facilities and services of the association. Because of political, physical, and population changes in Boston during the second half of the century, the Boston YMCA established branch divisions to satisfy the needs of local neighborhoods. From its early days, the Boston YMCA offered educational classes. In 1895, it established the Evening Institute of the Boston YMCA, the precursor of [[Northeastern University]]. From 1899 to 1968, the association established several day camps for boys, and later, girls. Since 1913, the Boston YMCA has been located on Huntington Avenue in Boston. It continues to offer social, educational, and community programmes, and presently maintains 31 branches and centers.

The first central Baltimore YMCA, which still stands in 2014 (but with its towers removed in the early 1900s, converted to offices in the 1910s and apartments and condos in 2001) at the northern edge of the downtown business district near Cathedral Hill and the more toney residential [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon-Belvedere-Mount Royal]] neighborhood with many of the city's cultural and educational institutions relocating. By 1907, three blocks further north, a cornerstone was laid for a [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux Arts/Classical Revival]] styled, seven-story building on the northeast corner of West Franklin at Cathedral Streets, across the street to the north from the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] (the old Baltimore Cathedral) of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], (1806\u201321). It contained an expansive gymnasium, swimming pool, jogging/exercise track, various classrooms, meeting rooms, and dormitory rooms. Two decades later, the city's central branch of the [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]] public circulating library system (first of its kind in America) expanded from its original \"Old Central\" a block south facing West Mulberry Street to a new block-long library facing Cathedral Street and the Cathedral/Basilica in 1931\u20131933, with distinctive department store front display windows on the sidewalk, giving the area a unique cultural and educational centrality. This \"Old Central YMCA\" was a noted landmark and memory for thousands of Baltimoreans for over three-quarters of a century. It later was converted to the present Mount Vernon Hotel and Caf\u00e9 as the Baltimore area's Central YMCA of central Maryland reorganized in the early 1980s and cut back on its various activities in the downtown area to more suburban and neighborhood centers throughout the region (although not without controversy and some alienation as the \"Old Central\" was closed). Additional YMCA work was undertaken in what was then called the \"Colored YMCA\" in the inner northwest neighborhood of [[Upton, Baltimore|Upton]] on [[Maryland Route 127|Druid Hill Avenue]] near the traditional \"Black\" Pennsylvania Avenue commercial/cultural district which were undertaken by committed then \"Negro/Colored\" residents, who persevered in the early 20th century despite very little encouragement and hardly any financial resources from the board of the Central YMCA of Baltimore.\n\nIn 1853 the Reverend [[Anthony Bowen]] founded the first YMCA for Colored Men in Washington, D.C. The renamed Anthony Bowen YMCA is still serving the U Street area of Washington. It became a part of YMCA of the city of Washington in 1947.\n\nYMCA developed the first known English as a Second Language program in the United States in response to the influx of immigrants in the 1850s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ymcagbc.org/about-y/y|title=The Y|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nStarting before the [[American Civil War]],<ref name=YMCAhistory/> YMCA provided nursing, shelter, and other support in wartime.\n\nIn 1879 Darren Blach organized the first [[Sioux]] Indian YMCA in Florida.

It deployed over 25,000 staff in military units and bases from Siberia to Egypt to France. They took over the military's morale and comfort operations worldwide. [[Irving Berlin]] wrote ''[[Yip Yip Yaphank]]'', a revue that included a song entitled \"I Can Always Find a Little Sunshine in the YMCA\".

YMCA secretaries worked to create camp committees to run programs providing educational opportunities, physical instruction, and equipment, theatrical productions and musicals. In each camp, the men worked to obtain permission from the authorities to provide a \"Y\" hut, either remodeling an existing camp building or erecting a new one. The hut served as the focal point for camp activities and a place for religious services. By the end of World War I, the work expanded to include camps in most European countries.\n\n==== Since World War II ====\n\nYMCA was associated with homosexual subculture through the middle part of the 20th century, with the athletic facilities providing cover for closeted individuals.<ref>Neumann, Caryn E. glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture.

Notable founders of YMCA Indian Guides include Harold Keltner, the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] YMCA secretary, and Joe Friday, an Ojibway hunting guide. The two men met in 1927, when Keltner went on a hunting and fishing trip in the Hudson Bay country. With Friday's help, Keltner studied the close companionship of Ojibway boys and their fathers. This is when he conceived the plan for the Indian Guides.<ref>(From a newspaper article dated 9 November 1937) http://vintagekidstuff.com/yguides/imgB5.jpg</ref> Today, Joe Friday and Harold Keltner are commemorated with patch awards honoring their legacy. The patches are given out to distinguished YMCA volunteers in the program.<ref name=\"townhall\" /> In 2003 the programme evolved into what is now known nationally as YMCA Adventure Guides. \"Trailblazers\" is YMCA's parent/child program for older kids. In 2006, YMCA Indian Guides celebrated 80 years as a YMCA program.

G. Keyekbaev: \u201cIn human society there is such an objective regularity: especially talented, even great personalities, writers appear in every nation, in any nationality once every hundred years , scientists, batyrs. Such people are usually called sons or daughters of the people. This high name can be applied to Jalil Giniyatovich Keyekbaev. \u201d (G.G. Saitbattalov. Memoirs of Jalil Keyekbaev.-Ufa, 1989.-S.39-40.)\n*Full member of the Academy of Sciences of [[Tatarstan|the Republic of Tatarstan]], Doctor of Philology, Professor [[Mirfatyh Zakiev]] about Professor J. Keyekbaev: \u201cThis person is one of the beautiful features of human nature. If there weren\u2019t such people who could embody the best qualities of past and present generations, human society would not be able to develop so quickly. \u201d(Zakiev M.Z. Inspirational song.-Ufa, 2011.-\u0421.11. )\n*Memoirs of the Head of the Yakut Language Department of  [[North-Eastern Federal University]] (Yakut State University), Professor Nikolai Antonov: \u201cThe lectures of J. Kiekbaev remained extremely interesting and exciting in memory. We were struck by the depth of his knowledge, erudition, knowledge of all issues. The scientist was fluent in many Turkic and Western European languages. In lectures, he attracted rich material from the Ural-Altai languages, including the Yakut, Chuvash, Tungus-Manchurian, Finno-Ugric and other languages. We felt that we were facing  one of the most prominent linguists in the country. His lectures had a great influence on our work, and at the same time, we admired his simplicity and breadth of soul.\u00bb (Memoirs of Jalil Keyekbaev.-Ufa, 1989.-S.57-58. Memoirs of N. Antonov)\n*Russian scientist-Turkologist, Doctor of Philology, academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences A.N. Kononov: \u00abThe history of the kinship of the Turkic and Ural-Altai languages has been studied for more than 200 years, various ways and methods have been used for this, but not one of them has led to the desired results. And in recent years, Professor J.G. Keyekbaev and his school have achieved great results in this area. This is an indisputable fact, so we all need to study his works and his scientific methods, get acquainted with his scientific school. I don\u2019t see another way now\u00bb.(Aznabaev A.J.

G. Keyekbaev: \u201cIn human society there is such an objective regularity: especially talented, even great personalities, writers appear in every nation, in any nationality once every hundred years , scientists, batyrs. Such people are usually called sons or daughters of the people. This high name can be applied to Jalil Giniyatovich Keyekbaev. \u201d (G.G. Saitbattalov. Memoirs of Jalil Keyekbaev.-Ufa, 1989.-S.39-40.) \n\n*Full member of the Academy of Sciences of [[Tatarstan|the Republic of Tatarstan]], Doctor of Philology, Professor [[Mirfatyh Zakiev]] about Professor J. Keyekbaev: \u201cThis person is one of the beautiful features of human nature. If there weren\u2019t such people who could embody the best qualities of past and present generations, human society would not be able to develop so quickly. \u201d(Zakiev M.Z. Inspirational song.-Ufa, 2011.-\u0421.11. )\n\n*Memoirs of the Head of the Yakut Language Department of  [[North-Eastern Federal University]] (Yakut State University), Professor Nikolai Antonov: \u201cThe lectures of J. Kiekbaev remained extremely interesting and exciting in memory. We were struck by the depth of his knowledge, erudition, knowledge of all issues. The scientist was fluent in many Turkic and Western European languages. In lectures, he attracted rich material from the Ural-Altai languages, including the Yakut, Chuvash, Tungus-Manchurian, Finno-Ugric and other languages. We felt that we were facing  one of the most prominent linguists in the country. His lectures had a great influence on our work, and at the same time, we admired his simplicity and breadth of soul.\u00bb (Memoirs of Jalil Keyekbaev.-Ufa, 1989.-S.57-58. Memoirs of N. Antonov)\n\n*Russian scientist-Turkologist, Doctor of Philology, academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences A.N. Kononov: \u00abThe history of the kinship of the Turkic and Ural-Altai languages has been studied for more than 200 years, various ways and methods have been used for this, but not one of them has led to the desired results. And in recent years, Professor J.G. Keyekbaev and his school have achieved great results in this area.

Both parents played the piano. His father earned his living as a maker of colours and lacquers at Horsens {{harv|Barnett|n.d.}}. The Danish journalist [[Knud Holmboe]] was his elder brother.\n\nFrom the age of 14 Vagn Holmboe took violin lessons. In 1926, at the age of 16, he began formal music training at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] in Copenhagen on the recommendation of [[Carl Nielsen]]. He studied under [[Knud Jeppesen]] (theory) and [[Finn H\u00f8ffding]] (composition).\n\nAfter finishing his studies in 1929 he moved to Berlin where for a short period [[Ernst Toch]] became his teacher {{harv|Rapoport|2001}}. During his time in the German capital he met the [[Romania]]n-born pianist and [[Visual arts|visual artist]] Meta May Graf (1910\u20132003) from [[Sibiu|Sibiu/Hermannstadt]]. She had studied at the [[Berlin University of the Arts|Musikhochschule Berlin]] since 1929, with [[Paul Hindemith]] as one of her teachers {{harv|Anon.|2018a}}. The couple married in 1933 and left Berlin for Romania, where they visited obscure and remote villages and studied [[Transylvania]]n folk-song {{harv|Barnett|n.d.}}. Subsequently, they moved to Denmark, settling in the capital, Copenhagen, in 1934.  While his wife Meta gave up her musical career to pursue her passions in the visual arts, photography in particular, Vagn gave music lessons privately and began composing during this period. Many of the early compositions have never been performed. Similar to the research he had already done in Romania, he pursued his studies of folk-song with much field-work throughout Denmark including the [[Faroes]] and [[Greenland]]. Many overtly folk-linked compositions, including the Inuit Songs, are a result of these activities.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1949 he was a teacher at the [[Institute for the Blind and Partially Sighted (Denmark)|Royal Institute for the Blind]], and from 1950 to 1965 he taught at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music|Royal Conservatory]] in Copenhagen, being appointed a Professor there in 1955. Prior to that he had also worked as a [[music criticism|music critic]] for the Danish daily [[Politiken]] from 1947 to 1955 {{harv|Anon.|2018b}}.\n\nVagn Holmboe's students included [[Per N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd]], [[Ib N\u00f8rholm]], [[Bent Lorentzen (composer)|Bent Lorentzen]], [[Arne Nordheim]], [[Egil Hovland]] and [[Alan Stout (composer)|Alan Stout]]. {{See LMST|Vagn|Holmboe}}\n\nVagn and his wife Meta had bought a piece of land at Lake [[Arres\u00f8]] in [[Raml\u00f8se]]/[[Zealand]] in 1940, where they set up a farm, \"Arre Boreale\" (Latin for ''Northern Arres\u00f8''), in the 1950s and spent the rest of their lives together there {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}. Vagn Holmboe was a keen nature-lover, who lived in the countryside until his death in 1996 and over the years personally planted 3000 trees on his land {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}.\n\n==Music==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}\n{{See also|List of compositions by Vagn Holmboe}}\nHolmboe composed about 370 works, including 13 [[symphony|symphonies]], three chamber symphonies, four symphonies for strings, 20 [[string quartet]]s, numerous [[concerto]]s, one opera, and the late series of ''preludes'' for chamber orchestra, as well as much [[choir|choral]] and other music, in addition to some early works that never received opus numbers. His last work, the 21st string quartet, ''Quartetto sereno,'' was completed by his pupil Per N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nMusical metamorphosis of thematic or [[Motif (music)|motivic]] fragments characterize most of his works between the years 1950 and 1970 (similar to [[Jean Sibelius]]).

Just as the Kingdom was a unification of various states in the Italian peninsula, so the ''Regia Marina'' was formed from the navies of those states, though the main constituents were the [[Real Marina (Kingdom of the Two Sicilies)|navies]] of the former kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]. The new Navy inherited a substantial number of ships, both sail- and steam-powered, and the long naval traditions of its constituents, especially those of Sardinia and Naples, but also suffered from some major handicaps.\n\nFirstly, it suffered from a lack of uniformity and cohesion; the ''Regia Marina'' was a heterogeneous mix of equipment, standards and practice, and even saw hostility between the officers from the various former navies. These problems were compounded by the continuation of separate officer schools at [[Genoa]] and [[Naples]], and were not fully addressed until the opening of a unified [[Accademia Navale di Livorno|Naval Academy]] at [[Livorno]] in 1881.\n\nSecondly, unification occurred during a period of rapid advances in naval technology and tactics, as typified by the launch of {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}} by France in 1858, and later by the appearance of, and battle between, {{USS|Monitor}} and {{ship|CSS|Virginia||6}} in 1862. These innovations quickly made older warships obsolete. Italy did not possess the shipyards or infrastructure to build the modern ships required, but the then Minister for the Navy, Admiral [[Carlo di Persano]], launched a substantial programme to purchase warships from foreign yards.\n\n===Seven Weeks War===\n[[File:Die Seeschlacht bei Lissa.jpg|thumb|right|''The Sea Battle of Lissa'', by [[Carl Frederik S\u00f8rensen]], 1868]]\nThe new navy's baptism of fire came on 20 July 1866 at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] (parallel to the [[Seven Weeks War]]). The battle was fought against the [[Austrian Empire]] and occurred near the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] in the [[Adriatic sea]]. This was one of the few fleet actions of the nineteenth century, and as a major sea battle that involved [[ram (ship)|ramming]], it is often considered to have had a profound effect on subsequent warship design and tactics.\n\nThe Italian fleet, commanded by Admiral Persano, mustered 12 [[ironclad]] and 17 wooden-hulled ships, though only one, {{ship|Italian battleship|Affondatore||2}}, was of the most modern [[turret ship]] design. Despite a marked disadvantage in numbers and equipment, superior handling by the Austrians under Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] resulted in a severe defeat for Italy, which lost two armoured ships and 640 men.\n\n===Decline and resurgence===\nAfter the war, the ''Regia Marina'' passed through some difficult years as the naval budget was substantially reduced, thus impairing the fleet's efficiency and the pace of new construction; only in the 1870s, under [[Simone Antonio Saint-Bon|Simone Pacoret de Saint Bon]]'s ministry, did the situation begin to improve. In 1881, the battleship {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}} was commissioned, followed in 1882 by the battleship {{ship|Italian ironclad|Enrico Dandolo||2}}; at the time these were the most powerful warships in the world, and signalled the Italian fleet's renewed power. In 1896 the corvette ''Magenta'' completed a circumnavigation of the world. The following year the ''Regia Marina'' conducted experiments with [[Guglielmo Marconi]] in the use of radio communications. 1909 saw the first use of aircraft with the fleet. An Italian naval officer, [[Vittorio Cuniberti]], was the first in 1903 to envision in a published article the all-big gun battleship design, which would be later come to be known as [[dreadnought]].\n\n===Italo-Turkish War===\nIn 1911 and 1912, the ''Regia Marina'' was involved in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] against forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. As the majority of the Ottoman fleet stayed behind the relative safety of the Dardanelles, the Italians dominated the Mediterranean during the conflict winning victories against Ottoman light units at the battles of [[Battle of Preveza (1911)|Preveza]] and [[Battle of Beirut (1912)|Beirut]]. In the Red Sea the Italian forces were vastly superior to those of the Ottomans who only possessed a squadron of gunboats there. These were destroyed while attempting to withdraw into the Mediterranean at the [[Battle of Kunfuda Bay]].\n\n==World War I==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 134-C2280, Szent Istv\u00e1n, Sinkendes Linienschiff.jpg|thumb|right|{{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n||2}} low in the water, after being torpedoed by Italian [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]]]]\n\nBefore 1914, the Kingdom of Italy built six [[Battleship|dreadnought]] battleships: ({{ship|Italian battleship|Dante Alighieri||2}} as a prototype; {{ship|Italian battleship|Giulio Cesare||2}}, {{ship|Italian battleship|Conte di Cavour||2}} and {{ship|Italian battleship|Leonardo da Vinci||2}} of the {{sclass-|Conte di Cavour|battleship|4}}; and {{ship|Italian battleship|Andrea Doria||2}} and {{ship|Italian battleship|Caio Duilio||2}} of the {{sclass-|Andrea Doria|battleship|4}}), but they did not participate in major naval actions in [[World War I]], as they were positioned to intercept a major sortie of the Austro-Hungarian Navy which never came.\n\nDuring the war, the ''Regia Marina'' spent its major efforts in the [[Adriatic Sea]], fighting the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. The resulting [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I]] consisted mainly of Austro-Hungarian coastal bombardments of Italy's Adriatic coast, and wider-ranging German/Austro-Hungarian submarine warfare into the Mediterranean. Allied forces mainly limited themselves to blockading the German/Austro-Hungarian navies in the Adriatic, which was successful in regards to surface units, but failed for the submarines, which found safe harbours and easy passage into and out of the area for the whole of the war. Considered a relatively minor part of the naval warfare of World War I, it nonetheless tied down significant forces.\n\nFor most of the war the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies each kept a relatively passive watch over their adversaries. The Italian fleet lost the pre-dreadnought battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Benedetto Brin||2}} at [[Brindisi]] (27 September 1915) and the dreadnought {{ship|Italian battleship|Leonardo da Vinci||2}} at [[Taranto]] (2 August 1916) due to a magazine explosion (although there were rumours of Austrian sabotage). In the last part of the war, the Regia Marina developed new weapons: the [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], that sank the Austro-Hungarian battleship {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n}} in the [[Adriatic Sea]] on 10 June 1918; and an early type of [[human torpedo]] (''Mignatta'') entered the harbour of [[Pula]] and sank the [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[flagship]] {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} on 1 November 1918 shortly after the entire Austro-Hungarian Navy was turned over to the newly founded neutral State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The battleship {{SMS|Tegetthoff|1912|6}} (sister of the former two) was handed over to Italy as a war prize in 1919.\n\n==Interwar years==\nDuring the interwar years the Italian government set about modernizing the ''Regia Marina'' in a way that could enable it to reach dominance over the Mediterranean Sea. Italian naval construction was limited by the [[Washington Naval Conference]]. The 1922 treaty required a parity in naval forces between the Italian and French navies, with equality in total displacement in battleships and carriers. The treaty influenced the development of the Italian fleet over the years between the two world wars. Between the late twenties and early thirties a construction program began, focusing first on cruisers up to 10,000 tons, followed by the building of destroyers and submarines, and lastly the construction of the new {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|2}}s; plans were also put in place to modernize the {{sclass-|Conte di Cavour|battleship|0}} and {{sclass-|Andrea Doria|battleship|2}}s. Much of these new naval units were responses to French naval constructions, as the [[Marine nationale]] was seen until the mid 1930s as the most likely enemy in a hypothetical conflict.\n\nThe ''Regia Marina'' chose to build fast ships armed with longer ranged guns to give the Italian vessels the ability to minimize close contact with vessels of the Royal Navy, whose crews were more experienced. In theory this would allow them to engage or break off at their own choosing, and would allow them to hit the enemy when he could not yet hit back. New guns were developed with longer ranges than their British counterparts of similar caliber. Speed was emphasized in their new construction. Italian cruisers built in the 1920s, such as {{ship|Italian cruiser|Giovanni delle Bande Nere||2}} were built with a newly designed and relatively thin armour.. This would have a decisive role in a number of naval battles, including the [[Battle of Cape Spada]]. Later classes, such as the {{sclass-|Zara|cruiser|5}} and {{sclass-|Raimondo Montecuccoli|cruiser|5}} classes, were built to a more balanced design with thicker armor.\n\n[[File:Duilio 1948.jpg|thumb|right|''Caio Duilio'' after refitting.]]\nThe modernization work on the four Great War era battleships turned into a significant reconstruction project, with only 40% of the original structures being left. The ship's guns were upgraded in main armament, going from 13 guns of 305&nbsp;mm diameter, to 10 guns of 320&nbsp;mm diameter. The middle turret and the vessel's central tower were eliminated. To increase speed the coal-fired boilers were replaced with modern oil-fired boilers and ten meters were added to the ship's length to improve the [[Fineness ratio|coefficient of fineness]]. Though the ships were improved, they still were not an equal match for the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}}s and the {{sclass-|Renown|battlecruiser|2}}s, both of which carried larger guns and heavier armour.\n\nThough scientific research on tracking devices such as radar and sonar was being conducted in Italian universities and military laboratories by men such as Ugo Tiberio and [[Guglielmo Marconi]], the conservative Italian leadership had little interest in these new technologies, and did not use them to improve the effectiveness of the Italian vessels. This was mainly due to the influence of Admiral [[Domenico Cavagnari]], whom Mussolini appointed as Chief of Staff of the Navy in 1933, and whom he later promoted to Secretary of the Navy. Likewise technological advancement in radio range finders and gunnery control devices for night combat were not incorporated. Regarding such devices, Cavagnari emphasized \"not wanting traps in your way\". Writing to Admiral Iachino, he wrote \"..procedere con estrema cautela nell'accettare brillanti novit\u00e0 tecniche che non siano ancora collaudate da una esperienza pratica sufficientemente lunga..\", which can be translated to \"... proceed with extreme caution regarding brilliant technical innovations that have not yet been tested or with which there is no practical experience.\"  Thus, the Italian navy entered the Second World War with a marked technical inferiority to the British Navy. German General [[Albert Kesselring]], overall commander of Axis forces in the Mediterranean, observed that the Italian navy was \"a good weather\" force, unable to operate effectively at night or in heavy seas.\n\n[[File:Amerigo vespucci 1976 nyc aufgetakelt.jpg|thumb|right|{{ship|Italian training ship|Amerigo Vespucci||2}}, launched in 1931; here in the harbor of [[New York City|New York]], 1976.]]\nTwo training ships were built during this period, in addition to the effort to modernize and re-equip the combat vessels of the navy. These were square rigged school ships the ''Regia Marina'' ordered in 1925. The sailing ships followed a design by Lieutenant Colonel [[Francesco Rotundi]] of the Italian Navy Engineering Corps, reminiscent of [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] from the [[Napoleonic era]]. The first of these two ships, {{ship|Italian training ship|Cristoforo Colombo||2}}, was put into service in 1928 and was used by the Italian Navy for training until 1943. After [[World War II]], this ship was handed over to the [[Soviet Union]] as part of [[war reparation]]s and was shortly afterwards decommissioned. The second ship of the design was {{ship|Italian training ship|Amerigo Vespucci||2}}. The ship was built in 1930 at the (formerly Royal) Naval Shipyard of [[Castellammare di Stabia]] ([[Naples]]). She was launched on 22 February 1931, and was put into service in July of that year. She is still being used to this day.\n\nIn 1928, the unified command of the \"''Armata Navale''\" was abolished, and the fleet was divided in two [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] (''Squadre navali''), one based at La Spezia and the other based at Taranto.\n\n===Italo-Ethiopian War===\n[[File:Raimondo Montecuccoli SLV Green.jpg|thumb|Cruiser ''Raimondo Montecuccoli'' during a visit to Australia in 1938]]\nThe ''Regia Marina'' played a limited role in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invasion of Ethiopia]]. While the [[Ethiopian Empire]] was landlocked, the navy was instrumental in delivering and supplying the invasion forces through [[Somalia|Somali]] and [[Eritrea]]n ports.\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\nAt the time of the Italian intervention in the [[Spanish Civil War]], the ''Regia Marina'' sent naval units in support of the Italian Corps of Volunteer Troops (''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]''). Approximately 58 Italian submarines took part in operations against Republican naval forces of Spain. These submarines were organized in a Submarine Legion and complemented German [[U-boat]] operations as part of [[Operation Ursula]]. At least two [[Spanish Second Republic|Republican]] freighters, one [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and another [[Panamanian]] were either sunk or forced to run aground by Italian destroyers near the [[Strait of Sicily]].<ref>Greene and Masignani, pp. 22\u201323</ref> Two light cruisers took part in the shelling of [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] in 1937, resulting in the deaths of more than 30 civilians.<ref>Greene and Massignani, p. 22</ref>\n\n===Albania===\nIn 1939, the ''Regia Marina'' supported the [[Italian invasion of Albania|invasion of Albania]]. All ground forces involved in the invasion had to cross the [[Adriatic Sea]] from mainland Italy and the crossings were accomplished without incident.\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:RNVittorio Veneto-Battle of Cape Spartivento.jpg|thumb|''Vittorio Veneto'' at the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]].

Italy went to war with the fourth largest navy in the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] saw the control of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as an essential prerequisite for expanding his \"[[New Roman Empire]]\" into [[Nice]], [[Corsica]], [[Tunis]] and the [[Balkans]]. Italian naval building accelerated during his tenure. Mussolini described the Mediterranean as \"[[Mare Nostrum]]\" (Our Sea).<ref name=\"Mollo, p.94\">Mollo, p.94</ref>\n\nBefore the declaration of war, Italian ground and air forces prepared to strike at the beaten French forces across the border in the [[Italian invasion of France]]. By contrast, the ''Regia Marina'' prepared to secure the lines of communications between Italy, [[Italian Libya|Libya]] and the [[Italian East Africa|East Africa]]n colonies. The Italian High Command (''Comando Supremo'') did not approve of the plan devised by the Italian Naval Headquarters (''[[Supermarina]]'') to occupy a weakly defended [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]],<ref name=\"Piekalkiewicz, p. 82\">Piekalkiewicz, p. 82</ref> which proved a crucial mistake. The British, thinking Malta could not be defended due to the proximity of Italian air bases in Italy, Sicily, and Libya, had put little effort into bolstering the islands' defences. Thus, at the outset of the war there were only 42 anti-aircraft guns on the island and twelve [[Gloster Gladiator|Gloster Sea Gladiators]], half sitting in crates at the wharf.<ref name=\"Taylor 1974, p. 181.\">Taylor 1974, p. 181.</ref>\n\nEntering the war, the ''Regia Marina'' was operating under a number of limitations. Though significant assets were available to challenge the Royal Navy for control of the Mediterranean, there had been a lack of emphasis on the incorporation of technological advances such as radar and sonar. This meant that in night engagements or foul weather, the Italian ships were unable to detect the approach of their British adversaries. When engaged, they could only range their guns if they were able to visually locate their targets.\n\nThe ''Regia Marina'' had six battleships with which to contend for control of the Mediterranean, the four most modern of which were being re-fit at the outbreak of the war. In addition to the six capital ships, the Italians had 19 cruisers, 59 destroyers, 67 torpedo boats, and 116 submarines. Though the ''Regia Marina'' had a number of fast new cruisers with good range in their gunnery, the older classes were lightly built and had inadequate defensive armor. Numerically the Italian fleet was formidable, but there were a large number of older vessels, and the service suffered in general from insufficient time at sea for crew training.\n\nItaly's lack of raw materials meant that they would have great difficulty building new ships over the course of the war. Thus, the assets they did have were handled with caution by ''Supermarina''. Whereas Allied commanders at sea had a fair degree of autonomy and discretion to fight their vessels as circumstance allowed, Italian commanders were required to confer with their headquarters before committing their forces in an engagement that might result in their loss. This led to delays in arriving at decisions and actions being avoided, even when the Italians had a clear advantage. An example occurred during \"[[Malta Convoys#September 1940 \u2013 Operation Hats|Operation Hats]]\", in which the ''Regia Marina'' had superior forces but failed to commit them to take advantage of the opportunity.<ref>Tobagi pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nA further key disadvantage in the convoy support and interception battles that dominated the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]] was the intelligence advantage granted to the British in intercepting German ''Ultra'' and, through this, the key information on Italian convoy routes, times of departure, time of arrival, and make up of the convoy.\n\nThe warships of the ''Regia Marina'' had a general reputation as being well-designed. Italian small attack craft lived up to expectations and were responsible for many successful actions in the Mediterranean. Though Italian warships lacked [[radar]], this was partly offset in fair weather by good optical [[rangefinder]] and [[fire-control system|fire-control]] systems.<ref>Luciano Garibaldi, ''Century of War'' (2001)</ref>\n\nThe Italian Navy lacked a fleet air arm. The high command had reasoned that since the Italian navy would be operating solely in the Mediterranean, their vessels would never be far from an airfield, thus the time and resources needed to develop a naval air arm could be directed elsewhere. This proved problematic on a number of occasions. Though the Italians did have the aircraft carriers {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Aquila||2}} and {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Sparviero||2}} under construction at the start of the war, neither one was ever completed.<ref name=\"Mollo, p.94\"/> Lastly, the lack of natural oil reserves and subsequent shortage of oil precluded extensive fleet operations.<ref name=\"Piekalkiewicz, p. 82\"/>\n\n===Mediterranean===\n[[File:HMS Queen Elizabeth after the modernisation.jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} in [[Alexandria]] harbour surrounded by [[Torpedo nets|anti-torpedo nets]]. ''Regia Marina'' divers heavily damaged her on 19 December 1941.]]\n\nThe ''Regia Marina'' and the Royal Navy engaged in a two-and-a-half-year struggle for control of the Mediterranean. The ''Regia Marina''{{'}}s primary goal was to support the Axis forces in North Africa while obstructing the supply route to Alexandria and cutting off supplies to Malta. The Royal Navy's major effort was to maintain supply to the military forces and people of Malta, and secondarily to interdict convoy shipments to North Africa.<ref name=\"Coggins p. 179\">Coggins p. 179</ref>{{#tag:ref|The ''British Official History'' states \"All the major operations of the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean in 1942 prior to the Anglo-American landing in November were concerned with taking convoys into Malta.\"<ref name=\"Coggins p. 179\"/>|group=N}}  The first major action occurred on 11 November 1940 when the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} launched two waves of Swordfish torpedo-bombers in a [[Battle of Taranto|surprise raid]] against the Italian Fleet moored at the naval base of [[Taranto]]. The raid came in undetected, and three battleships were sunk. Another major defeat was inflicted on the ''Regia Marina'' at [[Battle of Cape Matapan|Cape Matapan]], where the Royal Navy and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] intercepted and destroyed three heavy cruisers ({{ship|Italian cruiser|Zara||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Pola||2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Fiume||2}}; all of the same class) and two {{sclass-|Oriani|destroyer|2}}<nowiki/>s in a night ambush, with the loss of over 2,300 seamen. The Allies had [[Ultra]] intercepts, which uncovered the Italian movements, and [[radar]], which enabled them to locate the ships and range their weapons at distance and at night. The better air reconnaissance skills of the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and their close collaboration with surface units were other major causes of the Italian debacle.\n\nOn 19 December 1941, the battleships {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} and {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}} were sunk in shallow water by [[limpet mine]]s planted by Italian [[manned torpedo]]es, knocking both out of the conflict for almost two years. This [[Raid on Alexandria (1941)|action]], coming on the heels of the loss of the ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'' in the South China Sea, significantly weakened the surface strength of the Royal Navy, making it difficult for them to challenge control of the eastern Mediterranean.{{#tag:ref|\"Consequently, the Alexandria Fleet remained for many months without any battleships, and it was forced to abandon any further open activity. In fact, Admiral Cunningham wrote that his Fleet now ''should have to leave it to the Royal Air Force to try if they could dispute the control of the Central Mediterranean with the enemy's fleet.''(...) In fact, it opened a period of clear Italian naval supremacy in the east-central Mediterranean\".<ref>Bragadin, page 152</ref>|group=N}}\n\nOn the night of 19 December, [[Force K]], comprising three cruisers and four destroyers based at [[Malta]], ran into an Italian minefield off [[Tripoli]]. Three cruisers struck mines, with the [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Neptune|20|6}} lost, along with the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Kandahar|F28|6}}. In addition, another destroyer was seriously damaged. All told 800 seamen were lost, and Force K, which had been effectively interdicting Axis convoys, was put out of action. This series of successes allowed the ''Regia Marina'' to achieve naval supremacy in the central Mediterranean. Coupled with an intensive bombing campaign against Malta, the Axis supply routes from southern Europe to North Africa were almost untouched by the Royal Navy or its allies for the next several months.\n\n[[File:The Sinking of HMS Bedouin.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Bedouin|F67|6}} sinking after Italian naval and aerial attack during Operation Harpoon]]\nThe Italian fleet went on the offensive, blocking or mauling three large Allied convoys bound for Malta. This led to a number of naval engagements, including the [[Second Battle of Sirte]] in March 1942, [[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]] and [[Operation Vigorous]], (known as the \"Battle of Mid-June\") and [[Operation Pedestal]] (the \"Battle of Mid-August\"). All of these engagements were favourable to the Axis. Despite this activity, the only real success of the Italian Fleet was the surface attack on the Harpoon convoy, supported by Axis aerial forces. These attacks sank several Allied warships and damaged others. Only two transports of the original six in the convoy reached Malta. This was an undisputed squadron-sized victory for Italian surface forces in World War II.{{#tag:ref|\"Clearly this was an Axis victory and a tactical victory for the Italian Navy. Part of the convoy did get through to Malta, but the British suffered far heavier losses than did the Italians and Mussolini would later personally present medals to Da Zara and some of his men for their efforts. It would be the only squadron-sized surface naval victory of the war for Italy.\"<ref>Greene & Massignani p. 238</ref>|group=N}}\n\nDespite the heavy losses suffered by the merchantmen and escorting forces of convoy Pedestal, the oil and supplies brought through allowed the near starving island of Malta to continue to hold out. With Allied landings in North Africa, [[Operation Torch]], in November 1942, the fortunes of war turned against the Italians. Their sea convoys were harassed day after day by the aerial and naval supremacy of the Allies. The maritime lane between Sicily and Tunisia became known as the \"route of death\". After years of back and forth, the Axis forces were forced to surrender in Tunisia, bringing the campaign for North Africa to a close.\n\nThe ''Regia Marina'' performed well and bravely in its North African convoy duties, but remained at a technical disadvantage. The Italian ships relied on speed but could easily be damaged by shell or torpedo, due to their relatively thin armour. The fatal and final blow to the Italian Navy was a shortage of fuel, which forced its main units to remain at anchor for most of the last year of the Italian alliance with Germany.<ref>Garibaldi, ''Century of War'' (2001) p. 151</ref>\n\n===Atlantic===\nFrom 10 June 1940, submarines of the ''Regia Marina'' took part in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] alongside the U-Boats of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. The Italian submarines were based in [[Bordeaux]], [[France]] at the [[BETASOM]] base. While more suited for the Mediterranean Sea than the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the thirty-two Italian submarines that operated in the Atlantic sank 109 Allied ships for a total of 593,864 tons.\n\nThe ''Regia Marina'' even planned an attack on [[New York City|New York]] harbor with midget submarines for December 1942, but this plan was delayed for many reasons and was never carried out.<ref>Borghese, p. 262</ref>\n\n===Red Sea===\nInitially, Italian forces enjoyed considerable success in East Africa. From 10 June 1940, the ''Regia Marina'''s [[Red Sea Flotilla]], based at [[Massawa]], [[Eritrea]], posed a potential threat to Allied shipping crossing the [[Red Sea]] between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the Mediterranean Sea. This threat increased in August 1940 with the [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]], which allowed the Italians the use of the port of [[Berbera]]; in January 1941, however, British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces launched a successful [[counterattack]] in East Africa and the threat posed by the Red Sea Flotilla disappeared.\n\nMuch of the Red Sea Flotilla was destroyed by hostile action during the first months of war or when the port of Massawa fell in April 1941. However, there were a few survivors. In February 1941, prior to the fall of Massawa, the colonial ship {{ship|Italian colonial ship|Eritrea||2}} and the [[Armed merchantmen|auxiliary cruisers]] {{ship|Italian ship|Ramb I||2}} and {{ship|Italian ship|Ramb II||2}} broke out and sailed to [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. While ''Ramb I'' was sunk by the [[New Zealand]] cruiser {{HMNZS|Leander}} off the [[Maldives]], ''Eritrea'' and ''Ramb II'' made it to Kobe. As the port of Massawa was falling, four submarines\u2014''Guglielmo'', ''Gauleo Ferraras'', {{ship|Italian submarine|Perla||2}}, and {{ship|Italian submarine|Archimede|1939|2}}\u2014sailed south from Massawa, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and ultimately sailed to [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|German occupied]] [[Bordeaux]], [[France]]. One or two Italian merchant ships from the Red Sea Flotilla made it to [[Vichy French]]-controlled [[Madagascar]].\n\nOn 10 June 1941 the British launched Operation Chronometer, landing a battalion of troops from the British Indian army at [[Assab]], the last Italian-held harbour on the Red Sea.<ref>Rohwer & H\u00fcmmelchen (1992), p. 78</ref>  By 11 June, Assab had fallen. Two days later, on 13 June, the Indian trawler ''Parvati'' became the last naval casualty of the East African Campaign when it struck a moored mine near Assab.<ref>Shah, Mian Zahir (2001).

The vessels were transported overland to the [[Danube|Danube River]] at [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], and then transported by water to [[Constan\u021ba]], [[Romania]]. The flotilla had an active and successful campaign, based at [[Yalta]] and [[Feodosiya|Feodosia]].\n\nAfter Italy quit the war, most of the Italian vessels on the Black Sea were transferred to [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''.

As part of [[Naval Detachment K]], German, Italian, and Finnish vessels operated against Soviet gunboats, escorts and supply vessels during the [[Siege of Leningrad]] between 21 June and 21 October 1942. The Italian vessels were ultimately turned over to Finland.\n\n===Far East===\nThe ''Regia Marina'' had a naval base in the [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession territory]] of [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] in [[China]]. The primary Italian vessels based in China were the mine-layer ''Lepanto'' and the gunboat {{ship|Italian gunboat|Carlotto||2}}. During World War II, Italian supply ships, auxiliary cruisers and submarines operated throughout the waters of the Far East, often in disguise.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The Italians also utilized Japanese-controlled port facilities such as [[Shanghai]], China, and Kobe, Japan.\n\nSeven Italian submarines operating from France were converted by the Italians into \"[[Merchant submarine|transport submarines]]\" in order to exchange rare or irreplaceable trade goods with Japan. The submarines {{ship|Italian submarine|Alpino Bagnolini||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Barbarigo||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Comandante Cappellini||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Giuseppe Finzi||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Reginaldo Giuliani||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Enrico Tazzoli|1935|2}}, and {{ship|Italian submarine|Luigi Torelli||2}} were converted for service with the ''[[Monsun Gruppe]]'' (\"Monsoon Group\"). The name of ''Comandante Cappellini'' was changed to {{ship|Italian submarine|Aquila III||2}}.\n\nTwelve additional [[Italian R-class submarine|R-class]] [[blockade runner|blockade running]] transport submarines were specifically designed for trade with the Far East, but only two of these vessels were completed before Italy quit the war. Both of these submarines were destroyed by Allied action almost as soon as they were launched.\n\n===Armistice of 1943===\nIn 1943, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was deposed and the new Italian government agreed to an [[Armistice with Italy|armistice with the Allies]]. Under the terms of this armistice, the ''Regia Marina'' had to sail its ships to an Allied port. Most sailed to Malta, but a flotilla from [[La Spezia]] headed towards [[Sardinia]]. This was intercepted and attacked by German aircraft and the battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Roma|1940|2}} was sunk by two hits from [[Fritz X]] guided glide-bombs. Among the 1600 sailors killed on board ''Roma'' was the Italian Naval Commander-in-Chief, Admiral [[Carlo Bergamini (admiral)|Carlo Bergamini]].<ref>[http://www.regiamarina.net/detail_text_with_list.asp?nid=123&lid=1 Carlo Bergamini, Biography by Pier Paolo Bergamini]</ref>\n\nAs vessels became available to the new Italian government, the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Navy]] was formed to fight on the side of the Allies. Other ships were captured in port by the Germans or scuttled by their crews. Few ''Regia Marina'' crews chose to fight for Mussolini's new fascist regime in northern Italy, the [[Italian Social Republic]] (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana'', RSI). Mussolini's pro-German National Republican Navy (''Marina Nazionale Repubblicana'') hardly reached a twentieth the size attained by the co-belligerent Italian fleet.<ref>Mollo, p. 100</ref>  In the Far East, the Japanese occupied the Italian concession territory of Tiensin.\n\nThere was little use for the surrendered Italian battleships and there was doubt about the loyalties of the crews, so these ships were interned in Egypt. In June 1944, the less powerful battleships (''Andrea Doria'', ''Caio Duilio'' and ''Giulio Cesare'') were allowed to return to [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]] harbour in [[Sicily]] for training. The others, {{ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Veneto||2}} and ''Italia'' (ex-{{ship|Italian battleship|Littorio||2}}), remained at [[Isma\u00eflia]] in the [[Suez Canal]] until 1947. After the war, ''Giulio Cesare'' was passed to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the Co-belligerency period, until [[Victory in Europe Day|\"VE\" (Victory in Europe) Day]], Italian light cruisers participated in the naval war in the Atlantic Ocean with patrols against German raiders. Smaller naval units (mainly submarines and torpedo boats) served in the Mediterranean Sea. In the last days of war, the issue of whether Italian battleships and cruisers should participate in the [[Pacific War]] was debated by the Allied leaders.\n\nThere were also Italian naval units in the Far East in 1943 when the new Italian government agreed to an armistice with the Allies. The reactions of their crews varied greatly. In general, surface units, mainly supply ships and auxiliary cruisers, either surrendered at Allied ports (''Eritrea'' at [[Colombo]], [[Ceylon]]) or, if in Japanese controlled ports, they were scuttled by their own crew (''Conte Verde'', ''Lepanto'', and ''Carlotto'' at [[Shanghai]]). ''Ramb II'' was taken over by the Japanese in Kobe and renamed ''Calitea II''. Four Italian submarines were in the Far East at the time of the armistice, transporting rare goods to Japan and Singapore: {{ship|Italian submarine|Ammiraglio Cagni||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Comandante Cappellini||2}} ({{ship|Italian submarine|Aquilla III||2}}), {{ship|Italian submarine|Reginaldo Giuliani||2}}, and {{ship|Italian submarine|Luigi Torelli||2}}. The crew of ''Ammiraglio Cagni'' heard of the armistice and surrendered to the Royal Navy off [[Durban]], [[South Africa]]. ''Comandante Cappellini'', ''Reginaldo Giuliani'', and ''Luigi Torelli'' and their crews were temporarily interned by the Japanese. The boats passed to German U-boat command and, with mixed German and Italian crews, they continued to fight against the Allies. The German navy assigned new officers to the three submarines. The three were renamed {{GS|UIT-23||2}}, {{GS|UIT-24||2}} and {{GS|UIT-25||2}} and took part in German war operations in the Pacific. ''Reginaldo Giuliani'' was sunk by the British submarine {{HMS|Tally-Ho|P317|6}} in February 1944. In May 1945, the other two vessels were taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Navy]] when Germany surrendered. About twenty Italian sailors continued to fight with the Japanese. ''Luigi Torelli'' remained active until 30 August 1945, when, in Japanese waters, this last Fascist Italian submarine shot down a [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] bomber of the [[United States Army Air Forces]].<ref>Willmott, H p (2009). ''The Last Century of Sea Power: From Port Arthur to Chanak, 1894\u20131922''.\nIndiana University Press, p. 276. {{ISBN|0253352142}}</ref>\n\n== After World War II ==\n{{main|Marina Militare}}\nAfter the end of hostilities, the ''Regia Marina'' started a long and complex rebuilding process. At the beginning of the war, the ''Regia Marina'' was the fourth largest navy in the world with a mix of modernised and new battleships. The important combat contributions of the Italian naval forces after the signing of the armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943 and the subsequent cooperation agreement on 23 September 1943 left the ''Regia Marina'' in a poor condition. Much of its infrastructure and bases were unusable and its ports mined and blocked by sunken ships. However, a large number of its naval units had survived the war, albeit in a low efficiency state. This was due to the conflict and the age of many vessels.\n\nThe vessels that remained were:\n* 2 incomplete and damaged aircraft carriers\n* 5 battleships\n* 9 cruisers\n* 11 destroyers\n* 22 frigates\n* 19 corvettes\n* 44 fast coastal patrol units\n* 50 minesweepers\n* 16 amphibious operations vessels\n* 2 school ships\n* 1 support ship and plane transport\n* various submarine units\n\nOn 2 June 1946, the Italian monarchy was abolished by a popular referendum. The Kingdom of Italy (''Regno d'Italia'') ended and was replaced by the [[Italian Republic]] (''Repubblica Italiana''). The ''Regia Marina'' became the Navy of the Italian Republic (''Marina Militare'').\n\n== Peace treaty ==\nOn 10 February 1947, a [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|peace treaty]] was signed in [[Paris]] between the Italian Republic and the victorious powers of World War II. The treaty was onerous for the Italian Navy. Apart from territorial and material losses, the following restrictions were imposed:\n\n* A ban on owning, building or experimenting with atomic weapons, self-propulsion projectiles or related launchers\n* A ban on owning battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines and amphibious assault units.\n* A ban on operating military installations on the islands of [[Pantelleria]] and [[Pianosa]]; and the [[Pelagie Islands]].\n* The total displacement, battleships excluded, of the future navy was not allowed to be greater than 67,500 tons, while the staff was capped at 25,000 men.\n\nThe treaty also ordered Italy to put the following ships at the disposals of the victorious nations [[United States]], Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, [[Greece]], [[Yugoslavia]], and Albania as war compensation:\n\n* 3 battleships: {{ship|Italian battleship|Giulio Cesare||2}}, {{ship|Italian battleship|Italia|1943|2}}, {{ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Veneto||2}};\n* 5 cruisers: {{ship|Italian cruiser|Emanuele Filiberto Duca d'Aosta||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Attilio Regolo||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Scipione Africano||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Eugenio di Savoia||2}} and  {{ship|Italian sloop|Eritrea||2}};\n* 7 destroyers; 5 of the {{sclass2-|Soldati|destroyer|4}}, {{ship|Italian destroyer|Augusto Riboty||2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Alfredo Oriani||2}};\n* 6 minesweepers;\n* 8 submarines, including three of the {{sclass-|Acciaio|submarine|4}};\n* 1 sailing school ship: {{ship|Italian training ship|Cristoforo Colombo||2}}.\n\nThe convoy escort {{ship|Italian ship|Ramb III||2}} ultimately became the Yugoslav Navy yacht {{ship||Galeb|ship|2}}. ''Galeb'' was used by the late [[List of heads of state of Yugoslavia|President]] of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] [[Marshal of Yugoslavia|Marshal]] [[Josip Broz Tito]] on his

Just as the Kingdom was a unification of various states in the Italian peninsula, so the ''Regia Marina'' was formed from the navies of those states, though the main constituents were the [[Real Marina (Kingdom of the Two Sicilies)|navies]] of the former kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]. The new Navy inherited a substantial number of ships, both sail- and steam-powered, and the long naval traditions of its constituents, especially those of Sardinia and Naples, but also suffered from some major handicaps.\n\nFirstly, it suffered from a lack of uniformity and cohesion; the ''Regia Marina'' was a heterogeneous mix of equipment, standards and practice, and even saw hostility between the officers from the various former navies. These problems were compounded by the continuation of separate officer schools at [[Genoa]] and [[Naples]], and were not fully addressed until the opening of a unified [[Accademia Navale di Livorno|Naval Academy]] at [[Livorno]] in 1881.\n\nSecondly, unification occurred during a period of rapid advances in naval technology and tactics, as typified by the launch of {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}} by France in 1858, and later by the appearance of, and battle between, {{USS|Monitor}} and {{ship|CSS|Virginia||6}} in 1862. These innovations quickly made older warships obsolete. Italy did not possess the shipyards or infrastructure to build the modern ships required, but the then Minister for the Navy, Admiral [[Carlo di Persano]], launched a substantial programme to purchase warships from foreign yards.\n\n===Seven Weeks War===\n[[File:Die Seeschlacht bei Lissa.jpg|thumb|right|''The Sea Battle of Lissa'', by [[Carl Frederik S\u00f8rensen]], 1868]]\nThe new navy's baptism of fire came on 20 July 1866 at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] (parallel to the [[Seven Weeks War]]). The battle was fought against the [[Austrian Empire]] and occurred near the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] in the [[Adriatic sea]]. This was one of the few fleet actions of the nineteenth century, and as a major sea battle that involved [[ram (ship)|ramming]], it had a profound, though with hindsight a detrimental, effect on warship design and tactics.\n\nThe Italian fleet, commanded by Admiral Persano, mustered 12 [[ironclad]] and 17 wooden-hulled ships, though only one, {{ship|Italian battleship|Affondatore||2}}, was of the most modern [[turret ship]] design. Despite a marked disadvantage in numbers and equipment, superior handling by the Austrians under Admiral [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]] resulted in a severe defeat for Italy, which lost two armoured ships and 640 men.\n\n===Decline and resurgence===\nAfter the war, the ''Regia Marina'' passed through some difficult years as the naval budget was substantially reduced, thus impairing the fleet's efficiency and the pace of new construction; only in the 1870s, under [[Simone Antonio Saint-Bon|Simone Pacoret de Saint Bon]]'s ministry, did the situation begin to improve. In 1881, the battleship {{ship|Italian ironclad|Caio Duilio||2}} was commissioned, followed in 1882 by the battleship {{ship|Italian ironclad|Enrico Dandolo||2}}; at the time these were the most powerful warships in the world, and signalled the Italian fleet's renewed power. In 1896 the corvette ''Magenta'' completed a circumnavigation of the world. The following year the ''Regia Marina'' conducted experiments with [[Guglielmo Marconi]] in the use of radio communications. 1909 saw the first use of aircraft with the fleet. An Italian naval officer, [[Vittorio Cuniberti]], was the first in 1903 to envision in a published article the all-big gun battleship design, which would be later come to be known as [[dreadnought]].\n\n===Italo-Turkish War===\nIn 1911 and 1912, the ''Regia Marina'' was involved in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] against forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. As the majority of the Ottoman fleet stayed behind the relative safety of the Dardanelles, the Italians dominated the Mediterranean during the conflict winning victories against Ottoman light units at the battles of [[Battle of Preveza (1911)|Preveza]] and [[Battle of Beirut (1912)|Beirut]]. In the Red Sea the Italian forces were vastly superior to those of the Ottomans who only possessed a squadron of gunboats there. These were destroyed while attempting to withdraw into the Mediterranean at the [[Battle of Kunfuda Bay]].\n\n==World War I==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 134-C2280, Szent Istv\u00e1n, Sinkendes Linienschiff.jpg|thumb|right|{{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n||2}} low in the water, after being torpedoed by Italian [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]]]]\n\nBefore 1914, the Kingdom of Italy built six [[Battleship|dreadnought]] battleships: ({{ship|Italian battleship|Dante Alighieri||2}} as a prototype; {{ship|Italian battleship|Giulio Cesare||2}}, {{ship|Italian battleship|Conte di Cavour||2}} and {{ship|Italian battleship|Leonardo da Vinci||2}} of the {{sclass-|Conte di Cavour|battleship|4}}; and {{ship|Italian battleship|Andrea Doria||2}} and {{ship|Italian battleship|Caio Duilio||2}} of the {{sclass-|Andrea Doria|battleship|4}}), but they did not participate in major naval actions in [[World War I]], as they were positioned to intercept a major sortie of the Austro-Hungarian Navy which never came.\n\nDuring the war, the ''Regia Marina'' spent its major efforts in the [[Adriatic Sea]], fighting the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. The resulting [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I]] consisted mainly of Austro-Hungarian coastal bombardments of Italy's Adriatic coast, and wider-ranging German/Austro-Hungarian submarine warfare into the Mediterranean. Allied forces mainly limited themselves to blockading the German/Austro-Hungarian navies in the Adriatic, which was successful in regards to surface units, but failed for the submarines, which found safe harbours and easy passage into and out of the area for the whole of the war. Considered a relatively minor part of the naval warfare of World War I, it nonetheless tied down significant forces.\n\nFor most of the war the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies each kept a relatively passive watch over their adversaries. The Italian fleet lost the pre-dreadnought battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Benedetto Brin||2}} at [[Brindisi]] (27 September 1915) and the dreadnought {{ship|Italian battleship|Leonardo da Vinci||2}} at [[Taranto]] (2 August 1916) due to a magazine explosion (although there were rumours of Austrian sabotage). In the last part of the war, the Regia Marina developed new weapons: the [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], that sank the Austro-Hungarian battleship {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n}} in the [[Adriatic Sea]] on 10 June 1918; and an early type of [[human torpedo]] (''Mignatta'') entered the harbour of [[Pula]] and sank the [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[flagship]] {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} on 1 November 1918 shortly after the entire Austro-Hungarian Navy was turned over to the newly founded neutral State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The battleship {{SMS|Tegetthoff|1912|6}} (sister of the former two) was handed over to Italy as a war prize in 1919.\n\n==Interwar years==\nDuring the interwar years the Italian government set about modernizing the ''Regia Marina'' in a way that could enable it to reach dominance over the Mediterranean Sea. Italian naval construction was limited by the [[Washington Naval Conference]]. The 1922 treaty required a parity in naval forces between the Italian and French navies, with equality in total displacement in battleships and carriers. The treaty influenced the development of the Italian fleet over the years between the two world wars. Between the late twenties and early thirties a construction program began, focusing first on cruisers up to 10,000 tons, followed by the building of destroyers and submarines, and lastly the construction of the new {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|2}}s; plans were also put in place to modernize the {{sclass-|Conte di Cavour|battleship|0}} and {{sclass-|Andrea Doria|battleship|2}}s. Much of these new naval units were responses to French naval constructions, as the [[Marine nationale]] was seen until the mid 1930s as the most likely enemy in a hypothetical conflict.\n\nThe ''Regia Marina'' chose to build fast ships armed with longer ranged guns to give the Italian vessels the ability to minimize close contact with vessels of the Royal Navy, whose crews were more experienced. In theory this would allow them to engage or break off at their own choosing, and would allow them to hit the enemy when he could not yet hit back. New guns were developed with longer ranges than their British counterparts of similar caliber. Speed was emphasized in their new construction. Italian cruisers built in the 1920s, such as {{ship|Italian cruiser|Giovanni delle Bande Nere||2}} were built with a newly designed and relatively thin armour.. This would have a decisive role in a number of naval battles, including the [[Battle of Cape Spada]]. Later classes, such as the {{sclass-|Zara|cruiser|5}} and {{sclass-|Raimondo Montecuccoli|cruiser|5}} classes, were built to a more balanced design with thicker armor.\n\n[[File:Duilio 1948.jpg|thumb|right|''Caio Duilio'' after refitting.]]\nThe modernization work on the four Great War era battleships turned into a significant reconstruction project, with only 40% of the original structures being left. The ship's guns were upgraded in main armament, going from 13 guns of 305&nbsp;mm diameter, to 10 guns of 320&nbsp;mm diameter. The middle turret and the vessel's central tower were eliminated. To increase speed the coal-fired boilers were replaced with modern oil-fired boilers and ten meters were added to the ship's length to improve the [[Fineness ratio|coefficient of fineness]]. Though the ships were improved, they still were not an equal match for the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|2}}s and the {{sclass-|Renown|battlecruiser|2}}s, both of which carried larger guns and heavier armour.\n\nThough scientific research on tracking devices such as radar and sonar was being conducted in Italian universities and military laboratories by men such as Ugo Tiberio and [[Guglielmo Marconi]], the conservative Italian leadership had little interest in these new technologies, and did not use them to improve the effectiveness of the Italian vessels. This was mainly due to the influence of Admiral [[Domenico Cavagnari]], whom Mussolini appointed as Chief of Staff of the Navy in 1933, and whom he later promoted to Secretary of the Navy. Likewise technological advancement in radio range finders and gunnery control devices for night combat were not incorporated. Regarding such devices, Cavagnari emphasized \"not wanting traps in your way\". Writing to Admiral Iachino, he wrote \"..procedere con estrema cautela nell'accettare brillanti novit\u00e0 tecniche che non siano ancora collaudate da una esperienza pratica sufficientemente lunga..\", which can be translated to \"... proceed with extreme caution regarding brilliant technical innovations that have not yet been tested or with which there is no practical experience.\"  Thus, the Italian navy entered the Second World War with a marked technical inferiority to the British Navy. German General [[Albert Kesselring]], overall commander of Axis forces in the Mediterranean, observed that the Italian navy was \"a good weather\" force, unable to operate effectively at night or in heavy seas.\n\n[[File:Amerigo vespucci 1976 nyc aufgetakelt.jpg|thumb|right|{{ship|Italian training ship|Amerigo Vespucci||2}}, launched in 1931; here in the harbor of [[New York City|New York]], 1976.]]\nTwo training ships were built during this period, in addition to the effort to modernize and re-equip the combat vessels of the navy. These were square rigged school ships the ''Regia Marina'' ordered in 1925. The sailing ships followed a design by Lieutenant Colonel [[Francesco Rotundi]] of the Italian Navy Engineering Corps, reminiscent of [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] from the [[Napoleonic era]]. The first of these two ships, {{ship|Italian training ship|Cristoforo Colombo||2}}, was put into service in 1928 and was used by the Italian Navy for training until 1943. After [[World War II]], this ship was handed over to the [[Soviet Union]] as part of [[war reparation]]s and was shortly afterwards decommissioned. The second ship of the design was {{ship|Italian training ship|Amerigo Vespucci||2}}. The ship was built in 1930 at the (formerly Royal) Naval Shipyard of [[Castellammare di Stabia]] ([[Naples]]). She was launched on 22 February 1931, and was put into service in July of that year. She is still being used to this day.\n\nIn 1928, the unified command of the \"''Armata Navale''\" was abolished, and the fleet was divided in two [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]] (''Squadre navali''), one based at La Spezia and the other based at Taranto.\n\n===Italo-Ethiopian War===\n[[File:Raimondo Montecuccoli SLV Green.jpg|thumb|Cruiser ''Raimondo Montecuccoli'' during a visit to Australia in 1938]]\nThe ''Regia Marina'' played a limited role in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invasion of Ethiopia]]. While the [[Ethiopian Empire]] was landlocked, the navy was instrumental in delivering and supplying the invasion forces through [[Somalia|Somali]] and [[Eritrea]]n ports.\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\nAt the time of the Italian intervention in the [[Spanish Civil War]], the ''Regia Marina'' sent naval units in support of the Italian Corps of Volunteer Troops (''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]''). Approximately 58 Italian submarines took part in operations against Republican naval forces of Spain. These submarines were organized in a Submarine Legion and complemented German [[U-boat]] operations as part of [[Operation Ursula]]. At least two [[Spanish Second Republic|Republican]] freighters, one [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and another [[Panamanian]] were either sunk or forced to run aground by Italian destroyers near the [[Strait of Sicily]].<ref>Greene and Masignani, pp. 22\u201323</ref> Two light cruisers took part in the shelling of [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] in 1937, resulting in the deaths of more than 30 civilians.<ref>Greene and Massignani, p. 22</ref>\n\n===Albania===\nIn 1939, the ''Regia Marina'' supported the [[Italian invasion of Albania|invasion of Albania]].

Italy went to war with the fourth largest navy in the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] saw the control of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as an essential prerequisite for expanding his \"[[New Roman Empire]]\" into [[Nice]], [[Corsica]], [[Tunis]] and the [[Balkans]]. Italian naval building accelerated during his tenure. Mussolini described the Mediterranean as \"[[Mare Nostrum]]\" (Our Sea).<ref name=\"Mollo, p.94\">Mollo, p.94</ref>\n\nBefore the declaration of war, Italian ground and air forces prepared to strike at the beaten French forces across the border in the [[Italian invasion of France]]. By contrast, the ''Regia Marina'' prepared to secure the lines of communications between Italy, [[Italian Libya|Libya]] and the [[Italian East Africa|East Africa]]n colonies. The Italian High Command (''Comando Supremo'') did not approve of the plan devised by the Italian Naval Headquarters (''[[Supermarina]]'') to occupy a weakly defended [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]],<ref name=\"Piekalkiewicz, p. 82\">Piekalkiewicz, p. 82</ref> which proved a crucial mistake. The British, thinking Malta could not be defended due to the proximity of Italian air bases in Italy, Sicily, and Libya, had put little effort into bolstering the islands' defences. Thus, at the outset of the war there were only 42 anti-aircraft guns on the island and twelve [[Gloster Gladiator|Gloster Sea Gladiators]], half sitting in crates at the wharf.<ref name=\"Taylor 1974, p. 181.\">Taylor 1974, p. 181.</ref>\n\nEntering the war, the ''Regia Marina'' was operating under a number of limitations. Though significant assets were available to challenge the Royal Navy for control of the Mediterranean, there had been a lack of emphasis on the incorporation of technological advances such as radar and sonar. This meant that in night engagements or foul weather, the Italian ships were unable to detect the approach of their British adversaries. When engaged, they could only range their guns if they were able to visually locate their targets.\n\nThe ''Regia Marina'' had six battleships with which to contend for control of the Mediterranean, the four most modern of which were being re-fit at the outbreak of the war. In addition to the six capital ships, the Italians had 19 cruisers, 59 destroyers, 67 torpedo boats, and 116 submarines. Though the ''Regia Marina'' had a number of fast new cruisers with good range in their gunnery, the older classes were lightly built and had inadequate defensive armor. Numerically the Italian fleet was formidable, but there were a large number of older vessels, and the service suffered in general from insufficient time at sea for crew training.\n\nItaly's lack of raw materials meant that they would have great difficulty building new ships over the course of the war. Thus, the assets they did have were handled with caution by ''Supermarina''. Whereas Allied commanders at sea had a fair degree of autonomy and discretion to fight their vessels as circumstance allowed, Italian commanders were required to confer with their headquarters before committing their forces in an engagement that might result in their loss. This led to delays in arriving at decisions and actions being avoided, even when the Italians had a clear advantage. An example occurred during \"[[Malta Convoys#September 1940 \u2013 Operation Hats|Operation Hats]]\", in which the ''Regia Marina'' had superior forces but failed to commit them to take advantage of the opportunity.<ref>Tobagi pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nA further key disadvantage in the convoy support and interception battles that dominated the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]] was the intelligence advantage granted to the British in intercepting German ''Ultra'' and, through this, the key information on Italian convoy routes, times of departure, time of arrival, and make up of the convoy.\n\nThe warships of the ''Regia Marina'' had a general reputation as being well-designed. Italian small attack craft lived up to expectations and were responsible for many successful actions in the Mediterranean. Though Italian warships lacked [[radar]], this was partly offset in fair weather by good optical [[rangefinder]] and [[fire-control system|fire-control]] systems.<ref>Luciano Garibaldi, ''Century of War'' (2001)</ref>\n\nThe Italian Navy lacked a fleet air arm. The high command had reasoned that since the Italian navy would be operating solely in the Mediterranean, their vessels would never be far from an airfield, thus the time and resources needed to develop a naval air arm could be directed elsewhere. This proved problematic on a number of occasions. Though the Italians did have the aircraft carriers {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Aquila||2}} and {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Sparviero||2}} under construction at the start of the war, neither one was ever completed.<ref name=\"Mollo, p.94\"/> Lastly, the lack of natural oil reserves and subsequent shortage of oil precluded extensive fleet operations.<ref name=\"Piekalkiewicz, p. 82\"/>\n\n===Mediterranean===\n[[File:HMS Queen Elizabeth after the modernisation.jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} in [[Alexandria]] harbour surrounded by [[Torpedo nets|anti-torpedo nets]].

The ''Regia Marina''{{'}}s primary goal was to support the Axis forces in North Africa while obstructing the supply route to Alexandria and cutting off supplies to Malta. The Royal Navy's major effort was to maintain supply to the military forces and people of Malta, and secondarily to interdict convoy shipments to North Africa.<ref name=\"Coggins p. 179\">Coggins p. 179</ref>{{#tag:ref|The ''British Official History'' states \"All the major operations of the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean in 1942 prior to the Anglo-American landing in November were concerned with taking convoys into Malta.\"<ref name=\"Coggins p. 179\"/>|group=N}}  The first major action occurred on 11 November 1940 when the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} launched two waves of Swordfish torpedo-bombers in a [[Battle of Taranto|surprise raid]] against the Italian Fleet moored at the naval base of [[Taranto]]. The raid came in undetected, and three battleships were sunk. Another major defeat was inflicted on the ''Regia Marina'' at [[Battle of Cape Matapan|Cape Matapan]], where the Royal Navy and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] intercepted and destroyed three heavy cruisers ({{ship|Italian cruiser|Zara||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Pola||2}} and {{ship|Italian cruiser|Fiume||2}}; all of the same class) and two {{sclass-|Oriani|destroyer|2}}<nowiki/>s in a night ambush, with the loss of over 2,300 seamen. The Allies had [[Ultra]] intercepts, which uncovered the Italian movements, and [[radar]], which enabled them to locate the ships and range their weapons at distance and at night. The better air reconnaissance skills of the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and their close collaboration with surface units were other major causes of the Italian debacle.\n\nOn 19 December 1941, the battleships {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} and {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}} were sunk in shallow water by [[limpet mine]]s planted by Italian [[manned torpedo]]es, knocking both out of the conflict for almost two years. This [[Raid on Alexandria (1941)|action]], coming on the heels of the loss of the ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'' in the South China Sea, significantly weakened the surface strength of the Royal Navy, making it difficult for them to challenge control of the eastern Mediterranean.{{#tag:ref|\"Consequently, the Alexandria Fleet remained for many months without any battleships, and it was forced to abandon any further open activity. In fact, Admiral Cunningham wrote that his Fleet now ''should have to leave it to the Royal Air Force to try if they could dispute the control of the Central Mediterranean with the enemy's fleet.''(...) In fact, it opened a period of clear Italian naval supremacy in the east-central Mediterranean\".<ref>Bragadin, page 152</ref>|group=N}}\n\nOn the night of 19 December, [[Force K]], comprising three cruisers and four destroyers based at [[Malta]], ran into an Italian minefield off [[Tripoli]]. Three cruisers struck mines, with the [[cruiser]] {{HMS|Neptune|20|6}} lost, along with the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Kandahar|F28|6}}. In addition, another destroyer was seriously damaged. All told 800 seamen were lost, and Force K, which had been effectively interdicting Axis convoys, was put out of action. This series of successes allowed the ''Regia Marina'' to achieve naval supremacy in the central Mediterranean. Coupled with an intensive bombing campaign against Malta, the Axis supply routes from southern Europe to North Africa were almost untouched by the Royal Navy or its allies for the next several months.\n\n[[File:The Sinking of HMS Bedouin.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Bedouin|F67|6}} sinking after Italian naval and aerial attack during Operation Harpoon]]\nThe Italian fleet went on the offensive, blocking or mauling three large Allied convoys bound for Malta. This led to a number of naval engagements, including the [[Second Battle of Sirte]] in March 1942, [[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]] and [[Operation Vigorous]], (known as the \"Battle of Mid-June\") and [[Operation Pedestal]] (the \"Battle of Mid-August\"). All of these engagements were favourable to the Axis. Despite this activity, the only real success of the Italian Fleet was the surface attack on the Harpoon convoy, supported by Axis aerial forces. These attacks sank several Allied warships and damaged others. Only two transports of the original six in the convoy reached Malta. This was an undisputed squadron-sized victory for Italian surface forces in World War II.{{#tag:ref|\"Clearly this was an Axis victory and a tactical victory for the Italian Navy. Part of the convoy did get through to Malta, but the British suffered far heavier losses than did the Italians and Mussolini would later personally present medals to Da Zara and some of his men for their efforts. It would be the only squadron-sized surface naval victory of the war for Italy.\"<ref>Greene & Massignani p. 238</ref>|group=N}}\n\nDespite the heavy losses suffered by the merchantmen and escorting forces of convoy Pedestal, the oil and supplies brought through allowed the near starving island of Malta to continue to hold out. With Allied landings in North Africa, [[Operation Torch]], in November 1942, the fortunes of war turned against the Italians. Their sea convoys were harassed day after day by the aerial and naval supremacy of the Allies. The maritime lane between Sicily and Tunisia became known as the \"route of death\". After years of back and forth, the Axis forces were forced to surrender in Tunisia, bringing the campaign for North Africa to a close.\n\nThe ''Regia Marina'' performed well and bravely in its North African convoy duties, but remained at a technical disadvantage. The Italian ships relied on speed but could easily be damaged by shell or torpedo, due to their relatively thin armour. The fatal and final blow to the Italian Navy was a shortage of fuel, which forced its main units to remain at anchor for most of the last year of the Italian alliance with Germany.<ref>Garibaldi, ''Century of War'' (2001) p. 151</ref>\n\n===Atlantic===\nFrom 10 June 1940, submarines of the ''Regia Marina'' took part in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] alongside the U-Boats of [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. The Italian submarines were based in [[Bordeaux]], [[France]] at the [[BETASOM]] base. While more suited for the Mediterranean Sea than the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the thirty-two Italian submarines that operated in the Atlantic sank 109 Allied ships for a total of 593,864 tons.\n\nThe ''Regia Marina'' even planned an attack on [[New York City|New York]] harbor with midget submarines for December 1942, but this plan was delayed for many reasons and was never carried out.<ref>Borghese, p. 262</ref>\n\n===Red Sea===\nInitially, Italian forces enjoyed considerable success in East Africa. From 10 June 1940, the ''Regia Marina'''s [[Red Sea Flotilla]], based at [[Massawa]], [[Eritrea]], posed a potential threat to Allied shipping crossing the [[Red Sea]] between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the Mediterranean Sea. This threat increased in August 1940 with the [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]], which allowed the Italians the use of the port of [[Berbera]]; in January 1941, however, British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces launched a successful [[counterattack]] in East Africa and the threat posed by the Red Sea Flotilla disappeared.\n\nMuch of the Red Sea Flotilla was destroyed by hostile action during the first months of war or when the port of Massawa fell in April 1941. However, there were a few survivors. In February 1941, prior to the fall of Massawa, the colonial ship {{ship|Italian colonial ship|Eritrea||2}} and the [[Armed merchantmen|auxiliary cruisers]] {{ship|Italian ship|Ramb I||2}} and {{ship|Italian ship|Ramb II||2}} broke out and sailed to [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. While ''Ramb I'' was sunk by the [[New Zealand]] cruiser {{HMNZS|Leander}} off the [[Maldives]], ''Eritrea'' and ''Ramb II'' made it to Kobe. As the port of Massawa was falling, four submarines\u2014''Guglielmo'', ''Gauleo Ferraras'', {{ship|Italian submarine|Perla||2}}, and {{ship|Italian submarine|Archimede|1939|2}}\u2014sailed south from Massawa, rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and ultimately sailed to [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|German occupied]] [[Bordeaux]], [[France]]. One or two Italian merchant ships from the Red Sea Flotilla made it to [[Vichy French]]-controlled [[Madagascar]].\n\nOn 10 June 1941 the British launched Operation Chronometer, landing a battalion of troops from the British Indian army at [[Assab]], the last Italian-held harbour on the Red Sea.<ref>Rohwer & H\u00fcmmelchen (1992), p. 78</ref>  By 11 June, Assab had fallen.

As part of [[Naval Detachment K]], German, Italian, and Finnish vessels operated against Soviet gunboats, escorts and supply vessels during the [[Siege of Leningrad]] between 21 June and 21 October 1942. The Italian vessels were ultimately turned over to Finland.\n\n===Far East===\nThe ''Regia Marina'' had a naval base in the [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession territory]] of [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] in [[China]]. The primary Italian vessels based in China were the mine-layer ''Lepanto'' and the gunboat {{ship|Italian gunboat|Carlotto||2}}. During World War II, Italian supply ships, auxiliary cruisers and submarines operated throughout the waters of the Far East, often in disguise.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The Italians also utilized Japanese-controlled port facilities such as [[Shanghai]], China, and Kobe, Japan.\n\nSeven Italian submarines operating from France were converted by the Italians into \"[[Merchant submarine|transport submarines]]\" in order to exchange rare or irreplaceable trade goods with Japan. The submarines {{ship|Italian submarine|Alpino Bagnolini||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Barbarigo||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Comandante Cappellini||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Giuseppe Finzi||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Reginaldo Giuliani||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Enrico Tazzoli|1935|2}}, and {{ship|Italian submarine|Luigi Torelli||2}} were converted for service with the ''[[Monsun Gruppe]]'' (\"Monsoon Group\"). The name of ''Comandante Cappellini'' was changed to {{ship|Italian submarine|Aquila III||2}}.\n\nTwelve additional [[Italian R-class submarine|R-class]] [[blockade runner|blockade running]] transport submarines were specifically designed for trade with the Far East, but only two of these vessels were completed before Italy quit the war. Both of these submarines were destroyed by Allied action almost as soon as they were launched.\n\n===Armistice of 1943===\nIn 1943, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was deposed and the new Italian government agreed to an [[Armistice with Italy|armistice with the Allies]]. Under the terms of this armistice, the ''Regia Marina'' had to sail its ships to an Allied port. Most sailed to Malta, but a flotilla from [[La Spezia]] headed towards [[Sardinia]]. This was intercepted and attacked by German aircraft and the battleship {{ship|Italian battleship|Roma|1940|2}} was sunk by two hits from [[Fritz X]] guided glide-bombs. Among the 1600 sailors killed on board ''Roma'' was the Italian Naval Commander-in-Chief, Admiral [[Carlo Bergamini (admiral)|Carlo Bergamini]].<ref>[http://www.regiamarina.net/detail_text_with_list.asp?nid=123&lid=1 Carlo Bergamini, Biography by Pier Paolo Bergamini]</ref>\n\nAs vessels became available to the new Italian government, the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Navy]] was formed to fight on the side of the Allies. Other ships were captured in port by the Germans or scuttled by their crews. Few ''Regia Marina'' crews chose to fight for Mussolini's new fascist regime in northern Italy, the [[Italian Social Republic]] (''Repubblica Sociale Italiana'', RSI). Mussolini's pro-German National Republican Navy (''Marina Nazionale Repubblicana'') hardly reached a twentieth the size attained by the co-belligerent Italian fleet.<ref>Mollo, p. 100</ref>  In the Far East, the Japanese occupied the Italian concession territory of Tiensin.\n\nThere was little use for the surrendered Italian battleships and there was doubt about the loyalties of the crews, so these ships were interned in Egypt. In June 1944, the less powerful battleships (''Andrea Doria'', ''Caio Duilio'' and ''Giulio Cesare'') were allowed to return to [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]] harbour in [[Sicily]] for training. The others, {{ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Veneto||2}} and ''Italia'' (ex-{{ship|Italian battleship|Littorio||2}}), remained at [[Isma\u00eflia]] in the [[Suez Canal]] until 1947. After the war, ''Giulio Cesare'' was passed to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the Co-belligerency period, until [[Victory in Europe Day|\"VE\" (Victory in Europe) Day]], Italian light cruisers participated in the naval war in the Atlantic Ocean with patrols against German raiders. Smaller naval units (mainly submarines and torpedo boats) served in the Mediterranean Sea. In the last days of war, the issue of whether Italian battleships and cruisers should participate in the [[Pacific War]] was debated by the Allied leaders.\n\nThere were also Italian naval units in the Far East in 1943 when the new Italian government agreed to an armistice with the Allies. The reactions of their crews varied greatly. In general, surface units, mainly supply ships and auxiliary cruisers, either surrendered at Allied ports (''Eritrea'' at [[Colombo]], [[Ceylon]]) or, if in Japanese controlled ports, they were scuttled by their own crew (''Conte Verde'', ''Lepanto'', and ''Carlotto'' at [[Shanghai]]). ''Ramb II'' was taken over by the Japanese in Kobe and renamed ''Calitea II''. Four Italian submarines were in the Far East at the time of the armistice, transporting rare goods to Japan and Singapore: {{ship|Italian submarine|Ammiraglio Cagni||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Comandante Cappellini||2}} ({{ship|Italian submarine|Aquilla III||2}}), {{ship|Italian submarine|Reginaldo Giuliani||2}}, and {{ship|Italian submarine|Luigi Torelli||2}}. The crew of ''Ammiraglio Cagni'' heard of the armistice and surrendered to the Royal Navy off [[Durban]], [[South Africa]]. ''Comandante Cappellini'', ''Reginaldo Giuliani'', and ''Luigi Torelli'' and their crews were temporarily interned by the Japanese. The boats passed to German U-boat command and, with mixed German and Italian crews, they continued to fight against the Allies. The German navy assigned new officers to the three submarines. The three were renamed {{GS|UIT-23||2}}, {{GS|UIT-24||2}} and {{GS|UIT-25||2}} and took part in German war operations in the Pacific. ''Reginaldo Giuliani'' was sunk by the British submarine {{HMS|Tally-Ho|P317|6}} in February 1944. In May 1945, the other two vessels were taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Navy]] when Germany surrendered. About twenty Italian sailors continued to fight with the Japanese. ''Luigi Torelli'' remained active until 30 August 1945, when, in Japanese waters, this last Fascist Italian submarine shot down a [[North American B-25 Mitchell]] bomber of the [[United States Army Air Forces]].<ref>Willmott, H p (2009). ''The Last Century of Sea Power: From Port Arthur to Chanak, 1894\u20131922''.\nIndiana University Press, p. 276. {{ISBN|0253352142}}</ref>\n\n== After World War II ==\n{{main|Marina Militare}}\nAfter the end of hostilities, the ''Regia Marina'' started a long and complex rebuilding process. At the beginning of the war, the ''Regia Marina'' was the fourth largest navy in the world with a mix of modernised and new battleships. The important combat contributions of the Italian naval forces after the signing of the armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943 and the subsequent cooperation agreement on 23 September 1943 left the ''Regia Marina'' in a poor condition. Much of its infrastructure and bases were unusable and its ports mined and blocked by sunken ships. However, a large number of its naval units had survived the war, albeit in a low efficiency state. This was due to the conflict and the age of many vessels.\n\nThe vessels that remained were:\n* 2 incomplete and damaged aircraft carriers\n* 5 battleships\n* 9 cruisers\n* 11 destroyers\n* 22 frigates\n* 19 corvettes\n* 44 fast coastal patrol units\n* 50 minesweepers\n* 16 amphibious operations vessels\n* 2 school ships\n* 1 support ship and plane transport\n* various submarine units\n\nOn 2 June 1946, the Italian monarchy was abolished by a popular referendum. The Kingdom of Italy (''Regno d'Italia'') ended and was replaced by the [[Italian Republic]] (''Repubblica Italiana''). The ''Regia Marina'' became the Navy of the Italian Republic (''Marina Militare'').\n\n== Peace treaty ==\nOn 10 February 1947, a [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|peace treaty]] was signed in [[Paris]] between the Italian Republic and the victorious powers of World War II. The treaty was onerous for the Italian Navy. Apart from territorial and material losses, the following restrictions were imposed:\n\n* A ban on owning, building or experimenting with atomic weapons, self-propulsion projectiles or related launchers\n* A ban on owning battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines and amphibious assault units.\n* A ban on operating military installations on the islands of [[Pantelleria]] and [[Pianosa]]; and the [[Pelagie Islands]].\n* The total displacement, battleships excluded, of the future navy was not allowed to be greater than 67,500 tons, while the staff was capped at 25,000 men.\n\nThe treaty also ordered Italy to put the following ships at the disposals of the victorious nations [[United States]], Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, [[Greece]], [[Yugoslavia]], and Albania as war compensation:\n\n* 3 battleships: {{ship|Italian battleship|Giulio Cesare||2}}, {{ship|Italian battleship|Italia|1943|2}}, {{ship|Italian battleship|Vittorio Veneto||2}};\n* 5 cruisers: {{ship|Italian cruiser|Emanuele Filiberto Duca d'Aosta||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Attilio Regolo||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Scipione Africano||2}}, {{ship|Italian cruiser|Eugenio di Savoia||2}} and  {{ship|Italian sloop|Eritrea||2}};\n* 7 destroyers; 5 of the {{sclass2-|Soldati|destroyer|4}}, {{ship|Italian destroyer|Augusto Riboty||2}} and {{ship|Italian destroyer|Alfredo Oriani||2}};\n* 6 minesweepers;\n* 8 submarines, including three of the {{sclass-|Acciaio|submarine|4}};\n* 1 sailing school ship: {{ship|Italian training ship|Cristoforo Colombo||2}}.\n\nThe convoy escort {{ship|Italian ship|Ramb III||2}} ultimately became the Yugoslav Navy yacht {{ship||Galeb|ship|2}}. ''Galeb'' was used by the late [[List of heads of state of Yugoslavia|President]] of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] [[Marshal of Yugoslavia|Marshal]] [[Josip Broz Tito]] on his
