Rowman & Littlefield, 2005]</ref> The difference in the usage of the two type depends on the mindset of the negotiator but also on the situation: one-off encounters where lasting relationships do not obtain are more likely to produce distributive negotiations whereas lasting relationships are more likely to require integrative negotiating<ref>{{cite book | title=Bargaining for Advantage | last=Shell | first=G Richard | publisher=Penguin | date=1999 | location=United States | isbn=9780670881338 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/bargainingforadv1999shel }}</ref>  Different theorists use different labels for the two general types and distinguish them in different ways.\n\n=== Distributive negotiation ===\n{{See also|Zero-sum game}}\n\nDistributive negotiation is also sometimes called positional or hard-bargaining negotiation and attempts to distribute a \"fixed pie\" of benefits. Distributive negotiation operates under zero-sum conditions and implies that any gain one party makes is at the expense of the other and vice versa. For this reason, distributive negotiation is also sometimes called ''win-lose'' because of the assumption that one person's gain is another person's loss. Distributive negotiation examples include haggling prices on an open market, including the negotiation of the price of a car or a home.\n\nIn a distributive negotiation, each side often adopts an extreme or fixed position, knowing it will not be accepted\u2014and then seeks to cede as little as possible before reaching a deal. Distributive bargainers conceive of negotiation as a process of distributing a fixed amount of value. A distributive negotiation often involves people who have never had a previous interactive relationship, nor are they likely to do so again in the near future, although all negotiations usually have a distributive element.\n\nIn the distributive approach each negotiator fights for the largest possible piece of the pie, so parties tend to regard each other more as an adversary than a partner and to take a harder line.<ref name=\":0\">Saner, Raymond. ''The Expert Negotiator'', The Netherlands: Kluwer Law International, 2000 (p. 40)</ref> Since [[Prospect theory|Prospect Theory]] indicates that people value losses more than gains and are more risk-averse about losses, concession-convergence bargaining is likely to be more acrimonious and less productive of an agreement<ref>{{cite book|last=McDermott | first=Rose | title=Prospect Theory and Negotiation | editor-last=Avenhaus | editor-first=Rudolf[ | editor2-last=Sj\u00f6sted | editor2-first=Gunnar | chapter=Negotiated Risks | publisher=Springer | location=Germany | date=2009 | isbn=978-3-540-92992-5 | pages=372 }}</ref>\n\n=== {{vanchor|Integrative negotiation}} ===\n{{See also|Non-zero-sum game|Win-win game}}\n\nIntegrative negotiation is also called interest-based, merit-based, or principled negotiation. It is a set of techniques that attempts to improve the quality and likelihood of negotiated agreement by taking advantage of the fact that different parties often value various outcomes differently.<ref>John Nash, \"The Bargaining problem,\" Econometrica XVIII 1:155-162, 1950; G C Homans, Social Behavior. Harcourt, Brace and world, 1961</ref> While distributive negotiation assumes there is a fixed amount of value (a \"fixed pie\") to be divided between the parties, integrative negotiation attempts to create value in the course of the negotiation (\"expand the pie\") by either \"compensating\" loss of one item with gains from another (\"trade-offs\" or [[logrolling]]), or by constructing or reframing the issues of the conflict in such a way that both parties benefit (\"win-win\" negotiation).<ref>{{cite book| title=Creative Experience | last=Follett | first=Mary | publisher=P Smith | location=United States | date=1951 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, even integrative negotiation is likely to have some distributive elements, especially when the different parties both value different items to the same degree or when details are left to be allocated at the end of the negotiation. While concession is mandatory for negotiations, research shows that people who concede more quickly, are less likely to explore all integrative and mutually beneficial solutions.  Therefore, early conceding reduces the chance of an integrative negotiation.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Hufmeier|last3=Loschelder|last4=Schwartz|last5=Collwitzer|date=2011|title=Perspective taking as a means to overcome motivational barriers in negotiations: When putting oneself in the opponents shoes helps to walk towards agreements|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=101|issue=4|pages=771\u2013790|doi=10.1037/a0023801|pmid=21728447|last1=Trotschel|url=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/771.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.728.9853}}</ref>\n\nIntegrative negotiation often involves a higher degree of trust and the formation of a relationship. It can also involve creative problem-solving that aims to achieve mutual gains. It sees a good agreement as not one with maximum individual gain, but one that provides optimum gain for all parties. Gains in this scenario are not at the expense of the Other, but with it.  Each seeks to accord the Other enough benefit that it will hold to the agreement that gives the first party an agreeable outcome, and vice versa.\n\nProductive negotiation focuses on the underlying interests of the parties rather than their starting positions, approaches negotiation as a shared problem-solving rather than a personalized battle, and insists upon adherence to objective, principled criteria as the basis for agreement.<ref name=\"AgainstGridlock-p1\">Gregory Brazeal, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1730725 \"Against Gridlock: The Viability of Interest-Based Legislative Negotiation\"], ''Harvard Law & Policy Review'' (Online), vol. 3, p. 1 (2009).</ref>\n\n=== Stages in the negotiation process ===\n\nHowever, negotiators need not sacrifice effective negotiation in favor of a positive relationship between parties. Rather than conceding, each side can appreciate that the other has emotions and motivations of their own and use this to their advantage in discussing the issue. In fact, perspective-taking can help move parties toward a more integrative solution. Fisher et al. illustrate a few techniques that effectively improve perspective-taking in their book ''Getting to Yes'', and through the following, negotiators can separate people from the problem itself.\n\n* '''Put yourself in their shoes''' \u2013 People tend to search for information that confirms his or her own beliefs and often ignore information that contradicts prior beliefs. In order to negotiate effectively, it is important to empathize with the other party's point of view. One should be open to other views and attempt to approach an issue from the perspective of the other.\n* '''Discuss each other's perceptions''' \u2013 A more direct approach to understanding the other party is to explicitly discuss each other's perceptions. Each individual should openly and honestly share his or her perceptions without assigning blame or judgement to the other.\n* '''Find opportunities to act inconsistently with his or her views''' \u2013 It is possible that the other party has prior perceptions and expectations about the other side. The other side can act in a way that directly contradicts those preconceptions, which can effectively send a message that the party is interested in an integrative negotiation.\n* '''Face-saving''' \u2013 This approach refers to justifying a stance based on one's previously expressed principles and values in a negotiation. This approach to an issue is less arbitrary, and thus, it is more understandable from the opposing party's perspective.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally, negotiators can use certain communication techniques to build a stronger relationship and develop more meaningful negotiation solution.\n\n* '''Active listening''' \u2013 Listening is more than just hearing what the other side is saying. Active listening involves paying close attention to what is being said verbally and nonverbally. It involves periodically seeking further clarification from the person. By asking the person exactly what they mean, they may realize you are not simply walking through a routine, but rather take them seriously.\n* '''Speak for a purpose''' \u2013 Too much information can be as harmful as too little. Before stating an important point, determine exactly what you wish you communicate to the other party. Determine the exact purpose that this shared information will serve.<ref name=\":1\">Fisher, Roger, Ury, Wiliam, & Paten, Bruce (1991). Getting to yes: Negotiating agreement without giving in. Penguin: New York. Chapter 2</ref>\n\n=== Integrated negotiation ===\n''Integrated negotiation'' is a strategic approach to influence that maximizes value in any single negotiation through the astute linking and sequencing of other negotiations and decisions related to one's operating activities.\n\nThis approach in complex settings is best executed by mapping out all potentially relevant negotiations, conflicts and operating decisions in order to integrate helpful connections among them, while minimizing any potentially harmful connections (see examples below).\n\n''Integrated negotiation'' is not to be confused with ''integrative negotiation'', a different concept (as outlined above) related to a non-zero-sum approach to creating value in negotiations.\n\nIntegrated negotiation was first identified and labeled by international negotiator and author Peter Johnston in his book ''Negotiating with Giants''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://negotiatingwithgiants.com|title=Negotiating with Giants|last=Johnston|first=Peter D|publisher=Negotiation Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0980942101|location=United States|pages=Pages 4 to 5}}</ref>\n\nOne of the examples cited in Johnston's book is that of J. D. Rockefeller deciding where to build his first major oil refinery. Instead of taking the easier, cheaper route from the oil fields to refine his petroleum in Pittsburgh, Rockefeller chose to build his refinery in Cleveland. Why? Because rail companies would be transporting his refined oil to market. Pittsburgh had just one major railroad, meaning it could dictate prices in negotiations, while Cleveland had three railroads that Rockefeller knew would compete for his business, potentially reducing his costs significantly. The leverage gained in these rail negotiations more than offset the additional operating costs of sending his oil to Cleveland for refining, helping establish Rockefeller's empire, while undermining his competitors who failed to integrate their core operating decisions with their negotiation strategies.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/titan00ronc_0|title=Titan, The Life of John D.

Bad faith is a concept in negotiation theory whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.<ref>\"negotiating in bad faith\", example of use of [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bad%252Bfaith \"bad faith\"] definition in Oxford Online Dictionary</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=IBHS Union Voice |url=http://unitas.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/bad-faith-negotiation/ |title=\"Bad Faith Negotiation\", Union Voice |publisher=Unitas.wordpress.com |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>\n\nBad faith negotiations are often used in [[political science]] and [[political psychology]] to refer to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of [[information processing]].<ref>example of use - ''\"the Republicans accused the Democrats of [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bad%252Bfaith \"negotiating in bad faith\"], Oxford Online Dictionary</ref>  The \"[[inherent bad faith model]]\" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.<ref>Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3791139 \"The 'Inherent Bad Faith Model' Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger\"], ''Political Psychology''{{paywall}}</ref> It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.<ref name=\"Gilbert & Fiske inherent\">\"...&nbsp;the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one's opponent&nbsp;...\"'', ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T.

Examples are [[John Foster Dulles]]' position regarding the Soviet Union, or [[Hamas]]'s position on the state of [[Israel]].<ref name=\"Gilbert & Fiske inherent\" />{{POV statement|date=June 2011}}\n\n== Negotiation Pie ==\nThe total of advantages and disadvantages to be distributed in a negotiation is illustrated with the term negotiation pie.<ref>''Jung/Krebs'', The Essentials of Contract Negotiation, p. 125 (keyword: Negotiation Pie).</ref> The course of the negotiation can either lead to an increase, shrinking, or stagnation of these values. If the negotiation parties are able to expand the total pie a win-win situation is possible assuming that both parties profit from the expansion of the pie. In practice, however, this maximisation approach is oftentimes impeded by the so-called small pie bias, i.e. the psychological underestimation of the negotiation pie's size. Likewise, the possibility to increase the pie may be underestimated due to the so-called incompatibility bias.<ref name=\"Krebs p. 126\">''Jung/Krebs'', The Essentials of Contract Negotiation, p. 126 (keyword: Negotiation Pie).</ref> Contrary to enlarging the pie, the pie may also shrink during negotiations e.g. due to (excessive) negotiation costs.<ref name=\"Krebs p. 126\"/>\n\n== Strategies ==\n\nThere are many different ways to categorize the essential elements of negotiation.\n\nOne view of negotiation involves three basic elements: ''process'', ''behavior'' and ''substance''.  The process refers to how the parties negotiate: the context of the negotiations, the parties to the negotiations,  the tactics used by the parties, and the sequence and stages in which all of these play out. Behavior refers to the relationships among these parties, the communication between them and the styles they adopt. The substance refers to what the parties negotiate over: the agenda, the issues (positions and \u2013 more helpfully \u2013 interests), the options, and the agreement(s) reached at the end.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAnother view of negotiation comprises four elements: ''strategy'', ''process'', ''tools'', and ''tactics''. Strategy comprises the top level goals \u2013 typically including relationship and the final outcome. Processes and tools include the steps to follow and roles to take in preparing for and negotiating with the other parties. Tactics include more detailed statements and actions and responses to others' statements and actions. Some add to this ''persuasion and influence'', asserting that these have become integral to modern day negotiation success, and so should not be omitted.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n=== Employing an advocate ===\n\nA skilled negotiator may serve as an advocate for one party to the negotiation. The advocate attempts to obtain the most favorable outcomes possible for that party. In this process the negotiator attempts to determine the minimum outcome(s) the other party is (or parties are) willing to accept, then adjusts their demands accordingly. A \"successful\" negotiation in the advocacy approach is when the negotiator is able to obtain all or most of the outcomes their party desires, but without driving the other party to permanently break off negotiations.\n\nSkilled negotiators may use a variety of tactics ranging from negotiation hypnosis,{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} to a straightforward presentation of demands or setting of preconditions, to more deceptive approaches such as [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]. Intimidation and [[salami tactics]] may also play a part in swaying the outcome of negotiations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAnother negotiation tactic is bad guy/good guy. Bad guy/good guy is when one negotiator acts as a bad guy by using anger and threats. The other negotiator acts as a good guy by being considerate and understanding. The good guy blames the bad guy for all the difficulties while trying to get concessions and agreement from the opponent.<ref name=\"Churchman 1993\">Churchman, David. 1993. ''Negotiation Tactics''. Maryland: University Press of America. p. 13.</ref>\n\n=== BATNA ===\n\nThe best alternative to a negotiated agreement, or [[BATNA]], is the most advantageous alternative course of action a negotiator can take should the current negotiation end without reaching agreement. The quality of a BATNA has the potential to improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward.<ref>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83 (5) (2002), pp. 1131\u20131140</ref> Alternatives need to be actual and actionable to be of value.<ref>[https://www.negotiations.com/articles/best-alternative/ Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Negotiators may also consider the other party's BATNA and how it compares to what they are offering during the negotiation.<ref>Negotiation, Readings, Exercises and Cases, Roy J.

Thomas identified five styles or responses to negotiation.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Conflict and conflict management: Reflections and update  |date=2006-11-21 |doi=10.1002/job.4030130307 |volume=13 |issue=3  |journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior |pages=265\u2013274|last1=Thomas  |first1=Kenneth W  |hdl = 10945/40295|url=https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/10945/40295/6/thomas_conflict_1992.pdf}}</ref><ref>Shell, R.

The following five styles can be used based on individuals' preferences depending on their pro-self or pro-social goals. These styles can change over time, and individuals can have strong dispositions towards numerous styles.\n\n{{glossary}}\n{{term|1=Accommodating}}\n{{defn|1=Individuals who enjoy solving the other party's problems and preserving personal relationships.\n         Accommodators are sensitive to the emotional states, body language, and verbal signals of the other parties.\n         They can, however, feel taken advantage of in situations when the other party places little emphasis on the relationship. Accommodation is a passive but prosocial approach to conflict. People solve both large and small conflicts by giving in to the demands of others. Sometimes, they yield because they realize that their position is in error, so they agree with the viewpoint adopted by others. In other cases, however, they may withdraw their demands without really being convinced that the other side is correct, but for the sake of group unity or in the interest of time--they withdraw all complaints. Thus, yielding can reflect either genuine conversion or superficial compliance.}}\n{{term|1=Avoiding}}\n{{defn|1=Individuals who do not like to negotiate and don't do it unless warranted.\n         When negotiating, avoiders tend to defer and dodge the confrontational aspects of negotiating; however, they may be perceived as tactful and diplomatic. Inaction is a passive means of dealing with disputes. Those who avoid conflicts adopt a \"wait and see\" attitude, hoping that problems will solve themselves. Avoiders often tolerate conflicts, allowing them to simmer without doing anything to minimize them. Rather than openly discussing disagreements, people who rely on avoidance change the subject, skip meetings, or even leave the group altogether (Bayazit & Mannix, 2003). Sometimes they simply agree to disagree (a modus vivendi).}}\n{{term|1=[[Collaboration|Collaborating]]}}\n{{defn|1=Individuals who enjoy negotiations that involve solving tough problems in creative ways.\n         Collaborators are good at using negotiations to understand the concerns and interests of the other parties.\n         Collaborating is an active, pro-social, and pro-self approach to conflict resolution. Collaborating people identify the issues underlying the dispute and then work together to identify a solution that is satisfying to both sides. This orientation, which is also described as collaboration, problem solving, or a win-win orientation, entreats both sides in the dispute to consider their opponent's outcomes as well as their own<ref>{{Cite book|title=Group dynamics|last=Forsyth|first=David|publisher=Wadsworth Pub Co.|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=379\u2013409|quote=|via=}}</ref>}}\n{{term|1=[[Competition|Competing]]}}\n{{defn|1=Individuals who enjoy negotiations because they present an opportunity to win something.\n         Competitive negotiators have strong instincts for all aspects of negotiating and are often strategic.\n         Because their style can dominate the bargaining process, competitive negotiators often neglect the importance of relationships. Competing is an active, pro-self means of dealing with conflict that involves forcing others to accept one's view. Those who use this strategy tend to see conflict as a win-lose situation and so use competitive, powerful tactics to intimidate others. Fighting (forcing, dominating, or contending) can take many forms, including authoritative mandate, challenges, arguing, insults, accusations, complaining, vengeance, and even physical violence (Morrill, 1995). These conflict resolution methods are all contentious ones because they involve imposing one's solution on the other party.}}\n{{term|1=Compromising}}\n{{defn|1=Individuals who are eager to close the deal by doing what is fair and equal for all parties involved in the negotiation.\n         Compromisers can be useful when there is limited time to complete the deal; however, compromisers often unnecessarily rush the negotiation process and make concessions too quickly.}}\n{{glossary end}}\n\n=== Types of negotiators ===\n\nThree basic kinds of negotiators have been identified by researchers involved in The Harvard Negotiation Project. These types of negotiators are: soft bargainers, hard bargainers, and principled bargainers.\n\n; Soft: These people see negotiation as too close to competition, so they choose a gentle style of bargaining. The offers they make are not in their best interests, they yield to others' demands, avoid confrontation, and they maintain good relations with fellow negotiators. Their perception of others is one of friendship, and their goal is agreement.  They do not separate the people from the problem, but are soft on both. They avoid contests of wills and insist on agreement, offering solutions and easily trusting others and changing their opinions.\n; Hard: These people use contentious strategies to influence, utilizing phrases such as \"this is my final offer\" and \"take it or leave it.\" They make threats, are distrustful of others, insist on their position, and apply pressure to negotiate. They see others as adversaries and their ultimate goal is victory. Additionally, they search for one single answer, and insist you agree on it. They do not separate the people from the problem (as with soft bargainers), but they are hard on both the people involved and the problem.\n; Principled: Individuals who bargain this way seek integrative solutions, and do so by sidestepping commitment to specific positions. They focus on the problem rather than the intentions, motives, and needs of the people involved. They separate the people from the problem, explore interests, avoid bottom lines, and reach results based on standards independent of personal will. They base their choices on objective criteria rather than power, pressure, self-interest, or an arbitrary decisional procedure. These criteria may be drawn from moral standards, principles of fairness, professional standards, and tradition.\n\nResearchers from The Harvard Negotiation Project recommend that negotiators explore a number of alternatives to the problems they face in order to reach the best solution, but this is often not the case (as when you may be dealing with an individual using soft or hard bargaining tactics) (Forsyth, 2010).\n\n=== {{vanchor|Tactics|Negotiation tactics}} ===\n\nTactics are always an important part of the negotiating process. More often than not they are subtle, difficult to identify and used for multiple purposes. Tactics are more frequently used in distributive negotiations and when the focus in on taking as much value off the table as possible.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Steve|title=The Negotiation Book|year=2011|publisher=A John Wiley and Sons, LTD., Publication|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-470-66491-9|page=232}}</ref>  Many negotiation tactics exist. Below are a few commonly used tactics.\n\n'''[[Auction]]:'''\nThe bidding process is designed to create competition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Steve|title=The Negotiation Book|year=2011|publisher=A John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Publication|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-470-66491-9|page=240}}</ref>  When multiple parties want the same thing, pit them against one another. When people know that they may lose out on something, they want it even more. Not only do they want the thing that is being bid on, they also want to win, just to win. Taking advantage of someone's competitive nature can drive up the price.\n\n'''[[Brinksmanship]]:'''\nOne party aggressively pursues a set of terms to the point where the other negotiating party must either agree or walk away. Brinkmanship is a type of \"hard nut\" approach to bargaining in which one party pushes the other party to the \"brink\" or edge of what that party is willing to accommodate.  Successful brinksmanship convinces the other party they have no choice but to accept the offer and there is no acceptable alternative to the proposed agreement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Alvin|title=Settling For More: Mastering Negotiating Strategies and Techniques|year=1991|publisher=The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-87179-651-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/settlingformorem0000gold/page/83 83]|url=https://archive.org/details/settlingformorem0000gold/page/83}}</ref>\n\n'''Bogey:'''\nNegotiators use the bogey tactic to pretend that an issue of little or no importance is very important.<ref name=\"Essentials82\">{{cite book|last=Lewicki|first=R.

Minton}}</ref>  Then, later in the negotiation, the issue can be traded for a major concession of actual importance.\n\n'''Calling a higher authority:''' To mitigate too far reaching concessions, deescalate, or overcome a deadlock situation, one party makes the further negotiation process dependent on the decision of a decision maker, not present at the negotiation table.<ref>''Jung/Krebs'', p. 73.</ref>\n\n'''[[Chicken game|Chicken]]:'''\nNegotiators propose extreme measures, often bluffs, to force the other party to chicken out and give them what they want. This tactic can be dangerous when parties are unwilling to back down and go through with the extreme measure.\n\n'''Defence in Depth:'''\nSeveral layers of decision-making authority is used to allow further concessions each time the agreement goes through a different level of authority.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Steve|title=The Negotiation Book|year=2011|publisher=A John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Publication|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-470-66491-9|page=246}}</ref> In other words, each time the offer goes to a decision maker, that decision maker asks to add another concession to close the deal.\n\n'''[[Time limit|Deadlines]]:'''\nGive the other party a deadline forcing them to make a decision. This method uses time to apply pressure to the other party. Deadlines given can be actual or artificial.\n\n'''Flinch:'''\nFlinching is showing a strong negative physical reaction to a proposal.  Common examples of flinching are gasping for air, or a visible expression of surprise or shock.  The flinch can be done consciously or unconsciously.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coburn|first=Calum|title=Neutralising Manipulative Negotiation Tactics|url=http://www.calumcoburn.co.uk/articles/negotiation-tactics/|publisher=Negotiation Training Solutions|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>  The flinch signals to the opposite party that you think the offer or proposal is absurd in hopes the other party will lower their aspirations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Steve|title=The Negotiation Book|year=2011|publisher=A John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Publication|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-470-66491-9|page=245}}</ref>  Seeing a physical reaction is more believable than hearing someone saying, \"I'm shocked.\"\n\n'''Good Guy/Bad Guy:'''\nWithin the tactic of good guy/bad guy (synonyms are good cop/bad cop or black hat/white hat) oftentimes positive and unpleasant tasks are divided between two negotiators on the same negotiation side or unpleasant tasks or decisions are allocated to an (real or fictitious) outsider. The good guy supports the conclusion of the contract and emphasises positive aspects of the negotiation (mutual interests). The bad guy criticises negative aspects (opposing interests). The division of the two roles allows more consistent behaviour and credibility of the individual negotiators. As the good guy promotes the contract, he/she can build trust with the other side.<ref>''Jung/Krebs'', p. 102.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Highball}}'''Highball/Lowball''' or '''Ambit claim'''\nDepending on whether selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer that is not achievable. The theory is that the extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the resistance point (as far as you are willing to go to reach an agreement).<ref name=\"Essentials81\">{{cite book|title=Essentials of Negotiation|last=Lewicki|first=R.

Minton|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=2001|isbn=978-0-07-231285-0|location=New York|page=81}}</ref> Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.\n\n'''The Nibble:'''\nAlso known under salami tactic or quivering quill, nibbling is the demand of proportionally small concessions that haven't been discussed previously just before closing the deal.<ref name=\"Essentials82\"/> This method takes advantage of the other party's desire to close by adding \"just one more thing.\"\n\n'''Snow Job:'''\nNegotiators overwhelm the other party with so much information that they have difficulty determining what information is important, and what is a diversion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewicki|first=R.

Minton}}</ref> Negotiators may also use technical language or jargon to mask a simple answer to a question asked by a non-expert.\n\n'''Mirroring:'''\nWhen people get on well, the outcome of a negotiation is likely to be more positive. To create trust and a rapport, a negotiator may mimic or mirror the opponent's behavior and repeat what they say. Mirroring refers to a person repeating the core content of what another person just said, or repeating a certain expression. It indicates attention to the subject of negotiation and acknowledges the other party's point or statement.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vecchi | first1 = G. M. | last2 = Van Hasselt | first2 = V.

Effective negotiation requires that participants effectively convey and interpret information. Participants in a negotiation communicate information not only verbally but non-verbally through body language and gestures. By understanding how nonverbal communication works, a negotiator is better equipped to interpret the information other participants are leaking non-verbally while keeping secret those things that would inhibit his/her ability to negotiate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hui|first=Zhou|author2=Tingqin Zhang|title=Body Language in Business Negotiation|journal=International Journal of Business and Management|volume=3|issue=2}}</ref>\n\n==== Examples ====\n\n'''Non-verbal \"anchoring\"'''\nIn a negotiation, a person can gain the advantage by verbally expressing a position first. By [[anchoring]] one's position, one establishes the position from which the negotiation proceeds. In a like manner, one can \"anchor\" and gain advantage with nonverbal (body language) cues.\n\n* [[Personal space]]: The person at the head of the table is the apparent symbol of power. Negotiators can negate this strategic advantage by positioning allies in the room to surround that individual.\n* [[First impression (psychology)|First impression]]: Begin the negotiation with positive gestures and enthusiasm. Look the person in the eye with sincerity. If you cannot maintain eye contact, the other person might think you are hiding something or that you are insincere. Give a solid handshake.<ref>{{cite book|title=Body Language Magic|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vsNU1fjgCi8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n'''Reading non-verbal communication'''\nBeing able to read the non-verbal communication of another person can significantly aid in the communication process. By being aware of inconsistencies between a person's verbal and non-verbal communication and reconciling them, negotiators can to come to better resolutions. Examples of incongruity in body language include:\n\n* Nervous Laugh: A laugh not matching the situation. This could be a sign of nervousness or discomfort. When this happens, it may be good to probe with questions to discover the person's true feelings.\n* Positive words but negative body language: If someone asks their negotiation partner if they are annoyed and the person pounds their fist and responds sharply, \"what makes you think anything is bothering me?\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Michael C.|publisher=Wiley Publishing, Inc.|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|isbn=978-1-118-06808-3|title=Negotiating For Dummies|date=2011-04-18}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n* Hands raised in a clenched position: The person raising his/her hands in this position reveals frustration even when he/she is smiling. This is a signal that the person doing it may be holding back a negative attitude.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pease|first=Barbara and Alan|title=The Definitive Book of Body Language|year=2006|publisher=Bantam Dell|location=New York|isbn=978-0-553-80472-0|url=https://archive.org/details/definitivebookof00barb}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n* If possible, it may be helpful for negotiation partners to spend time together in a comfortable setting outside of the negotiation room.  Knowing how each partner non-verbally communicates outside of the negotiation setting helps negotiation partners sense incongruity between verbal and non-verbal communication.\n\n'''Conveying receptivity'''\nThe way negotiation partners position their bodies relative to each other may influence how receptive each is to the other person's message and ideas.\n\n* Face and eyes: Receptive negotiators smile, make plenty of eye contact. This conveys the idea that there is more interest in the person than in what is being said. On the other hand, non-receptive negotiators make little to no eye contact. Their eyes may be squinted, jaw muscles clenched and head turned slightly away from the speaker\n* Arms and hands: To show receptivity, negotiators should spread arms and open hands on table or relaxed on their lap. Negotiators show poor receptivity when their hands are clenched, crossed, positioned in front of their mouth, or rubbing the back of their neck.\n* Legs and Feet: Receptive negotiators sit with legs together or one leg slightly in front of the other. When standing, they distribute weight evenly and place hands on their hips with their body tilted toward the speaker. Non-receptive negotiators stand with legs crossed, pointing away from the speaker.\n* Torso: Receptive negotiators sit on the edge of their chair, unbutton their suit coat with their body tilted toward the speaker. Non-receptive negotiators may lean back in their chair and keep their suit coat buttoned.\n\nReceptive negotiators tend to appear relaxed with their hands open and palms visibly displayed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Michael C.|title=Negotiating for dummies|year=1996|publisher=Hungry Minds|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56884-867-9|author2=Donaldson, Mimi|url=https://archive.org/details/negotiatingfordu00dona}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Barriers ===\n\n* Die-hard bargainers\n* Lack of trust\n* Informational vacuums and negotiator's dilemma\n* Structural impediments\n* Spoilers\n* Cultural and gender differences\n* Communication problems\n* The power of dialogue<ref>{{cite book |author=Richard Luecke |series=Harvard Business Essentials |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |title=Negotiation |location=Boston |isbn=9781591391111|year=2003 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n== Emotion ==\n\n<!-- This sub section is linked from emotion, dispositional affectivity, anger, Group Emotion etc. -->\n[[Emotion]]s play an important part in the negotiation process, although it is only in recent years that their effect is being studied. Emotions have the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation. During negotiations, the decision as to whether or not to settle rests in part on emotional factors. Negative emotions can cause intense and even irrational behavior, and can cause conflicts to escalate and negotiations to break down, but may be instrumental in attaining concessions. On the other hand, positive emotions often facilitate reaching an agreement and help to maximize joint gains, but can also be instrumental in attaining concessions. Positive and negative discrete emotions can be strategically displayed to influence task and relational outcomes<ref name=\"Kopelman, Rosette, & Thompson, 2006\">Kopelman, S.; Rosette, A.; and Thompson, L.

Although various negative emotions affect negotiation outcomes, by far the most researched is [[anger]]. Angry negotiators plan to use more competitive strategies and to cooperate less, even before the negotiation starts.<ref name=\"Forgas 1998\"/> These competitive strategies are related to reduced joint outcomes.\nDuring negotiations, anger disrupts the process by reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side.<ref name=\"Maiese\"/> Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains.<ref name=\"Allred 1997\">{{cite journal | last1 = Allred | first1 = K.

(2003) suggested that there are two conditions for emotional affect, both related to the ability (presence of environmental or cognitive disturbances) and the motivation:\n\n# Identification of the affect: requires high motivation, high ability or both.\n# Determination that the affect is relevant and important for the judgment: requires that either the motivation, the ability or both are low.\n\nAccording to this model, emotions affect negotiations only when one is high and the other is low. When both ability and motivation are low, the affect is identified, and when both are high the affect is identified but discounted as irrelevant to judgment.<ref name=\"Albarrac\u0131n 2003\">{{cite journal | last1 = Albarracin | first1 = D. | last2 = Kumkale | first2 = G.T. | year = 2003 | title = Affect as Information in Persuasion: A Model of Affect Identification and Discounting | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 453\u2013469 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.3.453| pmid = 12635909 | pmc = 4797933 }}</ref>\nA possible implication of this model is, for example, that the positive effects PA has on negotiations (as described above) is seen only when either motivation or ability are low.\n\n=== Effect of partner's emotions ===\n\nMost studies on emotion in negotiations focus on the effect of the negotiator's own emotions on the process. However, what the other party feels might be just as important, as [[group emotion]]s are known to affect processes both at the group and the personal levels.\nWhen it comes to negotiations, trust in the other party is a necessary condition for its emotion to affect,<ref name=\"Van Kleef 2006\"/> and visibility enhances the effect.<ref name=\"Carnevale 1986\"/>\nEmotions contribute to negotiation processes by signaling what one feels and thinks and can thus prevent the other party from engaging in destructive behaviors and to indicate what steps should be taken next: PA signals to keep in the same way, while NA points that mental or behavioral adjustments are needed.<ref name=\"Barry 2004\"/><br />\nPartner's emotions can have two basic effects on negotiator's emotions and behavior: mimetic/ reciprocal or complementary.<ref name=\"Butt 2005\"/> For example, [[disappointment]] or [[sadness]] might lead to [[compassion]] and more cooperation.<ref name=\"Barry 2004\"/> In a study by Butt et al. (2005) that simulated real multi-phase negotiation, most people reacted to the partner's emotions in reciprocal, rather than complementary, manner. Specific emotions were found to have different effects on the opponent's feelings and strategies chosen:\n\n* '''Anger''' caused the opponents to place lower demands and to concede more in a [[Zero-sum game|zero-sum]] negotiation, but also to evaluate the negotiation less favorably.<ref name=\"Van Kleef 2004\">{{cite journal | last1 = Van Kleef | first1 = G.

It is important to allow both parties to share any emotions he or she may have.\n* '''Allow time to let off steam -''' It is possible that one party may feel angry or frustrated at some point during the negotiation. Rather than try to avoid discussing those feelings, allow the individual to talk it out. Sitting and listening, without providing too much feedback to the substance itself, can offer enough support for the person to feel better. Once the grievances are released, it may become easier to negotiate.\n* '''Symbolic gestures -''' Consider that an [[Apology (act)|apology]], or any other simple act, may be one of the most effective and low cost means to reduce any negative emotions between parties.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Problems with laboratory studies ===\n\nNegotiation is a rather complex [[Social interaction|interaction]].

Although lab studies have their advantages, they do have major drawbacks when studying emotions:\n\n* Emotions in lab studies are usually manipulated and are therefore relatively 'cold' (not intense). Although those 'cold' emotions might be enough to show effects, they are qualitatively different from the 'hot' emotions often experienced during negotiations.<ref name=\"Bazerman 2000\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bazerman | first1 = M.

Real-life scenarios provoke a much wider scale of emotions.<ref name=\"Barry 2004\"/>\n* Coding the emotions has a double catch: if done by a third side, some emotions might not be detected as the negotiator sublimates them for strategic reasons. Self-report measures might overcome this, but they are usually filled only before or after the process, and if filled during the process might interfere with it.<ref name=\"Barry 2004\"/>\n\n== Group composition ==\n\n=== Multi-party ===\nWhile negotiations involving more than two parties is less often researched, some results from two-party negotiations still apply with more than two parties.  One such result is that in negotiations it is common to see language similarity arise between the two negotiating parties.  In three-party negotiations, language similarity still arose, and results were particularly efficient when the party with the most to gain from the negotiation adopted language similarities from the other parties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sagi|first=Eyal|last2=Diermeier|first2=Daniel|date=2015-12-01|title=Language Use and Coalition Formation in Multiparty Negotiations|journal=Cognitive Science|language=en|pages=259\u2013271|doi=10.1111/cogs.12325|pmid=26671166|issn=1551-6709|volume=41|issue=1}}</ref>\n\n=== Team ===\n\n[[File:Warsaw Negotiation Round Senate of Poland 2014 01.JPG|thumb|250px|Students from [[University of Troms\u00f8]] and [[University of Toronto]] during 5th International Negotiation Tournament \u2013 Warsaw Negotiation Round in the [[Polish Senate]] (2014).]]\n\nDue to globalization and growing business trends, negotiation in the form of teams is becoming widely adopted. Teams can effectively collaborate to break down a complex negotiation. There is more knowledge and wisdom dispersed in a team than in a single mind. Writing, listening, and talking, are specific roles team members must satisfy. The capacity base of a team reduces the amount of blunder, and increases familiarity in a negotiation.<ref>Sparks, D. B. (1993). ''The Dynamics of Effective Negotiation'' (second edition). Houston: Gulf Publishing Co.</ref>\n\nHowever, unless a team can appropriately utilize the full capacity of its potential, effectiveness can suffer. One factor in the effectiveness of team negotiation is a problem that occurs through solidarity behavior. Solidarity behavior occurs when one team member reduces his or her own utility (benefit) in order to increase the benefits of other team members. This behavior is likely to occur when interest conflicts rise. When the utility/needs of the negotiation opponent does not align with every team member's interests, team members begin to make concessions and balance the benefits gained among the team.<ref>Wang, J., & Gong, J. (n.d.). Team Negotiation Based on Solidarity Behavior: A Concession Strategy in the Team. Retrieved November 14, 2016, from http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515883</ref>\n\nIntuitively, this may feel like a cooperative approach. However, though a team may aim to negotiate in a cooperative or collaborative nature, the outcome may be less successful than is possible, especially when integration is possible. Integrative potential is possible when different negotiation issues are of different importance to each team member. Integrative potential is often missed due to the lack of awareness of each member's interests and preferences. Ultimately, this leads to a poorer negotiation result.\n\nThus, a team can perform more effectively if each member discloses his or her preferences prior to the negotiation. This step will allow the team to recognize and organize the team's joint priorities, which they can take into consideration when engaging with the opposing negotiation party. Because a team is more likely to discuss shared information and common interests, teams must make an active effort to foster and incorporate unique viewpoints from experts from different fields. Research by Daniel Thiemann, which largely focused on computer-supported collaborative tasks, found that the Preference Awareness method is an effective tool for fostering the knowledge about joint priorities and further helps the team judge which negotiation issues were of highest importance.<ref>Thiemann, D., & Hesse, F. W. (2015). Learning about Team Members' Preferences: Computer-Supported Preference Awareness in the Negotiation Preparation of Teams.</ref>\n\n=== Women ===\nMany of the strategies in negotiation vary across genders, and this leads to variations in outcomes for different genders, often with women experiencing less success in negotiations as a consequence.  This is due to a number of factors, including that it has been shown that it is more difficult for women to be self-advocating when they are negotiating.  Many of the implications of these findings have strong financial impacts in addition to the social backlash faced by self-advocating women in negotiations, as compared to other advocating women, self-advocating men, and other advocating men.  Research in this area has been studied across platforms, in addition to more specific areas like women as physician assistants.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brianne|first=Hall|last2=Tracy|first2=Hoelting|date=2015-04-24|title=Influence of negotiation and practice setting on salary disparities between male and female physician assistants|url=http://soar.wichita.edu/handle/10057/11423|language=en-US}}</ref>  The backlash associated with this type of behavior is attributed to the fact that to be self-advocated is considered masculine, whereas the alternative, being accommodating, is considered more feminine.<ref name=\"Gladstone 18\u201325\">{{Cite journal|last=Gladstone|first=Eric|last2=O'Connor|first2=Kathleen M.|date=2014-09-01|title=A counterpart's feminine face signals cooperativeness and encourages negotiators to compete|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=125|issue=1|pages=18\u201325|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2014.05.001}}</ref>  Males, however, do not appear to face any type of backlash for not being self-advocating.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Amanatullah|first=Emily T.|last2=Tinsley|first2=Catherine H.|date=2013-01-01|title=Punishing female negotiators for asserting too much\u2026or not enough: Exploring why advocacy moderates backlash against assertive female negotiators|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=120|issue=1|pages=110\u2013122|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2012.03.006}}</ref>\n\nThis research has been supported by multiple studies, including one which evaluated candidates participating in a negotiation regarding compensation.  This study showed that women who initiated negotiations were evaluated more poorly than men who initiated negotiations.  In another variation of this particular setup, men and women evaluated videos of men and women either accepting a compensation package or initiating negotiations.  Men evaluated women more poorly for initiating negotiations, while women evaluated both men and women more poorly for initiating negotiations.  In this particular experiment, women were less likely to initiate a negotiation with a male, citing nervousness, but there was no variation with the negotiation was initiated with another female.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bowles|first=Hannah|last2=Babcock|first2=Linda|last3=Lai|first3=Lei|year=2006|title=Social incentives for gender diVerences in the propensity to initiate negotiations: Sometimes it does hurt to ask|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/cfawis/bowles.pdf|journal= Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=103|pages=84\u2013103|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.09.001}}</ref>\n\nResearch also supports the notion that the way individuals respond in a negotiation varies depending on the gender of the opposite party.  In all-male groups, the use of deception showed no variation upon the level of trust between negotiating parties, however in mixed-sex groups there was an increase in deceptive tactics when it was perceived that the opposite party was using an accommodating strategy.  In all-female groups, there were many shifts in when individuals did and did not employ deception in their negotiation tactics.<ref name=\"Gladstone 18\u201325\" />\n\n=== Academic negotiation ===\nThe academic world contains a unique management system, wherein faculty members, some of which have tenure, reside in academic units (e.g. departments) and are overseen by chairs, or heads. These chairs/heads are in turn supervised by deans of the college where their academic unit resides. Negotiation is an area where faculty, chairs/heads and their deans have little preparation; their doctoral degrees are typically in a highly specialized area according to their academic expertise. However, the academic environment frequently presents with situations where negotiation takes place. For example, many faculty are hired with an expectation that they will conduct research and publish scholarly works. For these faculty, where their research requires equipment, space, and/or funding, negotiation of a \"start-up\" package is critical for their success and future promotion.<ref name=\"Callahan 25571\">{{Cite journal|last=Callahan|first=J|last2=Besterfield-Sacre|first2=M.E. |last3=Carpenter|first3=J.P.|last4=Needy|first4=K.L.|last5=Schrader|first5=C.B.|date=2016|title=Listening and Negotiation|url=https://peer.asee.org/25571|journal=2016 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, New Orleans, Louisiana|doi=10.18260/p.25571|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\"Amekudzi-Kennedy 28631\">{{Cite journal|last=Amekudzi-Kennedy|first=A.A.|last2=Hall|first2=K.D. |last3=Harding|first3=T.S.|last4=Moll|first4=A.J.|last5=Callahan|first5=J.|date=2017|title=Listening and Negotiation II|url=https://peer.asee.org/28631 |journal=2017 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, Columbus, Ohio|doi=10.18260/1-2--28631}}</ref> Also, department chairs often find themselves in situations, typically involving resource redistribution where they must negotiate with their dean, on behalf of their unit.

Rowman & Littlefield, 2005]</ref> The difference in the usage of the two type depends on the mindset of the negotiator but also on the situation: one-off encounters where lasting relationships do not obtain are more likely to produce distributive negotiations whereas lasting relationships are more likely to require integrative negotiating<ref>{{cite book | title=Bargaining for Advantage | last=Shell | first=G Richard | publisher=Penguin | date=1999 | location=United States | isbn=9780670881338 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/bargainingforadv1999shel }}</ref>  Different theorists use different labels for the two general types and distinguish them in different ways.\n\n=== Distributive negotiation ===\n{{See also|Zero-sum game}}\n\nDistributive negotiation is also sometimes called positional or hard-bargaining negotiation and attempts to distribute a \"fixed pie\" of benefits. Distributive negotiation operates under zero-sum conditions and implies that any gain one party makes is at the expense of the other and vice versa. For this reason, distributive negotiation is also sometimes called ''win-lose'' because of the assumption that one person's gain is another person's loss. Distributive negotiation examples include haggling prices on an open market, including the negotiation of the price of a car or a home.\n\nIn a distributive negotiation, each side often adopts an extreme or fixed position, knowing it will not be accepted\u2014and then seeks to cede as little as possible before reaching a deal. Distributive bargainers conceive of negotiation as a process of distributing a fixed amount of value. A distributive negotiation often involves people who have never had a previous interactive relationship, nor are they likely to do so again in the near future, although all negotiations usually have a distributive element.\n\nIn the distributive approach each negotiator fights for the largest possible piece of the pie, so parties tend to regard each other more as an adversary than a partner and to take a harder line.<ref name=\":0\">Saner, Raymond. ''The Expert Negotiator'', The Netherlands: Kluwer Law International, 2000 (p. 40)</ref> Since [[Prospect theory|Prospect Theory]] indicates that people value losses more than gains and are more risk-averse about losses, concession-convergence bargaining is likely to be more acrimonious and less productive of an agreement<ref>{{cite book|last=McDermott | first=Rose | title=Prospect Theory and Negotiation | editor-last=Avenhaus | editor-first=Rudolf[ | editor2-last=Sj\u00f6sted | editor2-first=Gunnar | chapter=Negotiated Risks | publisher=Springer | location=Germany | date=2009 | isbn=978-3-540-92992-5 | pages=372 }}</ref>\n\n=== {{vanchor|Integrative negotiation}} ===\n{{See also|Non-zero-sum game|Win-win game}}\n\nIntegrative negotiation is also called interest-based, merit-based, or principled negotiation. It is a set of techniques that attempts to improve the quality and likelihood of negotiated agreement by taking advantage of the fact that different parties often value various outcomes differently.<ref>John Nash, \"The Bargaining problem,\" Econometrica XVIII 1:155-162, 1950; G C Homans, Social Behavior. Harcourt, Brace and world, 1961</ref> While distributive negotiation assumes there is a fixed amount of value (a \"fixed pie\") to be divided between the parties, integrative negotiation attempts to create value in the course of the negotiation (\"expand the pie\") by either \"compensating\" loss of one item with gains from another (\"trade-offs\" or [[logrolling]]), or by constructing or reframing the issues of the conflict in such a way that both parties benefit (\"win-win\" negotiation).<ref>{{cite book| title=Creative Experience | last=Follett | first=Mary | publisher=P Smith | location=United States | date=1951 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, even integrative negotiation is likely to have some distributive elements, especially when the different parties both value different items to the same degree or when details are left to be allocated at the end of the negotiation. While concession is mandatory for negotiations, research shows that people who concede more quickly, are less likely to explore all integrative and mutually beneficial solutions.  Therefore, early conceding reduces the chance of an integrative negotiation.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Hufmeier|last3=Loschelder|last4=Schwartz|last5=Collwitzer|date=2011|title=Perspective taking as a means to overcome motivational barriers in negotiations: When putting oneself in the opponents shoes helps to walk towards agreements|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=101|issue=4|pages=771\u2013790|doi=10.1037/a0023801|pmid=21728447|last1=Trotschel|url=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/771.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.728.9853}}</ref>\n\nIntegrative negotiation often involves a higher degree of trust and the formation of a relationship. It can also involve creative problem-solving that aims to achieve mutual gains. It sees a good agreement as not one with maximum individual gain, but one that provides optimum gain for all parties. Gains in this scenario are not at the expense of the Other, but with it.  Each seeks to accord the Other enough benefit that it will hold to the agreement that gives the first party an agreeable outcome, and vice versa.\n\nProductive negotiation focuses on the underlying interests of the parties rather than their starting positions, approaches negotiation as a shared problem-solving rather than a personalized battle, and insists upon adherence to objective, principled criteria as the basis for agreement.<ref name=\"AgainstGridlock-p1\">Gregory Brazeal, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1730725 \"Against Gridlock: The Viability of Interest-Based Legislative Negotiation\"], ''Harvard Law & Policy Review'' (Online), vol. 3, p. 1 (2009).</ref>\n\n=== Stages in the negotiation process ===\n\nHowever, negotiators need not sacrifice effective negotiation in favor of a positive relationship between parties. Rather than conceding, each side can appreciate that the other has emotions and motivations of their own and use this to their advantage in discussing the issue. In fact, perspective-taking can help move parties toward a more integrative solution. Fisher et al. illustrate a few techniques that effectively improve perspective-taking in their book ''Getting to Yes'', and through the following, negotiators can separate people from the problem itself.\n\n* '''Put yourself in their shoes''' \u2013 People tend to search for information that confirms his or her own beliefs and often ignore information that contradicts prior beliefs. In order to negotiate effectively, it is important to empathize with the other party's point of view. One should be open to other views and attempt to approach an issue from the perspective of the other.\n* '''Discuss each other's perceptions''' \u2013 A more direct approach to understanding the other party is to explicitly discuss each other's perceptions. Each individual should openly and honestly share his or her perceptions without assigning blame or judgement to the other.\n* '''Find opportunities to act inconsistently with his or her views''' \u2013 It is possible that the other party has prior perceptions and expectations about the other side. The other side can act in a way that directly contradicts those preconceptions, which can effectively send a message that the party is interested in an integrative negotiation.\n* '''Face-saving''' \u2013 This approach refers to justifying a stance based on one's previously expressed principles and values in a negotiation. This approach to an issue is less arbitrary, and thus, it is more understandable from the opposing party's perspective.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally, negotiators can use certain communication techniques to build a stronger relationship and develop more meaningful negotiation solution.\n\n* '''Active listening''' \u2013 Listening is more than just hearing what the other side is saying. Active listening involves paying close attention to what is being said verbally and nonverbally. It involves periodically seeking further clarification from the person. By asking the person exactly what they mean, they may realize you are not simply walking through a routine, but rather take them seriously.\n* '''Speak for a purpose''' \u2013 Too much information can be as harmful as too little. Before stating an important point, determine exactly what you wish you communicate to the other party. Determine the exact purpose that this shared information will serve.<ref name=\":1\">Fisher, Roger, Ury, Wiliam, & Paten, Bruce (1991). Getting to yes: Negotiating agreement without giving in. Penguin: New York. Chapter 2</ref>\n\n=== Integrated negotiation ===\n''Integrated negotiation'' is a strategic approach to influence that maximizes value in any single negotiation through the astute linking and sequencing of other negotiations and decisions related to one's operating activities.\n\nThis approach in complex settings is best executed by mapping out all potentially relevant negotiations, conflicts and operating decisions in order to integrate helpful connections among them, while minimizing any potentially harmful connections (see examples below).\n\n''Integrated negotiation'' is not to be confused with ''integrative negotiation'', a different concept (as outlined above) related to a non-zero-sum approach to creating value in negotiations.\n\nIntegrated negotiation was first identified and labeled by international negotiator and author Peter Johnston in his book ''Negotiating with Giants''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://negotiatingwithgiants.com|title=Negotiating with Giants|last=Johnston|first=Peter D|publisher=Negotiation Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0980942101|location=United States|pages=Pages 4 to 5}}</ref>\n\nOne of the examples cited in Johnston's book is that of J. D. Rockefeller deciding where to build his first major oil refinery. Instead of taking the easier, cheaper route from the oil fields to refine his petroleum in Pittsburgh, Rockefeller chose to build his refinery in Cleveland. Why? Because rail companies would be transporting his refined oil to market. Pittsburgh had just one major railroad, meaning it could dictate prices in negotiations, while Cleveland had three railroads that Rockefeller knew would compete for his business, potentially reducing his costs significantly. The leverage gained in these rail negotiations more than offset the additional operating costs of sending his oil to Cleveland for refining, helping establish Rockefeller's empire, while undermining his competitors who failed to integrate their core operating decisions with their negotiation strategies.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/titan00ronc_0|title=Titan, The Life of John D.

Bad faith is a concept in negotiation theory whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.<ref>\"negotiating in bad faith\", example of use of [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bad%252Bfaith \"bad faith\"] definition in Oxford Online Dictionary</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=IBHS Union Voice |url=http://unitas.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/bad-faith-negotiation/ |title=\"Bad Faith Negotiation\", Union Voice |publisher=Unitas.wordpress.com |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>\n\nBad faith negotiations are often used in [[political science]] and [[political psychology]] to refer to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of [[information processing]].<ref>example of use - ''\"the Republicans accused the Democrats of [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bad%252Bfaith \"negotiating in bad faith\"], Oxford Online Dictionary</ref>  The \"[[inherent bad faith model]]\" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.<ref>Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3791139 \"The 'Inherent Bad Faith Model' Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger\"], ''Political Psychology''{{paywall}}</ref> It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.<ref name=\"Gilbert & Fiske inherent\">\"...&nbsp;the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one's opponent&nbsp;...\"'', ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T.

If the negotiation parties are able to expand the total pie a win-win situation is possible assuming that both parties profit from the expansion of the pie. In practice, however, this maximisation approach is oftentimes impeded by the so-called small pie bias, i.e. the psychological underestimation of the negotiation pie's size. Likewise, the possibility to increase the pie may be underestimated due to the so-called incompatibility bias.<ref name=\"Krebs p. 126\">''Jung/Krebs'', The Essentials of Contract Negotiation, p. 126 (keyword: Negotiation Pie).</ref> Contrary to enlarging the pie, the pie may also shrink during negotiations e.g. due to (excessive) negotiation costs.<ref name=\"Krebs p. 126\"/>\n\n== Strategies ==\n\nThere are many different ways to categorize the essential elements of negotiation.\n\nOne view of negotiation involves three basic elements: ''process'', ''behavior'' and ''substance''.  The process refers to how the parties negotiate: the context of the negotiations, the parties to the negotiations,  the tactics used by the parties, and the sequence and stages in which all of these play out. Behavior refers to the relationships among these parties, the communication between them and the styles they adopt. The substance refers to what the parties negotiate over: the agenda, the issues (positions and \u2013 more helpfully \u2013 interests), the options, and the agreement(s) reached at the end.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAnother view of negotiation comprises four elements: ''strategy'', ''process'', ''tools'', and ''tactics''. Strategy comprises the top level goals \u2013 typically including relationship and the final outcome. Processes and tools include the steps to follow and roles to take in preparing for and negotiating with the other parties. Tactics include more detailed statements and actions and responses to others' statements and actions. Some add to this ''persuasion and influence'', asserting that these have become integral to modern day negotiation success, and so should not be omitted.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n=== Employing an advocate ===\n\nA skilled negotiator may serve as an advocate for one party to the negotiation. The advocate attempts to obtain the most favorable outcomes possible for that party. In this process the negotiator attempts to determine the minimum outcome(s) the other party is (or parties are) willing to accept, then adjusts their demands accordingly. A \"successful\" negotiation in the advocacy approach is when the negotiator is able to obtain all or most of the outcomes their party desires, but without driving the other party to permanently break off negotiations.\n\nSkilled negotiators may use a variety of tactics ranging from negotiation hypnosis,{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} to a straightforward presentation of demands or setting of preconditions, to more deceptive approaches such as [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]. Intimidation and [[salami tactics]] may also play a part in swaying the outcome of negotiations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAnother negotiation tactic is bad guy/good guy. Bad guy/good guy is when one negotiator acts as a bad guy by using anger and threats. The other negotiator acts as a good guy by being considerate and understanding. The good guy blames the bad guy for all the difficulties while trying to get concessions and agreement from the opponent.<ref name=\"Churchman 1993\">Churchman, David. 1993. ''Negotiation Tactics''. Maryland: University Press of America. p. 13.</ref>\n\n=== BATNA ===\n\nThe best alternative to a negotiated agreement, or [[BATNA]], is the most advantageous alternative course of action a negotiator can take should the current negotiation end without reaching agreement. The quality of a BATNA has the potential to improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward.<ref>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83 (5) (2002), pp. 1131\u20131140</ref> Alternatives need to be actual and actionable to be of value.<ref>[https://www.negotiations.com/articles/best-alternative/ Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Negotiators may also consider the other party's BATNA and how it compares to what they are offering during the negotiation.<ref>Negotiation, Readings, Exercises and Cases, Roy J.

Thomas identified five styles or responses to negotiation.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Conflict and conflict management: Reflections and update  |date=2006-11-21 |doi=10.1002/job.4030130307 |volume=13 |issue=3  |journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior |pages=265\u2013274|last1=Thomas  |first1=Kenneth W  |hdl = 10945/40295|url=https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/10945/40295/6/thomas_conflict_1992.pdf}}</ref><ref>Shell, R. G. (2006). ''Bargaining for advantage''.

The following five styles can be used based on individuals' preferences depending on their pro-self or pro-social goals. These styles can change over time, and individuals can have strong dispositions towards numerous styles.\n\n{{glossary}}\n{{term|1=Accommodating}}\n{{defn|1=Individuals who enjoy solving the other party's problems and preserving personal relationships.\n         Accommodators are sensitive to the emotional states, body language, and verbal signals of the other parties.\n         They can, however, feel taken advantage of in situations when the other party places little emphasis on the relationship. Accommodation is a passive but prosocial approach to conflict. People solve both large and small conflicts by giving in to the demands of others. Sometimes, they yield because they realize that their position is in error, so they agree with the viewpoint adopted by others. In other cases, however, they may withdraw their demands without really being convinced that the other side is correct, but for the sake of group unity or in the interest of time--they withdraw all complaints. Thus, yielding can reflect either genuine conversion or superficial compliance.}}\n{{term|1=Avoiding}}\n{{defn|1=Individuals who do not like to negotiate and don't do it unless warranted.\n         When negotiating, avoiders tend to defer and dodge the confrontational aspects of negotiating; however, they may be perceived as tactful and diplomatic. Inaction is a passive means of dealing with disputes. Those who avoid conflicts adopt a \"wait and see\" attitude, hoping that problems will solve themselves. Avoiders often tolerate conflicts, allowing them to simmer without doing anything to minimize them. Rather than openly discussing disagreements, people who rely on avoidance change the subject, skip meetings, or even leave the group altogether (Bayazit & Mannix, 2003). Sometimes they simply agree to disagree (a modus vivendi).}}\n{{term|1=[[Collaboration|Collaborating]]}}\n{{defn|1=Individuals who enjoy negotiations that involve solving tough problems in creative ways.\n         Collaborators are good at using negotiations to understand the concerns and interests of the other parties.\n         Collaborating is an active, pro-social, and pro-self approach to conflict resolution. Collaborating people identify the issues underlying the dispute and then work together to identify a solution that is satisfying to both sides. This orientation, which is also described as collaboration, problem solving, or a win-win orientation, entreats both sides in the dispute to consider their opponent's outcomes as well as their own<ref>{{Cite book|title=Group dynamics|last=Forsyth|first=David|publisher=Wadsworth Pub Co.|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=379\u2013409|quote=|via=}}</ref>}}\n{{term|1=[[Competition|Competing]]}}\n{{defn|1=Individuals who enjoy negotiations because they present an opportunity to win something.\n         Competitive negotiators have strong instincts for all aspects of negotiating and are often strategic.\n         Because their style can dominate the bargaining process, competitive negotiators often neglect the importance of relationships. Competing is an active, pro-self means of dealing with conflict that involves forcing others to accept one's view. Those who use this strategy tend to see conflict as a win-lose situation and so use competitive, powerful tactics to intimidate others. Fighting (forcing, dominating, or contending) can take many forms, including authoritative mandate, challenges, arguing, insults, accusations, complaining, vengeance, and even physical violence (Morrill, 1995). These conflict resolution methods are all contentious ones because they involve imposing one's solution on the other party.}}\n{{term|1=Compromising}}\n{{defn|1=Individuals who are eager to close the deal by doing what is fair and equal for all parties involved in the negotiation.\n         Compromisers can be useful when there is limited time to complete the deal; however, compromisers often unnecessarily rush the negotiation process and make concessions too quickly.}}\n{{glossary end}}\n\n=== Types of negotiators ===\n\nThree basic kinds of negotiators have been identified by researchers involved in The Harvard Negotiation Project. These types of negotiators are: soft bargainers, hard bargainers, and principled bargainers.\n\n; Soft: These people see negotiation as too close to competition, so they choose a gentle style of bargaining. The offers they make are not in their best interests, they yield to others' demands, avoid confrontation, and they maintain good relations with fellow negotiators. Their perception of others is one of friendship, and their goal is agreement.  They do not separate the people from the problem, but are soft on both. They avoid contests of wills and insist on agreement, offering solutions and easily trusting others and changing their opinions.\n; Hard: These people use contentious strategies to influence, utilizing phrases such as \"this is my final offer\" and \"take it or leave it.\" They make threats, are distrustful of others, insist on their position, and apply pressure to negotiate. They see others as adversaries and their ultimate goal is victory. Additionally, they search for one single answer, and insist you agree on it. They do not separate the people from the problem (as with soft bargainers), but they are hard on both the people involved and the problem.\n; Principled: Individuals who bargain this way seek integrative solutions, and do so by sidestepping commitment to specific positions. They focus on the problem rather than the intentions, motives, and needs of the people involved. They separate the people from the problem, explore interests, avoid bottom lines, and reach results based on standards independent of personal will. They base their choices on objective criteria rather than power, pressure, self-interest, or an arbitrary decisional procedure. These criteria may be drawn from moral standards, principles of fairness, professional standards, and tradition.\n\nResearchers from The Harvard Negotiation Project recommend that negotiators explore a number of alternatives to the problems they face in order to reach the best solution, but this is often not the case (as when you may be dealing with an individual using soft or hard bargaining tactics) (Forsyth, 2010).\n\n=== {{vanchor|Tactics|Negotiation tactics}} ===\n\nTactics are always an important part of the negotiating process. More often than not they are subtle, difficult to identify and used for multiple purposes. Tactics are more frequently used in distributive negotiations and when the focus in on taking as much value off the table as possible.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Steve|title=The Negotiation Book|year=2011|publisher=A John Wiley and Sons, LTD., Publication|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-470-66491-9|page=232}}</ref>  Many negotiation tactics exist.

When people know that they may lose out on something, they want it even more. Not only do they want the thing that is being bid on, they also want to win, just to win. Taking advantage of someone's competitive nature can drive up the price.\n\n'''[[Brinksmanship]]:'''\nOne party aggressively pursues a set of terms to the point where the other negotiating party must either agree or walk away. Brinkmanship is a type of \"hard nut\" approach to bargaining in which one party pushes the other party to the \"brink\" or edge of what that party is willing to accommodate.  Successful brinksmanship convinces the other party they have no choice but to accept the offer and there is no acceptable alternative to the proposed agreement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Alvin|title=Settling For More: Mastering Negotiating Strategies and Techniques|year=1991|publisher=The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-87179-651-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/settlingformorem0000gold/page/83 83]|url=https://archive.org/details/settlingformorem0000gold/page/83}}</ref>\n\n'''Bogey:'''\nNegotiators use the bogey tactic to pretend that an issue of little or no importance is very important.<ref name=\"Essentials82\">{{cite book|last=Lewicki|first=R.

This tactic can be dangerous when parties are unwilling to back down and go through with the extreme measure.\n\n'''Defence in Depth:'''\nSeveral layers of decision-making authority is used to allow further concessions each time the agreement goes through a different level of authority.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Steve|title=The Negotiation Book|year=2011|publisher=A John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Publication|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-470-66491-9|page=246}}</ref> In other words, each time the offer goes to a decision maker, that decision maker asks to add another concession to close the deal.\n\n'''[[Time limit|Deadlines]]:'''\nGive the other party a deadline forcing them to make a decision. This method uses time to apply pressure to the other party. Deadlines given can be actual or artificial.\n\n'''Flinch:'''\nFlinching is showing a strong negative physical reaction to a proposal.  Common examples of flinching are gasping for air, or a visible expression of surprise or shock.  The flinch can be done consciously or unconsciously.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coburn|first=Calum|title=Neutralising Manipulative Negotiation Tactics|url=http://www.calumcoburn.co.uk/articles/negotiation-tactics/|publisher=Negotiation Training Solutions|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>  The flinch signals to the opposite party that you think the offer or proposal is absurd in hopes the other party will lower their aspirations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gates|first=Steve|title=The Negotiation Book|year=2011|publisher=A John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Publication|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-470-66491-9|page=245}}</ref>  Seeing a physical reaction is more believable than hearing someone saying, \"I'm shocked.\"\n\n'''Good Guy/Bad Guy:'''\nWithin the tactic of good guy/bad guy (synonyms are good cop/bad cop or black hat/white hat) oftentimes positive and unpleasant tasks are divided between two negotiators on the same negotiation side or unpleasant tasks or decisions are allocated to an (real or fictitious) outsider. The good guy supports the conclusion of the contract and emphasises positive aspects of the negotiation (mutual interests). The bad guy criticises negative aspects (opposing interests). The division of the two roles allows more consistent behaviour and credibility of the individual negotiators. As the good guy promotes the contract, he/she can build trust with the other side.<ref>''Jung/Krebs'', p. 102.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|highball}}'''Highball/Lowball''' or '''Ambit claim'''\nDepending on whether selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer that is not achievable.

A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.\n\n'''The Nibble:'''\nAlso known under salami tactic or quivering quill, nibbling is the demand of proportionally small concessions that haven't been discussed previously just before closing the deal.<ref name=\"Essentials82\"/> This method takes advantage of the other party's desire to close by adding \"just one more thing.\"\n\n'''Snow Job:'''\nNegotiators overwhelm the other party with so much information that they have difficulty determining what information is important, and what is a diversion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewicki|first=R.

Minton}}</ref> Negotiators may also use technical language or jargon to mask a simple answer to a question asked by a non-expert.\n\n'''Mirroring:'''\nWhen people get on well, the outcome of a negotiation is likely to be more positive. To create trust and a rapport, a negotiator may mimic or mirror the opponent's behavior and repeat what they say. Mirroring refers to a person repeating the core content of what another person just said, or repeating a certain expression. It indicates attention to the subject of negotiation and acknowledges the other party's point or statement.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vecchi | first1 = G. M. | last2 = Van Hasselt | first2 = V.

Effective negotiation requires that participants effectively convey and interpret information. Participants in a negotiation communicate information not only verbally but non-verbally through body language and gestures. By understanding how nonverbal communication works, a negotiator is better equipped to interpret the information other participants are leaking non-verbally while keeping secret those things that would inhibit his/her ability to negotiate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hui|first=Zhou|author2=Tingqin Zhang|title=Body Language in Business Negotiation|journal=International Journal of Business and Management|volume=3|issue=2}}</ref>\n\n==== Examples ====\n\n'''Non-verbal \"anchoring\"'''\nIn a negotiation, a person can gain the advantage by verbally expressing a position first. By [[anchoring]] one's position, one establishes the position from which the negotiation proceeds. In a like manner, one can \"anchor\" and gain advantage with nonverbal (body language) cues.\n\n* [[Personal space]]: The person at the head of the table is the apparent symbol of power. Negotiators can negate this strategic advantage by positioning allies in the room to surround that individual.\n* [[First impression (psychology)|First impression]]: Begin the negotiation with positive gestures and enthusiasm. Look the person in the eye with sincerity. If you cannot maintain eye contact, the other person might think you are hiding something or that you are insincere. Give a solid handshake.<ref>{{cite book|title=Body Language Magic|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vsNU1fjgCi8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n'''Reading non-verbal communication'''\nBeing able to read the non-verbal communication of another person can significantly aid in the communication process. By being aware of inconsistencies between a person's verbal and non-verbal communication and reconciling them, negotiators can to come to better resolutions. Examples of incongruity in body language include:\n\n* Nervous Laugh: A laugh not matching the situation. This could be a sign of nervousness or discomfort. When this happens, it may be good to probe with questions to discover the person's true feelings.\n* Positive words but negative body language: If someone asks their negotiation partner if they are annoyed and the person pounds their fist and responds sharply, \"what makes you think anything is bothering me?\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Michael C.|publisher=Wiley Publishing, Inc.|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|isbn=978-1-118-06808-3|title=Negotiating For Dummies|date=2011-04-18}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n* Hands raised in a clenched position: The person raising his/her hands in this position reveals frustration even when he/she is smiling. This is a signal that the person doing it may be holding back a negative attitude.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pease|first=Barbara and Alan|title=The Definitive Book of Body Language|year=2006|publisher=Bantam Dell|location=New York|isbn=978-0-553-80472-0|url=https://archive.org/details/definitivebookof00barb}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n* If possible, it may be helpful for negotiation partners to spend time together in a comfortable setting outside of the negotiation room.  Knowing how each partner non-verbally communicates outside of the negotiation setting helps negotiation partners sense incongruity between verbal and non-verbal communication.\n\n'''Conveying receptivity'''\nThe way negotiation partners position their bodies relative to each other may influence how receptive each is to the other person's message and ideas.\n\n* Face and eyes: Receptive negotiators smile, make plenty of eye contact. This conveys the idea that there is more interest in the person than in what is being said. On the other hand, non-receptive negotiators make little to no eye contact. Their eyes may be squinted, jaw muscles clenched and head turned slightly away from the speaker\n* Arms and hands: To show receptivity, negotiators should spread arms and open hands on table or relaxed on their lap. Negotiators show poor receptivity when their hands are clenched, crossed, positioned in front of their mouth, or rubbing the back of their neck.\n* Legs and Feet: Receptive negotiators sit with legs together or one leg slightly in front of the other. When standing, they distribute weight evenly and place hands on their hips with their body tilted toward the speaker. Non-receptive negotiators stand with legs crossed, pointing away from the speaker.\n* Torso: Receptive negotiators sit on the edge of their chair, unbutton their suit coat with their body tilted toward the speaker. Non-receptive negotiators may lean back in their chair and keep their suit coat buttoned.\n\nReceptive negotiators tend to appear relaxed with their hands open and palms visibly displayed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Donaldson|first=Michael C.|title=Negotiating for dummies|year=1996|publisher=Hungry Minds|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56884-867-9|author2=Donaldson, Mimi|url=https://archive.org/details/negotiatingfordu00dona}}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Barriers ===\n\n* Die-hard bargainers\n* Lack of trust\n* Informational vacuums and negotiator's dilemma\n* Structural impediments\n* Spoilers\n* Cultural and gender differences\n* Communication problems\n* The power of dialogue<ref>{{cite book |author=Richard Luecke |series=Harvard Business Essentials |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |title=Negotiation |location=Boston |isbn=9781591391111|year=2003 }}</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n== Emotion ==\n\n<!-- This sub section is linked from emotion, dispositional affectivity, anger, Group Emotion etc. -->\n[[Emotion]]s play an important part in the negotiation process, although it is only in recent years that their effect is being studied. Emotions have the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation. During negotiations, the decision as to whether or not to settle rests in part on emotional factors. Negative emotions can cause intense and even irrational behavior, and can cause conflicts to escalate and negotiations to break down, but may be instrumental in attaining concessions. On the other hand, positive emotions often facilitate reaching an agreement and help to maximize joint gains, but can also be instrumental in attaining concessions. Positive and negative discrete emotions can be strategically displayed to influence task and relational outcomes<ref name=\"Kopelman, Rosette, & Thompson, 2006\">Kopelman, S.; Rosette, A.; and Thompson, L.

Although various negative emotions affect negotiation outcomes, by far the most researched is [[anger]]. Angry negotiators plan to use more competitive strategies and to cooperate less, even before the negotiation starts.<ref name=\"Forgas 1998\"/> These competitive strategies are related to reduced joint outcomes.\nDuring negotiations, anger disrupts the process by reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side.<ref name=\"Maiese\"/> Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains.<ref name=\"Allred 1997\">{{cite journal | last1 = Allred | first1 = K.

(2003) suggested that there are two conditions for emotional affect, both related to the ability (presence of environmental or cognitive disturbances) and the motivation:\n\n# Identification of the affect: requires high motivation, high ability or both.\n# Determination that the affect is relevant and important for the judgment: requires that either the motivation, the ability or both are low.\n\nAccording to this model, emotions affect negotiations only when one is high and the other is low. When both ability and motivation are low, the affect is identified, and when both are high the affect is identified but discounted as irrelevant to judgment.<ref name=\"Albarrac\u0131n 2003\">{{cite journal | last1 = Albarracin | first1 = D. | last2 = Kumkale | first2 = G.T. | year = 2003 | title = Affect as Information in Persuasion: A Model of Affect Identification and Discounting | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 453\u2013469 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.3.453| pmid = 12635909 | pmc = 4797933 }}</ref>\nA possible implication of this model is, for example, that the positive effects PA has on negotiations (as described above) is seen only when either motivation or ability are low.\n\n=== Effect of partner's emotions ===\n\nMost studies on emotion in negotiations focus on the effect of the negotiator's own emotions on the process. However, what the other party feels might be just as important, as [[group emotion]]s are known to affect processes both at the group and the personal levels.\nWhen it comes to negotiations, trust in the other party is a necessary condition for its emotion to affect,<ref name=\"Van Kleef 2006\"/> and visibility enhances the effect.<ref name=\"Carnevale 1986\"/>\nEmotions contribute to negotiation processes by signaling what one feels and thinks and can thus prevent the other party from engaging in destructive behaviors and to indicate what steps should be taken next: PA signals to keep in the same way, while NA points that mental or behavioral adjustments are needed.<ref name=\"Barry 2004\"/><br />\nPartner's emotions can have two basic effects on negotiator's emotions and behavior: mimetic/ reciprocal or complementary.<ref name=\"Butt 2005\"/> For example, [[disappointment]] or [[sadness]] might lead to [[compassion]] and more cooperation.<ref name=\"Barry 2004\"/> In a study by Butt et al. (2005) that simulated real multi-phase negotiation, most people reacted to the partner's emotions in reciprocal, rather than complementary, manner. Specific emotions were found to have different effects on the opponent's feelings and strategies chosen:\n\n* '''Anger''' caused the opponents to place lower demands and to concede more in a [[Zero-sum game|zero-sum]] negotiation, but also to evaluate the negotiation less favorably.<ref name=\"Van Kleef 2004\">{{cite journal | last1 = Van Kleef | first1 = G.

It is important to allow both parties to share any emotions he or she may have.\n* '''Allow time to let off steam -''' It is possible that one party may feel angry or frustrated at some point during the negotiation. Rather than try to avoid discussing those feelings, allow the individual to talk it out. Sitting and listening, without providing too much feedback to the substance itself, can offer enough support for the person to feel better. Once the grievances are released, it may become easier to negotiate.\n* '''Symbolic gestures -''' Consider that an [[Apology (act)|apology]], or any other simple act, may be one of the most effective and low cost means to reduce any negative emotions between parties.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Problems with laboratory studies ===\n\nNegotiation is a rather complex [[Social interaction|interaction]]. Capturing all its complexity is a very difficult task, let alone isolating and controlling only certain aspects of it. For this reason most negotiation studies are done under [[laboratory]] conditions, and focus only on some aspects. Although lab studies have their advantages, they do have major drawbacks when studying emotions:\n\n* Emotions in lab studies are usually manipulated and are therefore relatively 'cold' (not intense). Although those 'cold' emotions might be enough to show effects, they are qualitatively different from the 'hot' emotions often experienced during negotiations.<ref name=\"Bazerman 2000\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bazerman | first1 = M.

Real-life scenarios provoke a much wider scale of emotions.<ref name=\"Barry 2004\"/>\n* Coding the emotions has a double catch: if done by a third side, some emotions might not be detected as the negotiator sublimates them for strategic reasons. Self-report measures might overcome this, but they are usually filled only before or after the process, and if filled during the process might interfere with it.<ref name=\"Barry 2004\"/>\n\n== Group composition ==\n\n=== Multi-party ===\nWhile negotiations involving more than two parties is less often researched, some results from two-party negotiations still apply with more than two parties.  One such result is that in negotiations it is common to see language similarity arise between the two negotiating parties.  In three-party negotiations, language similarity still arose, and results were particularly efficient when the party with the most to gain from the negotiation adopted language similarities from the other parties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sagi|first=Eyal|last2=Diermeier|first2=Daniel|date=2015-12-01|title=Language Use and Coalition Formation in Multiparty Negotiations|journal=Cognitive Science|language=en|pages=259\u2013271|doi=10.1111/cogs.12325|pmid=26671166|issn=1551-6709|volume=41|issue=1}}</ref>\n\n=== Team ===\n\n[[File:Warsaw Negotiation Round Senate of Poland 2014 01.JPG|thumb|250px|Students from [[University of Troms\u00f8]] and [[University of Toronto]] during 5th International Negotiation Tournament \u2013 Warsaw Negotiation Round in the [[Polish Senate]] (2014).]]\n\nDue to globalization and growing business trends, negotiation in the form of teams is becoming widely adopted. Teams can effectively collaborate to break down a complex negotiation. There is more knowledge and wisdom dispersed in a team than in a single mind. Writing, listening, and talking, are specific roles team members must satisfy. The capacity base of a team reduces the amount of blunder, and increases familiarity in a negotiation.<ref>Sparks, D. B. (1993). ''The Dynamics of Effective Negotiation'' (second edition). Houston: Gulf Publishing Co.</ref>\n\nHowever, unless a team can appropriately utilize the full capacity of its potential, effectiveness can suffer. One factor in the effectiveness of team negotiation is a problem that occurs through solidarity behavior. Solidarity behavior occurs when one team member reduces his or her own utility (benefit) in order to increase the benefits of other team members. This behavior is likely to occur when interest conflicts rise. When the utility/needs of the negotiation opponent does not align with every team member's interests, team members begin to make concessions and balance the benefits gained among the team.<ref>Wang, J., & Gong, J. (n.d.). Team Negotiation Based on Solidarity Behavior: A Concession Strategy in the Team. Retrieved November 14, 2016, from http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515883</ref>\n\nIntuitively, this may feel like a cooperative approach. However, though a team may aim to negotiate in a cooperative or collaborative nature, the outcome may be less successful than is possible, especially when integration is possible. Integrative potential is possible when different negotiation issues are of different importance to each team member. Integrative potential is often missed due to the lack of awareness of each member's interests and preferences. Ultimately, this leads to a poorer negotiation result.\n\nThus, a team can perform more effectively if each member discloses his or her preferences prior to the negotiation. This step will allow the team to recognize and organize the team's joint priorities, which they can take into consideration when engaging with the opposing negotiation party. Because a team is more likely to discuss shared information and common interests, teams must make an active effort to foster and incorporate unique viewpoints from experts from different fields. Research by Daniel Thiemann, which largely focused on computer-supported collaborative tasks, found that the Preference Awareness method is an effective tool for fostering the knowledge about joint priorities and further helps the team judge which negotiation issues were of highest importance.<ref>Thiemann, D., & Hesse, F. W. (2015). Learning about Team Members' Preferences: Computer-Supported Preference Awareness in the Negotiation Preparation of Teams.</ref>\n\n=== Women ===\nMany of the strategies in negotiation vary across genders, and this leads to variations in outcomes for different genders, often with women experiencing less success in negotiations as a consequence.  This is due to a number of factors, including that it has been shown that it is more difficult for women to be self-advocating when they are negotiating.  Many of the implications of these findings have strong financial impacts in addition to the social backlash faced by self-advocating women in negotiations, as compared to other advocating women, self-advocating men, and other advocating men.  Research in this area has been studied across platforms, in addition to more specific areas like women as physician assistants.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brianne|first=Hall|last2=Tracy|first2=Hoelting|date=2015-04-24|title=Influence of negotiation and practice setting on salary disparities between male and female physician assistants|url=http://soar.wichita.edu/handle/10057/11423|language=en-US}}</ref>  The backlash associated with this type of behavior is attributed to the fact that to be self-advocated is considered masculine, whereas the alternative, being accommodating, is considered more feminine.<ref name=\"Gladstone 18\u201325\">{{Cite journal|last=Gladstone|first=Eric|last2=O'Connor|first2=Kathleen M.|date=2014-09-01|title=A counterpart's feminine face signals cooperativeness and encourages negotiators to compete|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=125|issue=1|pages=18\u201325|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2014.05.001}}</ref>  Males, however, do not appear to face any type of backlash for not being self-advocating.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Amanatullah|first=Emily T.|last2=Tinsley|first2=Catherine H.|date=2013-01-01|title=Punishing female negotiators for asserting too much\u2026or not enough: Exploring why advocacy moderates backlash against assertive female negotiators|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=120|issue=1|pages=110\u2013122|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2012.03.006}}</ref>\n\nThis research has been supported by multiple studies, including one which evaluated candidates participating in a negotiation regarding compensation.  This study showed that women who initiated negotiations were evaluated more poorly than men who initiated negotiations.  In another variation of this particular setup, men and women evaluated videos of men and women either accepting a compensation package or initiating negotiations.  Men evaluated women more poorly for initiating negotiations, while women evaluated both men and women more poorly for initiating negotiations.  In this particular experiment, women were less likely to initiate a negotiation with a male, citing nervousness, but there was no variation with the negotiation was initiated with another female.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bowles|first=Hannah|last2=Babcock|first2=Linda|last3=Lai|first3=Lei|year=2006|title=Social incentives for gender diVerences in the propensity to initiate negotiations: Sometimes it does hurt to ask|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/cfawis/bowles.pdf|journal= Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=103|pages=84\u2013103|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.09.001}}</ref>\n\nResearch also supports the notion that the way individuals respond in a negotiation varies depending on the gender of the opposite party.  In all-male groups, the use of deception showed no variation upon the level of trust between negotiating parties, however in mixed-sex groups there was an increase in deceptive tactics when it was perceived that the opposite party was using an accommodating strategy.  In all-female groups, there were many shifts in when individuals did and did not employ deception in their negotiation tactics.<ref name=\"Gladstone 18\u201325\" />\n\n=== Academic negotiation ===\nThe academic world contains a unique management system, wherein faculty members, some of which have tenure, reside in academic units (e.g. departments) and are overseen by chairs, or heads. These chairs/heads are in turn supervised by deans of the college where their academic unit resides. Negotiation is an area where faculty, chairs/heads and their deans have little preparation; their doctoral degrees are typically in a highly specialized area according to their academic expertise. However, the academic environment frequently presents with situations where negotiation takes place. For example, many faculty are hired with an expectation that they will conduct research and publish scholarly works. For these faculty, where their research requires equipment, space, and/or funding, negotiation of a \"start-up\" package is critical for their success and future promotion.<ref name=\"Callahan 25571\">{{Cite journal|last=Callahan|first=J|last2=Besterfield-Sacre|first2=M.E. |last3=Carpenter|first3=J.P.|last4=Needy|first4=K.L.|last5=Schrader|first5=C.B.|date=2016|title=Listening and Negotiation|url=https://peer.asee.org/25571|journal=2016 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, New Orleans, Louisiana|doi=10.18260/p.25571|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\"Amekudzi-Kennedy 28631\">{{Cite journal|last=Amekudzi-Kennedy|first=A.A.|last2=Hall|first2=K.D. |last3=Harding|first3=T.S.|last4=Moll|first4=A.J.|last5=Callahan|first5=J.|date=2017|title=Listening and Negotiation II|url=https://peer.asee.org/28631 |journal=2017 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, Columbus, Ohio|doi=10.18260/1-2--28631}}</ref> Also, department chairs often find themselves in situations, typically involving resource redistribution where they must negotiate with their dean, on behalf of their unit.

It derived most directly from the [[rhythm and blues]] music of the 1940s, which itself developed from earlier [[blues]], [[boogie woogie]], [[jazz]] and [[swing music]], and was also influenced by [[gospel music|gospel]], [[country music|country and western]], and traditional [[folk music]]. Rock and roll in turn provided the main basis for the music that, since the mid-1960s, has been generally known simply as [[rock music]].\n\nThe phrase \"rocking and rolling\" originally described the movement of a ship on the ocean, but it was used by the early 20th century, both to describe a spiritual fervor and as a sexual analogy. Various gospel, blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became used more frequently \u2013 but still intermittently \u2013 in the late 1930s and 1940s, principally on recordings and in reviews of what became known as \"rhythm and blues\" music aimed at black audiences.

Such double-entendres were well established in blues music but were new to the radio airwaves. After the success of \"Good Rocking Tonight\", many other R&B artists used similar titles through the late 1940s. At least two different songs with the title \"Rock and Roll\" were recorded in the late 1940s: by [[Paul Bascomb]] in 1947 and [[Wild Bill Moore]] in 1948.<ref name=Aquila2000>R.

After a night of heavy drinking, he and his friends came up with the name ''The Rock and Roll Party'' because he already was using the phrase ''Rock and Roll Session'' to describe the music he was playing.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} As his show became extremely popular, the term became widely used to describe the style of music.\n\n==Development of the musical style==\n{{also|Origins of the blues}}\nRock and roll music emerged from the wide variety of musical genres that existed in the United States in the first half of the 20th century among different ethnic and social groups. Each genre developed over time through changing fashion and innovation, and each one exchanged ideas and stylistic elements with all the others. The greatest contribution came from the musical traditions of America's black population{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, with an ancient heritage of oral storytelling through music of African origin, usually with strong rhythmic elements, with frequent use of \"[[blue notes]]\" and often using a \"[[call and response]]\" vocal pattern. [[Music of Africa|African music]] was modified through the experience of slavery, and through contact with white musical styles such as the folk [[ballad]], and instruments, such as the Spanish guitar. New styles of music emerged among black Americans in the early 20th century in the form of [[blues]], [[ragtime]], [[jazz]], and [[gospel music]].<ref name=\"unterberger birth\"/><ref name=palmer3-14>[[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]], \"Rock Begins\", in ''Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'', New York : Rolling Stone Press/Random House, 1976-1980, pp. 3\u201314 (UK edition)</ref> According to the writer [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]]:<blockquote>\"Rock 'n' roll was an inevitable outgrowth of the social and musical interactions between blacks and whites in the South and Southwest. Its roots are a complex tangle. Bedrock black church music influenced blues, rural blues influenced white folk song and the black popular music of the Northern ghettos, blues and black pop influenced jazz, and so on. But the single most important process was the influence of black music on white.\"<ref name=palmer /></blockquote>\n\nBy the 1930s, [[African-American music|African American musicians]], such as [[Cab Calloway]], [[Fletcher Henderson]] and [[Duke Ellington]], were developing [[swing music]], essentially jazz played for dancing, and in some areas such as New York City processes of social integration were taking place. According to Palmer, by the mid-1930s, elements of rock and roll could be found in every type of American folk and blues music. Some jazz bands, such as [[Count Basie]]'s, increasingly played rhythmic music that was heavily based on blues riffs. In Chicago, blues performers formed into small groups, such as [[the Harlem Hamfats]], and explored the use of amplification. In the Midwest, jump bands developed instrumental blues based on riffs, with saxophone solos and shouted vocals. In Nashville and elsewhere, country music played by white musicians such as [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] incorporated blues styles, and in some cases was recorded with (uncredited) black musicians. In Texas and Oklahoma, [[Western swing]] bands, such as [[Bob Wills]], combined elements of big band, blues and country music into a new style of dance music. As musicians from different areas and cultures heard each other's music, so styles merged and innovations spread.<ref name=palmer /> Increasingly, processes of active cross-fertilisation took place between the music played and heard by white people and the music predominantly played and heard by black people. These processes of exchange and mixing were fueled by the spread of radio, [[78&nbsp;rpm]] and later [[gramophone record|records]] and [[jukeboxes]], and the expansion of the commercial popular music business. The music also benefited from the development of new [[Amplifier|amplification]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|electronic recording]] techniques from the 1930s onward, including the invention of the [[electric guitar]], first recorded as a virtuoso instrument by [[Charlie Christian]].<ref name=\"unterberger birth\"/>\n[[File:Louis Jordan, New York, N.Y., ca. July 1946 (William P. Gottlieb 04721).jpg|thumb|[[Louis Jordan]] in 1946]]\nIn 1938, promoter and record producer [[John H. Hammond]] staged the first \"[[From Spirituals to Swing]]\" concert in New York City to highlight black musical styles. It featured pianist [[Pete Johnson]] and singer [[Big Joe Turner]], whose recording of \"[[Roll 'Em Pete]]\" helped spark a craze across American society for \"boogie woogie\" music, mostly played by black musicians. In both musical and social terms, this helped pave the way for rock and roll music. Economic changes also made the earlier [[Big band|big bands]] unwieldy; [[Louis Jordan]] left [[Chick Webb]]'s orchestra the same year to form the Tympany Five. Mixing of genres continued through the shared experiences of the World War II, and afterward a new style of music emerged, featuring \"honking\" saxophone solos, increasing use of the electric guitar, and strongly accented boogie rhythms. This \"[[jump blues]]\" encompassed both novelty records, such as those by Jordan, and more heavily rhythmic recordings such as those by [[Lionel Hampton]]. \n\nIncreasingly, the term \"rocking\" was used in the records themselves, and by the late 1940s frequently was used to describe the music of performers such as [[Wynonie Harris]] whose records reached the top of the newly christened \"rhythm and blues\" charts.<ref name=\"unterberger birth\"/><ref name=palmer />\n\nIn 1947, blues singer [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]] recorded \"[[Good Rocking Tonight]]\", a song that parodied church music by appropriating its references, including the word \"rocking\" and the gospel call \"Have you heard the news?\", relating them to very worldly lyrics about dancing, drinking and sex. The song became much more successful the following year when recorded by Wynonie Harris, whose version changed the steady blues rhythm to an uptempo gospel beat, and it was re-recorded by Elvis Presley in 1954 as his second single. A craze began in the rhythm and blues market for songs about \"rocking\", including \"We're Gonna Rock\" by [[Wild Bill Moore]], the first commercially successful \"honking\" sax record, with the words \"We're gonna rock, we're gonna roll\" as a background chant. One of the most popular was \"[[Rock the Joint]]\", first recorded by [[Jimmy Preston]] in May 1949, and a R&B top 10 hit that year. Preston's version is often considered a prototype of a rock-and-roll song, and it was covered in 1952 by [[Bill Haley & His Comets|Bill Haley and the Saddlemen]]. [[Marshall Lytle]], Haley's bass player, claimed that this was one of the songs that inspired [[Alan Freed]] to coin the phrase \"rock and roll\" to refer to the music he played.<ref name=\"hoyhoy\" />\n\nFreed first started playing the music in 1951, and by 1953 the phrase \"rock and roll\" was becoming used much more widely to market the music beyond its initial black audience. The practitioners of the music were young black artists, appealing to the post-war community's need for excitement, dancing and increasing social freedoms, but the music also became very attractive to white teenagers. As well as \"rocking\" rhythm and blues songs, such as the massively successful and influential \"[[Rocket 88]]\" recorded by [[Ike Turner]] and his band but credited to singer [[Jackie Brenston]], the term was used to encompass other forms of black music. In particular, vocal harmony group recordings in the style that later became known as \"doo-wop\", such as \"[[Gee (The Crows song)|Gee]]\" by [[the Crows]] and \"[[Earth Angel]]\" by [[the Penguins]], became huge commercial successes, often for the new small independent record companies becoming established. These included [[Modern Records|Modern]], [[Imperial Records|Imperial]], [[Specialty Records|Specialty]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[King Records (USA)|King]] and [[Chess Records|Chess]].\n\nThe adoption of rock and roll by white people was hindered by racist attitudes. As [[Billy Burnette]] said about his father [[Dorsey Burnette]] and uncle [[Johnny Burnette]]:<blockquote>They'd buy their clothes on [[Beale Street]], at Lansky Brothers, where all the black people shopped. Right outside Memphis, there was a voodoo village, all black-real mystic kind of people... A lot of real old line southern people called my dad and my uncle white nigger. Nobody was doing rock-and-roll in those days except people they called white trash. When my dad and my uncle started doin' it, they were just about the first.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Rockin' in Time|last = Szatmary|first = David P.|publisher = Pearson|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-205-93624-3|location = New Jersey|pages = 41}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough some of the rhythm and blues musicians who had been successful in earlier years \u2013 such as Joe Turner, [[Ruth Brown]], and [[Fats Domino]] who had his first R&B hit in 1950 \u2013 made the transition into new markets, much of the initial breakthrough into the wider pop music market came from white musicians, such as Haley, Presley, [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], re-recording earlier rhythm and blues hits, often making use of technological improvements in recording and innovations such as [[double tracking]], developed by the large mainstream record companies, as well as the invention of the 45-rpm record and the rapid growth of its use in [[jukeboxes]]. At the same time, younger black musicians such as [[Little Richard]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Bo Diddley]] took advantage of the gradual breakdown of ethnic barriers in America to become equally popular and help launch the rock and roll era. By the time of Haley's first hits in 1953, and those of Berry, Little Richard and then Presley the next year, rock and roll was firmly established.<ref name=\"hoyhoy\" /><ref name=\"unterberger birth\"/>\nThe Pentecostal church has also been identified as a crucial component in the development of rock and roll. The modern Pentecostal movement parallels rock and roll in many ways. Further, the unhinged, wild energy of the church is evidenced in the most important of early rock performers that were also raised in Pentecostal churches, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis.<ref>Cosby, James A.

In their introduction, the authors claim that since the modern definition of rock 'n' roll was set by [[disc jockey]] [[Alan Freed]]'s use of the term in his groundbreaking ''The Rock and Roll Show'' on New York's [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] in late 1954, as well as at his ''Rock and Roll Jubilee Balls'' at St. Nicholas Arena in January 1955, they chose to judge their candidates according to the music Freed spotlighted: R&B combos, black vocal groups, honking saxophonists, blues belters, and several white artists playing in the authentic R&B style ([[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]], [[Elvis Presley]]). The artists who appeared at Freed's earliest shows included orchestra leader [[Buddy Johnson]], [[the Clovers]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Big Joe Turner]], the [[Moonglows]], [[Clyde McPhatter]] and [[the Drifters]], and [[the Harptones]]. That, say Dawson and Propes, was the first music being called rock and roll during that short time when the term caught on all over America. Because the honking tenor saxophone was the driving force at those shows and on many of the records Freed was playing, the authors began their list with a 1944 squealing and squawking live performance by [[Illinois Jacquet]] with [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] in Los Angeles in mid-1944. That record, \"Blues, Part 2,\" was released as Stinson 6024 and is still in print as a CD on the Verve label. Several notable jazz greats accompanied Jacquet on \"Blues\", including Paul Leslie and Slim Nadine (the monikers employed by Les Paul and Nat \"King\" Cole, respectively, in order to appear at the JATP concert incognito).\n\nIn 2004, Elvis Presley's \"[[That's All Right Mama]]\" and Bill Haley's \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" both celebrated their 50th anniversaries.

Each genre developed over time through changing fashion and innovation, and each one exchanged ideas and stylistic elements with all the others. The greatest contribution came from the musical traditions of America's black population{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, with an ancient heritage of oral storytelling through music of African origin, usually with strong rhythmic elements, with frequent use of \"[[blue notes]]\" and often using a \"[[call and response]]\" vocal pattern. [[Music of Africa|African music]] was modified through the experience of slavery, and through contact with white musical styles such as the folk [[ballad]], and instruments, such as the Spanish guitar. New styles of music emerged among black Americans in the early 20th century in the form of [[blues]], [[ragtime]], [[jazz]], and [[gospel music]].<ref name=\"unterberger birth\"/><ref name=palmer3-14>[[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]], \"Rock Begins\", in ''Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'', New York : Rolling Stone Press/Random House, 1976-1980, pp. 3\u201314 (UK edition)</ref> According to the writer [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]]:<blockquote>\"Rock 'n' roll was an inevitable outgrowth of the social and musical interactions between blacks and whites in the South and Southwest. Its roots are a complex tangle.

But the single most important process was the influence of black music on white.\"<ref name=palmer /></blockquote>\n\nBy the 1930s, [[African-American music|African American musicians]], such as [[Cab Calloway]], [[Fletcher Henderson]] and [[Duke Ellington]], were developing [[swing music]], essentially jazz played for dancing, and in some areas such as New York City processes of social integration were taking place. According to Palmer, by the mid-1930s, elements of rock and roll could be found in every type of American folk and blues music. Some jazz bands, such as [[Count Basie]]'s, increasingly played rhythmic music that was heavily based on blues riffs. In Chicago, blues performers formed into small groups, such as [[the Harlem Hamfats]], and explored the use of amplification. In the Midwest, jump bands developed instrumental blues based on riffs, with saxophone solos and shouted vocals. In Nashville and elsewhere, country music played by white musicians such as [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] incorporated blues styles, and in some cases was recorded with (uncredited) black musicians. In Texas and Oklahoma, [[Western swing]] bands, such as [[Bob Wills]], combined elements of big band, blues and country music into a new style of dance music. As musicians from different areas and cultures heard each other's music, so styles merged and innovations spread.<ref name=palmer /> Increasingly, processes of active cross-fertilisation took place between the music played and heard by white people and the music predominantly played and heard by black people. These processes of exchange and mixing were fueled by the spread of radio, [[78&nbsp;rpm]] and later [[gramophone record|records]] and [[jukeboxes]], and the expansion of the commercial popular music business. The music also benefited from the development of new [[Amplifier|amplification]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|electronic recording]] techniques from the 1930s onward, including the invention of the [[electric guitar]], first recorded as a virtuoso instrument by [[Charlie Christian]].<ref name=\"unterberger birth\"/>\n[[File:Louis Jordan, New York, N.Y., ca. July 1946 (William P. Gottlieb 04721).jpg|thumb|[[Louis Jordan]] in 1946]]\nIn 1938, promoter and record producer [[John H. Hammond]] staged the first \"[[From Spirituals to Swing]]\" concert in New York City to highlight black musical styles. It featured pianist [[Pete Johnson]] and singer [[Big Joe Turner]], whose recording of \"[[Roll 'Em Pete]]\" helped spark a craze across American society for \"boogie woogie\" music, mostly played by black musicians. In both musical and social terms, this helped pave the way for rock and roll music. Economic changes also made the earlier [[Big band|big bands]] unwieldy; [[Louis Jordan]] left [[Chick Webb]]'s orchestra the same year to form the Tympany Five. Mixing of genres continued through the shared experiences of the World War II, and afterward a new style of music emerged, featuring \"honking\" saxophone solos, increasing use of the electric guitar, and strongly accented boogie rhythms. This \"[[jump blues]]\" encompassed both novelty records, such as those by Jordan, and more heavily rhythmic recordings such as those by [[Lionel Hampton]]. \n\nIncreasingly, the term \"rocking\" was used in the records themselves, and by the late 1940s frequently was used to describe the music of performers such as [[Wynonie Harris]] whose records reached the top of the newly christened \"rhythm and blues\" charts.<ref name=\"unterberger birth\"/><ref name=palmer />\n\nIn 1947, blues singer [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]] recorded \"[[Good Rocking Tonight]]\", a song that parodied church music by appropriating its references, including the word \"rocking\" and the gospel call \"Have you heard the news?\", relating them to very worldly lyrics about dancing, drinking and sex. The song became much more successful the following year when recorded by Wynonie Harris, whose version changed the steady blues rhythm to an uptempo gospel beat, and it was re-recorded by Elvis Presley in 1954 as his second single. A craze began in the rhythm and blues market for songs about \"rocking\", including \"We're Gonna Rock\" by [[Wild Bill Moore]], the first commercially successful \"honking\" sax record, with the words \"We're gonna rock, we're gonna roll\" as a background chant. One of the most popular was \"[[Rock the Joint]]\", first recorded by [[Jimmy Preston]] in May 1949, and a R&B top 10 hit that year. Preston's version is often considered a prototype of a rock-and-roll song, and it was covered in 1952 by [[Bill Haley & His Comets|Bill Haley and the Saddlemen]]. [[Marshall Lytle]], Haley's bass player, claimed that this was one of the songs that inspired [[Alan Freed]] to coin the phrase \"rock and roll\" to refer to the music he played.<ref name=\"hoyhoy\" />\n\nFreed first started playing the music in 1951, and by 1953 the phrase \"rock and roll\" was becoming used much more widely to market the music beyond its initial black audience. The practitioners of the music were young black artists, appealing to the post-war community's need for excitement, dancing and increasing social freedoms, but the music also became very attractive to white teenagers. As well as \"rocking\" rhythm and blues songs, such as the massively successful and influential \"[[Rocket 88]]\" recorded by [[Ike Turner]] and his band but credited to singer [[Jackie Brenston]], the term was used to encompass other forms of black music. In particular, vocal harmony group recordings in the style that later became known as \"doo-wop\", such as \"[[Gee (The Crows song)|Gee]]\" by [[the Crows]] and \"[[Earth Angel]]\" by [[the Penguins]], became huge commercial successes, often for the new small independent record companies becoming established. These included [[Modern Records|Modern]], [[Imperial Records|Imperial]], [[Specialty Records|Specialty]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[King Records (USA)|King]] and [[Chess Records|Chess]].\n\nThe adoption of rock and roll by white people was hindered by racist attitudes. As [[Billy Burnette]] said about his father [[Dorsey Burnette]] and uncle [[Johnny Burnette]]:<blockquote>They'd buy their clothes on [[Beale Street]], at Lansky Brothers, where all the black people shopped. Right outside Memphis, there was a voodoo village, all black-real mystic kind of people... A lot of real old line southern people called my dad and my uncle white nigger. Nobody was doing rock-and-roll in those days except people they called white trash. When my dad and my uncle started doin' it, they were just about the first.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Rockin' in Time|last = Szatmary|first = David P.|publisher = Pearson|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-205-93624-3|location = New Jersey|pages = 41}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough some of the rhythm and blues musicians who had been successful in earlier years \u2013 such as Joe Turner, [[Ruth Brown]], and [[Fats Domino]] who had his first R&B hit in 1950 \u2013 made the transition into new markets, much of the initial breakthrough into the wider pop music market came from white musicians, such as Haley, Presley, [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], re-recording earlier rhythm and blues hits, often making use of technological improvements in recording and innovations such as [[double tracking]], developed by the large mainstream record companies, as well as the invention of the 45-rpm record and the rapid growth of its use in [[jukeboxes]]. At the same time, younger black musicians such as [[Little Richard]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Bo Diddley]] took advantage of the gradual breakdown of ethnic barriers in America to become equally popular and help launch the rock and roll era. By the time of Haley's first hits in 1953, and those of Berry, Little Richard and then Presley the next year, rock and roll was firmly established.<ref name=\"hoyhoy\" /><ref name=\"unterberger birth\"/>\nThe Pentecostal church has also been identified as a crucial component in the development of rock and roll. The modern Pentecostal movement parallels rock and roll in many ways. Further, the unhinged, wild energy of the church is evidenced in the most important of early rock performers that were also raised in Pentecostal churches, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis.<ref>Cosby, James A.

In their introduction, the authors claim that since the modern definition of rock 'n' roll was set by [[disc jockey]] [[Alan Freed]]'s use of the term in his groundbreaking ''The Rock and Roll Show'' on New York's [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] in late 1954, as well as at his ''Rock and Roll Jubilee Balls'' at St. Nicholas Arena in January 1955, they chose to judge their candidates according to the music Freed spotlighted: R&B combos, black vocal groups, honking saxophonists, blues belters, and several white artists playing in the authentic R&B style ([[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]], [[Elvis Presley]]). The artists who appeared at Freed's earliest shows included orchestra leader [[Buddy Johnson]], [[the Clovers]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Big Joe Turner]], the [[Moonglows]], [[Clyde McPhatter]] and [[the Drifters]], and [[the Harptones]]. That, say Dawson and Propes, was the first music being called rock and roll during that short time when the term caught on all over America. Because the honking tenor saxophone was the driving force at those shows and on many of the records Freed was playing, the authors began their list with a 1944 squealing and squawking live performance by [[Illinois Jacquet]] with [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] in Los Angeles in mid-1944. That record, \"Blues, Part 2,\" was released as Stinson 6024 and is still in print as a CD on the Verve label. Several notable jazz greats accompanied Jacquet on \"Blues\", including Paul Leslie and Slim Nadine (the monikers employed by Les Paul and Nat \"King\" Cole, respectively, in order to appear at the JATP concert incognito).\n\nIn 2004, Elvis Presley's \"[[That's All Right Mama]]\" and Bill Haley's \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" both celebrated their 50th anniversaries.

The leader of the rebellion, Sardar [[Muhammad Ibrahim Khan (politician)|Muhammad Ibrahim Khan]] escaped to Lahore by the end of August 1947 and persuaded the Pakistani authorities to back the rebellion. In addition to the backing, Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] authorised an invasion of the state, by the ex-[[Indian National Army]] personnel in the south and a force led by Major [[Khurshid Anwar (Major)|Khurshid Anwar]] in the north. These invasions eventually led to the [[First Kashmir War]] fought between India and Pakistan, and the formation of [[Azad Kashmir]]. The Poonch jagir has since been divided across Azad Kashmir, administered by Pakistan and the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], administered by India.<ref name=\"india-seminar\">{{Cite web |last=Snedden |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Snedden |url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2013/643/643_christopher_snedden.htm |title=The forgotten Poonch uprising of 1947 |website=India-seminar }}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[Poonch jagir|Poonch]] was originally an internal ''jagir'' (autonomous principality), governed by an alternative family line of Maharaja [[Hari Singh]].{{efn|Poonch and Mirpur (Chibhal) districts were originally granted by Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] to Raja Dhyan Singh, the brother of Raja [[Gulab Singh]]. After the death of Ranjit Singh, Dhyan Singh was murdered in palace ingrigues. Subject to the terms of the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846]], Gulab Singh, who became the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, reinstated these territories as ''jagirs'' to Dhyan Singh's sons. While Mirpur was subsequently absorbed by Gulab Singh, Poonch remained with the descendants of Dhyan Singh until 1940.}} The Muslims of Poonch suffered from small landholdings and high taxation and nursed their grievances since 1905. They had also campaigned for the principality to be absorbed into the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab province]] of British India. In 1938, a notable disturbance occurred for religious reasons, but a settlement was reached. From then on, a garrison of State troops was established in Poonch to keep order.<ref>{{harvtxt|Snedden, Kashmir: The Unwritten History|2013|pp=30\u201331}}; {{harvtxt|Ankit, The Problem of Poonch|2010|p=8}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Raja Jagatdev Singh of Poonch in 1940, Maharaja Hari Singh appointed a chosen guardian for his minor son, Shiv Ratandev Singh, and used the opportunity to integrate the Poonch ''jagir'' into the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Poonch came to be administered by the officers of Jammu and Kashmir as a district of the [[Jammu Division|Jammu province]]. This resulted in loss of autonomy for Poonch and subjected its people to the increased taxation of the Kashmir state, both of which were resented by the people.<ref>{{harvtxt|Snedden, Kashmir: The Unwritten History|2013|pp=237\u2013238}}; {{harvtxt|McLeod, India and Pakistan: Friends, Rivals or Enemies?|2008|pp=74\u201375}}; {{harvtxt|Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict|2003|p=41}}</ref>\n\nThe Poonchis had a tradition of military service.

On that day, orders were issued via demi-official letters to various brigade headquarters in the North-West Pakistan to operationalise the plan. According to the plan, 20 ''lashkars'' (tribal militias), consisting of 1000 Pashtun tribesmen each, were to be recruited and armed at various brigade headquarters in the North-West Pakistan. Ten lashkars were to be launched into the Kashmir Valley via [[Muzaffarabad]] and another ten lashkars were to join the rebels in Poonch, Bhimber and [[Rawalakot]] with a view to advance to [[Jammu]].

The people of Poonch who suffered under the local ruler, and his overlord, the Kashmir durbar, had started a people\u2019s movement to redress their grievances. It was not communal. The Kashmir State sent their troops and there was panic in Poonch. Most of the adult population in Poonch was ex-servicemen of the Indian Army, who had close connections with the people in Jhelum and Rawalpindi. They evacuated their women and children, crossed the frontier and returned with arms supplied to them by willing people.

The leader of the rebellion, Sardar [[Muhammad Ibrahim Khan (politician)|Muhammad Ibrahim Khan]] escaped to Lahore by the end of August 1947 and persuaded the Pakistani authorities to back the rebellion.

After the death of Ranjit Singh, Dhyan Singh was murdered in palace ingrigues. Subject to the terms of the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846]], Gulab Singh, who became the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, reinstated these territories as ''jagirs'' to Dhyan Singh's sons. While Mirpur was subsequently absorbed by Gulab Singh, Poonch remained with the descendants of Dhyan Singh until 1940.}} The Muslims of Poonch suffered from small landholdings and high taxation and nursed their grievances since 1905. They had also campaigned for the principality to be absorbed into the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab province]] of British India. In 1938, a notable disturbance occurred for religious reasons, but a settlement was reached. From then on, a garrison of State troops was established in Poonch to keep order.<ref>{{harvtxt|Snedden, Kashmir: The Unwritten History|2013|pp=30\u201331}}; {{harvtxt|Ankit, The Problem of Poonch|2010|p=8}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Raja Jagatdev Singh of Poonch in 1940, Maharaja Hari Singh appointed a chosen guardian for his minor son, Shiv Ratandev Singh, and used the opportunity to integrate the Poonch ''jagir'' into the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Poonch came to be administered by the officers of Jammu and Kashmir as a district of the [[Jammu Division|Jammu province]]. This resulted in loss of autonomy for Poonch and subjected its people to the increased taxation of the Kashmir state, both of which were resented by the people.<ref>{{harvtxt|Snedden, Kashmir: The Unwritten History|2013|pp=237\u2013238}}; {{harvtxt|McLeod, India and Pakistan: Friends, Rivals or Enemies?|2008|pp=74\u201375}}; {{harvtxt|Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict|2003|p=41}}</ref>\n\nThe Poonchis had a tradition of military service.

Despite their alliances to the all-India parties, both the parties had ambiguous positions on the accession of the state. The National Conference demanded that the power should be devolved to the people and the people should decide on accession.

On that day, orders were issued via demi-official letters to various brigade headquarters in the North-West Pakistan to operationalise the plan. According to the plan, 20 ''lashkars'' (tribal militias), consisting of 1000 Pashtun tribesmen each, were to be recruited and armed at various brigade headquarters in the North-West Pakistan. Ten lashkars were to be launched into the Kashmir Valley via [[Muzaffarabad]] and another ten lashkars were to join the rebels in Poonch, Bhimber and [[Rawalakot]] with a view to advance to [[Jammu]]. The plan also consisted of detailed arrangements for the military leadership and armaments.{{sfnp|Prasad & Pal, Operations in Jammu & Kashmir |1987 |pp=17\u201319}}<ref>{{citation|last=Kalkat|first=Onkar S.|title=The Far-flung Frontiers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWO5AAAAIAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Allied Publishers|pp=40\u201342}}</ref> Scholar Robin James Moore states that, by 13 September, armed Pashtuns drifted into Lahore and Rawalpindi.

In response to incidents around Poonch that invariably involved Muslims, the Maharaja\u2019s army fired on crowds, burned houses and villages indiscriminately, plundered, arrested people, and imposed local martial law. Indeed, because \u2018trouble continued \u2026 the State forces were compelled to deal with it with a heavy hand\u2019. Until such oppressive actions, the anti-Maharaja cause probably had little backing. \u2018Substantial men\u2019 told Symonds that \u2018they would never have joined such a rash enterprise\u2019 opposing the Maharaja \u2018but for the folly of the Dogras who burnt whole villages where only a single family was involved in the revolt\u2019. Such \u2018folly\u2019 motivated some Poonch Muslims to organise a people\u2019s resistance movement.\"</blockquote>Referring to the events in Poonch, Sheikh Abdullah, according to a New Delhi report circulated by the Associated Press of India, on 21 October said:<ref name=\"Bhasin\" /><blockquote>\nThe present troubles in Poonch, a feudatory of Kashmir, were because of the policy adopted by the State. The people of Poonch who suffered under the local ruler, and his overlord, the Kashmir durbar, had started a people\u2019s movement to redress their grievances. It was not communal. The Kashmir State sent their troops and there was panic in Poonch. Most of the adult population in Poonch was ex-servicemen of the Indian Army, who had close connections with the people in Jhelum and Rawalpindi. They evacuated their women and children, crossed the frontier and returned with arms supplied to them by willing people. The Kashmir State forces were thus forced to withdraw from certain areas.\n</blockquote>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nAfter the Indian forces entered the war, Pakistan officially intervened subsequently.
