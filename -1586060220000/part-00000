Established by Presidential Proclamation in 1902 as the Lincoln Forest Preserve, the {{convert|1103897|acre|km2}} forest begins near the Texas border and contains lands in parts of [[Chaves County, New Mexico|Chaves]], [[Eddy County, New Mexico|Eddy]], [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln]], and [[Otero County, New Mexico|Otero]] counties.  The three Ranger Districts within the forest contain all or part of four mountain ranges, and include a variety of different environmental areas, from desert to heavily forested mountains and sub-alpine grasslands.  Established to balance conservation, resource management, and recreation, the lands of the Lincoln National Forest include important local timber resources, protected wilderness areas, and popular recreation and winter sports areas.  The forest headquarters is located in [[Alamogordo]], N.M. with local offices in [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]], [[Cloudcroft]], and [[Ruidoso]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe modern Lincoln National Forest traces its origins to several different forest reserves and national forests designated in the 1902-1908 period.  These included the Lincoln Forest Preserve, a 545,256 acre area established July 26, 1902 around Capitan and Lincoln, the 78,480 acre Gallinas Forest Preserve established on November 5, 1906 in the Gallinas Mountains west of Gallinas, the [[Guadalupe National Forest]], established April 19, 1907 in the mountains along the Texas border, and the [[Sacramento National Forest]], created on April 24, 1907 to preserve the forested heights of the Sacramento Mountains near Alamogordo.  Scattered throughout south-central New Mexico, these individual units contained lands in the Guadalupe, Sacramento, Sierra Blanca/White Mountains, Capitan and Gallinas ranges, and encompassed environments from the desert shrubs at the floor of the Chihuahuan Desert through forests of Pi\u00f1on, Pine and Juniper to sub-alpine grasslands above the tree-line.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/lincoln/learning/nature-science</ref>\n\nThe process of integrating these individual units into a single, unified National Forest began in July 1908, when President Theodore Roosevelt signed Executive Order 908, which combined a number of national forests in the Southwestern states into larger units. One of the first foresters was Arthur Ringland who later founded the international relief organization, CARE.<ref>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cuming_Ringland</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} One element of this order was to add the [[Gallinas National Forest]], a tract of land around the Gallinas Mountains west of [[Corona, New Mexico]] to the existing Lincoln National Forest.  Another element of Roosevelt's Executive Order that would have a great impact on the development of the Lincoln National Forest was the decision to combine the existing Guadalupe and Sacramento National Forests into the [[Alamo National Forest]].  A wholly new administrative unit, the Alamo National Forest was headquartered in [[Alamogordo]] and led by inaugural Forest Supervisor Arthur M. Neal.\n\nNearly nine years later, on June 6, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson signed an Executive order that transferred the lands of the Alamo National Forest to the control of the Lincoln National Forest.  As a result of this order, the main elements of the Alamo National Forest, the public lands around the Sacramento and Guadalupe Mountains, were transferred to the Lincoln, greatly expanding its size.  The last major change in the Forest's boundaries came in 1945, when administrative control of the former Gallinas National Forest was transferred from the Lincoln to the sprawling [[Cibola National Forest]].  Officially transferred in 1958.  the Gallinas area was renamed the Mountainair Ranger District, with its headquarters in [[Mountainair]].\n\n==The forest==\nThe modern Lincoln National Forest is composed of three separate units, the Smokey Bear Ranger District, headquartered in [[Ruidoso]], the Sacramento Ranger District, headquartered in [[Cloudcroft]], and the Guadalupe Ranger District, with its headquarters in [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]]. \n[[File:Lincoln National Forest headquarters building.jpg|thumb|right|Forest Headquarters, Alamogordo, N.M.]]\n\n===Sacramento Ranger District===\n\nOriginally established April 24, 1907 as the Sacramento National Forest, the heavily forested southern Sacramento Mountains, east of [[Alamogordo]], were combined with the Guadalupe National Forest to form the Alamo National Forest in July 1908.  One of the two major elements of the new forest, the former Sacramento National Forest was divided into a number of smaller ranger districts within the larger unit.  These included the La Luz, Mayhill, and Weed Ranger Districts, all of which administered lands around their respective villages.  On June 6, 1917, these lands became part of the Lincoln National Forest, when their parent organization, the Alamo National Forest was disestablished.  As a result of this order, some areas of the former Sacramento National Forest, like La Luz Ranger District, lost their independent status, others were renamed, such as the Fresnal district, which became the Cloudcroft Ranger District, and others, like Mayhill and Weed, retained their original names and designations.<ref name=\"foresthistory.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Publications/region/3/early_days/3/appe.htm|title=The Early Days: A Sourcebook of Southwestern Region History \u2014 Book 3 (Appendix E)|website=www.foresthistory.org|access-date=2017-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811223811/http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Publications/region/3/early_days/3/appe.htm|archive-date=2017-08-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1961, the Cloudcroft, Mayhill and Weed Ranger Districts were consolidated and given their current designation, the Sacramento Ranger District of the Lincoln National Forest.<ref name=\"foresthistory.org\"/>\n\nRising high above the gypsum sands of [[White Sands National Park]] and the city of Alamogordo, the Sacramento district encompasses much of the southern half of the Sacramento Mountains.  Located immediately south of the [[Mescalero Apache Reservation]], which covers the northern half of the mountains, the district is primarily composed of Douglas Fir, Ponderosa pine, aspen, and oak, as well as numerous creeks and waterfalls.  The district is traversed east-west by that section of [[U.S. 82]] between [[Artesia, New Mexico|Artesia]] and [[Alamogordo]], which goes through the villages of Cloudcroft and Mayhill.  Other roads include New Mexico State Road 6563, also known as the Sunspot Scenic Byway, which runs between Cloudcroft and the village of Sunspot, and NM 244, which exits the district north of Cloudcroft and enters the Mescalero Apache Reservation.\n\n====Trestle====\n[[File:Mexican Canyon Trestle from the lookout (5032007085).jpg|thumb|left|Wood railroad trestle across Mexican Canyon]]\nA heavily forested area in an otherwise arid environment, the Sacramento Mountains have long been used for timber harvesting.  To expedite the transport of timber to processing facilities and markets, the Alamogordo and Sacramento Mountain Railway was constructed in 1898 by the El Paso and Northeastern Railway, a short-line railroad that connected El Paso, Texas and Alamogordo.  A genuine engineering marvel, the Alamogordo and Sacramento Mountain Railway climbed 4,747 feet over 32 miles of track, and included numerous switchbacks, trestles, and grades as high as 6.4%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Publications/region/3/lincoln/cultres4/sec1.htm|title=Logging Railroads of the Lincoln National Forest, New Mexico (Historic Overview)|website=www.foresthistory.org}}</ref> Though the track was removed in 1948, evidence of the railroad is visible throughout the district.  The most visible remnant of the railroad is the 320 foot trestle over Mexican Canyon near Cloudcroft.  Crossing 52 feet above the canyon floor the trestle can be seen from vista points on U.S. 82 and by a number of short trails beginning at the Trestle Recreation Area, a day-use facility on the western edge of Cloudcroft.\n<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5404319.pdf</ref>\n\n====Sunspot Observatory====\n\nThe high mountains of the Sacramentos are also home to the National Solar Observatory's Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope, considered the world's premier high resolution optical solar telescope at the time of its inauguration in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsosp.nso.edu/dst|title=Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope - NSO - Sacramento Peak|website=nsosp.nso.edu}}</ref>\nLocated in the southern end of the district, the observatory is open to the public on a seasonal basis and can be accessed by the scenic New Mexico State Road 6563, also known as the Sunspot Scenic Byway, a two-lane paved road that travels the 15.5 miles between Cloudcroft and the village of Sunspot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sangres.com/newmexico/scenic-byways/sunspot-scenic-byway.htm#.WTGK5b9TKCg|title=Sunspot Scenic Byway|website=www.sangres.com}}</ref>\n[[File:Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope (5508694434).jpg|thumb|right|Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope, Sunspot, N.M.]]\n\n===Smokey Bear District===\nPart of the original Forest Preserve established in 1902, the modern Smokey Bear Ranger District administers lands north of Capitan and Lincoln, in the Capitan Mountains, and south of Capitan to Ruidoso, immediately east of the Sierra Blanca or White Mountains.  The area was initially divided into the Baca Ranch Ranger District, renamed the Capitan District in February 1919, along the Rio Bonito north of Lincoln, and the Mesa and Ruidoso Ranger Districts further south.  The Mesa and Ruidoso districts were combined in October 1929 into the White Mountain Ranger District, a designation that lasted until 1952 when both areas resumed their original names.  All of these areas were combined in 1960 and given their current designation, the Smokey Bear Ranger District.\n\n423,416 acres in size, and ranging in elevation from 5,400 to 11,580 feet in the Capitan Mountains, the Smoky Bear district embraces a number of different environments, and includes desert shrubs, forests of pinyon pine, juniper, and spruce, and high-elevation grasslands above the treeline.  The area also includes the Forest's two designated Wilderness Areas and one of the two ski areas, Ski Apache near Ruidoso.  The district can be reached via U.S. 70, which traverses much of the southern part of the district and passes through the village of Ruidoso.  Another highway, U.S. 380, crosses a thin stretch of public lands east of Carrizozo and crosses through Capitan and Lincoln.\n\n====Smokey Bear====\n\nOne of the most enduring of stories to come out of the long history of the forest is the tale of the real-life Smokey Bear, a bear cub rescued from the devastated forest after the Capitan Gap fire of 1950.  Rescued from a burnt tree by either a New Mexico Department of Game and Fish ranger or a group of soldiers from nearby Fort Bliss seconded to fight the blaze, the cub was flown to Santa Fe by New Mexico Ranger Ray Bell for treatment of burns and other injuries.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/SFD/SmokeyBear/SmokeyBeartheLivingSymbol.html|title=EMNRD Forestry Division|website=www.emnrd.state.nm.us}}</ref>\nThe bear was eventually named Smokey Bear, after the Forest Service's symbol of fire safety on public lands, which had been created in 1944 by artist Harry Rossol.  Now the living symbol of fire awareness and prevention, Smokey Bear was flown to the National Zoo in Washington D.C.  The subject of hundreds of thousands of visitors and letters, the bear lived at the zoo until his death in 1976.  Eulogized by the [[Washington Post]] as a transplanted New Mexico native with many years of government service, Smokey Bear was returned to his native land and buried near Capitan in November 1976. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://smokeybear.com/en/smokeys-history/story-of-smokey|title=Story of Smokey - Smokey Bear|website=smokeybear.com}}</ref>\n\n====Lincoln County War====\n\n[[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]], in which much of the district is located, was the site of the 1878-79 [[Lincoln County War]], a complex and bloody struggle between ranchers, bankers, politicians, and hired gunmen for control of the County.  One of the major events in the war took place in the village of Lincoln itself, when forces supporting Sheriff George W. Peppin besieged the house of merchant Alexander McSween over several days while soldiers from nearby Fort Stanton stood by.  McSween was killed by gunfire, but a number of his supporters, known as \"regulators,\" escaped, led from the burning building by a young tough named William Bonney, later known as the famous gunfighter Billy the Kid.  The violence continued until early 1879, when Federal troops arrived to support local law enforcement in returning the area to the rule of law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.024|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains - LINCOLN COUNTY WAR|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Guadalupe Ranger District===\n\nPart of a rugged and remote landscape of mountains and ridges, the 288,540 acre Guadalupe Ranger District begins at the Texas and New Mexico border and follows the spine of the Guadalupe Mountains northwest for nearly 50 miles.  Originally established on April 19, 1907 as the Guadalupe National Forest, with its headquarters in [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]], the area became part of the newly created Alamo National Forest in July 1908, as the Carson Seep Ranger District.  When the Alamo was disestablished in June 1917, the Guadalupe area became part of the Lincoln National Forest, where it was re-designated the Guadalupe Ranger District.\n\nThe district is part of the Guadalupe Mountain range, an exposed area of the Capitan Reef, a Permian-era (251 to 299 million years ago) barrier that partially encircled the Delaware Sea, a 150 mile long and 75 mile wide sea to the south and east.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/gumo/learn/nature/geologicformations.htm|title=Geologic Formations - Guadalupe Mountains National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> \nRunning north-northwest from the more famous Guadalupe and El Capitan peaks on the Texas side of the border, the Guadalupe Ranger District forms the back reef of the northern-most section of the Capitan Reef.  Ranging in elevation from 7500' in the south to 3500' in the north, the district begins at the Texas-New border in a series of steeply-walled canyons before gradually changing into rolling hills and small canyons that run east into the valley of the [[Pecos River]].\n\n===Lookout towers===\n[[File:Monjeau Lookout - Photo by USDA Forest Service.jpg|thumb|left|Monjeau Lookout tower]]\nGiven the importance of fire prevention and fire fighting in the heavily forested areas of the Lincoln National Forest it is not surprising that there have been a number of fire lookout towers constructed on forest lands.  Of the sixteen fire lookout structures once in the forest, 9 are still extant, and six of those are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  The structures range from the unique stone structure of the Montjeau Lookout, a 1930s [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) project in the Smoky Bear Ranger District, to the Sacramento Lookout, a 14x14 live-in cab on a 62-foot high steel tower located west of Cloudcroft, to the 7x7 ft. Dark Canyon Lookout, standing 48 feet over the deep canyons of the southern Guadalupe District above its CCC-constructed observer's cabin and sheds. Most of these Lookouts offer some sort of public access, and two of them, Carissa and Wofford, are under consideration for conversion to rental cabins.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/lincoln/learning/history-culture/?cid=stelprdb5392873</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Mexican_Canyon_Trestle_in_the_snow-PANO.jpg|thumb|Mexican Canyon Trestle outside of Cloudcroft in the snow.]]\nSince the forest encompasses a wide range of environments temperatures vary with elevation. At higher elevations (7,000 feet/2,134 meters and up), summer temperatures range between 40&nbsp;\u00b0F/4&nbsp;\u00b0C (night) to 78&nbsp;\u00b0F/26&nbsp;\u00b0C (day), while winter temperatures can drop to a -15&nbsp;\u00b0F/-26&nbsp;\u00b0C at night and rise to 50&nbsp;\u00b0F/10&nbsp;\u00b0C during the day.  At lower elevations (6,000 to 7,000 feet/1,829 to 2,134 meters), summer temperatures range between 50&nbsp;\u00b0F/10&nbsp;\u00b0C to 85&nbsp;\u00b0F/29&nbsp;\u00b0C, while during the winter, temperatures rarely fall below 0&nbsp;\u00b0F/-18&nbsp;\u00b0C and usually run from teens to 50s (-10&nbsp;\u00b0C to 10&nbsp;\u00b0C).  At the lowest elevations (below 6,000 feet/1,829 meters), temperatures are generally 10&nbsp;\u00b0F/5&nbsp;\u00b0C higher throughout the year.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/lincoln/about-forest</ref>\n\nSpring is the windy season. These high winds dry the forest to the point of extreme fire danger. Fire is a constant threat in the Lincoln National Forest. The fire season usually starts in March or April and continues through mid-July. If the fire danger becomes too high, open fires may be prohibited, and forest areas and roads may be closed. The rainy season begins in July and continues through September, helping to end the immediate fire threat. The first snows fall in late October or early November and can continue for four or five months.  Villages at medium elevations, such as Ruidoso and Capitan, annually receive 30-40 inches of snow, while higher elevations, such as the village of Cloudcroft, often receive 70 inches in a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nm1931|title=CLOUDCROFT, NEW MEXICO - Climate Summary|website=www.wrcc.dri.edu}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nm1927|title=CLOUDCROFT, NEW MEXICO - Climate Summary|website=www.wrcc.dri.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Forest economics==\n\nAlong with preservation and recreation, resource management and use is one of the main principles of the National Forest system.  Initially created, in part, to help regulate the free grazing of livestock, which by the 1880s was leading to a significant loss of resources, one of the oldest uses for the forest area has been grazing.  Over the last one hundred years the use of public lands for grazing has proved to be a stable and consistent addition to the local economy.  As an example, a study by the Cooperative Extension Service at [[New Mexico State University]], demonstrated that between 1970 and 2003 the average number of calves on forest lands was 6,233 head. During the same period, the price per calf at market averaged $530, implying that over the 33-year period livestock grazing rights contributed $3.3 million to the local economy.<ref name=\"nmsu.edu\">http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_ritf/RITF68.pdf</ref>\nAnother major type of resource in the forest is timber, the mighty oak, Ponderosa pine, and fir trees that cover much of the forest area.  The importance of this resource has been known to generations of Natives and settlers, both Mexican and Anglo, as well as by the construction and railroad building industries that helped push Anglo society ever further west, and eventually connected the markets of the East Coast with the resources of the West.  Along with grazing, logging is the oldest economic use of the forest area, and according to the NMSU study, generated an average of $11 million annually from 1970 to 1990 for the economies of the four counties in which the forest is contained.  In terms of total economic impact, the massive diminution of consumptive activities on the Lincoln since 1990 has cost the region $14.7 million in potential revenues, comparable to the estimated income of 930 local residents.<ref name=\"nmsu.edu\"/>\n\nThe third use of forest resources is tourism, or \"dispersed recreation\" as it is referred to by the Forest Service.  Since the extension of rail lines, and later highways, into southern New Mexico in the late 19th/early 20th centuries tourism has been a consistent part of the economics of the Lincoln.  In 2004, the Forest Service's National Visitor Use Monitoring Study (NVUM) showed 735,237 visitors to the forest in that year.  These visitors, multiplied by the estimated cost of an 8-hr Recreational Visitor Day (RVD), calculated as $5.93 in the NMSU study, implied a direct economic impact of 4.6 million, and a total impact of $8.33 million, including direct, indirect, and induced impacts on the region.  While this is a substantial impact on the region, tourism remains the least stable and consistent of the three forest uses, and the one most vulnerable to change, both from local issues, such as fire and drought, and from larger regional or national issues, such as economic instability and high seasonal gasoline prices.<ref name=\"nmsu.edu\"/>\n\nWhile the debates on forest planning and operations are often defined by the tension between these various uses\u2014grazing, logging, and dispersed recreation\u2014studies, such as the NMSU paper quoted above, have shown that no one industry can produce enough economic benefit for the region to offset the loss of revenues implied by the removal of one or both of the other two.<ref name=\"nmsu.edu\"/>\n\n===Firewood collection===\n\nWhile organized commercial logging has been drastically reduced in the forest area since 1990, the public use of the timber and forest resources by the public has continued, mainly in the collection of firewood.  Forest visitors can purchase permits entitling them to collect up to four cords of timber, both \"dead and down\" and \"green standing\" from designated firewood collection areas throughout the forest.  These permits are available at the Forest Headquarters and the three Ranger District offices.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/lincoln/passes-permits/?cid=stelprdb5175964</ref>\n\n===Christmas trees===\n\nAlong with collecting firewood, another long-standing tradition in the Lincoln National Forest is the cutting of Christmas trees during the holiday season.  Permits to harvest Christmas trees can be purchased at the Forest Headquarters or any of the three District Ranger Offices.\n<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/lincoln/passes-permits</ref>\n\n==Recreation==\n\nRanging from the floor of the Chihuahuan Desert to the forested peaks of the Sacramento and White Mountains, the Lincoln National Forest is a popular destination for year-around recreation, offering developed and [[dispersed camping]], group picnic and camping facilities, developed trails for hikers, equestrians, and OHV's, wilderness areas, ski areas, and designated snow play areas.\n\n===Smokey Bear Ranger District===\n\nThe Smokey Bear district has 6 developed family campgrounds and 2 group-camping areas.  Three of these areas, Montjeau, Baca, and Skyline are free, the others are fee areas.  Two areas located at lower elevation, Three Rivers and Baca, are open year-around.  The others, located at higher elevations, generally operate on a May to September schedule, subject to weather.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=34190&actid=29</ref> [[File:Terrain.JPG|thumb|right|View from the Crest Trail, Capitan Wilderness]]\nPicnic areas include Schoolhouse Canyon on the Rio Bonito, and Cedar Creek Picnic Area, which has picnic tables, grills, water, and restrooms.  Cedar Creek also offers a covered group picnic pavilion that can be reserved by groups of less than 40.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/lincoln/recreation/picnickinginfo/?recid=34166&actid=70</ref><ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/picnickinginfo/recarea/?recid=34244&actid=70</ref>\nThe district has over 50 hiking trails of varying lengths and all difficulty levels.  The majority of these trails are less than three miles in length and are located within the two designated wilderness areas.  Longer backpacking trails include the 20-mile long Crest Trail (T25) in the White Mountain Wilderness and the 11.1 mile long South Base Trail (T57 ) in the Capitan Wilderness.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=34190&actid=50</ref>\n\n===Sacramento Ranger District===\n\nThe most heavily developed of the three ranger districts, the Sacramento district has 10 developed campgrounds and 5 group-camping sites.  Three areas, James Canyon, Upper Karr Canyon, and Lower Karr Canyon are free.  Upper Karr is open year-round, while the others are generally open from May to September, weather permitting.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=34168&actid=29</ref> Popular day-use picnic sites include the Trestle Recreation Area near Cloudcroft, and Bluff Springs, a partially developed area near a scenic waterfall. \n<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=40310&actid=51</ref> \n[[File:Train Depot Cloudcroft New Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|Train depot replica at Trestle Recreation Area.]]\nThere are more than 50 trails within the district to challenge hikers of all skill levels.  Many of these trails explore small canyons, lead to natural features, such as waterfalls and springs, and follow the abandoned beds of the railroads that once hauled timber from the high forests down the desert floor.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=34168&actid=51</ref>\nWhile the majority of these trails are shorter than 3 miles in length, the Sacramento district has several long multi-day backpacking trails, including the 29-mile long Rim Trail (T105).  The district also includes the 5-mile long Dog Canyon National Recreation Trail, which begins immediately west of the forest in [[Oliver Lee Memorial State Park]], south of [[Alamogordo]] and climbs over 2000' to the heart of the forest.\n\n===Guadalupe Ranger District===\n\nThe most remote of the three ranger districts, the Guadalupe district only has one developed facility, Sitting Bull Falls Picnic Area.  An oasis in the desert located approximately 20 miles west of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]], Sitting Bull Falls has covered picnic tables, fire grills, water, restrooms, and access to a number of trails, including a .5 mile trail (T68A) to the 150-ft. Sitting Bull Falls.  This is a day-use facility only, with no camping allowed.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recarea/?recid=34238</ref> [[File:Sitting Bull Falls Day Use Area.jpg|Sitting Bull Falls Picnic Area|thumb|right]]\nThe district has 23 developed trails, most of which are 3 miles in length or less.  These trails can be found in all parts of the district, from the deep canyons in the south to the rolling hills further north and range from easy to difficult.\n<ref name=\"usda.gov\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recarea/?recid=34220</ref>\nThe majority of these trails are also open to pack and service animals.  Neither mechanized or motorized vehicles are allowed on the trails in the Guadalupe district, though OHV's are allowed on most forest roads.  Scenic drives in the district include an approximately 50-mile trip west from Carlsbad on N.M. 137 to 5 Points Vista, a scenic overlook with views of the Guadalupe Mountains and the Rim, the 1500' - 2000' cliff that extends the entire north-south length of the district and which marks the western edge of the Guadalupe range.\n<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/scenicdrivinginfo/recarea/?recid=79402&actid=105</ref>\n\n===Wilderness areas===\n\nThe Lincoln is home to a pair of designated wilderness areas, the [[Capitan Mountains Wilderness]] and the [[White Mountain Wilderness]], both located in the Smoky Bear Ranger District.\n\n====Capitan Mountains Wilderness====\nThe [[Capitan Mountains Wilderness]] was created as part of the [[New Mexico Wilderness Act of 1980]] (Public law 96-550), passed in December 1980, which placed 34,000 acres of public lands in the rugged mountains north of [[Lincoln, New Mexico|Lincoln]] and north-east of [[Capitan, New Mexico|Capitan]] into the National Wilderness Preservation System.<ref name=\"Wilderness.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.net/|title=Wilderness.net|website=Wilderness.net}}</ref>\nProtecting a rare (for New Mexico) east-west mountain range,  the Capitan Mountains Wilderness measures 12 miles long and from two to six miles wide.  Elevations range from about 5,500 feet to 10,083 feet at the top of Capitan Peak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/wildView?WID=97&tab=General|title=Wilderness.net - Capitan Mountains Wilderness - General Information|website=Wilderness.net}}</ref>\nBecause of the rugged nature of the area there are few trail heads into the wilderness and those require the use of a 4-wheel drive, high-clearance vehicle.<ref name=\"usda.gov1\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/attmain/lincoln/specialplaces</ref>\n\n====White Mountain Wilderness====\nThe [[White Mountain Wilderness]] was created in 1964 as part of the bill (Public Law 88-577) that created the [[National Wilderness Preservation System]].  Originally protecting 28,118 acres NW of [[Ruidoso]], the size of the wilderness area was increased by 16,860 acres in 1980.\n<ref name=\"Wilderness.net\"/>\nBeginning on the northern border of the Mescalero Apache Reservation west of Sierra Blanca Peak, the wilderness follows the main ridge of the White Mountains (Sierra Blanca in Spanish) north 12.5 miles.  Ranging from 4\u201312 miles in width the wilderness also includes numerous side canyons and a few year-round streams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/wildView?WID=649|title=Wilderness.net - White Mountain Wilderness - General Information|website=Wilderness.net}}</ref>\nPassenger vehicles can access the over 50 trails in the wilderness from the Three Rivers, Nogal Canyon, Crest and Mill's trailheads.  Other trail heads can be accessed by 4-wheel, high-clearance vehicles.<ref name=\"usda.gov1\"/>\n\nAs with all designated wilderness areas mechanized and motorized vehicles are prohibited in the White Mountains and Capitan Mountains Wildernesses.  Access can only be by foot or horse.<ref name=\"Wilderness.net\"/>\nTotally undeveloped, these areas have no amenities and require hikers and backpackers to practice \"Leave No Trace\" camping techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/LNT|title=Wilderness.net - Principals of Leave No Trace|website=Wilderness.net}}</ref>\n\n===Dispersed camping===\n\nMany areas of the Lincoln National Forest are open to [[dispersed camping]], meaning that visitors are allowed to drive up to 300' from public roads onto forest lands for camping.  This type of primitive camping is free and does not require a permit.  Since these are undeveloped areas there is no water, restrooms, or other amenities.  Not all forest lands are open to dispersed camping, so visitors should consult the current Motor Vehicle Use Map for the specific Ranger District to find eligible areas. Popular areas for dispersed camping are the Upper Bonito Dispersed Camping Area, NW of Ruidoso in the Smokey Bear Ranger District and Lower Karr Canyon in the Sacramento R.D. south of Cloudcroft.\n<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/lincoln/recreation/camping-cabins/?recid=34166&actid=34</ref>\n\n===Equestrian and mountain-biking trails===\n\nWhile there are no designated equestrian campgrounds, pack and saddle animals are allowed on the vast majority of trails within the forest.  Mountain bikes are permitted on most of the trails in the Sacramento district, as well as 10+ trails in the Smokey Bear district.  Mechanized vehicles are not permitted on any trail in the Guadalupe district.<ref name=\"usda.gov\"/>\n\n===OHVs===\n\nThe roads and developed trails of the Lincoln National Forest are popular areas for Off-Highway Vehicles (OHVs), such as motorcycles and ATVs.  All three districts allow OHVs less than 50\" wide on designated forest service roads.  Riders should consult the current Motor Vehicle User Map to see which forest roads are open to OHVs.  There are also a large number of trails open to OHVs in both the Sacramento and Smokey Bear Ranger Districts, including the last 28 miles of the Rim Trail (T105).  All trails in the Guadalupe Ranger District are closed to motorized vehicles.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/lincoln/recreation/ohv/?recid=34166&actid=93</ref>\n\n===Winter activities===\n[[File:Ski Apache.jpg|thumb|left|Ski Apache ski area, Smokey Bear Ranger District]]\nWinter in southern New Mexico brings new recreational opportunities to all parts of the Lincoln National Forest from the dry, desert lowlands to the snowy, high mountain areas.  Snow skiing and snowboarding is available at Ski Apache, a Mescalero Apache-owned resort on Sierra Blanca, in the Smokey Brar Ranger District approximately 15 miles west of Ruidoso.  The Upper Karr Canyon Area near Cloudcroft is designated for snow sledding and tubing, and two trails, the 1.9 mile Fir Trail (T122) and the 2.8 mile Little Apache Trail (T124) are maintained in winter as cross-country skiing trails.  These trails can be accessed from the Silver Overflow Campground in the Sacramento Ranger District, near Cloudcroft.  For campers, the Three Rivers and Baca campgrounds in the Smokey Bear district and the Upper Karr Canyon site in the Sacramento district are open year-round.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/lincoln/recreation/wintersports</ref>\n\n==Location and access==\n\n===Towns and cities===\nThe following towns and villages lie within the bounds of the Lincoln National Forest:\n* [[Cloudcroft, New Mexico]]\n* [[High Rolls, New Mexico]]\n* [[Mayhill, New Mexico]]\n* [[Ruidoso, New Mexico]]\n* [[Ruidoso Downs, New Mexico]]\n* [[Sacramento, New Mexico]]\n* [[Sunspot, New Mexico]]\n* [[Timberon, New Mexico]]\n* [[Queen, New Mexico]]\n* [[Capitan, New Mexico]]\n* [[Lincoln, New Mexico]]\n\nLarger cities near the Forest include:\n*[[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]\n*[[Carlsbad, New Mexico]]\n*[[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]\n*[[El Paso, Texas]]\n\n===Transportation===\n\n====Airports====\n* [[Sierra Blanca Regional Airport]], located about 15 miles (24&nbsp;km)northwest of [[Ruidoso, New Mexico|Ruidoso]]\n\n====Major highways====\nThe following major highways traverse the Lincoln National Forest:\n* [[U.S. Route 70 in New Mexico|U.S. Route 70]]\n* [[U.S. Route 82]]\n* [[U.S. Route 380]]\n* [[New Mexico State Highway 37|NM 37]]\n* [[New Mexico State Highway 48|NM 48]]\n\n==Nearby attractions==\nThe Lincoln National Forest is only one of many public lands in the south-central region of New Mexico.  Immediately west of the Sacramento Ranger District is [[White Sands National Park]], known to millions for its shifting ocean of fine, white gypsum sand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/whsa/index.htm|title=White Sands National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> A small section of the enormous dune field, located west of Alamogordo on U.S. 70, White Sands offers dune field access, picnic sites, and primitive camping.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/eatingsleeping.htm|title=Eating & Sleeping - White Sands National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\nSouth of Alamagordo is [[Oliver Lee Memorial State Park]], a New Mexico state park on the canyon floor west of the Sacramento Mountains.  A full service park with both tent and RV camping, group camping and group picnic areas, Oliver Lee is also the trailhead for the Dog Canyon Trail, which climbs 2000' into the forested mountains of the Sacramento District.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/spd/oliverleestatepark.html|title=Oliver Lee Memorial State Park New Mexico|website=www.emnrd.state.nm.us}}</ref> \nWest of White Sands and approximately 70 miles west of Alamogordo is the recently created [[Organ Mountains\u2013Desert Peaks National Monument]], a unit of the [[Bureau of Land Management]] created to protect the jagged Organ Mountains on the eastern outskirts of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]].<ref>https://www.blm.gov/nlcs_web/sites/nm/st/en/prog/NLCS/OMDP_NM.html</ref> Though a newer park, the area does contains a camp ground and trail heads for day hikes into the mountains.<ref>https://www.blm.gov/nlcs_web/sites/nm/st/en/prog/NLCS/OMDP_NM/omdp_recreational.html</ref>\n\nSouth of the Guadalupe District and west of Carlsbad lies two renowned national parks, [[Carlsbad Caverns]] and [[Guadalupe Mountains]] National Parks.  Located on U.S. 62/180 approx. 30 miles west of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]], [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]] is a world-famous site for exploring both developed and undeveloped caves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/cave/index.htm|title=Carlsbad Caverns National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> Primarily a day-use area, the park does have limited opportunities for backpacking on the high ridges west of the cavern's entrance.  Immediately west of Carlsbad Caverns, on the Texas side of the border, is [[Guadalupe Mountains National Park]].  Established in 1970, GMNP protects Guadalupe Peak and El Capitan, the two tallest mountains in the state, as well as scenic McKittrick Canyon, known for its fall colors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/gumo/index.htm|title=Guadalupe Mountains National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> A favorite destination for hikers and backpackers, GMNP has a number of trails for both day hikes and backpacking.  Shorter trips lead to a number of historical areas, such as the Butterfield Stagecoach station near Pine Springs, while longer treks climb high into the mountains and far into the adjacent salt-flats.  One of the more popular hikes is the 4.5 mile trail to the top of Guadalupe Peak, where decades of climbers have signed the register book at the summit.  A number of semi-developed back-country campsites make possible a wide range of multi-day trips.  For campers, GMNP has two developed campgrounds, one at Pine Springs, near the park headquarters on U.S. 62/180 and Dog Canyon, on the New Mexico side, approximately 70 miles west of Carlsbad.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/gumo/eatingsleeping.htm|title=Eating & Sleeping - Guadalupe Mountains National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Lincoln National Forest}}\n* [[Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation]]\n* [[Alamo National Forest]]\n* [[Sacramento National Forest]]\n* [[Guadalupe National Forest]]\n* [[Smokey Bear]]\n* [[Lincoln County War]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/lincoln/ Lincoln National Forest]\n*[http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/wildView?WID=649&tab=General White Mountains Wilderness]\n*[http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/wildView?WID=97 Capitan Mountains Wilderness]\n*[http://www.discoverruidoso.com Village of Ruidoso Tourism Office]\n*[http://cloudcroft.com/?mobiswitch=deskop Cloudcroft Online]\n*[http://www.skiapache.com/summer/ Ski Apache]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Protected areas of New Mexico}}\n{{National Forests of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:National Forests of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Chaves County, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Eddy County, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Lincoln County, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Otero County, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Alamogordo, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Lincoln National Forest| ]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 1902]]\n[[Category:1902 establishments in New Mexico Territory]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox protected area \n| name = Lincoln National Forest\n| photo = Terrain.JPG\n| photo_caption = Lincoln National Forest - view from Crest Trail\n| map = USA\n| relief = 1\n| map_caption = \n| location = [[New Mexico]], United States\n| nearest_city = [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo, NM]]\n| coordinates = {{coord|32.834|N|105.697|W|region:US|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| coords_ref = \n| area = {{convert|1103897|acre|km2}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Land Areas of the National Forest System |publisher=U.S. Forest Service |date=January 2012 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/land/staff/lar/LAR2011/LAR2011_Book_A5.pdf |accessdate=June 26, 2012}}</ref>\n| established = July 26, 1902<ref>{{cite web|title=The National Forests of the United States |publisher=ForestHistory.org |url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Places/National%20Forests%20of%20the%20U.S.pdf |accessdate=July 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EaRGckIT?url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/places/National%20Forests%20of%20the%20U.S.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2013 }}</ref>\n| visitation_num = \n| visitation_year = \n| governing_body = [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]]\n| website = [http://www.fs.usda.gov/lincoln/ Lincoln National Forest]\n}}\n\n'''Lincoln National Forest''' is a unit of the [[U.S. Forest Service]] located in southern [[New Mexico]].  Established by Presidential Proclamation in 1902 as the Lincoln Forest Preserve, the {{convert|1103897|acre|km2}} forest begins near the Texas border and contains lands in parts of [[Chaves County, New Mexico|Chaves]], [[Eddy County, New Mexico|Eddy]], [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln]], and [[Otero County, New Mexico|Otero]] counties.  The three Ranger Districts within the forest contain all or part of four mountain ranges, and include a variety of different environmental areas, from desert to heavily forested mountains and sub-alpine grasslands.  Established to balance conservation, resource management, and recreation, the lands of the Lincoln National Forest include important local timber resources, protected wilderness areas, and popular recreation and winter sports areas.  The forest headquarters is located in [[Alamogordo]], N.M. with local offices in [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]], [[Cloudcroft]], and [[Ruidoso]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe modern Lincoln National Forest traces its origins to several different forest reserves and national forests designated in the 1902-1908 period.  These included the Lincoln Forest Preserve, a 545,256 acre area established July 26, 1902 around Capitan and Lincoln, the 78,480 acre Gallinas Forest Preserve established on November 5, 1906 in the Gallinas Mountains west of Gallinas, the [[Guadalupe National Forest]], established April 19, 1907 in the mountains along the Texas border, and the [[Sacramento National Forest]], created on April 24, 1907 to preserve the forested heights of the Sacramento Mountains near Alamogordo.  Scattered throughout south-central New Mexico, these individual units contained lands in the Guadalupe, Sacramento, Sierra Blanca/White Mountains, Capitan and Gallinas ranges, and encompassed environments from the desert shrubs at the floor of the Chihuahuan Desert through forests of Pi\u00f1on, Pine and Juniper to sub-alpine grasslands above the tree-line.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/lincoln/learning/nature-science</ref>\n\nThe process of integrating these individual units into a single, unified National Forest began in July 1908, when President Theodore Roosevelt signed Executive Order 908, which combined a number of national forests in the Southwestern states into larger units. One of the first foresters was Arthur Ringland who later founded the international relief organization, CARE.<ref>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cuming_Ringland</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} One element of this order was to add the [[Gallinas National Forest]], a tract of land around the Gallinas Mountains west of [[Corona]] to the existing Lincoln National Forest.  Another element of Roosevelt's Executive Order that would have a great impact on the development of the Lincoln National Forest was the decision to combine the existing Guadalupe and Sacramento National Forests into the [[Alamo National Forest]].  A wholly new administrative unit, the Alamo National Forest was headquartered in [[Alamogordo]] and led by inaugural Forest Supervisor Arthur M. Neal.\n\nNearly nine years later, on June 6, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson signed an Executive order that transferred the lands of the Alamo National Forest to the control of the Lincoln National Forest.  As a result of this order, the main elements of the Alamo National Forest, the public lands around the Sacramento and Guadalupe Mountains, were transferred to the Lincoln, greatly expanding its size.  The last major change in the Forest's boundaries came in 1945, when administrative control of the former Gallinas National Forest was transferred from the Lincoln to the sprawling [[Cibola National Forest]].  Officially transferred in 1958.  the Gallinas area was renamed the Mountainair Ranger District, with its headquarters in [[Mountainair]].\n\n==The forest==\nThe modern Lincoln National Forest is composed of three separate units, the Smokey Bear Ranger District, headquartered in [[Ruidoso]], the Sacramento Ranger District, headquartered in [[Cloudcroft]], and the Guadalupe Ranger District, with its headquarters in [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]]. \n[[File:Lincoln National Forest headquarters building.jpg|thumb|right|Forest Headquarters, Alamogordo, N.M.]]\n\n===Sacramento Ranger District===\n\nOriginally established April 24, 1907 as the Sacramento National Forest, the heavily forested southern Sacramento Mountains, east of [[Alamogordo]], were combined with the Guadalupe National Forest to form the Alamo National Forest in July 1908.  One of the two major elements of the new forest, the former Sacramento National Forest was divided into a number of smaller ranger districts within the larger unit.  These included the La Luz, Mayhill, and Weed Ranger Districts, all of which administered lands around their respective villages.  On June 6, 1917, these lands became part of the Lincoln National Forest, when their parent organization, the Alamo National Forest was disestablished.  As a result of this order, some areas of the former Sacramento National Forest, like La Luz Ranger District, lost their independent status, others were renamed, such as the Fresnal district, which became the Cloudcroft Ranger District, and others, like Mayhill and Weed, retained their original names and designations.<ref name=\"foresthistory.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Publications/region/3/early_days/3/appe.htm|title=The Early Days: A Sourcebook of Southwestern Region History \u2014 Book 3 (Appendix E)|website=www.foresthistory.org|access-date=2017-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811223811/http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Publications/region/3/early_days/3/appe.htm|archive-date=2017-08-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 1961, the Cloudcroft, Mayhill and Weed Ranger Districts were consolidated and given their current designation, the Sacramento Ranger District of the Lincoln National Forest.<ref name=\"foresthistory.org\"/>\n\nRising high above the gypsum sands of [[White Sands National Park]] and the city of Alamogordo, the Sacramento district encompasses much of the southern half of the Sacramento Mountains.  Located immediately south of the [[Mescalero Apache Reservation]], which covers the northern half of the mountains, the district is primarily composed of Douglas Fir, Ponderosa pine, aspen, and oak, as well as numerous creeks and waterfalls.  The district is traversed east-west by that section of [[U.S. 82]] between [[Artesia, New Mexico|Artesia]] and [[Alamogordo]], which goes through the villages of Cloudcroft and Mayhill.  Other roads include New Mexico State Road 6563, also known as the Sunspot Scenic Byway, which runs between Cloudcroft and the village of Sunspot, and NM 244, which exits the district north of Cloudcroft and enters the Mescalero Apache Reservation.\n\n====Trestle====\n[[File:Mexican Canyon Trestle from the lookout (5032007085).jpg|thumb|left|Wood railroad trestle across Mexican Canyon]]\nA heavily forested area in an otherwise arid environment, the Sacramento Mountains have long been used for timber harvesting.  To expedite the transport of timber to processing facilities and markets, the Alamogordo and Sacramento Mountain Railway was constructed in 1898 by the El Paso and Northeastern Railway, a short-line railroad that connected El Paso, Texas and Alamogordo.  A genuine engineering marvel, the Alamogordo and Sacramento Mountain Railway climbed 4,747 feet over 32 miles of track, and included numerous switchbacks, trestles, and grades as high as 6.4%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Publications/region/3/lincoln/cultres4/sec1.htm|title=Logging Railroads of the Lincoln National Forest, New Mexico (Historic Overview)|website=www.foresthistory.org}}</ref> Though the track was removed in 1948, evidence of the railroad is visible throughout the district.  The most visible remnant of the railroad is the 320 foot trestle over Mexican Canyon near Cloudcroft.  Crossing 52 feet above the canyon floor the trestle can be seen from vista points on U.S. 82 and by a number of short trails beginning at the Trestle Recreation Area, a day-use facility on the western edge of Cloudcroft.\n<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5404319.pdf</ref>\n\n====Sunspot Observatory====\n\nThe high mountains of the Sacramentos are also home to the National Solar Observatory's Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope, considered the world's premier high resolution optical solar telescope at the time of its inauguration in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsosp.nso.edu/dst|title=Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope - NSO - Sacramento Peak|website=nsosp.nso.edu}}</ref>\nLocated in the southern end of the district, the observatory is open to the public on a seasonal basis and can be accessed by the scenic New Mexico State Road 6563, also known as the Sunspot Scenic Byway, a two-lane paved road that travels the 15.5 miles between Cloudcroft and the village of Sunspot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sangres.com/newmexico/scenic-byways/sunspot-scenic-byway.htm#.WTGK5b9TKCg|title=Sunspot Scenic Byway|website=www.sangres.com}}</ref>\n[[File:Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope (5508694434).jpg|thumb|right|Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope, Sunspot, N.M.]]\n\n===Smokey Bear District===\nPart of the original Forest Preserve established in 1902, the modern Smokey Bear Ranger District administers lands north of Capitan and Lincoln, in the Capitan Mountains, and south of Capitan to Ruidoso, immediately east of the Sierra Blanca or White Mountains.  The area was initially divided into the Baca Ranch Ranger District, renamed the Capitan District in February 1919, along the Rio Bonito north of Lincoln, and the Mesa and Ruidoso Ranger Districts further south.  The Mesa and Ruidoso districts were combined in October 1929 into the White Mountain Ranger District, a designation that lasted until 1952 when both areas resumed their original names.  All of these areas were combined in 1960 and given their current designation, the Smokey Bear Ranger District.\n\n423,416 acres in size, and ranging in elevation from 5,400 to 11,580 feet in the Capitan Mountains, the Smoky Bear district embraces a number of different environments, and includes desert shrubs, forests of pinyon pine, juniper, and spruce, and high-elevation grasslands above the treeline.  The area also includes the Forest's two designated Wilderness Areas and one of the two ski areas, Ski Apache near Ruidoso.  The district can be reached via U.S. 70, which traverses much of the southern part of the district and passes through the village of Ruidoso.  Another highway, U.S. 380, crosses a thin stretch of public lands east of Carrizozo and crosses through Capitan and Lincoln.\n\n====Smokey Bear====\n\nOne of the most enduring of stories to come out of the long history of the forest is the tale of the real-life Smokey Bear, a bear cub rescued from the devastated forest after the Capitan Gap fire of 1950.  Rescued from a burnt tree by either a New Mexico Department of Game and Fish ranger or a group of soldiers from nearby Fort Bliss seconded to fight the blaze, the cub was flown to Santa Fe by New Mexico Ranger Ray Bell for treatment of burns and other injuries.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/SFD/SmokeyBear/SmokeyBeartheLivingSymbol.html|title=EMNRD Forestry Division|website=www.emnrd.state.nm.us}}</ref>\nThe bear was eventually named Smokey Bear, after the Forest Service's symbol of fire safety on public lands, which had been created in 1944 by artist Harry Rossol.  Now the living symbol of fire awareness and prevention, Smokey Bear was flown to the National Zoo in Washington D.C.  The subject of hundreds of thousands of visitors and letters, the bear lived at the zoo until his death in 1976.  Eulogized by the [[Washington Post]] as a transplanted New Mexico native with many years of government service, Smokey Bear was returned to his native land and buried near Capitan in November 1976. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://smokeybear.com/en/smokeys-history/story-of-smokey|title=Story of Smokey - Smokey Bear|website=smokeybear.com}}</ref>\n\n====Lincoln County War====\n\n[[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]], in which much of the district is located, was the site of the 1878-79 [[Lincoln County War]], a complex and bloody struggle between ranchers, bankers, politicians, and hired gunmen for control of the County.  One of the major events in the war took place in the village of Lincoln itself, when forces supporting Sheriff George W. Peppin besieged the house of merchant Alexander McSween over several days while soldiers from nearby Fort Stanton stood by.  McSween was killed by gunfire, but a number of his supporters, known as \"regulators,\" escaped, led from the burning building by a young tough named William Bonney, later known as the famous gunfighter Billy the Kid.  The violence continued until early 1879, when Federal troops arrived to support local law enforcement in returning the area to the rule of law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.war.024|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains - LINCOLN COUNTY WAR|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Guadalupe Ranger District===\n\nPart of a rugged and remote landscape of mountains and ridges, the 288,540 acre Guadalupe Ranger District begins at the Texas and New Mexico border and follows the spine of the Guadalupe Mountains northwest for nearly 50 miles.  Originally established on April 19, 1907 as the Guadalupe National Forest, with its headquarters in [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]], the area became part of the newly created Alamo National Forest in July 1908, as the Carson Seep Ranger District.  When the Alamo was disestablished in June 1917, the Guadalupe area became part of the Lincoln National Forest, where it was re-designated the Guadalupe Ranger District.\n\nThe district is part of the Guadalupe Mountain range, an exposed area of the Capitan Reef, a Permian-era (251 to 299 million years ago) barrier that partially encircled the Delaware Sea, a 150 mile long and 75 mile wide sea to the south and east.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/gumo/learn/nature/geologicformations.htm|title=Geologic Formations - Guadalupe Mountains National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> \nRunning north-northwest from the more famous Guadalupe and El Capitan peaks on the Texas side of the border, the Guadalupe Ranger District forms the back reef of the northern-most section of the Capitan Reef.  Ranging in elevation from 7500' in the south to 3500' in the north, the district begins at the Texas-New border in a series of steeply-walled canyons before gradually changing into rolling hills and small canyons that run east into the valley of the [[Pecos River]].\n\n===Lookout towers===\n[[File:Monjeau Lookout - Photo by USDA Forest Service.jpg|thumb|left|Monjeau Lookout tower]]\nGiven the importance of fire prevention and fire fighting in the heavily forested areas of the Lincoln National Forest it is not surprising that there have been a number of fire lookout towers constructed on forest lands.  Of the sixteen fire lookout structures once in the forest, 9 are still extant, and six of those are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  The structures range from the unique stone structure of the Montjeau Lookout, a 1930s [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) project in the Smoky Bear Ranger District, to the Sacramento Lookout, a 14x14 live-in cab on a 62-foot high steel tower located west of Cloudcroft, to the 7x7 ft. Dark Canyon Lookout, standing 48 feet over the deep canyons of the southern Guadalupe District above its CCC-constructed observer's cabin and sheds. Most of these Lookouts offer some sort of public access, and two of them, Carissa and Wofford, are under consideration for conversion to rental cabins.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/lincoln/learning/history-culture/?cid=stelprdb5392873</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Mexican_Canyon_Trestle_in_the_snow-PANO.jpg|thumb|Mexican Canyon Trestle outside of Cloudcroft in the snow.]]\nSince the forest encompasses a wide range of environments temperatures vary with elevation. At higher elevations (7,000 feet/2,134 meters and up), summer temperatures range between 40&nbsp;\u00b0F/4&nbsp;\u00b0C (night) to 78&nbsp;\u00b0F/26&nbsp;\u00b0C (day), while winter temperatures can drop to a -15&nbsp;\u00b0F/-26&nbsp;\u00b0C at night and rise to 50&nbsp;\u00b0F/10&nbsp;\u00b0C during the day.  At lower elevations (6,000 to 7,000 feet/1,829 to 2,134 meters), summer temperatures range between 50&nbsp;\u00b0F/10&nbsp;\u00b0C to 85&nbsp;\u00b0F/29&nbsp;\u00b0C, while during the winter, temperatures rarely fall below 0&nbsp;\u00b0F/-18&nbsp;\u00b0C and usually run from teens to 50s (-10&nbsp;\u00b0C to 10&nbsp;\u00b0C).  At the lowest elevations (below 6,000 feet/1,829 meters), temperatures are generally 10&nbsp;\u00b0F/5&nbsp;\u00b0C higher throughout the year.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/lincoln/about-forest</ref>\n\nSpring is the windy season. These high winds dry the forest to the point of extreme fire danger. Fire is a constant threat in the Lincoln National Forest. The fire season usually starts in March or April and continues through mid-July. If the fire danger becomes too high, open fires may be prohibited, and forest areas and roads may be closed. The rainy season begins in July and continues through September, helping to end the immediate fire threat. The first snows fall in late October or early November and can continue for four or five months.  Villages at medium elevations, such as Ruidoso and Capitan, annually receive 30-40 inches of snow, while higher elevations, such as the village of Cloudcroft, often receive 70 inches in a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nm1931|title=CLOUDCROFT, NEW MEXICO - Climate Summary|website=www.wrcc.dri.edu}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nm1927|title=CLOUDCROFT, NEW MEXICO - Climate Summary|website=www.wrcc.dri.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Forest economics==\n\nAlong with preservation and recreation, resource management and use is one of the main principles of the National Forest system.  Initially created, in part, to help regulate the free grazing of livestock, which by the 1880s was leading to a significant loss of resources, one of the oldest uses for the forest area has been grazing.  Over the last one hundred years the use of public lands for grazing has proved to be a stable and consistent addition to the local economy.  As an example, a study by the Cooperative Extension Service at [[New Mexico State University]], demonstrated that between 1970 and 2003 the average number of calves on forest lands was 6,233 head. During the same period, the price per calf at market averaged $530, implying that over the 33-year period livestock grazing rights contributed $3.3 million to the local economy.<ref name=\"nmsu.edu\">http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_ritf/RITF68.pdf</ref>\nAnother major type of resource in the forest is timber, the mighty oak, Ponderosa pine, and fir trees that cover much of the forest area.  The importance of this resource has been known to generations of Natives and settlers, both Mexican and Anglo, as well as by the construction and railroad building industries that helped push Anglo society ever further west, and eventually connected the markets of the East Coast with the resources of the West.  Along with grazing, logging is the oldest economic use of the forest area, and according to the NMSU study, generated an average of $11 million annually from 1970 to 1990 for the economies of the four counties in which the forest is contained.  In terms of total economic impact, the massive diminution of consumptive activities on the Lincoln since 1990 has cost the region $14.7 million in potential revenues, comparable to the estimated income of 930 local residents.<ref name=\"nmsu.edu\"/>\n\nThe third use of forest resources is tourism, or \"dispersed recreation\" as it is referred to by the Forest Service.  Since the extension of rail lines, and later highways, into southern New Mexico in the late 19th/early 20th centuries tourism has been a consistent part of the economics of the Lincoln.  In 2004, the Forest Service's National Visitor Use Monitoring Study (NVUM) showed 735,237 visitors to the forest in that year.  These visitors, multiplied by the estimated cost of an 8-hr Recreational Visitor Day (RVD), calculated as $5.93 in the NMSU study, implied a direct economic impact of 4.6 million, and a total impact of $8.33 million, including direct, indirect, and induced impacts on the region.  While this is a substantial impact on the region, tourism remains the least stable and consistent of the three forest uses, and the one most vulnerable to change, both from local issues, such as fire and drought, and from larger regional or national issues, such as economic instability and high seasonal gasoline prices.<ref name=\"nmsu.edu\"/>\n\nWhile the debates on forest planning and operations are often defined by the tension between these various uses\u2014grazing, logging, and dispersed recreation\u2014studies, such as the NMSU paper quoted above, have shown that no one industry can produce enough economic benefit for the region to offset the loss of revenues implied by the removal of one or both of the other two.<ref name=\"nmsu.edu\"/>\n\n===Firewood collection===\n\nWhile organized commercial logging has been drastically reduced in the forest area since 1990, the public use of the timber and forest resources by the public has continued, mainly in the collection of firewood.  Forest visitors can purchase permits entitling them to collect up to four cords of timber, both \"dead and down\" and \"green standing\" from designated firewood collection areas throughout the forest.  These permits are available at the Forest Headquarters and the three Ranger District offices.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/lincoln/passes-permits/?cid=stelprdb5175964</ref>\n\n===Christmas trees===\n\nAlong with collecting firewood, another long-standing tradition in the Lincoln National Forest is the cutting of Christmas trees during the holiday season.  Permits to harvest Christmas trees can be purchased at the Forest Headquarters or any of the three District Ranger Offices.\n<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/lincoln/passes-permits</ref>\n\n==Recreation==\n\nRanging from the floor of the Chihuahuan Desert to the forested peaks of the Sacramento and White Mountains, the Lincoln National Forest is a popular destination for year-around recreation, offering developed and [[dispersed camping]], group picnic and camping facilities, developed trails for hikers, equestrians, and OHV's, wilderness areas, ski areas, and designated snow play areas.\n\n===Smokey Bear Ranger District===\n\nThe Smokey Bear district has 6 developed family campgrounds and 2 group-camping areas.  Three of these areas, Montjeau, Baca, and Skyline are free, the others are fee areas.  Two areas located at lower elevation, Three Rivers and Baca, are open year-around.  The others, located at higher elevations, generally operate on a May to September schedule, subject to weather.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=34190&actid=29</ref> [[File:Terrain.JPG|thumb|right|View from the Crest Trail, Capitan Wilderness]]\nPicnic areas include Schoolhouse Canyon on the Rio Bonito, and Cedar Creek Picnic Area, which has picnic tables, grills, water, and restrooms.  Cedar Creek also offers a covered group picnic pavilion that can be reserved by groups of less than 40.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/lincoln/recreation/picnickinginfo/?recid=34166&actid=70</ref><ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/picnickinginfo/recarea/?recid=34244&actid=70</ref>\nThe district has over 50 hiking trails of varying lengths and all difficulty levels.  The majority of these trails are less than three miles in length and are located within the two designated wilderness areas.  Longer backpacking trails include the 20-mile long Crest Trail (T25) in the White Mountain Wilderness and the 11.1 mile long South Base Trail (T57 ) in the Capitan Wilderness.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=34190&actid=50</ref>\n\n===Sacramento Ranger District===\n\nThe most heavily developed of the three ranger districts, the Sacramento district has 10 developed campgrounds and 5 group-camping sites.  Three areas, James Canyon, Upper Karr Canyon, and Lower Karr Canyon are free.  Upper Karr is open year-round, while the others are generally open from May to September, weather permitting.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=34168&actid=29</ref> Popular day-use picnic sites include the Trestle Recreation Area near Cloudcroft, and Bluff Springs, a partially developed area near a scenic waterfall. \n<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=40310&actid=51</ref> \n[[File:Train Depot Cloudcroft New Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|Train depot replica at Trestle Recreation Area.]]\nThere are more than 50 trails within the district to challenge hikers of all skill levels.  Many of these trails explore small canyons, lead to natural features, such as waterfalls and springs, and follow the abandoned beds of the railroads that once hauled timber from the high forests down the desert floor.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=34168&actid=51</ref>\nWhile the majority of these trails are shorter than 3 miles in length, the Sacramento district has several long multi-day backpacking trails, including the 29-mile long Rim Trail (T105).  The district also includes the 5-mile long Dog Canyon National Recreation Trail, which begins immediately west of the forest in [[Oliver Lee Memorial State Park]], south of [[Alamogordo]] and climbs over 2000' to the heart of the forest.\n\n===Guadalupe Ranger District===\n\nThe most remote of the three ranger districts, the Guadalupe district only has one developed facility, Sitting Bull Falls Picnic Area.  An oasis in the desert located approximately 20 miles west of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]], Sitting Bull Falls has covered picnic tables, fire grills, water, restrooms, and access to a number of trails, including a .5 mile trail (T68A) to the 150-ft. Sitting Bull Falls.  This is a day-use facility only, with no camping allowed.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recarea/?recid=34238</ref> [[File:Sitting Bull Falls Day Use Area.jpg|Sitting Bull Falls Picnic Area|thumb|right]]\nThe district has 23 developed trails, most of which are 3 miles in length or less.  These trails can be found in all parts of the district, from the deep canyons in the south to the rolling hills further north and range from easy to difficult.\n<ref name=\"usda.gov\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recarea/?recid=34220</ref>\nThe majority of these trails are also open to pack and service animals.  Neither mechanized or motorized vehicles are allowed on the trails in the Guadalupe district, though OHV's are allowed on most forest roads.  Scenic drives in the district include an approximately 50-mile trip west from Carlsbad on N.M. 137 to 5 Points Vista, a scenic overlook with views of the Guadalupe Mountains and the Rim, the 1500' - 2000' cliff that extends the entire north-south length of the district and which marks the western edge of the Guadalupe range.\n<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lincoln/recreation/scenicdrivinginfo/recarea/?recid=79402&actid=105</ref>\n\n===Wilderness areas===\n\nThe Lincoln is home to a pair of designated wilderness areas, the [[Capitan Mountains Wilderness]] and the [[White Mountain Wilderness]], both located in the Smoky Bear Ranger District.\n\n====Capitan Mountains Wilderness====\nThe [[Capitan Mountains Wilderness]] was created as part of the [[New Mexico Wilderness Act of 1980]] (Public law 96-550), passed in December 1980, which placed 34,000 acres of public lands in the rugged mountains north of [[Lincoln, New Mexico|Lincoln]] and north-east of [[Capitan, New Mexico|Capitan]] into the National Wilderness Preservation System.<ref name=\"Wilderness.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.net/|title=Wilderness.net|website=Wilderness.net}}</ref>\nProtecting a rare (for New Mexico) east-west mountain range,  the Capitan Mountains Wilderness measures 12 miles long and from two to six miles wide.  Elevations range from about 5,500 feet to 10,083 feet at the top of Capitan Peak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/wildView?WID=97&tab=General|title=Wilderness.net - Capitan Mountains Wilderness - General Information|website=Wilderness.net}}</ref>\nBecause of the rugged nature of the area there are few trail heads into the wilderness and those require the use of a 4-wheel drive, high-clearance vehicle.<ref name=\"usda.gov1\">https://www.fs.usda.gov/attmain/lincoln/specialplaces</ref>\n\n====White Mountain Wilderness====\nThe [[White Mountain Wilderness]] was created in 1964 as part of the bill (Public Law 88-577) that created the [[National Wilderness Preservation System]].  Originally protecting 28,118 acres NW of [[Ruidoso]], the size of the wilderness area was increased by 16,860 acres in 1980.\n<ref name=\"Wilderness.net\"/>\nBeginning on the northern border of the Mescalero Apache Reservation west of Sierra Blanca Peak, the wilderness follows the main ridge of the White Mountains (Sierra Blanca in Spanish) north 12.5 miles.  Ranging from 4\u201312 miles in width the wilderness also includes numerous side canyons and a few year-round streams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/wildView?WID=649|title=Wilderness.net - White Mountain Wilderness - General Information|website=Wilderness.net}}</ref>\nPassenger vehicles can access the over 50 trails in the wilderness from the Three Rivers, Nogal Canyon, Crest and Mill's trailheads.  Other trail heads can be accessed by 4-wheel, high-clearance vehicles.<ref name=\"usda.gov1\"/>\n\nAs with all designated wilderness areas mechanized and motorized vehicles are prohibited in the White Mountains and Capitan Mountains Wildernesses.  Access can only be by foot or horse.<ref name=\"Wilderness.net\"/>\nTotally undeveloped, these areas have no amenities and require hikers and backpackers to practice \"Leave No Trace\" camping techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/LNT|title=Wilderness.net - Principals of Leave No Trace|website=Wilderness.net}}</ref>\n\n===Dispersed camping===\n\nMany areas of the Lincoln National Forest are open to [[dispersed camping]], meaning that visitors are allowed to drive up to 300' from public roads onto forest lands for camping.  This type of primitive camping is free and does not require a permit.  Since these are undeveloped areas there is no water, restrooms, or other amenities.  Not all forest lands are open to dispersed camping, so visitors should consult the current Motor Vehicle Use Map for the specific Ranger District to find eligible areas. Popular areas for dispersed camping are the Upper Bonito Dispersed Camping Area, NW of Ruidoso in the Smokey Bear Ranger District and Lower Karr Canyon in the Sacramento R.D. south of Cloudcroft.\n<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/lincoln/recreation/camping-cabins/?recid=34166&actid=34</ref>\n\n===Equestrian and mountain-biking trails===\n\nWhile there are no designated equestrian campgrounds, pack and saddle animals are allowed on the vast majority of trails within the forest.  Mountain bikes are permitted on most of the trails in the Sacramento district, as well as 10+ trails in the Smokey Bear district.  Mechanized vehicles are not permitted on any trail in the Guadalupe district.<ref name=\"usda.gov\"/>\n\n===OHVs===\n\nThe roads and developed trails of the Lincoln National Forest are popular areas for Off-Highway Vehicles (OHVs), such as motorcycles and ATVs.  All three districts allow OHVs less than 50\" wide on designated forest service roads.  Riders should consult the current Motor Vehicle User Map to see which forest roads are open to OHVs.  There are also a large number of trails open to OHVs in both the Sacramento and Smokey Bear Ranger Districts, including the last 28 miles of the Rim Trail (T105).  All trails in the Guadalupe Ranger District are closed to motorized vehicles.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/lincoln/recreation/ohv/?recid=34166&actid=93</ref>\n\n===Winter activities===\n[[File:Ski Apache.jpg|thumb|left|Ski Apache ski area, Smokey Bear Ranger District]]\nWinter in southern New Mexico brings new recreational opportunities to all parts of the Lincoln National Forest from the dry, desert lowlands to the snowy, high mountain areas.  Snow skiing and snowboarding is available at Ski Apache, a Mescalero Apache-owned resort on Sierra Blanca, in the Smokey Brar Ranger District approximately 15 miles west of Ruidoso.  The Upper Karr Canyon Area near Cloudcroft is designated for snow sledding and tubing, and two trails, the 1.9 mile Fir Trail (T122) and the 2.8 mile Little Apache Trail (T124) are maintained in winter as cross-country skiing trails.  These trails can be accessed from the Silver Overflow Campground in the Sacramento Ranger District, near Cloudcroft.  For campers, the Three Rivers and Baca campgrounds in the Smokey Bear district and the Upper Karr Canyon site in the Sacramento district are open year-round.<ref>https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/lincoln/recreation/wintersports</ref>\n\n==Location and access==\n\n===Towns and cities===\nThe following towns and villages lie within the bounds of the Lincoln National Forest:\n* [[Cloudcroft, New Mexico]]\n* [[High Rolls, New Mexico]]\n* [[Mayhill, New Mexico]]\n* [[Ruidoso, New Mexico]]\n* [[Ruidoso Downs, New Mexico]]\n* [[Sacramento, New Mexico]]\n* [[Sunspot, New Mexico]]\n* [[Timberon, New Mexico]]\n* [[Queen, New Mexico]]\n* [[Capitan, New Mexico]]\n* [[Lincoln, New Mexico]]\n\nLarger cities near the Forest include:\n*[[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]\n*[[Carlsbad, New Mexico]]\n*[[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]\n*[[El Paso, Texas]]\n\n===Transportation===\n\n====Airports====\n* [[Sierra Blanca Regional Airport]], located about 15 miles (24&nbsp;km)northwest of [[Ruidoso, New Mexico|Ruidoso]]\n\n====Major highways====\nThe following major highways traverse the Lincoln National Forest:\n* [[U.S. Route 70 in New Mexico|U.S. Route 70]]\n* [[U.S. Route 82]]\n* [[U.S. Route 380]]\n* [[New Mexico State Highway 37|NM 37]]\n* [[New Mexico State Highway 48|NM 48]]\n\n==Nearby attractions==\nThe Lincoln National Forest is only one of many public lands in the south-central region of New Mexico.  Immediately west of the Sacramento Ranger District is [[White Sands National Park]], known to millions for its shifting ocean of fine, white gypsum sand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/whsa/index.htm|title=White Sands National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> A small section of the enormous dune field, located west of Alamogordo on U.S. 70, White Sands offers dune field access, picnic sites, and primitive camping.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/whsa/planyourvisit/eatingsleeping.htm|title=Eating & Sleeping - White Sands National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\nSouth of Alamagordo is [[Oliver Lee Memorial State Park]], a New Mexico state park on the canyon floor west of the Sacramento Mountains.  A full service park with both tent and RV camping, group camping and group picnic areas, Oliver Lee is also the trailhead for the Dog Canyon Trail, which climbs 2000' into the forested mountains of the Sacramento District.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/spd/oliverleestatepark.html|title=Oliver Lee Memorial State Park New Mexico|website=www.emnrd.state.nm.us}}</ref> \nWest of White Sands and approximately 70 miles west of Alamogordo is the recently created [[Organ Mountains\u2013Desert Peaks National Monument]], a unit of the [[Bureau of Land Management]] created to protect the jagged Organ Mountains on the eastern outskirts of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]].<ref>https://www.blm.gov/nlcs_web/sites/nm/st/en/prog/NLCS/OMDP_NM.html</ref> Though a newer park, the area does contains a camp ground and trail heads for day hikes into the mountains.<ref>https://www.blm.gov/nlcs_web/sites/nm/st/en/prog/NLCS/OMDP_NM/omdp_recreational.html</ref>\n\nSouth of the Guadalupe District and west of Carlsbad lies two renowned national parks, [[Carlsbad Caverns]] and [[Guadalupe Mountains]] National Parks.  Located on U.S. 62/180 approx. 30 miles west of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]], [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]] is a world-famous site for exploring both developed and undeveloped caves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/cave/index.htm|title=Carlsbad Caverns National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> Primarily a day-use area, the park does have limited opportunities for backpacking on the high ridges west of the cavern's entrance.  Immediately west of Carlsbad Caverns, on the Texas side of the border, is [[Guadalupe Mountains National Park]].  Established in 1970, GMNP protects Guadalupe Peak and El Capitan, the two tallest mountains in the state, as well as scenic McKittrick Canyon, known for its fall colors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/gumo/index.htm|title=Guadalupe Mountains National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> A favorite destination for hikers and backpackers, GMNP has a number of trails for both day hikes and backpacking.  Shorter trips lead to a number of historical areas, such as the Butterfield Stagecoach station near Pine Springs, while longer treks climb high into the mountains and far into the adjacent salt-flats.  One of the more popular hikes is the 4.5 mile trail to the top of Guadalupe Peak, where decades of climbers have signed the register book at the summit.  A number of semi-developed back-country campsites make possible a wide range of multi-day trips.  For campers, GMNP has two developed campgrounds, one at Pine Springs, near the park headquarters on U.S. 62/180 and Dog Canyon, on the New Mexico side, approximately 70 miles west of Carlsbad.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/gumo/eatingsleeping.htm|title=Eating & Sleeping - Guadalupe Mountains National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Lincoln National Forest}}\n* [[Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation]]\n* [[Alamo National Forest]]\n* [[Sacramento National Forest]]\n* [[Guadalupe National Forest]]\n* [[Smokey Bear]]\n* [[Lincoln County War]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/lincoln/ Lincoln National Forest]\n*[http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/wildView?WID=649&tab=General White Mountains Wilderness]\n*[http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/wildView?WID=97 Capitan Mountains Wilderness]\n*[http://www.discoverruidoso.com Village of Ruidoso Tourism Office]\n*[http://cloudcroft.com/?mobiswitch=deskop Cloudcroft Online]\n*[http://www.skiapache.com/summer/ Ski Apache]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Protected areas of New Mexico}}\n{{National Forests of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:National Forests of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Chaves County, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Eddy County, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Lincoln County, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Otero County, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Alamogordo, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Lincoln National Forest| ]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 1902]]\n[[Category:1902 establishments in New Mexico Territory]]\n", "name_user": "Netoholic", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:post-move link fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_National_Forest"}

A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''. The musical was ranked eighth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[Opinion poll|poll]] of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml Nation's Number One Essential Musical] from a [[BBC]] website</ref> ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was one of eight UK musicals featured on [[Royal Mail]] stamps, issued in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal Mail musicals stamps set to rock you! |url=https://www.royalmailgroup.com/en/press-centre/press-releases/royal-mail/royal-mail-musicals-stamps-set-to-rock-you/ |accessdate=27 April 2019 |agency=Royal Mail group}}</ref>\n\nBeyond its cult status, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid-sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/539534/we-live-in-the-world-rocky-horror-created|title=We Live in the World 'Rocky Horror' Created|date=25 September 2015 |work=Flavorwire|accessdate=22 May 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rocky Horror London programme.jpg|thumb|left|Original programme of the musical from the Theatre Upstairs]]\nAs an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote ''The Rocky Horror Show'' to keep himself busy on winter evenings. Since his youth, he had developed a passion for [[science fiction]] and [[B movies|B horror movies]]; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, [[Steve Reeves]] muscle films, and fifties [[rock and roll]] into ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=AmericanMusical>{{cite book |title = The American Musical and the Performance of Personal Identity |last=Knapp |first=Raymond |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2 March 2009 |pages=240 |isbn=978-0-691-14105-3}}</ref> A major theme running throughout the musical is [[transvestism]], which according to O'Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being. He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Auslander |first1=Philip |title=Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=49}}</ref> he has stated \"[[glam rock]] allowed me to be myself more\", allowing his concept to come into being.<ref name=\"Glam era\">{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century |date=2016 |publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref>\n\nO'Brien took a small amount of his unfinished ''Rocky Horror'' to Australian director [[Jim Sharman]], who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Sloane Square]], [[Chelsea, London]], which was used as a project space for new work.<ref name=Miller /> Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of ''Superstar'', during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians [[Nell Campbell]] and long-time scenic designer partner [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] into the production.\n\nStar [[Tim Curry]] recalled his first encounter with the script:\n{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman.

The show received critical praise and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Award|''Evening Standard'' Award]] for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\n==Other productions==\n\n===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===\n[[Lou Adler]] had made millions with risky ventures such as [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]].

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included Max Phipps - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); Graham Matters - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with Clive Hale: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much.\"  It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">''The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic'' (2016) by Dave Thompson; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books</ref><ref>Adelaide Programme 1977.</ref>\n\n===Original New York City (Broadway) production===\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster]]\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] after a ten-month run.

The cast included Marcelo M\u00e9dici (Frank-N-Furter), Bruna Guerin (Janet Weiss), Felipe de Carolis (Brad Majors), Gottsha (Magenta and Usherette), Thiago Machado (Riff Raff), Jana Amorim (Columbia), Nicola Lama (Eddie / Dr. Everett Scott), Felipe Mafra (Rocky), Marcel Octavio (Narrator), Vanessa Costa (Ghost) and Thiago Gar\u00e7a (Ghost).\n\nThe musical was a great success, especially for the large number of cosplayers who, at the end of very show, were invited to dance \"Time Warp\" on stage with the cast.\n\nShortly before the premiere of the musical, director and producer Cl\u00e1udio Botelho became embroiled in a major controversy after posting transphobic and homophobic comments in his personal profile page on Facebook regarding trans people. In his words:\n\n\"Guys, this sort of thing [being trans] is spreading because the parents do not hit their kids anymore. But if a father hits a LaverME [here, he makes a pun with Laverne Cox and the word \"worm\" in Portuguese], a fagot rights entity say that she is a woman trapped inside the body of a man. Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy [Garland], Barbra [Streisand] and Rog\u00e9ria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims. In his defense, the director said that the comments were nothing more than a joke and that they were taken out of context. According to him, it was just a discussion about the casting of actress Laverne Cox for the main role of the musical.\n\n=== Central American productions ===\n\n==== 2013 Panamanian production ====\nIn 2013 the English community [[Theatre Guild of Ancon]] presented the show under the direction of [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1754099/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1 Melanie Gilpin] (Lee).

A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''. The musical was ranked eighth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[Opinion poll|poll]] of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml Nation's Number One Essential Musical] from a [[BBC]] website</ref> ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was one of eight UK musicals featured on [[Royal Mail]] stamps, issued in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal Mail musicals stamps set to rock you! |url=https://www.royalmailgroup.com/en/press-centre/press-releases/royal-mail/royal-mail-musicals-stamps-set-to-rock-you/ |accessdate=27 April 2019 |agency=Royal Mail group}}</ref>\n\nBeyond its cult status, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid-sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/539534/we-live-in-the-world-rocky-horror-created|title=We Live in the World 'Rocky Horror' Created|date=25 September 2015 |work=Flavorwire|accessdate=22 May 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rocky Horror London programme.jpg|thumb|left|Original programme of the musical from the Theatre Upstairs]]\nAs an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote ''The Rocky Horror Show'' to keep himself busy on winter evenings. Since his youth, he had developed a passion for [[science fiction]] and [[B movies|B horror movies]]; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, [[Steve Reeves]] muscle films, and fifties [[rock and roll]] into ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=AmericanMusical>{{cite book |title = The American Musical and the Performance of Personal Identity |last=Knapp |first=Raymond |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2 March 2009 |pages=240 |isbn=978-0-691-14105-3}}</ref> A major theme running throughout the musical is [[transvestism]], which according to O'Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being. He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Auslander |first1=Philip |title=Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=49}}</ref> he has stated \"[[glam rock]] allowed me to be myself more\", allowing his concept to come into being.<ref name=\"Glam era\">{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century |date=2016 |publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref>\n\nO'Brien took a small amount of his unfinished ''Rocky Horror'' to Australian director [[Jim Sharman]], who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Sloane Square]], [[Chelsea, London]], which was used as a project space for new work.<ref name=Miller /> Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of ''Superstar'', during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians [[Nell Campbell]] and long-time scenic designer partner [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] into the production.\n\nStar [[Tim Curry]] recalled his first encounter with the script:\n{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman. He gave me the script, and I thought, \"Boy, if this works, it's going to be a smash.\"<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/146232172/Tim-Curry-intervirew |title=Curry Prefers the Sidelight for Now |publisher=[[United Media|NEA]] newspaper syndicate |authorlink=Frank Lovece |first=Frank |last=Lovece |date=8 December 1992 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer [[Sue Blane]] and musical director [[Richard Hartley (composer)|Richard Hartley]], although Pete Moss would later take over as musical director.

The show received critical praise and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Award|''Evening Standard'' Award]] for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\n==Other productions==\n\n===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===\n[[Lou Adler]] had made millions with risky ventures such as [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]].

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included Max Phipps - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); Graham Matters - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with Clive Hale: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much.\"  It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">''The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic'' (2016) by Dave Thompson; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books</ref><ref>Adelaide Programme 1977.</ref>\n\n===Original New York City (Broadway) production===\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster]]\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] after a ten-month run.

In his words:\n\n\"Guys, this sort of thing [being trans] is spreading because the parents do not hit their kids anymore. But if a father hits a LaverME [here, he makes a pun with Laverne Cox and the word \"worm\" in Portuguese], a fagot rights entity say that she is a woman trapped inside the body of a man. Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy [Garland], Barbra [Streisand] and Rog\u00e9ria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims. In his defense, the director said that the comments were nothing more than a joke and that they were taken out of context. According to him, it was just a discussion about the casting of actress Laverne Cox for the main role of the musical.\n\n=== Central American productions ===\n\n==== 2013 Panamanian production ====\nIn 2013 the English community [[Theatre Guild of Ancon]] presented the show under the direction of [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1754099/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1 Melanie Gilpin] (Lee).

One such instance is that the details in the FIR do not match the police press briefing of 10 January.<ref>{{cite news |title=JNU Attack: What the Delhi Police Has Done and What it Hasn't |url=https://thewire.in/government/jnu-attack-what-the-delhi-police-has-done-and-what-it-hasnt |accessdate=11 January 2020 |work=The Wire |date=9 January 2020}}</ref> The police even described a organisation, [[Students' Federation of India]] as ''Students \"Front\" of India''. In that press briefing, the DCP of police shared photographs of the identified students. On 11 January, the fact-checking website ''[[AltNews.in]]'' released an article regarding those photographs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Delhi police probe or ABVP investigation?

One FIR claimed that a group of students entered the Centre for Information System (CIS) office by breaking open a glass back door at around 1:00 p.m. on 4 January. The FIR mentioned, \"they illegally trespassed the University property with the criminal intention to damage to the public property once inside they damaged the servers and made it dysfunctional and severely damaged the fiber optic cables power supplies and broke the biometric systems inside the room\" and asked for action against those students, including JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh. Another FIR, alleged that the vandalism by students on 3 January severely affected a number of administrative functions, including \u201cbiometric attendance and CCTV surveillance system\u201d. In a statement, JNU vice-chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar has claimed that the violence on 5 January had its origins in the vandalism which occurred on 3 and 4 January. He also alleged that the broken biometric systems affected winter semester registration.<ref name=\"RTI1\">{{cite news |last1=Jebaraj |first1=Priscilla |title=JNU biometric systems, CCTVs not broken in Jan. 3, 4 vandalism' |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-biometric-systems-cctvs-not-broken-in-jan-3-4-vandalism/article30610681.ece |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The Hindu |date=21 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128033402/https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-biometric-systems-cctvs-not-broken-in-jan-3-4-vandalism/article30610681.ece |archive-date=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bhatnagar |first1=Gaurav |title=RTI Reveals Glaring Loopholes in JNU Admin's Claims on Campus Violence |url=https://thewire.in/rights/rti-reveals-glaring-loopholes-in-jnu-admins-claims-on-campus-violence |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The Wire |date=6 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nOne of the RTI asked for information on the \"total number of broken/destroyed biometric systems at CIS office from 30 December 2019 to 8 January 2020.\" It has also asked for details of all vandalised CCTV cameras from 30 December till 8 January. In response to both of the question, the CIS responded \"none\", which means that the said biometric system was not destroyed and CCTVs were not vandalised. The RTI asked whether the CIS Office (that was vandalised) contains the servers of the CCTV cameras. The response said that the server are \"not located in CIS office but located in data centre\". With regard to the fibre-optic cables used in the CIS servers, the response said, 17 such cables were damaged around 13:00 on 4 January.<ref name=\"RTI2\">{{cite news |last1=Kashyap |first1=Nitisha |title=CCTVs, Server Room Not Vandalised on January 3: RTI Reply Punctures Holes in JNU V-C's Version |url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/cctvs-server-room-not-vandalised-on-jan-3-rti-reply-punctures-holes-in-jnu-v-cs-version-2468015.html |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The News18 |date=22 January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"RTI3\">{{cite news |last1=Gunasekar |first1=Arvind |title=\"CCTV Video With Cops\", Says JNU After Claiming No Footage Of Mob Attack |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cctv-video-with-cops-says-jnu-after-claiming-no-footage-of-mob-attack-2170590 |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The NDTV |date=27 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe RTI responses again raised questions on Police and their CCTV footage claims. Initially, police responded to media that CCTV footage were not available for which it was difficult for them to identify the perpetrator, and instead they were using screenshots from viral social media posts. But one of the RTI responses says the CCTV footage are \"withheld with law and enforcement agencies for undergoing investigation into recent incidents at JNU\", which shows police have CCTV footage with them. Though a response to another RTI says that \"no continuous and entire CCTV footage\" of the north gate cameras between 3:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on 5 January was available with JNU. It adds that \"no CCTV camera footages are uploaded continuously to the JNU Cloud Computing Platform\". However, the response says, the JNU website continued to function during this period as it is important and \"running from alternate backup arrangement during this period\" (during the incidents). The RTI response does not give any clarity on whether there was any alternative backup arrangements for CCTV cameras.<ref name=\"RTI1\"/><ref name=\"RTI2\"/> One of the FIRs detailing vandalism has a \"date of occurrence\" listed as 1 January. However, in its response, CIS said there were only two incidents when JNU\u2019s main server was shut down during that week, at 1.30 p.m. on 3 January and the same time on 4 January \"due to power supply disruption\".<ref name=\"RTI3\"/>\n\n=== Petitions in Courts ===\n==== Petition to preserve evidence ====\nOn 10 January 2020, three JNU professors filed a petition in the High Court seeking a direction to Delhi Police and the government to preserve data, CCTV footage, and all evidence associated with the attack. The request included retrieval of evidence and data from [[WhatsApp]], [[Google]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. The data, such as messages, pictures, videos, and phone numbers of the members of the WhatsApp groups 'Unity Against Left' and 'Friends of RSS' were sought to be preserved.<ref name=\"Preserve data 10 Jan\" /> The petition said that the Delhi police have not responded to the requests for preservation of data. The petitioners noted their apprehension that without a direction from the court, it may not be preserved. Petitioners claimed that as far as they knew from news reports, the police have not yet retrieved CCTV footage, which is crucial evidence. The petition is scheduled for a hearing on 13 January.<ref name=\"Preserve data 10 Jan\">{{cite news |title=JNU campus violence: 3 JNU professors move HC with PIL to preserve data, CCTV footage, evidence |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnu-campus-violence-3-jnu-professors-move-hc-with-pil-to-preserve-data-cctv-footage-evidence/article30536332.ece |accessdate=10 January 2020 |work=The Hindu |date=10 January 2020 |language=en-IN}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 January, The Delhi High Court issued notice to all internet based companies Apple, Google and WhatsApp on the petitions seeking directions to preserve data, CCTV footage and other evidence.

The report asked if the administration already knew that an attack was going to happen and alleged that the servers were not made functional so that the CCTV cameras failed to record the attacks.<ref name=\"Congress panel 12 Jan\" />\n\nThe committee demanded the withdrawal of the fee hike and initiation of an independent judicial inquiry into the attacks.<ref name=\"Congress panel 12 Jan\" />\n\n==Investigation==\nPolice have said that some of the masked attackers have been identified and complaints have been merged and filed as a single FIR.<ref name=\"ndtv 24 students\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/jnu-violence-masked-mob-terrorises-jawaharlal-nehru-university-campus-24-students-and-teachers-injur-2159292|title=Some Masked JNU Attackers Identified, Say Cops, No Arrests Yet: 10 Points|last=Varma|first=Shylaja|date=6 December 2019|website=NDTV|access-date=6 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"FP JNUSU President\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/jnu-violence-live-updates-jnusu-president-aishe-ghosh-attacked-after-clash-with-abvp-members-students-claim-rss-abvp-men-called-outsiders-7863651.html|title=JNU violence LIVE updates: Sabarmati Hostel warden resigns on moral grounds; Delhi Police registers FIR 20 hours after attack on students|website=Firstpost|access-date=6 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> On 11 January, the police claimed they had identified 37 out of a total of 60 members of the WhatsApp group that included 10 outsiders, named 'Unity against Left'.

Shutting off the street lights, allowing armed mobs to move freely, and allowing attacks on journalists in front of the police are among many such instances which raised questions in the media and  on political platforms.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bordia |first1=Radhika |title=JNU attacks: Four questions for the Delhi Police about its actions on Sunday night |url=https://scroll.in/video/948908/jnu-attacks-four-questions-for-the-delhi-police-about-its-actions-on-sunday-night |accessdate=11 January 2020 |work=The Scroll |date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Along with the inaction of the police, questions were also raised over the investigation.

One FIR claimed that a group of students entered the Centre for Information System (CIS) office by breaking open a glass back door at around 1:00 p.m. on 4 January. The FIR mentioned, \"they illegally trespassed the University property with the criminal intention to damage to the public property once inside they damaged the servers and made it dysfunctional and severely damaged the fiber optic cables power supplies and broke the biometric systems inside the room\" and asked for action against those students, including JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh. Another FIR, alleged that the vandalism by students on 3 January severely affected a number of administrative functions, including \u201cbiometric attendance and CCTV surveillance system\u201d. In a statement, JNU vice-chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar has claimed that the violence on 5 January had its origins in the vandalism which occurred on 3 and 4 January. He also alleged that the broken biometric systems affected winter semester registration.<ref name=\"RTI1\">{{cite news |last1=Jebaraj |first1=Priscilla |title=JNU biometric systems, CCTVs not broken in Jan. 3, 4 vandalism' |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-biometric-systems-cctvs-not-broken-in-jan-3-4-vandalism/article30610681.ece |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The Hindu |date=21 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128033402/https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-biometric-systems-cctvs-not-broken-in-jan-3-4-vandalism/article30610681.ece |archive-date=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bhatnagar |first1=Gaurav |title=RTI Reveals Glaring Loopholes in JNU Admin's Claims on Campus Violence |url=https://thewire.in/rights/rti-reveals-glaring-loopholes-in-jnu-admins-claims-on-campus-violence |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The Wire |date=6 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nOne of the RTI asked for information on the \"total number of broken/destroyed biometric systems at CIS office from 30 December 2019 to 8 January 2020.\" It has also asked for details of all vandalised CCTV cameras from 30 December till 8 January. In response to both of the question, the CIS responded \"none\", which means that the said biometric system was not destroyed and CCTVs were not vandalised. The RTI asked whether the CIS Office (that was vandalised) contains the servers of the CCTV cameras. The response said that the server are \"not located in CIS office but located in data centre\". With regard to the fibre-optic cables used in the CIS servers, the response said, 17 such cables were damaged around 13:00 on 4 January.<ref name=\"RTI2\">{{cite news |last1=Kashyap |first1=Nitisha |title=CCTVs, Server Room Not Vandalised on January 3: RTI Reply Punctures Holes in JNU V-C's Version |url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/cctvs-server-room-not-vandalised-on-jan-3-rti-reply-punctures-holes-in-jnu-v-cs-version-2468015.html |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The News18 |date=22 January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"RTI3\">{{cite news |last1=Gunasekar |first1=Arvind |title=\"CCTV Video With Cops\", Says JNU After Claiming No Footage Of Mob Attack |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cctv-video-with-cops-says-jnu-after-claiming-no-footage-of-mob-attack-2170590 |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The NDTV |date=27 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe RTI responses again raised questions on Police and their CCTV footage claims. Initially, police responded to media that CCTV footage were not available for which it was difficult for them to identify the perpetrator, and instead they were using screenshots from viral social media posts. But one of the RTI responses says the CCTV footage are \"withheld with law and enforcement agencies for undergoing investigation into recent incidents at JNU\", which shows police have CCTV footage with them. Though a response to another RTI says that \"no continuous and entire CCTV footage\" of the north gate cameras between 3:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on 5 January was available with JNU. It adds that \"no CCTV camera footages are uploaded continuously to the JNU Cloud Computing Platform\". However, the response says, the JNU website continued to function during this period as it is important and \"running from alternate backup arrangement during this period\" (during the incidents). The RTI response does not give any clarity on whether there was any alternative backup arrangements for CCTV cameras.<ref name=\"RTI1\"/><ref name=\"RTI2\"/> One of the FIRs detailing vandalism has a \"date of occurrence\" listed as 1 January. However, in its response, CIS said there were only two incidents when JNU\u2019s main server was shut down during that week, at 1.30 p.m. on 3 January and the same time on 4 January \"due to power supply disruption\".<ref name=\"RTI3\"/>\n\n=== Petitions in Courts ===\n==== Petition to preserve evidence ====\nOn 10 January 2020, three JNU professors filed a petition in the High Court seeking a direction to Delhi Police and the government to preserve data, CCTV footage, and all evidence associated with the attack. The request included retrieval of evidence and data from [[WhatsApp]], [[Google]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. The data, such as messages, pictures, videos, and phone numbers of the members of the WhatsApp groups 'Unity Against Left' and 'Friends of RSS' were sought to be preserved.<ref name=\"Preserve data 10 Jan\" /> The petition said that the Delhi police have not responded to the requests for preservation of data. The petitioners noted their apprehension that without a direction from the court, it may not be preserved. Petitioners claimed that as far as they knew from news reports, the police have not yet retrieved CCTV footage, which is crucial evidence. The petition is scheduled for a hearing on 13 January.<ref name=\"Preserve data 10 Jan\">{{cite news |title=JNU campus violence: 3 JNU professors move HC with PIL to preserve data, CCTV footage, evidence |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnu-campus-violence-3-jnu-professors-move-hc-with-pil-to-preserve-data-cctv-footage-evidence/article30536332.ece |accessdate=10 January 2020 |work=The Hindu |date=10 January 2020 |language=en-IN}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 January, The Delhi High Court issued notice to all internet based companies Apple, Google and WhatsApp on the petitions seeking directions to preserve data, CCTV footage and other evidence.

Two months later, on 8 January 2008, a ''[[:meta:Proposal for Policy on overuse of bots in Wikipedias|Proposal for Policy on overuse of bots in Wikipedias]]'' was created on Meta-Wiki.<ref name=\"proposal-overuse-bots\">{{cite web|title=Proposal for Policy on overuse of bots in Wikipedias|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proposal_for_Policy_on_overuse_of_bots_in_Wikipedias&oldid=825200|work=Meta-Wiki|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=15 April 2013|date=8 January 2008}}</ref> Its purpose was to address perceived problems resulting from \"massive flood of additions from bots\", but {{as of|2014|07|lc=yes}}, it remains a proposal and is still in the process of gathering consensus for adoption.<ref name=\"proposal-overuse-bots\"/>\n\n=== Name and logo ===\n{{multiple image\n | width = 110\n | footer = \n | image1 = Wikipedia-logo-v2-vo.png\n | alt1 = Current logo since May 2013\n | caption1 = Current logo since May 2013\n | image2 = Wikipedia-logo-vo.png\n | alt2 = Original logo created in June 2005\n | caption2 = Original logo created in 2005\n }}\nThe word ''V\u00fckiped'' is unique among translations of the name ''Wikipedia'' because it conveys an adaptation of the original word's connotations while being composed entirely of existent Volap\u00fck [[morpheme]]s. Instead of opting for an habitual [[calque]] of the English [[portmanteau]] of '''''[[wiki]]''''' and ''encyclo'''pedia''''', the Volap\u00fck Wikipedia's community preferred to devise a neologism, because a borrowing of the prefix ''wiki-'' would be inconsistent with Volap\u00fck [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The resulting ''V\u00fckiped'' is composed of morphemes ''v\u00fc-'' (\"inter-\", \"among\") and ''kiped'' (\"to keep\", \"to preserve\", \"to maintain\"), and has an implied meaning that roughly translates as: \"the effort to maintain this Wikipedia is shared among a group of folks\".<ref name=\"naming\">{{cite web|title=Fomam tim\u00fc 14:00, 2003 febul 15id|url=https://vo.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geban:Jay_B.&direction=prev&oldid=86|work=V\u00fckiped|accessdate=14 April 2013|author1=Oliver Pereira|author2=Jay B}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Malafaya|author2=Anonymous|title=The word \"V\u00fckiped\"|url=https://vo.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%BCkiped:Kafetar#The_word_.22V.C3.BCkiped.22|website=V\u00fckiped|accessdate=20 July 2014|date=January 2013}}</ref> The word was adopted in early 2004, for its [[Autological word|autological]] conveyance of a central aspect of Wikipedia's nature and because it is both phonologically and orthographically similar to the original term ''Wikipedia''.<ref name=\"naming\"/>\n\nThe first [[Logo of Wikipedia|Wikipedia logo]] made for the V\u00fckiped was created by [[User:Nohat|Nohat]] and transferred to Wikimedia Commons on 8 June 2005.

Chamorro was supported by the US and a 14-party anti-Sandinista alliance known as the [[National Opposition Union]] (Uni\u00f3n Nacional Oppositora, UNO), an alliance that ranged from conservatives and liberals to communists.

In Ortega's concession speech the following day he vowed to keep \"ruling from below\" a reference to the power that the FSLN still wielded in various sectors. He also stressed his belief that the Sandinistas had the goal of bringing \"dignity\" to Latin America, and not necessarily to hold on to government posts. In 1991, Ortega claimed elections were \u201can instrument to reaffirm\u201d the FSLN's \u201cpolitical and ideological positions,\u201d and also \u201cconfront capitalism.\u201d{{sfn|Baltodano|2012|p=70}} However, the electoral loss led to pronounced divisions in the FSLN. Some members adopted more pragmatic positions, and sought to transform the FSLN into a modern social democratic party engaged in national reconciliation and class cooperation. Ortega and other party insiders found common ground with the radicals, who still promoted anti-imperialism and class conflict to achieve social change.<ref name=\"FSLNPostCollapse\" />\n\nPossible explanations for his loss include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega government as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless [[Violeta Chamorro]] won.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130117074255/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1222025.html \"Bush Vows to End Embargo if Chamorro Wins\"], ''The Washington Post,'' November 9, 1989</ref> Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras,<ref>{{cite report|publisher=Human Rights Watch|title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1989|chapter=Nicaragua|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/index.htm|date=1990|access-date=9 March 2016|chapter-url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/Nicaragu.htm|quote=The policy of keeping the contras alive ... also has placed in jeopardy the holding of elections by encouraging contra attacks on the electoral process.

The controversial alliance of Nicaragua's two major parties is aimed at distributing power between the PLC and FSLN, and preventing other parties from rising.

He also stressed his belief that the Sandinistas had the goal of bringing \"dignity\" to Latin America, and not necessarily to hold on to government posts. In 1991, Ortega claimed elections were \u201can instrument to reaffirm\u201d the FSLN's \u201cpolitical and ideological positions,\u201d and also \u201cconfront capitalism.\u201d{{sfn|Baltodano|2012|p=70}} However, the electoral loss led to pronounced divisions in the FSLN.

But he did not do so.

He explained that during the Reagan administration the United States imposed sanctions on Nicaragua. But cutting ties with Taiwan was a sad and painful decision because of the friendship between Nicaragua and Taiwan's people and government.

The first two conventions used [[German language|German]], and the last conference used only Volap\u00fck. In 1889, there were an estimated 283 clubs, 25 periodicals in or about Volap\u00fck, and 316 textbooks in 25 languages;<ref name=\"sprague\">[http://personal.southern.edu/~caviness/Volapuk/HBoV/ Handbook of Volap\u00fck], [[Charles E.

This was followed in 1880 by a full-length book in German. Schleyer himself did not write books on Volap\u00fck in other languages, but other authors soon did.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Cherpillod writes of the third Volap\u00fck convention,\n\n{{quote|In August 1889 the third convention was held in [[Paris]].  About two hundred people from many countries attended.  And, unlike in the first two conventions, people spoke only Volap\u00fck.

Lourdelet as President and a central committee that included the deputy [[Edgar Raoul-Duval]].<ref>{{citation|accessdate=2018-01-24|language=fr|ref={{harvid|Members du Comit\u00e9 Central \u2013 Le Volap\u00fck}}\n |title=Members du Comit\u00e9 Central |journal=Le Volap\u00fck|publisher=Association Fran\u00e7ais pour la propagation du Volap\u00fck|pages=2\u20133\n |url=http://volapuk.temerov.org/Volap%C3%BCkanef/Frans%C3%A4nap%C3%BCk/n%C3%BCneds/Le%20Volap%C3%BCk/06_Le_Volap%C3%BCk_Nombre_1_Juin_1886.pdf}}</ref>\nHowever, tensions arose between Kerckhoffs and others in the Academy, who wanted reforms made to the language, and Schleyer, who insisted strongly on retaining his proprietary rights. This led to schism, with much of the Academy abandoning Schleyer's Volap\u00fck Eiscritzscarben in favor of [[Idiom Neutral]] and other new constructed language projects. Another reason for the decline of Volap\u00fck may have been the rise of [[Esperanto]]. In 1887 the first Esperanto book (''[[Unua Libro]]'') was published. Many Volap\u00fck clubs became Esperanto clubs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nBy 1890 the movement was in disarray, with violent arguments among the members. Schleyer resigned from the Volap\u00fck Academy and created a rival academy. Derived languages such as [[Nal Bino]], Balta, Bopal, Spelin, Dil and Orba were invented and quickly forgotten.<ref name=Pei>{{cite book|last1=Pei|first1=Mario|title=One Language for the World|date=1968|publisher=Biblo and Tannen|location=New York|page=134|url=https://www.questia.com/read/591845/one-language-for-the-world|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=Okrent2012/>\nBy 1900 there were only 159 members of Volap\u00fck clubs recognized by Schleyer.<ref name=\"cherpillod1995\"/>\nThe umlauts, which may have been one of the reasons for the language's eventual decline into obscurity, were the subject of ridicule.

This revision was accepted by the few speakers of the language. De Jong simplified the grammar, eliminating some rarely used verb forms, and eliminated some gendered pronouns and gendered verb endings. He also rehabilitated the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/r/}} and used it to make some morphemes more recognizable. For instance, ''l\u00f6mib'' \"rain\" became ''rein''.<ref>http://www.rickharrison.com/language/dejong.html Arie de Jong's Revision of Volap\u00fck (1931) {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060102205719/http://www.rickharrison.com/language/dejong.html |date=2006-01-02 }} by Ed Robertson</ref>\nVolap\u00fck enjoyed a brief renewal of popularity in the Netherlands and Germany under de Jong's leadership, but was suppressed (along with other constructed languages) in countries under Nazi rule and never recovered.\n\nRegarding the success of this artificial language, the Spanish scientist [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]] wrote in the first edition of his ''Tonics of Willingness'', in 1898:\n\n{{quote|Nowadays, many scientific papers are published in more than six languages. To the likely attempt of restoring Latin or using Esperanto as the universal language of science, wise men have responded by multiplying the number of languages in which scientific works are published. We have to acknowledge that Volap\u00fck or Esperanto are practically one more language to be learnt. This result was predictable because neither the essentially popularized and democratic tendencies of modern knowledge, nor the economic views of authors and editors consent in a different way.<ref>Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, S. (2009): ''Tonics of Willingness: Rules and Advices about Scientific Investigation''.

We forecast the same for Esperanto.\"\n\nLarge Volap\u00fck collections are held by the International Esperanto Museum<ref>[http://www.onb.ac.at/sammlungen/plansprachen/ Collection for Planned Languages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040612032750/http://www.onb.ac.at/sammlungen/plansprachen/ |date=2004-06-12 }} (in German)</ref> in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]; the [[Centre de documentation et d'\u00e9tude sur la langue internationale]] in La Chaux-de-Fonds, [[Switzerland]]; and the [[American Philosophical Society]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].<ref>[http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/Mss.408.9.Ar7v-ead.xml Volap\u00fck Collection] - American Philosophical Society</ref>\nIn 2000 there were an estimated 20 Volap\u00fck speakers in the world.<ref name=\"speakers\"/>\n\nIn December 2007 it was reported that the [[Volap\u00fck Wikipedia|Volap\u00fck version of Wikipedia]] had recently jumped to 15th place among language editions, with more than 112,000 articles.\n<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |url=http://www.pcworld.pl/artykuly/56502/MySpace.kontra.Facebook.html#t_34252|title=Ciekawe wydarzenia w Internecie\n |journal=PC World (Polish) |date=December 1, 2007|accessdate=2013-04-26|language=Polish}}</ref>\nA few months earlier there had been only 797 articles.

(However, the question clitic \"-li\" does not affect the stress of the word it attaches to.)  Where there is secondary stress, as is found in the compounding of several roots together, it is found on the final syllable between the roots.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nSchleyer adapted the [[vocabulary]] mostly from [[English language|English]], with a smattering of [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]].  Some words  remain readily recognizable for a speaker of one of the source languages, but many others are modified beyond easy recognition.<ref name=\"alexander2005\">\"For example, while it is true that words like vol and p\u00fck don't really look like world and speak, but the whole language is not like that.  Scores of words are very obvious as what they mean&nbsp;\u2013 if, fasilik, gudik/badik, smalik, jerik (pronounced sher\u00edk&nbsp;\u2013 expensive), bank, b\u00e4k (back), deadik\".&nbsp;\u2013 [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0511C&L=AUXLANG&P=R231&D=0&T=0 \"What the L!\"], AUXLANG list posting by Thomas Alexander, 15 November 2005.</ref> For instance, ''vol'' and ''p\u00fck'' are derived from the English words ''world'' and ''speak''. Although unimportant linguistically, and regardless of the simplicity and consistency of the stress rule, these deformations were greatly mocked by the language's detractors. It seems to have been Schleyer's intention, however, to alter its loan words in such a way that they would be hard to recognise, thus losing their ties to the languages (and, by extension, nations) from which they came. Conversely, [[Esperanto]] and [[Interlingua]] are commonly criticized as being much easier to learn for [[European ethnic groups|European]]s than for those with non-European native languages.\n\n==Grammar==\nThe [[grammar]] is based on that of typical European languages, but with an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] character: grammatical inflections are indicated by stringing together separate [[affix]]es for each element of meaning.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns inflect for case and number, but not for gender.\n\nThe following is the declension of the Volap\u00fck word ''vol'' \"world\":\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Case!! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n!Nominative\n| ''vol'' (world)||| ''vols'' (worlds)\n|-\n!Genitive\n| ''vola'' (of the world)|| ''volas'' (of the worlds)\n|-\n!Dative\n| ''vole'' (to the world) || ''voles'' (to the worlds)\n|-\n!Accusative\n| ''voli'' (world) || ''volis'' (worlds)\n|}\n\nAs in [[German language|German]], the Volap\u00fck noun has four cases: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]] and [[accusative case|accusative]]. In compound words, the first part of the compound is usually separated from the second by the genitive termination ''-a'', e.g.&nbsp;''Vola-p\u00fck'', \"of-world language\": \"language of the world\".  However, the other case endings (''-e'' dative, ''-i'' accusative) are sometimes used if applicable, or the roots may be agglutinated in the nominative, with no separating vowel.\n\n===Adjectives and adverbs===\n[[Adjective]]s, formed by the suffix ''-ik'', normally follow the noun they qualify.  They do not agree with the noun in number and case in that position, but do if they precede the noun, are separated from it by intervening words, or stand alone.  [[Adverb]]s are formed by suffixing ''-o'', either to the root or to the adjectival ''-ik'' (''gudik'' \"good\", ''gudiko'' \"well\"); they normally follow the verb or adjective they modify.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThe pronouns begin with ''o-.'' In the singular, they are ''ob'' \"I\", ''ol'' \"[[thou]]\", ''om'' \"he/it\", ''of'' \"she\", ''os'' (impersonal),<ref>''Os'' is used for cases where the pronoun has no obvious antecedent, such as \"I swear it\", and perhaps with [[impersonal verb]]s.  ''Om'' is used for abstract things such as ''lit'' \"light\".</ref> ''on'' \"one\", ''ok'' \"oneself\". They are pluralized with ''-s'': ''obs'' \"we\", ''ols'' \"ye\", ''oms''  \"they\". The possessive may be formed with either the genitive ''-a'' or with adjectival ''-ik'': ''oba'' or ''obik'' \"my\". Prepositions, conjunctions and interjections are also formed from noun roots by appending appropriate suffixes.\n\n===Verbs===\nThe [[verb]] carries a fine degree of detail, with [[morpheme]]s marking [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical voice|voice]], [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical number|number]] and (in the third person) the subject's [[grammatical gender|gender]]. However, many of these categories are optional, and a verb can stand in an unmarked state. A Volap\u00fck verb can be conjugated in 1,584 ways (including infinitives and reflexives).<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Dictionary of Made-Up Languages: From Adunaic to Elvish, Zaum to Klingon-- the Anwa (Real) Origins of Invented Lexicons|last = Rogers|first = Stephen D.|publisher = Adams Media Corporation|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1440528170|location = Avon|pages = 238|url = https://www.questia.com/read/121836205/a-dictionary-of-made-up-languages-from-adunaic-to}}</ref>\n\n;Person\nFor the simple present, the pronouns are suffixed to the verb stem:\n:''binob'' I am, ''binol'' thou art,\netc. The present passive takes the prefix ''pa-'':\n:''pal\u00f6fons'' they are loved.\n\n;Tense, aspect, and voice\nThe three tenses in the [[indicative]], and the three [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] aspects, each take a characteristic vowel prefix:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Tense !!Prefix\n|-\n!Present\n|a-\n|-\n!Past\n|\u00e4-\n|-\n!Present perfect\n|e-\n|-\n!Past perfect\n|i-\n|-\n!Future\n|o-\n|-\n!Future perfect\n|u-\n|}\n\nThe present-tense prefix is omitted in the active voice, so:\n:''binob'' I am, ''\u00e4binol'' you were, ''ebinom'' he has been, ''ibinof'' she had been, ''obinos'' it will be, ''ubinon'' one will have been.\n\nThese are seen as being more distant from the present tense the further the vowel is from {{IPA|[a]}} in [[vowel space]], and they can be used with temporal words to indicate distance in the past or future. For example, from ''del'' 'day',\n:''adelo'' today, ''odelo'' tomorrow, ''udelo'' the day after tomorrow, ''\u00e4delo'' yesterday, ''edelo'' the day before yesterday, ''idelo'' three days ago.\n\nThe [[passive voice]] is formed with ''p-'', and here the ''a'' is required for the present tense:\n:''pal\u00f6fob'' I am loved, ''p\u00e4logol'' you were seen, ''pologobs'' we will be seen.\n\n;Infinitive mood\nThe infinitive is formed with the suffix ''-\u00f6n''.  It can be combined with tense/aspect prefixes:\n:''Log\u00f6n'' to see, ''elog\u00f6n'' to have seen.\n\n;Interrogative mood\nYes\u2013no questions are indicated with the particle ''li'':\n:''P\u00e4logom-li'' was he seen?\nThe hyphen indicates that the syllable ''li'' does not take stress. It occurs before the verb to avoid a sequence of three consonants or a double el:  ''li-p\u00e4logol?  li-binoms?''\n\n;Participles and the habitual aspect\nParticiples, both active and passive, are formed in ''-\u00f6l'':\n:''Log\u00f6l'' seeing, ''elog\u00f6l'' having seen, ''olog\u00f6l'' being about to see, ''palog\u00f6l'' seen (being seen), ''pelog\u00f6l'' seen (having been seen), ''polog\u00f6l'' about to be seen.\n''Binob pen\u00f6l'' is literally 'I am writing', though ''penob'' is also used.  For \"I write\" as habitual action, the [[habitual aspect]] is used.  This is formed by adding ''-i-'' after the tense prefix, and here again the present-tense ''a-'' is required. The forms are thus active ''ai-, \u00e4i-, ei-, ii-, oi-, ui-,'' passive ''pai-, p\u00e4i-, pei-, pii-, poi-, pui-.''  All are pronounced as two syllables.\n:''Aifidob bodi'' I eat bread (as a daily occurrence), ''\u00e4ipenob penedis'' I used to write letters.\nWith temporal words,\n:''aidelo'' daily (at the present time)\n\n;The imperative moods\nThe imperative ''-\u00f6d'' follows the person suffix:\n:''Golol\u00f6d!'' Go! (to one person), ''golols\u00f6d!'' go! (to more than one person)\n\n[[Optative mood|Optative]] ''-\u00f6s'' is used for courteous requests, and [[jussive mood|jussive]] ''-\u00f6z'' an emphatic command.\n\n;Conditional mood\nConditionals are formed with ''-la'' for the [[protasis]] (''if''-clause) and ''-\u00f6v'' for the apodosis (''then''-clause):\n: ''If \u00e4binob-la liegik, \u00e4binob\u00f6v givik''&nbsp;\u2013 if I were rich I would be generous.\n: ''Ibinom\u00f6v givik, if ibinom-la liegik''&nbsp;\u2013 he would have been generous if he had been rich.\n\nNote that the tense changes as well, so that in the first example the past tense is used even though the present tense is intended. Like the question particle, the ''-la'' is written with a hyphen to indicate that it is not stressed in speech.\n\n;Potential mood\nA [[potential mood]] is formed with ''-\u00f6x'':\n:''Pelom\u00f6x'' he might pay.\n\n;Reflexive verbs\nReflexive forms are made from the active voice and the pronoun ''ok'':\n:''Vat\u00fckob'' I wash, ''vat\u00fckobok'' (or  ''vat\u00fckob obi'') I wash myself.\nIn the third person, the periphrastic form of ''vat\u00fckomok'' (he washes himself) must use the reflexive pronoun, ''vat\u00fckom oki'', as ''vat\u00fckom omi'' would mean \"he washes him (someone else)\".\n\nThe plural ''-s'' may precede or follow the reflexive, as the speaker chooses:\n:''vat\u00fckomoks'' or ''vat\u00fckomsok'' they wash themselves.\nHere there is a meaningful distinction between joining the pronoun to the verb, and inflecting it independently:\n:''L\u00f6fobsok'' we love ourselves, ''l\u00f6fobs obis'' we love each other.\n\n;Gerundive\nThe [[gerundive]] arguments{{clarify|date=February 2014}} are active ''\u00f6-'', passive ''p\u00f6-''.\n\n==Examples==\n===The Lord's Prayer===\n{| lang=\"vo\"\n|-\n!|1880 Schleyer Volap\u00fck\n!|1930 de Jong Volap\u00fck\n|-\n||''O Fat obas, kel binol in s\u00fcls,''\n||''O Fat obas, kel binol in s\u00fcls!''\n|-\n||''paisaludom\u00f6z nem ola!''\n||''Nem olik pasal\u00fcd\u00fckon\u00f6d!''\n|-\n||''K\u00f6mom\u00f6d monarg\u00e4n ola!''\n||''Reg\u00e4n ola k\u00f6mon\u00f6d!''\n|-\n||''Jenom\u00f6z vil olik, \u00e4s in s\u00fcl, i su tal!''\n||''Vil olik jenon\u00f6d, \u00e4s\u00e4 in s\u00fcl, i su tal!''\n|-\n||''Bodi obsik v\u00e4deliki givol\u00f6s obes adelo!''\n||''Givol\u00f6s obes adelo bodi aldelik obsik!''\n|-\n||''E pardol\u00f6s obes debis obsik,''\n||''E pardol\u00f6s obes d\u00f6botis obsik,''\n|-\n||''\u00e4s id obs aipardobs debeles obas.''\n||''\u00e4s\u00e4 i obs pardobs utanes, kels ed\u00f6bons kol obs.''\n|-\n||''E no obis nindukol\u00f6s in tendadi;''\n||''E no blufodol\u00f6s obis,''\n|-\n||''sod aidalivol\u00f6s obis de bad.''\n||''ab liv\u00fckol\u00f6s obis de bad!''\n|-\n||\n||(''Ib\u00e4 dutons l\u00fc ol reg\u00e4n, e n\u00e4m\u00e4d e glor j\u00fc \u00fcn laid\u00fcp.'')\n|-\n||''Jenos\u00f6d!''\n||''So binos\u00f6s!''\n|}\n\n===Sample text===\n{{lang|vo|Ven l\u00e4rnoy p\u00fcki votik, v\u00f6dastok pl\u00f6senon fikulis.

One must continuously search for unknown words, and consequently interest is lost. In the elementary part, however, this problem has been overcome, because the relevant translation of each word appears below the Volap\u00fck words. A selection of readings follows, and it is suggested that the Volap\u00fck words be read out loud. The grammar and a basic vocabulary have already been done in the introduction; nevertheless, a quick glance at the translation is recommended to ensure that the overall meaning has been acquired. There is a maxim which states that a little study a day is better than a lot of study all at once.\n\n==Usage as common noun==\nThe word ''Volap\u00fck'' or a variation thereof means \"nonsense, gibberish\" in certain languages, such as Danish<ref>[http://www.cs.umass.edu/~rsnbrg/hardest.pdf \"The Hardest Natural Languages\"] by Arnold L.

This led to schism, with much of the Academy abandoning Schleyer's Volap\u00fck Eiscritzscarben in favor of [[Idiom Neutral]] and other new constructed language projects. Another reason for the decline of Volap\u00fck may have been the rise of [[Esperanto]]. In 1887 the first Esperanto book (''[[Unua Libro]]'') was published. Many Volap\u00fck clubs became Esperanto clubs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nBy 1890 the movement was in disarray, with violent arguments among the members. Schleyer resigned from the Volap\u00fck Academy and created a rival academy. Derived languages such as [[Nal Bino]], Balta, Bopal, Spelin, Dil and Orba were invented and quickly forgotten.<ref name=Pei>{{cite book|last1=Pei|first1=Mario|title=One Language for the World|date=1968|publisher=Biblo and Tannen|location=New York|page=134|url=https://www.questia.com/read/591845/one-language-for-the-world|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=Okrent2012/>\nBy 1900 there were only 159 members of Volap\u00fck clubs recognized by Schleyer.<ref name=\"cherpillod1995\"/>\nThe umlauts, which may have been one of the reasons for the language's eventual decline into obscurity, were the subject of ridicule.

This revision was accepted by the few speakers of the language. De Jong simplified the grammar, eliminating some rarely used verb forms, and eliminated some gendered pronouns and gendered verb endings. He also rehabilitated the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/r/}} and used it to make some morphemes more recognizable. For instance, ''l\u00f6mib'' \"rain\" became ''rein''.<ref>http://www.rickharrison.com/language/dejong.html Arie de Jong's Revision of Volap\u00fck (1931) {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060102205719/http://www.rickharrison.com/language/dejong.html |date=2006-01-02 }} by Ed Robertson</ref>\nVolap\u00fck enjoyed a brief renewal of popularity in the Netherlands and Germany under de Jong's leadership, but was suppressed (along with other constructed languages) in countries under Nazi rule and never recovered.\n\nRegarding the success of this artificial language, the Spanish scientist [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]] wrote in the first edition of his ''Tonics of Willingness'', in 1898:\n\n{{quote|Nowadays, many scientific papers are published in more than six languages. To the likely attempt of restoring Latin or using Esperanto as the universal language of science, wise men have responded by multiplying the number of languages in which scientific works are published. We have to acknowledge that Volap\u00fck or Esperanto are practically one more language to be learnt. This result was predictable because neither the essentially popularized and democratic tendencies of modern knowledge, nor the economic views of authors and editors consent in a different way.<ref>Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, S.

(However, the question clitic \"-li\" does not affect the stress of the word it attaches to.)  Where there is secondary stress, as is found in the compounding of several roots together, it is found on the final syllable between the roots.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nSchleyer adapted the [[vocabulary]] mostly from [[English language|English]], with a smattering of [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]].  Some words  remain readily recognizable for a speaker of one of the source languages, but many others are modified beyond easy recognition.<ref name=\"alexander2005\">\"For example, while it is true that words like vol and p\u00fck don't really look like world and speak, but the whole language is not like that.  Scores of words are very obvious as what they mean&nbsp;\u2013 if, fasilik, gudik/badik, smalik, jerik (pronounced sher\u00edk&nbsp;\u2013 expensive), bank, b\u00e4k (back), deadik\".&nbsp;\u2013 [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0511C&L=AUXLANG&P=R231&D=0&T=0 \"What the L!\"], AUXLANG list posting by Thomas Alexander, 15 November 2005.</ref> For instance, ''vol'' and ''p\u00fck'' are derived from the English words ''world'' and ''speak''. Although unimportant linguistically, and regardless of the simplicity and consistency of the stress rule, these deformations were greatly mocked by the language's detractors. It seems to have been Schleyer's intention, however, to alter its loan words in such a way that they would be hard to recognise, thus losing their ties to the languages (and, by extension, nations) from which they came. Conversely, [[Esperanto]] and [[Interlingua]] are commonly criticized as being much easier to learn for [[European ethnic groups|European]]s than for those with non-European native languages.\n\n==Grammar==\nThe [[grammar]] is based on that of typical European languages, but with an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] character: grammatical inflections are indicated by stringing together separate [[affix]]es for each element of meaning.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns inflect for case and number, but not for gender.\n\nThe following is the declension of the Volap\u00fck word ''vol'' \"world\":\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Case!! Singular !! Plural\n|-\n!Nominative\n| ''vol'' (world)||| ''vols'' (worlds)\n|-\n!Genitive\n| ''vola'' (of the world)|| ''volas'' (of the worlds)\n|-\n!Dative\n| ''vole'' (to the world) || ''voles'' (to the worlds)\n|-\n!Accusative\n| ''voli'' (world) || ''volis'' (worlds)\n|}\n\nAs in [[German language|German]], the Volap\u00fck noun has four cases: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]] and [[accusative case|accusative]]. In compound words, the first part of the compound is usually separated from the second by the genitive termination ''-a'', e.g.&nbsp;''Vola-p\u00fck'', \"of-world language\": \"language of the world\".  However, the other case endings (''-e'' dative, ''-i'' accusative) are sometimes used if applicable, or the roots may be agglutinated in the nominative, with no separating vowel.\n\n===Adjectives and adverbs===\n[[Adjective]]s, formed by the suffix ''-ik'', normally follow the noun they qualify.  They do not agree with the noun in number and case in that position, but do if they precede the noun, are separated from it by intervening words, or stand alone.  [[Adverb]]s are formed by suffixing ''-o'', either to the root or to the adjectival ''-ik'' (''gudik'' \"good\", ''gudiko'' \"well\"); they normally follow the verb or adjective they modify.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThe pronouns begin with ''o-.'' In the singular, they are ''ob'' \"I\", ''ol'' \"[[thou]]\", ''om'' \"he/it\", ''of'' \"she\", ''os'' (impersonal),<ref>''Os'' is used for cases where the pronoun has no obvious antecedent, such as \"I swear it\", and perhaps with [[impersonal verb]]s.  ''Om'' is used for abstract things such as ''lit'' \"light\".</ref> ''on'' \"one\", ''ok'' \"oneself\". They are pluralized with ''-s'': ''obs'' \"we\", ''ols'' \"ye\", ''oms''  \"they\". The possessive may be formed with either the genitive ''-a'' or with adjectival ''-ik'': ''oba'' or ''obik'' \"my\". Prepositions, conjunctions and interjections are also formed from noun roots by appending appropriate suffixes.\n\n===Verbs===\nThe [[verb]] carries a fine degree of detail, with [[morpheme]]s marking [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical voice|voice]], [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical number|number]] and (in the third person) the subject's [[grammatical gender|gender]]. However, many of these categories are optional, and a verb can stand in an unmarked state. A Volap\u00fck verb can be conjugated in 1,584 ways (including infinitives and reflexives).<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Dictionary of Made-Up Languages: From Adunaic to Elvish, Zaum to Klingon-- the Anwa (Real) Origins of Invented Lexicons|last = Rogers|first = Stephen D.|publisher = Adams Media Corporation|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1440528170|location = Avon|pages = 238|url = https://www.questia.com/read/121836205/a-dictionary-of-made-up-languages-from-adunaic-to}}</ref>\n\n;Person\nFor the simple present, the pronouns are suffixed to the verb stem:\n:''binob'' I am, ''binol'' thou art,\netc. The present passive takes the prefix ''pa-'':\n:''pal\u00f6fons'' they are loved.\n\n;Tense, aspect, and voice\nThe three tenses in the [[indicative]], and the three [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] aspects, each take a characteristic vowel prefix:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Tense !!Prefix\n|-\n!Present\n|a-\n|-\n!Past\n|\u00e4-\n|-\n!Present perfect\n|e-\n|-\n!Past perfect\n|i-\n|-\n!Future\n|o-\n|-\n!Future perfect\n|u-\n|}\n\nThe present-tense prefix is omitted in the active voice, so:\n:''binob'' I am, ''\u00e4binol'' you were, ''ebinom'' he has been, ''ibinof'' she had been, ''obinos'' it will be, ''ubinon'' one will have been.\n\nThese are seen as being more distant from the present tense the further the vowel is from {{IPA|[a]}} in [[vowel space]], and they can be used with temporal words to indicate distance in the past or future. For example, from ''del'' 'day',\n:''adelo'' today, ''odelo'' tomorrow, ''udelo'' the day after tomorrow, ''\u00e4delo'' yesterday, ''edelo'' the day before yesterday, ''idelo'' three days ago.\n\nThe [[passive voice]] is formed with ''p-'', and here the ''a'' is required for the present tense:\n:''pal\u00f6fob'' I am loved, ''p\u00e4logol'' you were seen, ''pologobs'' we will be seen.\n\n;Infinitive mood\nThe infinitive is formed with the suffix ''-\u00f6n''.  It can be combined with tense/aspect prefixes:\n:''Log\u00f6n'' to see, ''elog\u00f6n'' to have seen.\n\n;Interrogative mood\nYes\u2013no questions are indicated with the particle ''li'':\n:''P\u00e4logom-li'' was he seen?\nThe hyphen indicates that the syllable ''li'' does not take stress. It occurs before the verb to avoid a sequence of three consonants or a double el:  ''li-p\u00e4logol?  li-binoms?''\n\n;Participles and the habitual aspect\nParticiples, both active and passive, are formed in ''-\u00f6l'':\n:''Log\u00f6l'' seeing, ''elog\u00f6l'' having seen, ''olog\u00f6l'' being about to see, ''palog\u00f6l'' seen (being seen), ''pelog\u00f6l'' seen (having been seen), ''polog\u00f6l'' about to be seen.\n''Binob pen\u00f6l'' is literally 'I am writing', though ''penob'' is also used.  For \"I write\" as habitual action, the [[habitual aspect]] is used.  This is formed by adding ''-i-'' after the tense prefix, and here again the present-tense ''a-'' is required. The forms are thus active ''ai-, \u00e4i-, ei-, ii-, oi-, ui-,'' passive ''pai-, p\u00e4i-, pei-, pii-, poi-, pui-.''  All are pronounced as two syllables.\n:''Aifidob bodi'' I eat bread (as a daily occurrence), ''\u00e4ipenob penedis'' I used to write letters.\nWith temporal words,\n:''aidelo'' daily (at the present time)\n\n;The imperative moods\nThe imperative ''-\u00f6d'' follows the person suffix:\n:''Golol\u00f6d!''

One must continuously search for unknown words, and consequently interest is lost. In the elementary part, however, this problem has been overcome, because the relevant translation of each word appears below the Volap\u00fck words. A selection of readings follows, and it is suggested that the Volap\u00fck words be read out loud. The grammar and a basic vocabulary have already been done in the introduction; nevertheless, a quick glance at the translation is recommended to ensure that the overall meaning has been acquired.

I found myself working in Wyoming living in a bunk house with a bunch of old cowpokes and ranch hands, and a lot of those guys had grown up in a era before radio had even got to Wyoming. Their idea of an evening was to tell stories and sing songs. I was the kid with the guitar I was the accompaniment.I learned a bunch of those songs and got steeped into that tradition. It's a tradition that's almost gone. I've been sort of wondering what to do with that, for decades now.  About four years ago, I did a [[webcast]] with [[Josh Kaufman (musician)|Josh]] and a bunch of the guys from [[The National (band)|The National]]. I enjoyed playing with them a bunch. They decided that they liked my cowboy tunes with the [[Grateful Dead]], and proposed a project where we do some stuff like that.

The series followed the adventures of four young men ([[the Monkees]]) trying to make a name for themselves as a rock 'n roll band. The show introduced a number of innovative new-wave film techniques to series television and won two [[Emmy Award]]s in [[19th Primetime Emmy Awards|1967]], including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]. The program ended in 1968 at the finish of its second season and has received a long afterlife through Saturday morning repeats (CBS and ABC) and syndication, as well as overseas broadcasts; it later enjoyed a 1980s revival, after [[MTV]] aired reruns of the program in 1986. It has aired on Sunday afternoons on [[MeTV]], since February 24, 2019, three days after the death of [[Peter Tork]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{Main|List of The Monkees episodes}}\n{{:List of The Monkees episodes}}\n\nThe series centered on the adventures of the Monkees, a struggling rock band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] consisting of Micky, Davy, Michael, and Peter. The comic elements of the storyline were provided by the strange and often [[surreal humour|surreal]] encounters that the band would have while searching for their big break.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Conception and casting===\nIn the early 1960s, aspiring filmmakers [[Bob Rafelson]] and [[Bert Schneider]] had formed [[Raybert Productions]] and were trying to get a foot in the door in Hollywood. They were inspired by the Beatles' film [[A Hard Day's Night (film)|''A Hard Day's Night'']] and decided to develop a television series about a fictional rock and roll group.<ref name=\"LefcowitzPage7-8\">Lefcowitz (1985), pp.6\u20137</ref> Raybert sold the series idea to Screen Gems in April, 1965,<ref name=\"SandovalPage23\">Sandoval (2005), p.23</ref> and [[Paul Mazursky]] and [[Larry Tucker (screenwriter)|Larry Tucker]] completed a pilot script by August entitled \"The Monkeys\".<ref name=\"SandovalPage25\">Sandoval (2005), p.25</ref> Rafelson has said that he had the idea for a TV series about a music group as early as 1960, but had a hard time interesting anyone in it until 1965, by which time rock and roll music was firmly entrenched in pop culture.\n\nTrade publications ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' ran an ad on September 8, 1965 seeking \"Folk & Roll Musicians-Singers for acting roles in new TV series.\" As many as 400 hopefuls showed up to be considered as one of \"4 insane boys.\"<ref name=\"SandovalPage26\">Sandoval (2005), p.26</ref> Fourteen actors from the audition pool were brought back for screen tests,<ref name=\"MonkeesVHSBox\">Documents reproduced in booklet of VHS box set, Rhino Records, 1995</ref> and Raybert chose their final four after audience research.\n\n[[Micky Dolenz]], son of screen actor [[George Dolenz]], had prior screen experience under the name \"Mickey Braddock\" as the 10-year-old star of the ''[[Circus Boy]]'' series in the 1950s. He was actively auditioning for pilots at the time and was told about the Raybert project by his agent.<ref name=\"SandovalPage26\"/>\n\nEnglishman [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]] was a former jockey who had achieved some initial success on the musical stage, appearing with the cast of ''[[Oliver!]]'' on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' the night of the Beatles' live American debut. He was appearing in Columbia Pictures productions and recording for the [[Colpix]] record label and had been identified in advance as a potential star for the series.<ref name=\"SandovalPage25\"/>\n\nTexan [[Michael Nesmith]]'s mother [[Bette Nesmith Graham]] had invented a [[correction fluid]] and founded the company that became [[Liquid Paper]]. He had served a brief stint in the U.S. Air Force and had also recorded for Colpix under the name \"Michael Blessing.\" He was the only one of The Monkees who had come for the audition based on seeing the trade magazine ad. He showed up to the audition with his laundry<ref name=\"SandovalPage26\"/> and impressed Rafelson and Schneider with his laid-back style and droll sense of humor. He also wore a woollen hat to keep his hair out of his eyes when he rode his motorcycle,<ref name=\"BakerPage10\">Baker (1986), p.10</ref> leading to early promotional materials which nicknamed him \"Wool Hat.\" The hat remained part of Nesmith's wardrobe, but the name was dropped after the pilot.<ref name=\"BakerPage10\"/>\n\n[[Peter Tork]] was recommended to Rafelson and Schneider by friend [[Stephen Stills]] at his audition.<ref name=\"SandovalPage26\"/> Tork was a skilled multi-instrumentalist who had performed at various Greenwich Village folk clubs before moving west, where he worked as a [[busboy]].<ref name=\"SandovalPage26\"/>\n\n===Development===\n[[File:The Monkees 1967.jpg|right|thumb|The Monkees in the Spring of 1966, shortly after production for the first season begun]]\n\nRafelson and Schneider wanted the style of the series to reflect [[avant garde]] film techniques\u2014such as improvisation, quick cuts, jump cuts, breaking the [[fourth wall]], and free-flowing, loose narratives\u2014then being pioneered by European film directors. Each episode would contain at least one musical \"romp\" which might have nothing to do with the storyline. In retrospect, these vignettes now look very much like music videos: short, self-contained films of songs in ways that echoed the Beatles' recent ventures into promotional films for their singles. They also believed strongly in the program's ability to appeal to young people, intentionally framing the kids as heroes and the adults as heavies.<ref name=\"LefcowitzPage3\">Lefcowitz (1985), p.3</ref>\n\nRafelson and Schneider hired novice director [[James Frawley]] to teach the four actors improvisational comedy. Each of the four was given a different personality to portray: Dolenz the funny one, Nesmith the smart and serious one, Tork the naive one, and Jones the cute one. Their characters were loosely based on their real selves, with the exception of Tork, who was actually a quiet intellectual. The character types also had much in common with the respective personalities of [[the Beatles]], with Dolenz representing the madcap attitude of [[John Lennon]], Nesmith affecting the deadpan seriousness of [[George Harrison]], Tork depicting the odd-man-out quality of [[Ringo Starr]], and Jones conveying the pin-up appeal of [[Paul McCartney]].\n\nA pilot episode was shot in San Diego and Los Angeles on a shoestring budget\u2014in many scenes the Monkees wore their own clothes. Initial audience tests (which were just then being pioneered) produced very low responses. Rafelson then re-edited the pilot and included some of the screen tests, to better introduce the band members to viewers. (Dolenz was credited in this pilot as \"Micky Braddock.\") The re-cut pilot tested so well that NBC placed an order for two seasons of episodes. (The edited pilot was broadcast November 14, 1966, as the tenth episode of the first season, with Dolenz credited under his real last name, as for all other episodes.)\n\n===Filming===\n''The Monkees'' debuted September 12, 1966, on the NBC television network. The series was sponsored on alternate weeks by [[Kelloggs|Kellogg's Cereals]] and [[Yardley of London]].\n\nThe series was filmed by [[Screen Gems]], and many of the same sets and props from [[The Three Stooges]] short films made by the studio were used on ''The Monkees'': A pair of [[pajamas]] with a bunny design on the front that had been worn by [[Curly Howard]] in shorts such as ''[[Cactus Makes Perfect (film)|Cactus Makes Perfect]]'' and ''[[In the Sweet Pie and Pie]]'' were the same ones worn by Peter Tork in various episodes such as \"A Coffin Too Frequent\" and \"Monkee See, Monkee Die\".<ref>The Three Stooges Journal, Fall 1987; published by the Three Stooges Fan Club</ref>\n\nTo reduce noise on the set during filming, any of the four Monkees who was not needed in front of the cameras was locked into a converted meat locker.<ref>https://www.womansworld.com/posts/the-monkees-behind-the-scenes-169766</ref> In DVD commentary, Tork noted that this had the added benefit of concealing any marijuana use that might be going on, although he admitted that he was the sole \"serious 'head'\" of the four of them. (In the 1980s, Tork gave up alcohol and marijuana use and had volunteered time to help people recovering from alcoholism.) In a studio outtake included in the 1990s re-release of ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]'', Nesmith quips, before launching into \"Nine Times Blue\": \"Only difference between me and Peter is I'm just ''stone'' legal.\"<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/ne/bootsiepages/mikequotes.html</ref>\n\nDue to the loosely scripted nature of the series, some episodes would come in too short for air. The producers decided to fill time with various \"extras\", including the Monkees' original screen tests and candid interviews with the group (conducted by Rafelson off-camera); these interviews usually lasted one minute, hence the frequent joke, \"We're a minute short as usual,\" though the episode \"Find the Monkees\" featured a three-minute epilogue interview (in which the Monkees gave their opinions on the then-recently occurred [[Sunset Strip curfew riots]]). Although the early episodes contained a [[laugh track]], which was standard practice at the time, the show eventually did not add one, and most of the episodes from Season 2 had no canned laughter. NBC later cited that as one of the reasons for the waning popularity and eventual cancellation of the series.<ref name=\"Iverson\">Iverson, Paul: \"The Advent of the Laugh Track\" Hofstra University archives; February 1994.</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe theme song to ''The Monkees'', \"[[(Theme from) The Monkees]]\" (released as the single in some countries in 1967), is one of the group's most well known songs. The line \"We're the young generation, and we've got somethin' to say\" reflected the new youth counterculture and their desire to give their own opinions on world events and choosing how to live their own lives instead of abiding by the traditions and beliefs of their elders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nFor the second season, the show used a version of the song \"For Pete's Sake\" as the closing theme, which appeared on the Monkees' ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]'' album.\n\n==The Monkees' \"pad\"==\n{{original research|section|date=May 2015}}\nThe Monkees resided in a two-story beach house. The address varied in different episodes.\n* 1334 Beechwood in \u201cYour Friendly Neighborhood Kidnappers\u201d\n* 1424 ???, Malibu, California, in \u201cToo Many Girls\u201d\n* 1438 North Beechwood according to Davy in \u201cThe Case of the Missing Monkee\u201d\n* 1334 North Beechwood Drive, Hollywood, California, according to the telegram in ''[[Head (film)|Head]]''\nThe address 1334 North Beechwood Drive, Hollywood, California, was frequently given in ''[[16 (magazine)|16]]'' magazine as an address to contact [[Screen Gems]] and/or The Monkees. The front of the first floor was a combination of the living room, dining room and kitchen. In the back, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, was an alcove formed by massive floor-to-ceiling bay windows, where the Monkees kept their instruments and rehearsed songs. The walls were covered with various [[kitsch]]y signs and posters, such as the \"MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL\" sign near the kitchen, the \"SCRUB UP\" sign above the kitchen sink, and the \"IN CASE OF FIRE, RUN\" sign with an arrow pointing to an old-fashioned fire extinguisher near the front door. There were also two doors in the kitchen area; one led to a bathroom, the other to Davy and Peter's bedroom. The second floor (via spiral staircase near the front door) only consisted of Micky and Mike's bedroom. By the second season, the upstairs bedroom was occupied by all four Monkees. Also \"residing\" with the Monkees was Mr. Schneider, a mannequin who dispensed philosophical advice with the pull of his cord. Mr. Schneider was named after the show's co-producer Bert Schneider and was mostly voiced by main director James Frawley. During Season One, the boys also had to contend with their bad-tempered landlord Mr. Babbit, who was always yelling at them about various infractions that he thought they were responsible for or threatening to throw them out for not paying the rent.\n\n==Monkeemobile==\n{{Main|Monkeemobile}}\n[[Image:Monkeemobile2.jpg|right|thumb|The Monkeemobile.]]\n\nThe Monkeemobile was a modified [[Pontiac GTO]] designed and built by designer [[Dean Jeffries]]. The car featured a tilted forward split two-piece [[windshield]], a touring car T-bucket-type [[convertible]] top, modified rear quarter panels and front fenders, exaggerated tail lamps, set of four bucket seats with an extra third row bench where the rear deck should have been, and a [[parachute]]. The [[grille|front grille]] sported the GTO emblem.<ref name=\"StAntoine-MT\">St. Antoine, Arthur. - [http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/c12_0511_dean_jeffries_interview/index.html \"Interview: Dean Jeffries, Hollywood legend\"]. - ''[[Motor Trend|Motor Trend Magazine]]''</ref><ref name=\"KeefeD-PEM-1997\">Keefe, Don. - [http://www.monkees.net/DOCS/MMOBILE.HTM \"The History of the MonkeeMobile\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031513/http://www.monkees.net/DOCS/MMOBILE.HTM |date=2008-05-13 }}. - ''Pontiac Enthusiast Magazine''. - (c/o monkees.net) - 1997</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n''The Monkees'' won two Emmy Awards in [[19th Primetime Emmy Awards|1967]]: [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy]] ([[James Frawley]], for the episode \"Royal Flush\"). Frawley was nominated for the same award the following season (for the episode \"The Devil and Peter Tork\"). Its win for Comedy Series was considered somewhat of an upset, as it bested long-time favorites ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', and ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''.\n\n==Decline and cancellation==\nFor its first season (1966-1967), the series fared well in the television ratings bolstered by several hit records by the band. The Monkees became a huge pop culture sensation. However, the public did not realize the show and the band were just a regularly produced television series and the Monkees characters did not write or perform their own studio music, except to provide the vocals. The only exception were their live performances. When the truth became known, there was considerable backlash from many fans and music critics. Liner notes for a 2006 re-release of ''More of the Monkees'' also noted that the album sales had consistently outperformed the TV show's Nielsen ratings; more were listening to the Monkees than watching ''The Monkees'' on TV.\n\nNBC responded to the criticism, and internal tensions, by retooling the show in its second season with the Monkees now writing and performing much of their own music that was much less pop-oriented. In addition, the first season's clean cut looks were replaced by more [[hippy]] looking attire. By 1967, both NBC and the band felt the series had run its course, as even with the changes, the formulaic premises of each episode were beginning to repeat themselves. The series was cancelled in 1968, with the band afforded the right to write their own [[series finale]].<ref name=finalepisode/>\n\nThe series finale, Dolenz's original story \"The Frodis Caper,\" was written as a [[satire]] of the industry and a parting shot thereto: an evil eye resembling the [[CBS]] logo is hypnotizing television viewers everywhere, and the Monkees trace it to an alien plant being manipulated by a villain seeking world domination. When the plant emits smoke, it pacifies the villain, the meaning of which Dolenz stated he would leave to the imagination of the viewer. [[Tim Buckley]], as a special guest, closes out the series with his \"[[Song to the Siren (Tim Buckley song)|Song to the Siren]].\"<ref name=finalepisode/>\n\nHad the series been renewed for a third season, the Monkees had planned on abandoning the sitcom format and retooling the series. Ideas that had been bandied about included a music-centered live show, a [[variety show]] or a [[sketch comedy]] series.<ref name=finalepisode>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-monkees-final-episode/ |title=The Monkees Final Episode |publisher=ultimateclassicrock.com |date= |accessdate=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, The Monkees starred in their own motion picture titled [[Head (film)| Head]]. Elements of the series were included in the film. The film did poorly at the box office and criticism was mostly mixed.\n\n==Syndication==\n''The Monkees'' enjoyed a resurgence on Saturday morning/afternoon television on [[CBS]] from September 1969 to September 1972 (sponsored by [[General Foods]]' [[Kool-Aid]]), and on ABC from September 1972 to August 1973. To coincide with the releases of ''[[The Monkees Present]]'' and ''[[Changes (The Monkees album)|Changes]]'' albums during this time period, many episodes replaced the older songs with tracks from these recent releases.<ref>[http://monkeestv.tripod.com/SaturdayAfternoon/CBS_69-70.html monkeestv.tripod.com]</ref> (This strategy was also employed during the summer of 1967, when many of the first-season episodes had their songs from the first two albums replaced with songs from the then-current single and from the third album ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]].'') <ref>{{cite web|url=http://monkeestv2.tripod.com/season1/66-67_preem-re.html |title=1966-67 PREEMPTIONS & RERUNS |publisher=Monkeestv2.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\nThe 58 episodes were then sold to local markets for syndication in September 1975, where they typically appeared on independent television stations on weekday afternoons (the opening title sequence seen in the syndication package, for all 58 episodes, is from the second season of the original run).\n\nA second, massive resurgence occurred when a ''Monkees'' marathon aired on February 23, 1986 on [[MTV]]. Within months, the 58 episodes were airing regularly throughout the United States on local stations (in edited form), [[Nickelodeon]]/MTV (uncut), as well as Canada on [[MuchMusic]]. Dolenz, Tork and Jones, already reunited for a \"20th Anniversary Tour\", went from playing small clubs to stadiums as the series caught on, and the tour drew critical praise. The popularity led Columbia Pictures to create a \"reboot\" version of the franchise in 1987, ''[[New Monkees]]'', but it flopped and was cancelled after a half season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boone|first1=Brian|title=The Monkees, The Old New Monkees, and New Monkees: How to Destroy A Beloved Franchise|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/11/the-monkees-the-old-new-monkees-and-new-monkees-how-to-destroy-a-beloved-franchise/|website=SplitSider|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe series has aired edited versions on [[Antenna TV]], a digital subchannel network that broadcasts classic programming from the 1950s-1990s era. [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] also picked up the series for reruns in spring 2015. [[Fetv|FETV]], a cable and satellite network, began airing the series in December 2017. In 2018, Canadian superstation [[CHCH-DT|CHCH]] began carrying the series; the station is viewable over-the-air in portions of the United States.\n\nAs of March 3, 2019, restored episodes of The [[Monkees]] will air on [[MeTV]] on Sundays at 5 p.m. and 5:30&nbsp;p.m. after following an overwhelming response to [[Peter Tork]]'s death after MeTV aired two episodes on February 24, as a tribute to the late Monkee.<ref>{{cite web |last1=MeTV Staff |url=https://www.metv.com/stories/the-monkees-join-the-metv-lineup-starting-this-sunday |publisher=MeTV |accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Rhino Records]] now serves as the underlying rights holder for this series, as they acquired the Monkees' music catalog, TV series and official logo from Raybert and Columbia Pictures in 1994. [[Sony Pictures Television]], which has owned Columbia Pictures since 1989, remains the television distributor for syndication.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe TV show ''[[Miami 7]]'', the debut of the British 1990s pop band [[S Club 7]], had a very similar premise. It was the second time that a manufactured band had their own TV show on American television. Likewise, the Nickelodeon sitcom ''[[Big Time Rush (TV series)|Big Time Rush]]'' followed the same basic format and premise, and producers of that show acknowledged ''The Monkees'' as their primary inspiration.<ref name=\"Play\">Martin, Denise. \"Child's Play.\" ''Los Angeles Times.'' November 22, 2009.</ref>\n\nDolenz said in a 2007 interview on the [[Roe Conn]] radio program that, while inspiration did come from the Beatles, the band's image was not meant to be a rip-off of them. He said that the Beatles were always depicted as superstars with legions of fans, whereas the Monkees were always depicted as unsigned and struggling to make a buck. This is reflected numerous times throughout the series, such as in the pilot where Mike Nesmith is seen throwing darts at a Beatles poster, and in the episode \"Find the Monkees (The Audition)\" where the Monkees struggle to see a famous television producer who is looking for a rock act for use in commercial advertisements; in the episode \"I Was a 99-Pound Weakling\", Micky is tricked into signing onto a bogus weight-training program, but objects by noting, \"Where am I gonna get that kind of money? I'm an unemployed drummer.\" Also in a screen test, a Monkee asks what the Beatles have that they don't have.

It was far better TV than it had to be; during an era of formulaic domestic sitcoms and wacky comedies, it was a stylistically ambitious show, with a distinctive visual style, absurdist sense of humor and unusual story structure. Whatever Jones and The Monkees were meant to be, they became creative artists in their own right, and Jones\u2019 chipper Brit-pop presence was a big reason they were able to produce work that was commercial, wholesome and yet impressively weird.\"<ref name=Poniewozik>{{cite journal|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title= RIP Davy Jones, The Monkees' Daydreamboat | journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 2012 | volume= | issue= | pages= | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/02/29/rip-davy-jones-the-monkees-daydreamboat/?xid=rss-topstories |accessdate=February 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nSix two-episode VHS volumes of the television series were distributed by Musicvision/RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video between July 15, 1986 and June 25, 1987, taking advantage of the group's twentieth anniversary.\n\nOn October 17, 1995, with the Monkees' 30th anniversary looming, Rhino Home Video issued the complete series as a deluxe VHS boxed set, containing all 58 episodes, plus the pilot and the 1969 special, ''[[33\u2153 Revolutions Per Monkee]]'', in a total of 21 videotapes, along with a specially created full-color photo book that tells the history of the series, information of each episode and a variety of photographs from the series. First-run issues of the set also included a limited-edition wristwatch. A few months before, on May 22, Columbia House started releasing a Collector's Edition series also collecting all 58 ''Monkees'' episodes and the 1969 special; the one exception being the unaired 1965 ''Monkees'' pilot, which was available only on Rhino's Video Box Set.\n\nRhino later released individual two-episode VHS volumes of the TV series between March 26, 1996 and April 11, 2000; it would be the last time ''The Monkees'' television show would be distributed on videocassette.\n\nIn May and November 2003, [[Rhino Entertainment Company]] (under its ''Rhino Retrovision'' classic TV entertainment brand) released the first two seasons of the original television series on DVD.

The series followed the adventures of four young men ([[the Monkees]]) trying to make a name for themselves as a rock 'n roll band. The show introduced a number of innovative new-wave film techniques to series television and won two [[Emmy Award]]s in [[19th Primetime Emmy Awards|1967]], including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]. The program ended in 1968 at the finish of its second season and has received a long afterlife through Saturday morning repeats (CBS and ABC) and syndication, as well as overseas broadcasts; it later enjoyed a 1980s revival, after [[MTV]] aired reruns of the program in 1986. It has aired on Sunday afternoons on [[MeTV]], since February 24, 2019, three days after the death of [[Peter Tork]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{Main|List of The Monkees episodes}}\n{{:List of The Monkees episodes}}\n\nThe series centered on the adventures of the Monkees, a struggling rock band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] consisting of Micky, Davy, Michael, and Peter. The comic elements of the storyline were provided by the strange and often [[surreal humour|surreal]] encounters that the band would have while searching for their big break.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Conception and casting===\nIn the early 1960s, aspiring filmmakers [[Bob Rafelson]] and [[Bert Schneider]] had formed [[Raybert Productions]] and were trying to get a foot in the door in Hollywood. They were inspired by the Beatles' film [[A Hard Day's Night (film)|''A Hard Day's Night'']] and decided to develop a television series about a fictional rock and roll group.<ref name=\"LefcowitzPage7-8\">Lefcowitz (1985), pp.6\u20137</ref> Raybert sold the series idea to Screen Gems in April, 1965,<ref name=\"SandovalPage23\">Sandoval (2005), p.23</ref> and [[Paul Mazursky]] and [[Larry Tucker (screenwriter)|Larry Tucker]] completed a pilot script by August entitled \"The Monkeys\".<ref name=\"SandovalPage25\">Sandoval (2005), p.25</ref> Rafelson has said that he had the idea for a TV series about a music group as early as 1960, but had a hard time interesting anyone in it until 1965, by which time rock and roll music was firmly entrenched in pop culture.\n\nTrade publications ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' ran an ad on September 8, 1965 seeking \"Folk & Roll Musicians-Singers for acting roles in new TV series.\" As many as 400 hopefuls showed up to be considered as one of \"4 insane boys.\"<ref name=\"SandovalPage26\">Sandoval (2005), p.26</ref> Fourteen actors from the audition pool were brought back for screen tests,<ref name=\"MonkeesVHSBox\">Documents reproduced in booklet of VHS box set, Rhino Records, 1995</ref> and Raybert chose their final four after audience research.\n\n[[Micky Dolenz]], son of screen actor [[George Dolenz]], had prior screen experience under the name \"Mickey Braddock\" as the 10-year-old star of the ''[[Circus Boy]]'' series in the 1950s. He was actively auditioning for pilots at the time and was told about the Raybert project by his agent.<ref name=\"SandovalPage26\"/>\n\nEnglishman [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]] was a former jockey who had achieved some initial success on the musical stage, appearing with the cast of ''[[Oliver!]]'' on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' the night of the Beatles' live American debut. He was appearing in Columbia Pictures productions and recording for the [[Colpix]] record label and had been identified in advance as a potential star for the series.<ref name=\"SandovalPage25\"/>\n\nTexan [[Michael Nesmith]]'s mother [[Bette Nesmith Graham]] had invented a [[correction fluid]] and founded the company that became [[Liquid Paper]]. He had served a brief stint in the U.S. Air Force and had also recorded for Colpix under the name \"Michael Blessing.\" He was the only one of The Monkees who had come for the audition based on seeing the trade magazine ad. He showed up to the audition with his laundry<ref name=\"SandovalPage26\"/> and impressed Rafelson and Schneider with his laid-back style and droll sense of humor. He also wore a woollen hat to keep his hair out of his eyes when he rode his motorcycle,<ref name=\"BakerPage10\">Baker (1986), p.10</ref> leading to early promotional materials which nicknamed him \"Wool Hat.\" The hat remained part of Nesmith's wardrobe, but the name was dropped after the pilot.<ref name=\"BakerPage10\"/>\n\n[[Peter Tork]] was recommended to Rafelson and Schneider by friend [[Stephen Stills]] at his audition.<ref name=\"SandovalPage26\"/> Tork was a skilled multi-instrumentalist who had performed at various Greenwich Village folk clubs before moving west, where he worked as a [[busboy]].<ref name=\"SandovalPage26\"/>\n\n===Development===\n[[File:The Monkees 1967.jpg|right|thumb|The Monkees in the Spring of 1966, shortly after production for the first season begun]]\n\nRafelson and Schneider wanted the style of the series to reflect [[avant garde]] film techniques\u2014such as improvisation, quick cuts, jump cuts, breaking the [[fourth wall]], and free-flowing, loose narratives\u2014then being pioneered by European film directors. Each episode would contain at least one musical \"romp\" which might have nothing to do with the storyline. In retrospect, these vignettes now look very much like music videos: short, self-contained films of songs in ways that echoed the Beatles' recent ventures into promotional films for their singles. They also believed strongly in the program's ability to appeal to young people, intentionally framing the kids as heroes and the adults as heavies.<ref name=\"LefcowitzPage3\">Lefcowitz (1985), p.3</ref>\n\nRafelson and Schneider hired novice director [[James Frawley]] to teach the four actors improvisational comedy. Each of the four was given a different personality to portray: Dolenz the funny one, Nesmith the smart and serious one, Tork the naive one, and Jones the cute one. Their characters were loosely based on their real selves, with the exception of Tork, who was actually a quiet intellectual. The character types also had much in common with the respective personalities of [[the Beatles]], with Dolenz representing the madcap attitude of [[John Lennon]], Nesmith affecting the deadpan seriousness of [[George Harrison]], Tork depicting the odd-man-out quality of [[Ringo Starr]], and Jones conveying the pin-up appeal of [[Paul McCartney]].\n\nA pilot episode was shot in San Diego and Los Angeles on a shoestring budget\u2014in many scenes the Monkees wore their own clothes. Initial audience tests (which were just then being pioneered) produced very low responses. Rafelson then re-edited the pilot and included some of the screen tests, to better introduce the band members to viewers. (Dolenz was credited in this pilot as \"Micky Braddock.\") The re-cut pilot tested so well that NBC placed an order for two seasons of episodes. (The edited pilot was broadcast November 14, 1966, as the tenth episode of the first season, with Dolenz credited under his real last name, as for all other episodes.)\n\n===Filming===\n''The Monkees'' debuted September 12, 1966, on the NBC television network. The series was sponsored on alternate weeks by [[Kelloggs|Kellogg's Cereals]] and [[Yardley of London]].\n\nThe series was filmed by [[Screen Gems]], and many of the same sets and props from [[The Three Stooges]] short films made by the studio were used on ''The Monkees'': A pair of [[pajamas]] with a bunny design on the front that had been worn by [[Curly Howard]] in shorts such as ''[[Cactus Makes Perfect (film)|Cactus Makes Perfect]]'' and ''[[In the Sweet Pie and Pie]]'' were the same ones worn by Peter Tork in various episodes such as \"A Coffin Too Frequent\" and \"Monkee See, Monkee Die\".<ref>The Three Stooges Journal, Fall 1987; published by the Three Stooges Fan Club</ref>\n\nTo reduce noise on the set during filming, any of the four Monkees who was not needed in front of the cameras was locked into a converted meat locker.<ref>https://www.womansworld.com/posts/the-monkees-behind-the-scenes-169766</ref> In DVD commentary, Tork noted that this had the added benefit of concealing any marijuana use that might be going on, although he admitted that he was the sole \"serious 'head'\" of the four of them. (In the 1980s, Tork gave up alcohol and marijuana use and had volunteered time to help people recovering from alcoholism.) In a studio outtake included in the 1990s re-release of ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]'', Nesmith quips, before launching into \"Nine Times Blue\": \"Only difference between me and Peter is I'm just ''stone'' legal.\"<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/ne/bootsiepages/mikequotes.html</ref>\n\nDue to the loosely scripted nature of the series, some episodes would come in too short for air. The producers decided to fill time with various \"extras\", including the Monkees' original screen tests and candid interviews with the group (conducted by Rafelson off-camera); these interviews usually lasted one minute, hence the frequent joke, \"We're a minute short as usual,\" though the episode \"Find the Monkees\" featured a three-minute epilogue interview (in which the Monkees gave their opinions on the then-recently occurred [[Sunset Strip curfew riots]]). Although the early episodes contained a [[laugh track]], which was standard practice at the time, the show eventually did not add one, and most of the episodes from Season 2 had no canned laughter. NBC later cited that as one of the reasons for the waning popularity and eventual cancellation of the series.<ref name=\"Iverson\">Iverson, Paul: \"The Advent of the Laugh Track\" Hofstra University archives; February 1994.</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe theme song to ''The Monkees'', \"[[(Theme from) The Monkees]]\" (released as the single in some countries in 1967), is one of the group's most well known songs. The line \"We're the young generation, and we've got somethin' to say\" reflected the new youth counterculture and their desire to give their own opinions on world events and choosing how to live their own lives instead of abiding by the traditions and beliefs of their elders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nFor the second season, the show used a version of the song \"For Pete's Sake\" as the closing theme, which appeared on the Monkees' ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]'' album.\n\n==The Monkees' \"pad\"==\n{{original research|section|date=May 2015}}\nThe Monkees resided in a two-story beach house. The address varied in different episodes.\n* 1334 Beechwood in \u201cYour Friendly Neighborhood Kidnappers\u201d\n* 1424 ???, Malibu, California, in \u201cToo Many Girls\u201d\n* 1438 North Beechwood according to Davy in \u201cThe Case of the Missing Monkee\u201d\n* 1334 North Beechwood Drive, Hollywood, California, according to the telegram in ''[[Head (film)|Head]]''\nThe address 1334 North Beechwood Drive, Hollywood, California, was frequently given in ''[[16 (magazine)|16]]'' magazine as an address to contact [[Screen Gems]] and/or The Monkees. The front of the first floor was a combination of the living room, dining room and kitchen. In the back, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, was an alcove formed by massive floor-to-ceiling bay windows, where the Monkees kept their instruments and rehearsed songs. The walls were covered with various [[kitsch]]y signs and posters, such as the \"MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL\" sign near the kitchen, the \"SCRUB UP\" sign above the kitchen sink, and the \"IN CASE OF FIRE, RUN\" sign with an arrow pointing to an old-fashioned fire extinguisher near the front door. There were also two doors in the kitchen area; one led to a bathroom, the other to Davy and Peter's bedroom. The second floor (via spiral staircase near the front door) only consisted of Micky and Mike's bedroom. By the second season, the upstairs bedroom was occupied by all four Monkees. Also \"residing\" with the Monkees was Mr. Schneider, a mannequin who dispensed philosophical advice with the pull of his cord. Mr. Schneider was named after the show's co-producer Bert Schneider and was mostly voiced by main director James Frawley. During Season One, the boys also had to contend with their bad-tempered landlord Mr. Babbit, who was always yelling at them about various infractions that he thought they were responsible for or threatening to throw them out for not paying the rent.\n\n==Monkeemobile==\n{{Main|Monkeemobile}}\n[[Image:Monkeemobile2.jpg|right|thumb|The Monkeemobile.]]\n\nThe Monkeemobile was a modified [[Pontiac GTO]] designed and built by designer [[Dean Jeffries]]. The car featured a tilted forward split two-piece [[windshield]], a touring car T-bucket-type [[convertible]] top, modified rear quarter panels and front fenders, exaggerated tail lamps, set of four bucket seats with an extra third row bench where the rear deck should have been, and a [[parachute]]. The [[grille|front grille]] sported the GTO emblem.<ref name=\"StAntoine-MT\">St. Antoine, Arthur. - [http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/c12_0511_dean_jeffries_interview/index.html \"Interview: Dean Jeffries, Hollywood legend\"]. - ''[[Motor Trend|Motor Trend Magazine]]''</ref><ref name=\"KeefeD-PEM-1997\">Keefe, Don. - [http://www.monkees.net/DOCS/MMOBILE.HTM \"The History of the MonkeeMobile\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031513/http://www.monkees.net/DOCS/MMOBILE.HTM |date=2008-05-13 }}. - ''Pontiac Enthusiast Magazine''. - (c/o monkees.net) - 1997</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n''The Monkees'' won two Emmy Awards in [[19th Primetime Emmy Awards|1967]]: [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy]] ([[James Frawley]], for the episode \"Royal Flush\"). Frawley was nominated for the same award the following season (for the episode \"The Devil and Peter Tork\"). Its win for Comedy Series was considered somewhat of an upset, as it bested long-time favorites ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', and ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''.\n\n==Decline and cancellation==\nFor its first season (1966-1967), the series fared well in the television ratings bolstered by several hit records by the band. The Monkees became a huge pop culture sensation. However, the public did not realize the show and the band were just a regularly produced television series and the Monkees characters did not write or perform their own studio music, except to provide the vocals. The only exception were their live performances. When the truth became known, there was considerable backlash from many fans and music critics. Liner notes for a 2006 re-release of ''More of the Monkees'' also noted that the album sales had consistently outperformed the TV show's Nielsen ratings; more were listening to the Monkees than watching ''The Monkees'' on TV.\n\nNBC responded to the criticism, and internal tensions, by retooling the show in its second season with the Monkees now writing and performing much of their own music that was much less pop-oriented. In addition, the first season's clean cut looks were replaced by more [[hippy]] looking attire. By 1967, both NBC and the band felt the series had run its course, as even with the changes, the formulaic premises of each episode were beginning to repeat themselves. The series was cancelled in 1968, with the band afforded the right to write their own [[series finale]].<ref name=finalepisode/>\n\nThe series finale, Dolenz's original story \"The Frodis Caper,\" was written as a [[satire]] of the industry and a parting shot thereto: an evil eye resembling the [[CBS]] logo is hypnotizing television viewers everywhere, and the Monkees trace it to an alien plant being manipulated by a villain seeking world domination. When the plant emits smoke, it pacifies the villain, the meaning of which Dolenz stated he would leave to the imagination of the viewer. [[Tim Buckley]], as a special guest, closes out the series with his \"[[Song to the Siren (Tim Buckley song)|Song to the Siren]].\"<ref name=finalepisode/>\n\nHad the series been renewed for a third season, the Monkees had planned on abandoning the sitcom format and retooling the series. Ideas that had been bandied about included a music-centered live show, a [[variety show]] or a [[sketch comedy]] series.<ref name=finalepisode>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-monkees-final-episode/ |title=The Monkees Final Episode |publisher=ultimateclassicrock.com |date= |accessdate=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, The Monkees starred in their own motion picture titled [[Head (film)| Head]]. Elements of the series were included in the film. The film did poorly at the box office and criticism was mostly mixed.\n\n==Syndication==\n''The Monkees'' enjoyed a resurgence on Saturday morning/afternoon television on [[CBS]] from September 1969 to September 1972 (sponsored by [[General Foods]]' [[Kool-Aid]]), and on ABC from September 1972 to August 1973. To coincide with the releases of ''[[The Monkees Present]]'' and ''[[Changes (The Monkees album)|Changes]]'' albums during this time period, many episodes replaced the older songs with tracks from these recent releases.<ref>[http://monkeestv.tripod.com/SaturdayAfternoon/CBS_69-70.html monkeestv.tripod.com]</ref> (This strategy was also employed during the summer of 1967, when many of the first-season episodes had their songs from the first two albums replaced with songs from the then-current single and from the third album ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]].'') <ref>{{cite web|url=http://monkeestv2.tripod.com/season1/66-67_preem-re.html |title=1966-67 PREEMPTIONS & RERUNS |publisher=Monkeestv2.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\nThe 58 episodes were then sold to local markets for syndication in September 1975, where they typically appeared on independent television stations on weekday afternoons (the opening title sequence seen in the syndication package, for all 58 episodes, is from the second season of the original run).\n\nA second, massive resurgence occurred when a ''Monkees'' marathon aired on February 23, 1986 on [[MTV]]. Within months, the 58 episodes were airing regularly throughout the United States on local stations (in edited form), [[Nickelodeon]]/MTV (uncut), as well as Canada on [[MuchMusic]]. Dolenz, Tork and Jones, already reunited for a \"20th Anniversary Tour\", went from playing small clubs to stadiums as the series caught on, and the tour drew critical praise. The popularity led Columbia Pictures to create a \"reboot\" version of the franchise in 1987, ''[[New Monkees]]'', but it flopped and was cancelled after a half season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boone|first1=Brian|title=The Monkees, The Old New Monkees, and New Monkees: How to Destroy A Beloved Franchise|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/11/the-monkees-the-old-new-monkees-and-new-monkees-how-to-destroy-a-beloved-franchise/|website=SplitSider|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe series has aired edited versions on [[Antenna TV]], a digital subchannel network that broadcasts classic programming from the 1950s-1990s era. [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] also picked up the series for reruns in spring 2015. [[Fetv|FETV]], a cable and satellite network, began airing the series in December 2017. In 2018, Canadian superstation [[CHCH-DT|CHCH]] began carrying the series; the station is viewable over-the-air in portions of the United States.\n\nAs of March 3, 2019, restored episodes of The [[Monkees]] will air on [[MeTV]] on Sundays at 5 p.m. and 5:30&nbsp;p.m. after following an overwhelming response to [[Peter Tork]]'s death after MeTV aired two episodes on February 24, as a tribute to the late Monkee.<ref>{{cite web |last1=MeTV Staff |url=https://www.metv.com/stories/the-monkees-join-the-metv-lineup-starting-this-sunday |publisher=MeTV |accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Rhino Records]] now serves as the underlying rights holder for this series, as they acquired the Monkees' music catalog, TV series and official logo from Raybert and Columbia Pictures in 1994. [[Sony Pictures Television]], which has owned Columbia Pictures since 1989, remains the television distributor for syndication.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe TV show ''[[Miami 7]]'', the debut of the British 1990s pop band [[S Club 7]], had a very similar premise. It was the second time that a manufactured band had their own TV show on American television. Likewise, the Nickelodeon sitcom ''[[Big Time Rush (TV series)|Big Time Rush]]'' followed the same basic format and premise, and producers of that show acknowledged ''The Monkees'' as their primary inspiration.<ref name=\"Play\">Martin, Denise. \"Child's Play.\" ''Los Angeles Times.'' November 22, 2009.</ref>\n\nDolenz said in a 2007 interview on the [[Roe Conn]] radio program that, while inspiration did come from the Beatles, the band's image was not meant to be a rip-off of them. He said that the Beatles were always depicted as superstars with legions of fans, whereas the Monkees were always depicted as unsigned and struggling to make a buck. This is reflected numerous times throughout the series, such as in the pilot where Mike Nesmith is seen throwing darts at a Beatles poster, and in the episode \"Find the Monkees (The Audition)\" where the Monkees struggle to see a famous television producer who is looking for a rock act for use in commercial advertisements; in the episode \"I Was a 99-Pound Weakling\", Micky is tricked into signing onto a bogus weight-training program, but objects by noting, \"Where am I gonna get that kind of money? I'm an unemployed drummer.\" Also in a screen test, a Monkee asks what the Beatles have that they don't have. They sing \"Thirteen million dollars!\"\n\nWhen commenting on the death of Davy Jones on February 29, 2012, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine contributor James Poniewozik praised the show: \"Even if the show never meant to be more than entertainment and a hit-single generator, we shouldn\u2019t sell ''The Monkees'' short. It was far better TV than it had to be; during an era of formulaic domestic sitcoms and wacky comedies, it was a stylistically ambitious show, with a distinctive visual style, absurdist sense of humor and unusual story structure. Whatever Jones and The Monkees were meant to be, they became creative artists in their own right, and Jones\u2019 chipper Brit-pop presence was a big reason they were able to produce work that was commercial, wholesome and yet impressively weird.\"<ref name=Poniewozik>{{cite journal|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title= RIP Davy Jones, The Monkees' Daydreamboat | journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 2012 | volume= | issue= | pages= | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/02/29/rip-davy-jones-the-monkees-daydreamboat/?xid=rss-topstories |accessdate=February 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nSix two-episode VHS volumes of the television series were distributed by Musicvision/RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video between July 15, 1986 and June 25, 1987, taking advantage of the group's twentieth anniversary.\n\nOn October 17, 1995, with the Monkees' 30th anniversary looming, Rhino Home Video issued the complete series as a deluxe VHS boxed set, containing all 58 episodes, plus the pilot and the 1969 special, ''[[33\u2153 Revolutions Per Monkee]]'', in a total of 21 videotapes, along with a specially created full-color photo book that tells the history of the series, information of each episode and a variety of photographs from the series. First-run issues of the set also included a limited-edition wristwatch. A few months before, on May 22, Columbia House started releasing a Collector's Edition series also collecting all 58 ''Monkees'' episodes and the 1969 special; the one exception being the unaired 1965 ''Monkees'' pilot, which was available only on Rhino's Video Box Set.\n\nRhino later released individual two-episode VHS volumes of the TV series between March 26, 1996 and April 11, 2000; it would be the last time ''The Monkees'' television show would be distributed on videocassette.\n\nIn May and November 2003, [[Rhino Entertainment Company]] (under its ''Rhino Retrovision'' classic TV entertainment brand) released the first two seasons of the original television series on DVD. Seasons 1 and 2 were each released separately, six DVDs for Season 1 and five DVDs for Season 2. Both seasons were re-released by Eagle Rock Entertainment on Sept. 27, 2011.\n\nIn honor of The Monkees' 50th anniversary, Rhino released the complete series on Blu-ray on July 8, 2016, after a two-week delay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Monkees-The-Complete-Series/22187|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613201157/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Monkees-The-Complete-Series/22187|archivedate=2016-06-13}}</ref><ref>[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Monkees-The-Complete-Series/22362 New (and 'Final'!)

The city plan calls for more growth along Highway 7 and less towards the farmland to the north. A similar development in Cornell promotes the need for services to be closer to residences.\n\n===Transit plan===\nLinked to the concern of urban growth, Markham through [[York Region Transit]] (YRT) has implemented a transit system called [[Viva (bus rapid transit)|Viva]] to ease the strain on the region's congested roads. Viva is similar to YRT but is used as an express bus service with the ability to change traffic signals to help reduce delays. The YRT is also planning to build a transit terminal somewhere near Cornell soon.\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Varley Art Gallery Unionville.JPG|thumb|right|[[Frederick Horsman Varley Art Gallery]]]]\n[[File:FormerMarkhamCNRStn,ON-3.JPG|thumb|right|[[Markham GO Station]]]]\nMarkham has retained its historic past in part of the town.

The [[Thomas Speight Wagon Works]] exported products (wagons, horsecars) around the world, and Markham had a reputation as being more active than York (the former name for Toronto) early on. Most of these industries disappeared leaving farming as the main source of business.\n\nLight industries and businesses began to move into Markham in the 1980s attracted by land and lower taxes. Today, it claims to be \"Canada's Hi-Tech Capital\" with a number of key companies in the area, such as IBM, [[Motorola Canada head office|Motorola]], Toshiba, [[Lucent Technologies|Lucent]], [[Honeywell]], Apple, [[Genesis Microchip]], and is home to the head office of graphics card producer ATI (recently merged with AMD).

The city plan calls for more growth along Highway 7 and less towards the farmland to the north. A similar development in Cornell promotes the need for services to be closer to residences.\n\n===Transit plan===\nLinked to the concern of urban growth, Markham through [[York Region Transit]] (YRT) has implemented a transit system called [[Viva (bus rapid transit)|Viva]] to ease the strain on the region's congested roads. Viva is similar to YRT but is used as an express bus service with the ability to change traffic signals to help reduce delays. The YRT is also planning to build a transit terminal somewhere near Cornell soon.\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Varley Art Gallery Unionville.JPG|thumb|right|[[Frederick Horsman Varley Art Gallery]]]]\n[[File:FormerMarkhamCNRStn,ON-3.JPG|thumb|right|[[Markham GO Station]]]]\nMarkham has retained its historic past in part of the town.
