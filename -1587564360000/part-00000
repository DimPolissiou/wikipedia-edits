YRN was made-up of [[Pennine Radio (radio station)|Pennine Radio]] in [[Bradford]], [[96.9 Viking FM|Viking Radio]] in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Hallam FM|Radio Hallam]] in [[Sheffield]].\n\n==History==\n\nYRN was based{{what|date=September 2016}} in Sheffield at Radio Hallam [https://web.archive.org/web/20070417195357/http://www.mediauk.com/the_knowledge/i.muk/Yorkshire_Radio_Network], although all of the live programmes came from Studio 2 at Viking Radio in Hull [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125539/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=567916&page=2].\n\nThe company came about when Radio Hallam merged with Pennine Radio and later took over Viking Radio in 1987 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070518205936/http://www.keithskues.co.uk/biography.htm].\n\nIn 1989 all of the three radio stations' [[medium wave]] frequencies were used to form a new service called [[Classic Gold]]. YRN was bought by the [[Metro Radio group]] and as Pennine was making a loss they decided to rename it. [[The Pulse of West Yorkshire]] was born [https://web.archive.org/web/20070416071204/http://www.mediauk.com/the_knowledge/i.muk/The_Pulse], the station was later sold off.\n\nFor a while YRN used the overnight sustaining service \"[[The Superstation]]\" .\n\n==Programming==\n\nThere was [[Live radio|live]] networked programming across the stations each evening broadcast from Viking Radio's [[studio]]'s at Commercial Road in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. The programmes would mostly start after 8pm weekdays and slightly earlier over weekends.\n\nAd-breaks were not split so it was not unusual to hear [[promo (media)|promo]]s for Viking whilst you were listening to either Hallam or Pennine. However, both \"Benny Brown's American Countdown\" and \"[[Rick Dees]] Weekly Top-40\" programmes where bought in and played-out locally by each station, so the commercials were also played separately by the tech-ops at each individual station.\n\nTim Finlay would often say \"''we're on more frequencies than you've had hot dinners!''\", those frequencies before the [[AM broadcasting|AM]]/[[FM broadcasting|FM]] split were 96.1, 96.9, 97.4, 97.5, 102.5, 102.9, 103.2 and 103.4&nbsp;MHz and 990, 1161, 1278, 1305, 1530 and 1548&nbsp;kHz.\n\nFor a short-time Howard Pressman presented a Weekend afternoon show on the [[radio network|network]]. However, there was no reference to which station it was on other than in the jingles, which were only ever played after the ad-break and fired at each individual station.\n\n==Jingles==\n\nEach [[jingle]] was sung with different endings to ensure each station was fairly represented, for example:\n\n:''\"Latest hits, Greatest hits, Pennine, Hallam and Viking\"''.\n\n:''\"Every hour there's more music power, on Viking, Hallam and Pennine\"''.\n\n:''\"Where with you all the time, Pennine, Hallam and Viking\"''.\n\n:''\"Upfront, In front, Hallam, Pennine and Viking\"''.\n\nThis was a remarkably democratic process and was not present with previous packages. The older jingles would either sing '''\"Yorkshire Radio Network\"''' thus, not naming any station at all, or the order of the stations would be '''\"Viking, Pennine and Hallam\"''' this being unfair to Hallam, which was always last.\n\nEach YRN cut was also sung for each individual station with the same melody. This was to ensure one identity throughout each station regardless of the time of day, for example:\n\n:''\"Every hour there's more music power, on Viking F.M\"''.\n\n:''\"Every hour there's more music power, on Pennine F.M\"''.\n\n:''\"Every hour there's more music power, on Hallam F.M\"''.\n\nThe memorable YRN news jingle was re-produced several times, however the [[Melody|tune]] remained the same. This jingle was used on the individual stations. It was formed using the melody used at the start of that of 'Viking Radio' (also that of 'Pennine Radio'), and the end of that of 'Radio Hallam'.\n\nSome of the earlier jingles were sung by [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Jimmy Helms]]. Helms later went on to form the group [[Londonbeat]], they were regular guests on Tim Finlay's evening show, and they even sang him a jingle to the tune of their hit \"Failing in love again\".\n\nAll of the packages were created and written by British jingle production company [[Alfasound]], with the final package being a co-production with United States Company [[JAM Creative Productions]]. The YRN 4 jingle package used resings of \"Non-Stop Power\" - originally created for New York radio station [[WPLJ]].\n\n==Former presenters: Where are they now?==\n\n* [[Tim Finlay]] (performing in a functions band  called \"Midlife Crisis\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095414/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=486503&highlight=Tim+Finlay]\n* [[Diana Luke]] (now at [[BBC Radio Sheffield]]).\n* Steve Tong (after a name change to 'Steve Phillips' he moved to [[Great North Radio]], then [[Alpha 103.2]]).\n* James Watt ([[BBC Tees]], [[KCFM (FM)|KCFM]], now at [[BBC Radio Stoke]]<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02p89mk#auto</ref>).\n* Allis Moss (last heard at [[BBC Radio Five Live]]).\n* James Hilton.\n* Freddie Allen [https://web.archive.org/web/20110711023702/http://www.freddieallen.com/about.html].\n* Les Smith (now at [[Compass FM]] in [[Grimsby]]).\n* Paul Massey (last heard on [[KCFM (FM)|KCFM]] in Hull).\n* [[Keith Skues]] (now at [[BBC Radio Norfolk]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070518205936/http://www.keithskues.co.uk/biography.htm]).\n* Tim Jibson (former Programme Manager for [[KCFM (FM)|KCFM]]).\n* Bruce Edwards (last heard on [[BBC Tees]] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/tees/content/articles/2006/01/16/presenter_profile_bruce_edwards_feature.shtml]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}).\n* Martin Lee (last heard on [[Vale FM|97.4 Gold Radio]]).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cubwolf.co.uk/jingles.htm Jingle package 2 for YRN]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083900/http://www.adamfi.co.uk/Yorkshire_Radio_Network_1.mp3 Promo, jingle feat.

{"title_page": "Security of person", "text_new": "'''Security of the person''' is a basic entitlement guaranteed by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1948.  It is also a [[human right]] explicitly mentioned and protected by the  [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the [[Constitution of Canada]], the [[Constitution of South Africa]] and other laws around the world.\n\nIn general, the right to the security of one's person is associated with [[liberty]] and includes the right, if one is imprisoned unlawfully, to a remedy such as ''[[habeas corpus]]''.<ref>Rhona K.M. Smith, ''Textbook on International Human Rights'', second edition, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 240.</ref>  Security of person can also be seen as an expansion of rights based on prohibitions of [[torture]] and [[cruel and unusual punishment]].  Rights to security of person can guard against less lethal conduct, and can be used in regard to prisoners' rights.<ref>Smith, p. 245.</ref>\n\n==United Nations==\nThe right to security of the person is guaranteed by Article 3 of the ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]''. In this article, it is combined with the [[right to life]] and liberty. In full, the article reads, \"Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.\"\n\nThe United Nations treaty, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966), also recognizes a right to security of person.  Article 3 states that \"Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person,\" and the section prohibits \"arbitrary arrest or detention.\"  The section continues, \"No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.\"\n\n== Europe ==\nThe right to security of the person is mentioned in Article 5(1) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] under the heading ''Right to liberty and security'' (\"Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\") and in Article 6 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] (\"Everyone  has  the  right  to  liberty  and  security  of  person\"). \n\n==Canada==\nThe right to security of the person was recognized in [[Canada]] in the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] in 1960. Section 1(a) of this law recognized \"the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by [[due process]] of law.\" However, the Bill of Rights was a statute and not part of the Constitution.\n\nIn 1982, a right to security of the person was added to the Constitution.  It was included in [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which stipulates that \"Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of [[fundamental justice]].\"  Security of the person in section 7 consists of rights to privacy of the body and its health<ref>Hogg, Peter W.  ''Constitutional Law of Canada.''  2003 Student Ed.  Scarborough, Ontario:  Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, 981.</ref> and of the right protecting the \"psychological integrity\" of an individual. That is, the right protects against significant government-inflicted harm ([[Stress (medicine)|stress]]) to the mental state of the individual. (''[[Blencoe v. B.C. (Human Rights Commission)]]'', 2000)\n\nThis right has generated significant case law, as [[abortion in Canada]] was legalized in ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'' (1988) after the Supreme Court found the [[Therapeutic Abortion Committee]]s breached women's security of person by threatening their health.  Some judges also felt control of the body was a right within security of the person, breached by the abortion law.  In ''[[Operation Dismantle v. The Queen]]'' (1985) [[cruise missile]] testing was unsuccessfully challenged as violating security of the person for risking [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. In ''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'' (2005), some Supreme Court justices even considered [[Quebec]]'s ban on private [[health care]] to breach security of the person, since delays in medical treatment could have physical and stressful consequences.\n\nThere has been discussion within the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] and among academics as to whether security of the person also guarantees some economic rights.  Theoretically, security of the person would be breached if the government limits a person's ability to make an income, by denying [[Social welfare provision|welfare]], taking away property essential to one's profession, or denying licenses.  However, section 7 is primarily concerned with legal rights, so this reading of economic rights is questionable.  Many economic issues could also be [[political question]]s.<ref>Hogg, 983.</ref>\n\n==Turkey==\nThe [[Constitution of Turkey]] guarantees security of person, along with the right to liberty, in Article 19, enacted in 1982 and amended in 2001.  The article spells out limits to these rights in the form of rulings of courts under the law, allowing for mental institutions and institutions for addicts, [[extradition]], etc.  The article also limits arrest and detention to cases in which a judge allows it, where there is not enough time for this, or the person is seen being responsible for a crime.  A person will then be told why they have been arrested, and their [[next of kin]] will also be told of the arrest. Finally, the article allows for government compensation if these rights are violated.\n\n==New Zealand==\nThe [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act]], adopted in 1990, guarantees \"Life and security of the person\" in sections 8 through 11.  Section 8 guarantees a right to life except when deprived in accordance with fundamental justice, while section 9 prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.  Section 10 prohibits a person being subjected to medical treatment against his or her will.  Finally, section 11 gives a [[New Zealand]]er the right to not take medical treatment.\n\n==United Kingdom==\nSecurity of person is mentioned in Schedule I Article 5 of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents/data.htm|title=Human Rights Act 1998|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref>  This version is the latest incarnation of the Act, though there have been minor edits since.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/search/data.htm|title=Legislation.gov.uk|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref>  This new act represents one aspect of [[Tony Blair]]'s \"Constitutional Reform\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--<nowiki>Please do not type footnotes here.

Here, it was combined with a \"right to [[Freedom (political)|freedom]].\"  Section 12 went on to define security of the person and the right to freedom more thoroughly, including within it bodily control and reproductive control, freedom from torture and cruel and unusual punishment and a right to trial. In full, section 12 reads,\n\n{{quotation|\n:12.  (1) Everyone has the right to freedom and security of the person, which includes the right\n::(a) not to be deprived of freedom arbitrarily or without just cause;\n::(b) not to be detained without trial;\n::(c) to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources;\n::(d) not to be tortured in any way; and\n::(e) not to be treated or punished in a cruel, inhuman or degrading way.\n\n:(2) Everyone has the right to bodily and psychological integrity, which includes the right\n::(a) to make decisions concerning reproduction;\n::(b) to security in and control over their body; and\n::(c) not to be subjected to medical or scientific experiments without their informed consent.\n}}\n\n==Turkey==\nThe [[Constitution of Turkey]] guarantees security of person, along with the right to liberty, in Article 19, enacted in 1982 and amended in 2001.

Both countries were former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]]s of the former [[USSR]]. Armenia and Georgia governments have had generally positive relations, but there have also been some problems in the past. Georgia is a member of [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development|GUAM]], which leaves Armenia out of regional transportation and energy projects.\n\nRelations with Georgia are of particular importance for Armenia because, under the border blockades imposed against Armenia by [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]] due to the ongoing [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], Georgia offers Armenia its only land connection with [[Europe]] and access to its Black Sea ports. However, because of Armenia's reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought in the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia's imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia.\n\nThe Javakheti region in southern Georgia contains a large Armenian population and although there have been local civic organizations (such as United Javakhk) pushing for autonomy, there has been no violence between Armenians and Georgians in the area. The border disputes resulted in the [[Georgian\u2013Armenian War]].

The interaction peaked in the Middle Ages when both nations engaged in prolific cultural dialogue and allied themselves against the neighboring Muslim empires. There were frequent intermarriages between Armenian and Georgian royal and noble families, and both ethnicities intermingled in several border areas.\n\n===The Roman Conquest ===\n\n{{Main|Roman Armenia}}\n[[File:Roman-Persian Frontier, 565 AD.png|thumb|left|Lazica province of Eastern Roman Empire in 565 AD]]\n\nThis close association with Armenia brought upon the country an invasion (65 BC ) by the Roman general [[Pompey]], who was then at war with [[Mithradates VI of Pontus]], and Armenia; but Rome did not establish her power permanently over Iberia. Nineteen years later, the Romans again marched (36 BC) on Iberia forcing King [[Pharnavaz II of Iberia|Pharnavaz II]] to join their campaign against [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]].<ref>Braund, D., Georgia in Antiquity: A History of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia 550 BC \u2013 AD 562, Oxford University Press, 1996, p 36</ref>  \n[[File:Ashotkurapalatgeorgia.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Ashot I of Iberia|Ashot Kurapalates]], first [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagrationi]] King of Georgia, 829 AD]]\nDuring this time Armenia and Pontus were actively expanding at the expense of Rome, taking over its Eastern Mediterranean possessions. However, the success of the anti-Roman alliance did not last long. As a result of the brilliant Roman campaigns of Pompey and [[Lucullus]] from the west, and the [[Parthia]]n invasion from the south, Armenia lost a significant part of its conquests by 65 BC, devolving into a Roman-Parthian dependency. At the same time, the [[Kingdom of Pontus]] was completely destroyed by the Romans and all its territory including Colchis were incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] as her provinces.\n\nThe former Kingdom of Colchis became the Roman province of [[Egrisi|Lazicum]] ruled by Roman [[Legatus|legati]]. The following 600 years of Georgian history were marked by struggle between Rome and Persia (Iran) including [[Parthia]]ns and [[Sassanids]] who were fighting long wars against each other for the domination in the Middle East including Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]], and Iberia.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, Iberia strengthened her position in the area, especially during the reign of King [[Pharsman II]] who achieved full independence from Rome and reconquered some of the previously lost territories from declining Armenia. In the early 3rd century, Rome had to give up Albania and most of Armenia to [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persia]]. The province of Lazicum was given a degree of autonomy that by the end of the century developed into full independence with the formation of a new Kingdom of Lazica-Egrisi on the territories of smaller principalities of the Zans, Svans, Apsyls, and Sanyghs. This new Western Georgian state survived more than 250 years until 562 when it was absorbed by the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nWhile the Georgian kingdom of Colchis was administered as a Roman province, [[Caucasian Iberia]] freely accepted the Roman Imperial protection. A stone inscription discovered at [[Mtskheta]] speaks of the 1st-century ruler Mihdrat I (AD 58-106) as \"the friend of the Caesars\" and the king \"of the Roman-loving Iberians.\" Emperor [[Vespasian]] fortified the ancient Mtskheta site of Arzami for the Iberian kings in 75 AD.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, Iberia strengthened her position in the area, especially during the reign of King [[Pharsman II]] who achieved full independence from Rome and reconquered some of the previously lost territories from declining Armenia.\n\nIn the 3rd century AD, the [[Laz people|Lazi]] tribe came to dominate most of Colchis, establishing the kingdom of [[Lazica]], locally known as Egrisi. Colchis was a scene of the protracted rivalry between the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]]/[[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] empires, culminating in the [[Lazic War]] from 542 to 562.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/16*.html|title=J.

In 1071, the Seljuq army destroyed the united Byzantine-Armenian and Georgian forces in the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. By 1081, all of Armenia, [[Anatolia]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]], and most of Georgia had been conquered and devastated by the Seljuqs. By the end of the 1080s, Georgians were outnumbered in the region by the invaders. The defeat of the [[Bagratuni Dynasty]] ended Christian leadership of Armenia for the next millennium.[[File:Geor tamro aandersen.png|250px|thumb|Kingdom of Georgia at peak of its military dominance, 1184-1225]]\nThe struggle against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] invaders in Georgia was led by the young [[David IV of Georgia|King David IV]] Bagrationi (reigning 1089-1125). Georgians freed Shirvan and a large portion of Armenia. Thus in 1124 David also became the King of [[Armenians]], incorporating Northern Armenia into the lands of the Georgian Crown. In 1125 King David died, leaving Georgia with the status of a strong regional power.\n\nThe reign of [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]] represented the peak of Georgia's might in the whole history of the nation. The question of [[Georgian military campaigns over Armenian lands|liberation of Armenia]] remained of prime importance in Georgia's foreign policy. Tamar's armies led by ethnic Armenian generals from the [[Zakarids|Zakarian]] Family, [[Zakaria II Mkhargrdzeli|Zakare]] and [[Ivane Mkhargrdzeli]] overran fortresses and cities towards the [[Ararat Plain]], reclaiming one after another fortresses and districts from local Muslim rulers. As a result of [[Battle of Basian]], between 1203-1205 Georgians seized the town of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]<ref>{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=150}}.</ref> and entered [[Ahlat|Akhlatshah]] possessions twice and subdued the emir of [[Kars]] (vassal of the [[Saltukids]] in Erzurum), [[Shah-Armens|Akhlatshahs]], the emirs of [[Saltukids|Erzurum]] and [[House of Meng\u00fcjek|Erzincan]].\n\nThe temporary fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1204 to the Crusaders left Georgia as the strongest Christian state in the whole East Mediterranean area. Muslim power in [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Greater Armenia]] was seriously troubled by the resurgent Georgian monarchy. Many local nobles (''nakharars'') joined their efforts with the [[Georgians]], leading to [[Armenia within the Kingdom of Georgia|liberation of several areas in northern Armenia]], which was ruled, under the authority of the Georgian crown, by the [[Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli|Mkhargrdzeli]], a prominent Armeno-Georgian noble family.\n\n==== Mongol invasions ====\n{{main|Mongol invasions of Georgia}}\nThe kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 10th to 12th centuries, and fell to the [[Mongol invasions of Georgia]] by 1243, and after a brief reunion under [[George V of Georgia]] to the [[Timurid Empire]].\n\n==== Ottoman and Persian domination ====\nBy 1490, Georgia was fragmented into a number of petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the [[Early Modern period]] struggled to maintain their autonomy against Iranian (successive [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]], [[Afsharid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar dynasties]]) and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] domination until Georgia was finally annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1801.

In June 1918, in order to forestall an Ottoman advance on [[Tiflis]], the Georgian troops had occupied former districts of [[Tiflis Governorate]], the [[Lori Province]] which at the time had a 75% Armenian majority. After the [[Armistice of Mudros]] and the withdrawal of the Ottomans, the Georgian forces remained. Georgian [[Menshevik]] parliamentarian [[Irakli Tsereteli]] offered that the Armenians would be safer from the Turks as Georgian citizens. The Georgians offered a quadripartite conference including Georgia, Armenia, [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]], and the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]] in order to resolve the issue which the Armenians rejected. In December 1918, the Georgians were confronting a rebellion chiefly in the village of [[Odzun|Uzunlar]] in the Lori region. Within days, hostilities commenced between the two republics.<ref name=\"Walker\">Armenian the Survival of a Nation, Christopher Walker pg 267-268</ref>\n\nThe [[Georgian\u2013Armenian War]] was a border war fought in 1918 between the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] over the parts of then disputed province of [[Lori Province|Lori]].\n\n=== As Soviet republics ===\n\n==== Transcaucasian SFSR (1922\u20131936) ====\nFrom March 12, 1922 to December 5, 1936, Armenia and Georgia were a part of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] together with the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]. In 1936, the TSFSR was dissolved under Stalin's orders and the socialist republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were established instead.\n\n==== Armenian SSR and Georgian SSR (1936\u20131991) ====\n{{see also|Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic}}\n\nIn the Soviet Union, [[Armenians]] and [[Georgian people|Georgians]], along with [[Russians]], [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]], [[Belarusians]], [[Germans]], and [[Jews]] were judged as \"advanced\" peoples, and were grouped together as Western nationalities.<ref>Martin, Terry (2001).

The [[United States]] recognized both independence of the nations on [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|December 25, 1991]].\n\nArmenian-Georgian relations in the post-independence period have been mixed but cooperative. The two states are each one allied with the other one's adversaries (Armenia with Russia, Georgia with [[Azerbaijan]] and Turkey), but they are nevertheless obliged to maintain cooperative ties: the border blockades imposed by Turkey and Azerbaijan on Armenia makes Georgia (and, via a single route, Iran) the only possible trade partner of Armenia.\n\nRecent revelations indicate that [[Yerevan]] had taken steps to assure Tbilisi that it had Armenia's all-but-official support in the outbreak of the 2008 South Ossetian and Abkhazian conflict. Armenia offered itself as a safe haven for Georgians escaping the conflict, and at one point, temporarily housed at least 500 Georgian families escaping the war. To this day, Armenia has not recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. However, the establishment of diplomatic relations between Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and the separatist Republic of Artsakh has drawn criticism from the Georgian government, notably during President Salome Zourabichvili's visit to Armenia in March 2019. Moreover, the Armenian Apostolic Church's decision to place Armenian churches in Abkhazia under the jurisdiction of its South Russian Eparchy instead of the Church's Eparchy of Georgia was rescinded after a meeting between President Zourabichvili and Catholicos Karekin II.\n\nAccording to Wikileaks, however, Armenia's foreign diplomats grew increasingly frustrated with Tbilisi's inability to respond to calls or diplomatic cables from Yerevan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://massispost.com/?p=981|title=WikiLeaks: Georgia Offended Armenian Government Leaders During August War With Russia - Armenian News By MassisPost|date=30 November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref> Despite their reluctance to warmly embrace each other diplomatically, the differences between the two nations are more often highlighted by political rather than social or historical differences.\n\nPositive steps have been taken to strengthen ties between the two nations.

Both countries were former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]]s of the former [[USSR]]. Armenia and Georgia governments have had generally positive relations, but there have also been some problems in the past. Georgia is a member of [[GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development|GUAM]], which leaves Armenia out of regional transportation and energy projects.\n\nRelations with Georgia are of particular importance for Armenia because, under the border blockades imposed against Armenia by [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]] due to the ongoing [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], Georgia offers Armenia its only land connection with [[Europe]] and access to its Black Sea ports. However, because of Armenia's reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought in the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia's imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia.\n\nThe Javakheti region in southern Georgia contains a large Armenian population and although there have been local civic organizations (such as United Javakhk) pushing for autonomy, there has been no violence between Armenians and Georgians in the area. The border disputes resulted in the [[Georgian\u2013Armenian War]].

The interaction peaked in the Middle Ages when both nations engaged in prolific cultural dialogue and allied themselves against the neighboring Muslim empires. There were frequent intermarriages between Armenian and Georgian royal and noble families, and both ethnicities intermingled in several border areas.\n\n===The Roman Conquest ===\n\n{{Main|Roman Armenia}}\n[[File:Roman-Persian Frontier, 565 AD.png|thumb|left|Lazica province of Eastern Roman Empire in 565 AD]]\n\nThis close association with Armenia brought upon the country an invasion (65 BC ) by the Roman general [[Pompey]], who was then at war with [[Mithradates VI of Pontus]], and Armenia; but Rome did not establish her power permanently over Iberia. Nineteen years later, the Romans again marched (36 BC) on Iberia forcing King [[Pharnavaz II of Iberia|Pharnavaz II]] to join their campaign against [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]].<ref>Braund, D., Georgia in Antiquity: A History of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia 550 BC \u2013 AD 562, Oxford University Press, 1996, p 36</ref>  \n[[File:Ashotkurapalatgeorgia.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Ashot I of Iberia|Ashot Kurapalates]], first [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagrationi]] King of Georgia, 829 AD]]\nDuring this time Armenia and Pontus were actively expanding at the expense of Rome, taking over its Eastern Mediterranean possessions. However, the success of the anti-Roman alliance did not last long. As a result of the brilliant Roman campaigns of Pompey and [[Lucullus]] from the west, and the [[Parthia]]n invasion from the south, Armenia lost a significant part of its conquests by 65 BC, devolving into a Roman-Parthian dependency. At the same time, the [[Kingdom of Pontus]] was completely destroyed by the Romans and all its territory including Colchis were incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] as her provinces.\n\nThe former Kingdom of Colchis became the Roman province of [[Egrisi|Lazicum]] ruled by Roman [[Legatus|legati]]. The following 600 years of Georgian history were marked by struggle between Rome and Persia (Iran) including [[Parthia]]ns and [[Sassanids]] who were fighting long wars against each other for the domination in the Middle East including Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia, [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]], and Iberia.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, Iberia strengthened her position in the area, especially during the reign of King [[Pharsman II]] who achieved full independence from Rome and reconquered some of the previously lost territories from declining Armenia. In the early 3rd century, Rome had to give up Albania and most of Armenia to [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persia]]. The province of Lazicum was given a degree of autonomy that by the end of the century developed into full independence with the formation of a new Kingdom of Lazica-Egrisi on the territories of smaller principalities of the Zans, Svans, Apsyls, and Sanyghs. This new Western Georgian state survived more than 250 years until 562 when it was absorbed by the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nWhile the Georgian kingdom of Colchis was administered as a Roman province, [[Caucasian Iberia]] freely accepted the Roman Imperial protection. A stone inscription discovered at [[Mtskheta]] speaks of the 1st-century ruler Mihdrat I (AD 58-106) as \"the friend of the Caesars\" and the king \"of the Roman-loving Iberians.\" Emperor [[Vespasian]] fortified the ancient Mtskheta site of Arzami for the Iberian kings in 75 AD.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, Iberia strengthened her position in the area, especially during the reign of King [[Pharsman II]] who achieved full independence from Rome and reconquered some of the previously lost territories from declining Armenia.\n\nIn the 3rd century AD, the [[Laz people|Lazi]] tribe came to dominate most of Colchis, establishing the kingdom of [[Lazica]], locally known as Egrisi. Colchis was a scene of the protracted rivalry between the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]]/[[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] empires, culminating in the [[Lazic War]] from 542 to 562.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/16*.html|title=J.

In 1071, the Seljuq army destroyed the united Byzantine-Armenian and Georgian forces in the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. By 1081, all of Armenia, [[Anatolia]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]], and most of Georgia had been conquered and devastated by the Seljuqs. By the end of the 1080s, Georgians were outnumbered in the region by the invaders. The defeat of the [[Bagratuni Dynasty]] ended Christian leadership of Armenia for the next millennium.[[File:Geor tamro aandersen.png|250px|thumb|Kingdom of Georgia at peak of its military dominance, 1184-1225]]\nThe struggle against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] invaders in Georgia was led by the young [[David IV of Georgia|King David IV]] Bagrationi (reigning 1089-1125). Georgians freed Shirvan and a large portion of Armenia. Thus in 1124 David also became the King of [[Armenians]], incorporating Northern Armenia into the lands of the Georgian Crown. In 1125 King David died, leaving Georgia with the status of a strong regional power.\n\nThe reign of [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]] represented the peak of Georgia's might in the whole history of the nation. The question of [[Georgian military campaigns over Armenian lands|liberation of Armenia]] remained of prime importance in Georgia's foreign policy. Tamar's armies led by ethnic Armenian generals from the [[Zakarids|Zakarian]] Family, [[Zakaria II Mkhargrdzeli|Zakare]] and [[Ivane Mkhargrdzeli]] overran fortresses and cities towards the [[Ararat Plain]], reclaiming one after another fortresses and districts from local Muslim rulers. As a result of [[Battle of Basian]], between 1203-1205 Georgians seized the town of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]<ref>{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=150}}.</ref> and entered [[Ahlat|Akhlatshah]] possessions twice and subdued the emir of [[Kars]] (vassal of the [[Saltukids]] in Erzurum), [[Shah-Armens|Akhlatshahs]], the emirs of [[Saltukids|Erzurum]] and [[House of Meng\u00fcjek|Erzincan]].\n\nThe temporary fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1204 to the Crusaders left Georgia as the strongest Christian state in the whole East Mediterranean area. Muslim power in [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Greater Armenia]] was seriously troubled by the resurgent Georgian monarchy. Many local nobles (''nakharars'') joined their efforts with the [[Georgians]], leading to [[Armenia within the Kingdom of Georgia|liberation of several areas in northern Armenia]], which was ruled, under the authority of the Georgian crown, by the [[Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli|Mkhargrdzeli]], a prominent Armeno-Georgian noble family.\n\n==== Mongol invasions ====\n{{main|Mongol invasions of Georgia}}\nThe kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 10th to 12th centuries, and fell to the [[Mongol invasions of Georgia]] by 1243, and after a brief reunion under [[George V of Georgia]] to the [[Timurid Empire]].\n\n==== Ottoman and Persian domination ====\nBy 1490, Georgia was fragmented into a number of petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the [[Early Modern period]] struggled to maintain their autonomy against Iranian (successive [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]], [[Afsharid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar dynasties]]) and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] domination until Georgia was finally annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1801. Russian possession over Georgia got nominally finalised with [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] in 1813 in the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] following Russia's victory in the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]].<ref name=\"auto\">Timothy C.

In June 1918, in order to forestall an Ottoman advance on [[Tiflis]], the Georgian troops had occupied former districts of [[Tiflis Governorate]], the [[Lori Province]] which at the time had a 75% Armenian majority. After the [[Armistice of Mudros]] and the withdrawal of the Ottomans, the Georgian forces remained. Georgian [[Menshevik]] parliamentarian [[Irakli Tsereteli]] offered that the Armenians would be safer from the Turks as Georgian citizens. The Georgians offered a quadripartite conference including Georgia, Armenia, [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]], and the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]] in order to resolve the issue which the Armenians rejected. In December 1918, the Georgians were confronting a rebellion chiefly in the village of [[Odzun|Uzunlar]] in the Lori region. Within days, hostilities commenced between the two republics.<ref name=\"Walker\">Armenian the Survival of a Nation, Christopher Walker pg 267-268</ref>\n\nThe [[Georgian\u2013Armenian War]] was a border war fought in 1918 between the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] over the parts of then disputed province of [[Lori Province|Lori]].\n\n=== As Soviet republics ===\n\n==== Transcaucasian SFSR (1922\u20131936) ====\nFrom March 12, 1922 to December 5, 1936, Armenia and Georgia were a part of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] together with the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]. In 1936, the TSFSR was dissolved under Stalin's orders and the socialist republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were established instead.\n\n==== Armenian SSR and Georgian SSR (1936\u20131991) ====\n{{see also|Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic}}\n\nIn the Soviet Union, [[Armenians]] and [[Georgian people|Georgians]], along with [[Russians]], [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]], [[Belarusians]], [[Germans]], and [[Jews]] were judged as \"advanced\" peoples, and were grouped together as Western nationalities.<ref>Martin, Terry (2001).

The [[United States]] recognized both independence of the nations on [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|December 25, 1991]].\n\nArmenian-Georgian relations in the post-independence period have been mixed but cooperative. The two states are each one allied with the other one's adversaries (Armenia with Russia, Georgia with [[Azerbaijan]] and Turkey), but they are nevertheless obliged to maintain cooperative ties: the border blockades imposed by Turkey and Azerbaijan on Armenia makes Georgia (and, via a single route, Iran) the only possible trade partner of Armenia.\n\nRecent revelations indicate that [[Yerevan]] had taken steps to assure Tbilisi that it had Armenia's all-but-official support in the outbreak of the 2008 South Ossetian and Abkhazian conflict. Armenia offered itself as a safe haven for Georgians escaping the conflict, and at one point, temporarily housed at least 500 Georgian families escaping the war. To this day, Armenia has not recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. However, the establishment of diplomatic relations between Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and the separatist Republic of Artsakh has drawn criticism from the Georgian government, notably during President Salome Zourabichvili's visit to Armenia in March 2019. Moreover, the Armenian Apostolic Church's decision to place Armenian churches in Abkhazia under the jurisdiction of its South Russian Eparchy instead of the Church's Eparchy of Georgia was rescinded after a meeting between President Zourabichvili and Catholicos Karekin II.\n\nAccording to Wikileaks, however, Armenia's foreign diplomats grew increasingly frustrated with Tbilisi's inability to respond to calls or diplomatic cables from Yerevan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://massispost.com/?p=981|title=WikiLeaks: Georgia Offended Armenian Government Leaders During August War With Russia - Armenian News By MassisPost|date=30 November 2010|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref> Despite their reluctance to warmly embrace each other diplomatically, the differences between the two nations are more often highlighted by political rather than social or historical differences.\n\nPositive steps have been taken to strengthen ties between the two nations.

With the support and encouragement of rival European powers, they became strong enough to sail for the mainland of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish America]], known as the [[Spanish Main]], and sacked cities.\n\nDuring the mid 17th century, the Bahama Islands attracted many lawless people who had taken over [[New Providence]]. Encouraged by its large harbor, they were joined by several pirates who made their living by raiding the Spanish on the coast of Cuba. They called this activity buccaneering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsofpeterhe00bruc|title=Memoirs of Peter Henry Bruce, esq., a military officer, in the services of Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain.

The name became universally adopted later in 1684 when the first English translation of [[Alexandre Exquemelin]]'s book ''The Buccaneers of America'' was published.\n\nViewed from [[London]], buccaneering was a low-budget way to wage war on England's rival, Spain. So, the English crown licensed buccaneers with [[Letter of marque|letters of marque]], legalizing their operations in return for a share of their profits. The buccaneers were invited by Jamaica's Governor [[Thomas Modyford]] to base ships at [[Port Royal]]. The buccaneers robbed Spanish shipping and colonies, and returned to Port Royal with their plunder, making the city the most prosperous in the Caribbean. There even were [[Royal Navy]] officers sent to lead the buccaneers, such as [[Christopher Myngs]]. Their activities went on irrespective of whether England happened to be at war with Spain or France.\n\nAmong the leaders of the buccaneers were two Frenchmen, Jean-David Nau, better known as [[L'Ollonais|Fran\u00e7ois l'Ollonais]], and [[Daniel Montbars]], who destroyed so many Spanish ships and killed so many Spaniards that he was called \"the Exterminator\".\n\nAnother noted leader was a [[Welsh people|Welshman]] named [[Henry Morgan]], who sacked [[Maracaibo]], [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]], and [[Panama City]], stealing a huge amount from the Spanish. Morgan became rich and went back to England, where he was [[knight]]ed by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].\n\nIn the 1690s, the old buccaneering ways began to die out, as European governments began to discard the policy of \"no peace beyond [[Treaty of Tordesillas|the Line]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Buccaneers were hard to control; some even embroiled their colonies in unwanted wars. Notably, at the 1697 joint French-buccaneer [[Raid on Cartagena (1697)|siege of Cartagena]], led by [[Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis]], the buccaneers and the French regulars parted on extremely bitter terms.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Less tolerated by local Caribbean officials, buccaneers increasingly turned to legal work or else joined regular pirate crews who sought plunder in the Indian Ocean, the east coast of North America, or [[West Africa]] as well as in the Caribbean.\n\n==Legal status==\n[[File:Pyle pirates approaching ship.jpg|thumb|Howard Pyle &ndash; Buccaneers attacking a much larger Spanish galleon]]\n\nThe status of buccaneers as pirates or [[privateer]]s was ambiguous.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  As a rule, the buccaneers called themselves privateers, and many sailed under the protection of a [[letter of marque]] granted by British, French or Dutch authorities.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  For example, [[Henry Morgan]] had some form of legal cover for all of his attacks, and expressed great indignation at being called a \"corsair\" by the governor of Panama.<ref>Cawthorne, Nigel (2004), ''Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas'', Book Sales, {{ISBN|0785818561}}, p. 92.</ref>  Nevertheless, these rough men had little concern for legal niceties, and exploited every opportunity to pillage Spanish targets, whether or not a letter of marque was available. Many of the letters of marque used by buccaneers were legally invalid, and any form of legal paper in that illiterate age might be passed off as a letter of marque.<ref>[[Terry Breverton|Breverton, Terry]] (2004). ''The Pirate Dictionary'', Pelican, {{ISBN|1589802438}}, p. 94.</ref> Furthermore, even those buccaneers who had valid letters of marque often failed to observe their terms; Morgan's 1671 attack on [[Panama]], for instance, was not at all authorized by his commission from the governor of [[Jamaica]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The legal status of buccaneers was still further obscured by the practice of the Spanish authorities, who regarded them as heretics and interlopers, and thus hanged or garroted captured buccaneers entirely without regard to whether their attacks were licensed by French or English monarchs.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nSimultaneously, French and English governors tended to turn a blind eye to the buccaneers' depredations against the Spanish, even when unlicensed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} But as Spanish power waned toward the end of the 17th century, the buccaneers' attacks began to disrupt France and England's merchant traffic with [[Spanish Empire|Spanish America]], such that merchants who had previously regarded the buccaneers as a defense against Spain now saw them as a threat to commerce, and colonial authorities grew hostile.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This change in political atmosphere, more than anything else, put an end to buccaneering.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Lifestyle==\n\nA hundred years before the [[French Revolution]], the buccaneer companies were run on lines in which [[liberty]], [[social equality|equality]] and [[fraternity]] were the rule. In a buccaneer camp, the captain was elected and could be deposed by the votes of the crew. The crew, and not the captain, decided whether to attack a particular ship, or a fleet of ships. Spoils were evenly divided into shares; the captain received an agreed amount for the ship, plus a portion of the share of the [[prize money]], usually five or six shares.<ref>{{cite book |first=D. |last=Cordingley, D |title=Under the Black Flag |publisher=Random House |year=2006 |page=97}}</ref>\n\nCrews generally had no regular wages, being paid only from their shares of the plunder, a system called \"[[no purchase, no pay]]\" by Modyford or \"no prey, no pay\" by Exquemelin. There was a strong ''esprit'' among buccaneers. This, combined with overwhelming numbers, allowed them to win battles and raids. There was also, for some time, a social insurance system guaranteeing compensation for battle wounds at a worked-out scale.<ref>[[Thomas Salmon (historian)|Thomas Salmon]] (1746), ''Modern history, or the Present State of All nations'', University of Lausanne p. 243</ref>\n\n==Warfare==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{one source|section|date=January 2017}}\n{{self published | section|date=January 2017}}\n}}\n[[File:Pyle pirates city.jpg|thumb|Howard Pyle &ndash; Buccaneers extorting tribute from the citizens of a captured city.]]\n\n===Naval===\nBuccaneers initially used small boats to attack Spanish galleons surreptitiously, often at night, and climb aboard before the alarm could be raised.

Instead, they secretly beached their ships out of sight of their target, marched overland, and attacked the towns from the landward side, which was usually less fortified. Their raids relied mainly on surprise and speed.<ref name=pirates&privateers />{{better source|date=January 2017}} The [[Sack of Campeche (1663)|sack of Campeche]] was considered the first such raid and many others that followed replicated the same techniques including the [[attack on Veracruz]] in 1683 and the [[Raid on Cartagena (1683)|raid on Cartagena]] later that same year.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Downturn==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nWhile Spanish authorities always viewed buccaneers as trespassers and a threat to their hegemony in the Caribbean basin, over the second half of the 17th century other European powers learned to perceive them in the same way. These new powers had appropriated and secured territories in the area and needed to protect them. Buccaneers who did not settle down on agriculture or some other acceptable business after the so-called [[Golden Age of Piracy]] proved a nuisance to them, too. Spanish anti-pirate practices became thus a model for all recently arrived colonial governments. Some expanded them.\n\n==Punishments==\nWhen caught by anti-pirate English authorities, 17th and 18th century buccaneers received justice in a summary fashion, and many ended their lives by \"dancing the hempen jig\", a euphemism for hanging. Public executions were a form of entertainment, and people came out to watch them as they would for a sporting event today. Newspapers reported details such as condemned men's last words, the prayers said by the priests, and descriptions of their final moments in the gallows. In England, most executions took place at [[Execution Dock]] on the [[River Thames]] in [[London]].\n\nIn the cases of more famous prisoners, usually captains, their punishments extended beyond death. Their bodies were enclosed in [[Gibbeting|iron cages (gibbet)]] (for which they were measured before their execution) and left to swing in the air until the flesh rotted off them\u2014a process that could take as long as two years. The bodies of captains such as [[William Kidd|William \"Captain\" Kidd]], [[Charles Vane]], [[William Fly]], and [[Calico Jack|Jack Rackham (\"Calico Jack\")]] were all treated this way.\n\nIt is doubtful many buccaneers got off with just a time in the pillory. However, a pirate who was flogged could very well spend some time in the pillory after being beaten. \"The most common shaming punishment was confinement in the pillory often with symbols of their crimes.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ruff|first1=Julius R.|title=Violence in early modern Europe|url=https://archive.org/details/violenceinearlym0000ruff|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521591195|page=[https://archive.org/details/violenceinearlym0000ruff/page/97 97]|edition=Repr.}}</ref>\n\n==In literature==\nAfter the threat began to abate, literature brought buccaneers to glory as example of virility and self-reliance.

With the support and encouragement of rival European powers, they became strong enough to sail for the mainland of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish America]], known as the [[Spanish Main]], and sacked cities.\n\nDuring the mid 17th century, the Bahama Islands attracted many lawless people who had taken over [[New Providence]]. Encouraged by its large harbor, they were joined by several pirates who made their living by raiding the Spanish on the coast of Cuba. They called this activity buccaneering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirsofpeterhe00bruc|title=Memoirs of Peter Henry Bruce, esq., a military officer, in the services of Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain.

The name became universally adopted later in 1684 when the first English translation of [[Alexandre Exquemelin]]'s book ''The Buccaneers of America'' was published.\n\nViewed from [[London]], buccaneering was a low-budget way to wage war on England's rival, Spain. So, the English crown licensed buccaneers with [[Letter of marque|letters of marque]], legalizing their operations in return for a share of their profits. The buccaneers were invited by Jamaica's Governor [[Thomas Modyford]] to base ships at [[Port Royal]]. The buccaneers robbed Spanish shipping and colonies, and returned to Port Royal with their plunder, making the city the most prosperous in the Caribbean. There even were [[Royal Navy]] officers sent to lead the buccaneers, such as [[Christopher Myngs]]. Their activities went on irrespective of whether England happened to be at war with Spain or France.\n\nAmong the leaders of the buccaneers were two Frenchmen, Jean-David Nau, better known as [[L'Ollonais|Fran\u00e7ois l'Ollonais]], and [[Daniel Montbars]], who destroyed so many Spanish ships and killed so many Spaniards that he was called \"the Exterminator\".\n\nAnother noted leader was a [[Welsh people|Welshman]] named [[Henry Morgan]], who sacked [[Maracaibo]], [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]], and [[Panama City]], stealing a huge amount from the Spanish. Morgan became rich and went back to England, where he was [[knight]]ed by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].\n\nIn the 1690s, the old buccaneering ways began to die out, as European governments began to discard the policy of \"no peace beyond [[Treaty of Tordesillas|the Line]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Buccaneers were hard to control; some even embroiled their colonies in unwanted wars. Notably, at the 1697 joint French-buccaneer [[Raid on Cartagena (1697)|siege of Cartagena]], led by [[Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis]], the buccaneers and the French regulars parted on extremely bitter terms.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Less tolerated by local Caribbean officials, buccaneers increasingly turned to legal work or else joined regular pirate crews who sought plunder in the Indian Ocean, the east coast of North America, or [[West Africa]] as well as in the Caribbean.\n\n==Legal status==\n[[File:Pyle pirates approaching ship.jpg|thumb|Howard Pyle &ndash; Buccaneers attacking a much larger Spanish galleon]]\n\nThe status of buccaneers as pirates or [[privateer]]s was ambiguous.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  As a rule, the buccaneers called themselves privateers, and many sailed under the protection of a [[letter of marque]] granted by British, French or Dutch authorities.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  For example, [[Henry Morgan]] had some form of legal cover for all of his attacks, and expressed great indignation at being called a \"corsair\" by the governor of Panama.<ref>Cawthorne, Nigel (2004), ''Pirates: Blood and Thunder on the High Seas'', Book Sales, {{ISBN|0785818561}}, p. 92.</ref>  Nevertheless, these rough men had little concern for legal niceties, and exploited every opportunity to pillage Spanish targets, whether or not a letter of marque was available. Many of the letters of marque used by buccaneers were legally invalid, and any form of legal paper in that illiterate age might be passed off as a letter of marque.<ref>[[Terry Breverton|Breverton, Terry]] (2004). ''The Pirate Dictionary'', Pelican, {{ISBN|1589802438}}, p. 94.</ref> Furthermore, even those buccaneers who had valid letters of marque often failed to observe their terms; Morgan's 1671 attack on [[Panama]], for instance, was not at all authorized by his commission from the governor of [[Jamaica]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The legal status of buccaneers was still further obscured by the practice of the Spanish authorities, who regarded them as heretics and interlopers, and thus hanged or garroted captured buccaneers entirely without regard to whether their attacks were licensed by French or English monarchs.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nSimultaneously, French and English governors tended to turn a blind eye to the buccaneers' depredations against the Spanish, even when unlicensed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} But as Spanish power waned toward the end of the 17th century, the buccaneers' attacks began to disrupt France and England's merchant traffic with [[Spanish Empire|Spanish America]], such that merchants who had previously regarded the buccaneers as a defense against Spain now saw them as a threat to commerce, and colonial authorities grew hostile.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} This change in political atmosphere, more than anything else, put an end to buccaneering.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Lifestyle==\n\nA hundred years before the [[French Revolution]], the buccaneer companies were run on lines in which [[liberty]], [[social equality|equality]] and [[fraternity]] were the rule. In a buccaneer camp, the captain was elected and could be deposed by the votes of the crew. The crew, and not the captain, decided whether to attack a particular ship, or a fleet of ships. Spoils were evenly divided into shares; the captain received an agreed amount for the ship, plus a portion of the share of the [[prize money]], usually five or six shares.<ref>{{cite book |first=D. |last=Cordingley, D |title=Under the Black Flag |publisher=Random House |year=2006 |page=97}}</ref>\n\nCrews generally had no regular wages, being paid only from their shares of the plunder, a system called \"[[no purchase, no pay]]\" by Modyford or \"no prey, no pay\" by Exquemelin. There was a strong ''esprit'' among buccaneers. This, combined with overwhelming numbers, allowed them to win battles and raids. There was also, for some time, a social insurance system guaranteeing compensation for battle wounds at a worked-out scale.<ref>[[Thomas Salmon (historian)|Thomas Salmon]] (1746), ''Modern history, or the Present State of All nations'', University of Lausanne p. 243</ref>\n\n==Warfare==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{one source|section|date=January 2017}}\n{{self published | section|date=January 2017}}\n}}\n[[File:Pyle pirates city.jpg|thumb|Howard Pyle &ndash; Buccaneers extorting tribute from the citizens of a captured city.]]\n\n===Naval===\nBuccaneers initially used small boats to attack Spanish galleons surreptitiously, often at night, and climb aboard before the alarm could be raised.

Instead, they secretly beached their ships out of sight of their target, marched overland, and attacked the towns from the landward side, which was usually less fortified. Their raids relied mainly on surprise and speed.<ref name=pirates&privateers />{{better source|date=January 2017}} The [[Sack of Campeche (1663)|sack of Campeche]] was considered the first such raid and many others that followed replicated the same techniques including the [[attack on Veracruz]] in 1683 and the [[Raid on Cartagena (1683)|raid on Cartagena]] later that same year.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Downturn==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nWhile Spanish authorities always viewed buccaneers as trespassers and a threat to their hegemony in the Caribbean basin, over the second half of the 17th century other European powers learned to perceive them in the same way. These new powers had appropriated and secured territories in the area and needed to protect them. Buccaneers who did not settle down on agriculture or some other acceptable business after the so-called [[Golden Age of Piracy]] proved a nuisance to them, too. Spanish anti-pirate practices became thus a model for all recently arrived colonial governments. Some expanded them.\n\n==Punishments==\nWhen caught by anti-pirate English authorities, 17th and 18th century buccaneers received justice in a summary fashion, and many ended their lives by \"dancing the hempen jig\", a euphemism for hanging. Public executions were a form of entertainment, and people came out to watch them as they would for a sporting event today. Newspapers reported details such as condemned men's last words, the prayers said by the priests, and descriptions of their final moments in the gallows. In England, most executions took place at [[Execution Dock]] on the [[River Thames]] in [[London]].\n\nIn the cases of more famous prisoners, usually captains, their punishments extended beyond death. Their bodies were enclosed in [[Gibbeting|iron cages (gibbet)]] (for which they were measured before their execution) and left to swing in the air until the flesh rotted off them\u2014a process that could take as long as two years. The bodies of captains such as [[William Kidd|William \"Captain\" Kidd]], [[Charles Vane]], [[William Fly]], and [[Calico Jack|Jack Rackham (\"Calico Jack\")]] were all treated this way.\n\nIt is doubtful many buccaneers got off with just a time in the pillory. However, a pirate who was flogged could very well spend some time in the pillory after being beaten. \"The most common shaming punishment was confinement in the pillory often with symbols of their crimes.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ruff|first1=Julius R.|title=Violence in early modern Europe|url=https://archive.org/details/violenceinearlym0000ruff|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521591195|page=[https://archive.org/details/violenceinearlym0000ruff/page/97 97]|edition=Repr.}}</ref>\n\n==In literature==\nAfter the threat began to abate, literature brought buccaneers to glory as example of virility and self-reliance.

The office of the president was preserved in the [[Constitution of Poland]] passed in 1997; the constitution now provides the requirements for, the duties of and the authority of the office.\n\n==Election==\nThe President of Poland is elected directly by the people to serve for five years and can be reelected only once. Pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution, the President is elected by an absolute majority. If no candidate succeeds in passing this threshold, a second round of voting is held with the participation of the two candidates with the largest and second largest number of votes respectively.\n\nIn order to be registered as a candidate in the presidential election, one must be a Polish citizen, be at least 35 years old on the day of the first round of the election and collect at least 100,000 signatures of registered voters.\n\n==Powers==\n[[Image:Warszawa Pa\u0142ac Prezydencki 2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace]] on ''[[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]]'' in [[Warsaw]], with equestrian statue of Prince [[J\u00f3zef Poniatowski]] by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. It serves as the official seat of presidency.]]\nThe President has a free choice in selecting the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]], yet in practice he usually gives the task of forming a new government to a politician supported by the political party with the majority of seats in the [[Sejm]] (usually, though not always, it is the leader of that political party).\n\nThe President has the right to initiate the legislative process. He also has the opportunity to directly influence it by using his veto to stop a bill; however, his veto can be overruled by a three-fifths majority vote in the presence of at least half of the statutory number of members of the Sejm (230).

Thus, the tracks partially overlap similar to [[roof shingle]]s.  This approach was selected because physical limitations prevent recording magnetic heads from having the same width as reading heads, leaving recording heads wider.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ewh.ieee.org/r6/scv/mag/MtgSum/Meeting2010_10_Presentation.pdf |title=Shingled Magnetic Recording and Two-Dimensional Magnetic Recording |author=Roger Wood |website=ewh.ieee.org |date=October 19, 2010 |accessdate=December 14, 2014 |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.storagereview.com/what_is_shingled_magnetic_recording_smr/ |title=What is Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR)? |website=storagereview.com |date=January 30, 2015 |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"snia-smr\">{{cite web\n | url = http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/Dunn-Feldman_SNIA_Tutorial_Shingled_Magnetic_Recording-r7_Final.pdf\n | title = Shingled Magnetic Recording: Models, Standardization, and Applications\n | date = September 22, 2014 | accessdate = February 9, 2015\n | author1 = Mary Dunn | author2 = Timothy Feldman\n | publisher = [[Storage Networking Industry Association]]\n | format = PDF\n}}</ref>{{rp|7&ndash;9}}\n\nThe overlapping-tracks architecture complicates the writing process since writing to one track also overwrites an adjacent track. If adjacent tracks contain valid data, they must be rewritten as well.
