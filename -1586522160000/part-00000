He came from a respectable [[Brahmin]] family. He was orthodox in nature and was dubbed as \"oldish\" by [[Ramakrishna]].<ref>''The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna'', published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 314</ref>  From his very childhood, Gangadhar was so compassionate that he once gave his own shirt to a poor classmate whose shirt was torn.

He visited Ramakrishna for the first time in the company of his friend Harinath (later [[Turiyananda]]). He had first seen Ramakrishna in the house of [[Dinanath Bose]] at a very young age.<ref>The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 313</ref> Ramakrishna did not want him to be over orthodox and therefore introduced him to Narendranath Dutta (later [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda]]). Gangadhar was favourably impressed with Narendranath and became devoted to him, a devotion which lasted throughout his life and which later prompted him to take up service as the primary work over spiritual practices. During his visits to Dakshineswar, Gangadhar received instructions on meditation from Ramakrishna.<ref>''Swami Akhandananda: Service as Worship'', by Swami Devarajananda, Prabuddha Bharat, January 2009, page 133</ref>\n\n=== Pre monastic days ===\nGangadhar's father found a job for Gangadhar in a merchant's office. Gangadhar worked there a few days and then gave it up. He then fully engaged himself in spiritual disciplines and service to the master. \nGangadhar served Ramakrishna during the illness of the latter. After the death of Ramakrishna, when the [[Baranagar Math]] was formed by Narendranath and other brother disciples, Gangadhar renounced his family life and embraced a life of travel with consent from his family and set foot for the Himalayas.\nSteeped in [[Vedanta]] and his own experience, his mind ever pined to be absorbed in the bliss of the Himalayan solitude. In 1887, after visiting [[Kedarnath]] and [[Badrinath]], he travelled to [[Tibet]] where he lived in [[Lhasa]] and elsewhere for three years, returning to India in 1890.<ref>The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 315</ref> \nGangadhar's entire travel account is recorded in his book ''Smriti-Katha (From Holy Wanderings to The Service of God in Man)''. He travelled hundreds of miles in the mountains of the Himalayas without carrying any money or extra clothing.\n\n=== Life as a Monk ===\n\n==== Travels ====\nGangadhar took his monastic vow in 1890, in Baranagar Math and in the presence of SwamiVivekananda, and was given the name of \"Akhandananda\" (Akhanda - undifferentiated, ananda - bliss, one who finds supreme bliss in the undifferentiated nature of the Truth). After his return, he had frequent correspondence with Vivekananda, then at Ghazipur, who induced him to join him in travelling in some places of the Himalayas because of the latter's experience and familiarity in those terrains. Accordingly, Akhandananda came to Baranagore monastery, and after spending a few happy months with his brother-disciples, sharing his experiences with them, he set out in July 1890, with Vivekananda on a pilgrimage to the Himalayas.<ref>[http://www.sriramakrishna.org/akhandananda.php Biography of Akhandananda] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120914142616/http://www.sriramakrishna.org/akhandananda.php |date=2012-09-14 }} on the RMIC site</ref> Visiting important places on the way they reached Almora, but the illness of one or the other plagued their journey and they returned via Tehri to Dehra Dun, from where Akhandananda proceeded to Meerut for treatment.

After five months of association Vivekananda left them and Akhandananda followed him surreptitiously, going from one province to another in his search, but everywhere he narrowly missed meeting him. Finally he met Vivekananda again in Kutch where Swami Vivekananda entreated him to follow a separate course. Accordingly, Akhandananda continued his pilgrimage separately.<ref>''The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna'', published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 316</ref>\n\n==== Intellectual Pursuits ====\nDuring his days of wandering in the Himalayas, he studied [[Avadhuta Gita]] at [[Srinagar]] in [[Garhwal District|Garhwal]]. In 1891, while resting at Etawah, he spent most of his time reading the [[Mahabhashya]], Patanjali's voluminous commentary on Panini's [[Sanskrit grammar]], as well as [[Sridhara Swami]]\u2019s commentary on the Bhagavadgita. In [[Jamnagar]] in 1892, he studied the [[Charaka Samhita|Charaka]]-[[Sushruta Samhita]] with the help of the Sanskrit [[lexicon]] [[Shabdartha Chandrika Kosha]] and also [[Shukla Yajur Veda]]. In [[Udaipur]] he read the Vedantic text of [[Panchadasi]]. He also learned Hindi grammar from [[Bhasha Bhaskara]], to correct his Hindi pronunciation. In [[Indore]], he completed a reading of the entire [[Valmiki Ramayana]] over a period of eighteen days. Later in [[Mahula]] he undertook a critical study of the [[Yogavasishtha]] Ramayana.<ref>''Akhandananda: Service as Worship'', [[Devarajananda]], Prabuddha Bharat, January 2009, page 133</ref>\n\n==== Relationship with Vivekananda and Sarada Devi ====\nAkhandananda was an ardent follower of Vivekananda, who called him lovingly as ''Ganges''. He was also devoted to [[Sarada Devi]]. When hard work in [[Murshidabad]] took a toll on his health, she had him brought to Calcutta for treatment and took special care of him.\n\n==== Final Years ====\nAkhandananda became the vice president of Ramakrishna Math and Mission in 1925 and the third president after the demise of [[Swami Shivananda]] in 1934. He initiated a number of people after assuming office. However he continued to stay at Sargachhi.\n\nAkhandananda also initiated [[M. S. Golwalkar|Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar]], the second sarsanghachalak of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]].\n\nHe participated in the celebration of the Birth Centenary of Ramakrishna in 1936 in Calcutta.\n\nIn February 1937 he fell ill and was brought to Calcutta. He died in [[Belur Math]] on 7 February 1937.\n\n== Service ==\n[[File:Alambazar Math 1896.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Alambazar Math, 1896 (farewell to Swami Abhedananda leaving for the US)(from left) standing: [[Swami Adbhutananda]], Yogananda, Abhedananda, Trigunatitananda, Turiyananda, Nirmalananda, and Niranjanananda; sitting: Swamis Subodhananda, [[Swami Brahmananda|Brahmananda]] (on chair), and Akhandananda]]\n\nAkhandananda was the first monk of the Ramakrishna order, who gave shape to the cherished desire of Vivekananda to begin rural development work\u2014even before the Mission was established. \nThe distressing sorrows and suffering of the masses pulled him down to the plains, and to them he became a harbinger of peace and succour. Sacrificing  his Himalayan bliss, he chose to be with poor. Akhandananda practised till the very end of his life his Master's call: ''' Worship jiva as Shiva'''. He was one of the pillars of the Ramakrishna Movement's service activities.\nHis experience as a wandering monk, like those of Vivekananda moved him to take steps to remove the distress and misery of the masses. Vivekananda's encouraging letter from America which was sent as a reply to Akhandananda's request for guidance pushed him further, and in 1894 Akhandananda began his campaign against poverty.<ref>[http://www.rkmvadodara.com/lifeofDD.asp#14 Biography of Akhandananda] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231428/http://www.rkmvadodara.com/lifeofDD.asp#14 |date=2012-04-25 }} on RKM Vadodara website</ref>\nThe idea of working for the poor was conceived while he stayed in Jamnagar with Jhandu Bhatt, the famous ayurvedic physician, who served his patients with exceptional devotion.<ref>''Akhandananda: Service as Worship'', by Swami Devarajananda, Prabuddha Bharat, January 2009, page 135</ref>\nWhile in Khetri, [[Rajasthan]] during 1894, he went about from door to door, all alone to bring awareness in the people about the utility of education, and it was because of his efforts that the number of students in the Khetri Rajya English School rose from 80 to 257.<ref>The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 317</ref>\nUnder his inspiration the Maharaja of Khetri Ajit Singh arranged for the education of the Golas and also set up a permanent Education Department to open schools in the villages. Akhandananda also arranged for the publication of a newspaper on agriculture in order to educate the farmers of that area. He also contacted renowned landlords in the numerous village of [[Khetri]], inspiring them to take some concrete steps towards removing the miseries of their poor labourers. At the instance of the Swami the Sanskrit school in Khetri was converted to Vedic school and he raised subscriptions to purchase books for the poor students. He fed the [[Bhils]], an aboriginal tribe, in [[Uadaipur]]. He left [[Rajputana]] in 1895 and returned to the Alambazar Math, the new monastery of the Ramakrishna disciples. He first came in contact with widespread famine during his travel in the Murshidabad district of Bengal. He sought help from his brother disciples in 1897 and Vivekananda, who had returned to India by then, sent two monks with money.\nOn 1 May 1897 Vivekananda inaugurated the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], and Akhandananda opened a relief centre on 15 May in the temple premises of Mrityunjay Bhattacharya of Kedar-Mahula in [[Murshidabad]] to save people from an all-devouring famine. Though rice was difficult to procure at that time, he managed to procure some with the help of other people and with much trouble. Then he distributed equally among the poor, weighing the rice himself on a scale. This was the first public service work done by the Ramakrishna Mission.\n\nAkhandananda started an orphanage in Mahula, near [[Baharampur|Berhampore]], on 31 August 1897, and then established the first Rural Branch Centre of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission in Mahula. In 1899, he opened an ashrama in Shivnagar near [[Sargachi]] which continued for 14 years.<ref>[https://www.motivationbook.in/2020/04/swami-vivekananda-quotes-in-hindi.html MotivationBook]{{|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1899, he opened a free school there to deal with the problem of illiteracy in the locality. A carpentry and a weaving section also were added to revive those perishing village industries and make the boys self-reliant. Cotton cultivation was taught to the rural women to enhance their family income. In 1913 the present ashrama was found on a 13 acres land in March 1913.\nHe also led in relief activities in the Bhagalpur district of Bihar and during the [[Munger]] earthquake in Bihar.<ref>''The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna'', published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 321</ref>\n\n== Literary works ==\n* ''In the Lap of the Himalayas''\n* ''From holy wanderings to the service of God in man'' \n* ''The call of the Spirit: Conversations With Swami Akhandananda, Swami Nirmayananda''\n\n==Honors==\nThere is a dormitory named, in his honour, Akhananda Dham in [[Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, Deoghar]].\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''God lived with them: Life stories of sixteen monastic disciples'', by Swami Chetanananda, published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai, {{ISBN|81-7505-198-1}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n'''Bold text'''\n\n==External links==\n* {{Internet Archive author|name=Swami Akhandananda}} \n* [https://belurmath.org/swami-akhandananda/ Swami Akhandananda Biography] \n* [https://archive.is/20120914142616/http://www.sriramakrishna.org/akhandananda.php Biography on RMIC official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231428/http://www.rkmvadodara.com/lifeofDD.asp#14 Biography on RKM Vadodara website]\n\n{{Ramakrishna}}\n{{Presidents of the Ramakrishna Order}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Akhandananda, Swami}}\n[[Category:Heads of the Ramakrishna Mission]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Ramakrishna Order]]\n[[Category:Monastic disciples of Ramakrishna]]\n[[Category:1864 births]]\n[[Category:1937 deaths]]\n[[Category:Bengali Hindus]]\n[[Category:Monks of the Ramakrishna Mission]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the late 20th century Swami in Satyananda's ashram|Swami Akhandananda (Satyananda)}}\n{{religion primary|date=November 2015}}\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2009}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox Hindu leader\n| name = Swami Akhandananda\n| image = Swami Akhandananda.jpg\n| caption =Akhandananda (1864 -1937 )\n| religion = [[Hinduism]]\n| birth_date= {{Birth date|1864|9|30|df=y}}\n| birth_place= [[Calcutta]], [[India]]\n| birth_name= Gangadhar Ghatak (Gangophadyay)\n| death_date= {{death date and age|1937|2|7|1864|9|30|df=y}}\n| guru= [[Ramakrishna Paramahamsa]]\n| order = \n| philosophy= [[Advaita Vedanta]] \n| honors = 3rd president of Ramakrishna math and mission\n| footnotes=\n}}\n{{quote box|width=22em|title=Quotation|quote=The poor, the illiterate, the ignorant, the afflicted - let these be your God.

Vivekananda's encouraging letter from America which was sent as a reply to Akhandananda's request for guidance pushed him further, and in 1894 Akhandananda began his campaign against poverty.<ref>[http://www.rkmvadodara.com/lifeofDD.asp#14 Biography of Akhandananda] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231428/http://www.rkmvadodara.com/lifeofDD.asp#14 |date=2012-04-25 }} on RKM Vadodara website</ref>\nThe idea of working for the poor was conceived while he stayed in Jamnagar with Jhandu Bhatt, the famous ayurvedic physician, who served his patients with exceptional devotion.<ref>''Akhandananda: Service as Worship'', by Swami Devarajananda, Prabuddha Bharat, January 2009, page 135</ref>\nWhile in Khetri, [[Rajasthan]] during 1894, he went about from door to door, all alone to bring awareness in the people about the utility of education, and it was because of his efforts that the number of students in the Khetri Rajya English School rose from 80 to 257.<ref>The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 317</ref>\nUnder his inspiration the Maharaja of Khetri Ajit Singh arranged for the education of the Golas and also set up a permanent Education Department to open schools in the villages. Akhandananda also arranged for the publication of a newspaper on agriculture in order to educate the farmers of that area. He also contacted renowned landlords in the numerous village of [[Khetri]], inspiring them to take some concrete steps towards removing the miseries of their poor labourers. At the instance of the Swami the Sanskrit school in Khetri was converted to Vedic school and he raised subscriptions to purchase books for the poor students. He fed the [[Bhils]], an aboriginal tribe, in [[Uadaipur]]. He left [[Rajputana]] in 1895 and returned to the Alambazar Math, the new monastery of the Ramakrishna disciples. He first came in contact with widespread famine during his travel in the Murshidabad district of Bengal. He sought help from his brother disciples in 1897 and Vivekananda, who had returned to India by then, sent two monks with money.\nOn 1 May 1897 Vivekananda inaugurated the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], and Akhandananda opened a relief centre on 15 May in the temple premises of Mrityunjay Bhattacharya of Kedar-Mahula in [[Murshidabad]] to save people from an all-devouring famine. Though rice was difficult to procure at that time, he managed to procure some with the help of other people and with much trouble. Then he distributed equally among the poor, weighing the rice himself on a scale. This was the first public service work done by the Ramakrishna Mission.\n\nAkhandananda started an orphanage in Mahula, near [[Baharampur|Berhampore]], on 31 August 1897, and then established the first Rural Branch Centre of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission in Mahula. In 1899, he opened an ashrama in Shivnagar near [[Sargachi]] which continued for 14 years.<ref>[http://www.jankarihub.com/ Genesis of RKM Sargachhi]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1899, he opened a free school there to deal with the problem of illiteracy in the locality. A carpentry and a weaving section also were added to revive those perishing village industries and make the boys self-reliant. Cotton cultivation was taught to the rural women to enhance their family income. In 1913 the present ashrama was found on a 13 acres land in March 1913.\nHe also led in relief activities in the Bhagalpur district of Bihar and during the [[Munger]] earthquake in Bihar.<ref>''The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna'', published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 321</ref>\n\n== Literary works ==\n* ''In the Lap of the Himalayas''\n* ''From holy wanderings to the service of God in man'' \n* ''The call of the Spirit: Conversations With Swami Akhandananda, Swami Nirmayananda''\n\n==Honors==\nThere is a dormitory named, in his honour, Akhananda Dham in [[Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, Deoghar]].\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''God lived with them: Life stories of sixteen monastic disciples'', by Swami Chetanananda, published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai, {{ISBN|81-7505-198-1}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Internet Archive author|name=Swami Akhandananda}} \n* [https://belurmath.org/swami-akhandananda/ Swami Akhandananda Biography] \n* [https://archive.is/20120914142616/http://www.sriramakrishna.org/akhandananda.php Biography on RMIC official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231428/http://www.rkmvadodara.com/lifeofDD.asp#14 Biography on RKM Vadodara website]\n\n{{Ramakrishna}}\n{{Presidents of the Ramakrishna Order}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Akhandananda, Swami}}\n[[Category:Heads of the Ramakrishna Mission]]\n[[Category:Presidents of the Ramakrishna Order]]\n[[Category:Monastic disciples of Ramakrishna]]\n[[Category:1864 births]]\n[[Category:1937 deaths]]\n[[Category:Bengali Hindus]]\n[[Category:Monks of the Ramakrishna Mission]]\n", "name_user": "Motivationbook", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhandananda"}

Along with several other areas of southwestern Utah, the Hurricane area has undergone large population growth since the 1970s. Because of this, it has become a suburb of [[St. George, Utah|St. George]], while retaining its rural character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2018/08/07/on-the-edge-the-dilemma-of-rural-utah/|title=On the EDge: The dilemma of rural Utah|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nHurricane was first settled in 1896, and received its name after a whirlwind blew the top off a buggy in which [[Erastus Snow]] was riding.

There are several medical clinics in the area.\n\n===Hurricane Canal and Canal Trail===\nFor approximately 80 years, the [[Hurricane Canal]] was the lifeblood of the Hurricane Valley. Built over a period of 11 years (1893\u20131904), mostly by pick and shovel. Since 1985, the canal has lain empty. In 2000, special interest groups came together to preserve the canal, receiving grants and volunteering time to construct a trail to stand as a tribute to the early settlers put forth to make the canal a reality. A monument at the trailhead recounts the canal story in brief. Much of the trail, which only covers a small section of the canal, is the actual west bank of the canal, which \u201ccanal riders\u201d rode every day when the canal was in operation to ensure there were no leaks or other problems since the bank was somewhat unstable. Two of the trail's unique aspects are walking in the canal itself \u2013 on a steel flume across a wash and through a tunnel immediately thereafter. The trail provides excellent views of the towns of Hurricane and [[La Verkin, Utah|La Verkin]] throughout. The trail ends before reaching the [[Virgin River Gorge]], approximately five miles from the canal's former headwaters.\n\n=== State Route 59 crash ===\nOn December 30, 2006, an Arizona driver on the [[Utah State Route 59]] just outside Hurricane lost control and crashed through the guardrail at around 80&nbsp;mph. The truck struck the [[culvert]], flipped over, and rotated 180 degrees before landing on the opposite side of a ravine. Due to the rare nature of the event, photos of the crash were suspected to be a hoax, but the Hurricane City Police department confirmed the entire sequence of events.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Eliott C. |title=Amazing truck crash photos spark Web debate |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-09-06/us/utah.crash_1_pickup-truck-barricade-arizona-driver?_s=PM:US |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119173505/http://articles.cnn.com/2007-09-06/us/utah.crash_1_pickup-truck-barricade-arizona-driver?_s=PM:US |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 January 2013 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=29 October 2012 |date=6 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Truck Wreck: Livin' on the Edge|url=http://www.snopes.com/photos/accident/culvert.asp|publisher=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=29 October 2012|date=2 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 31.5&nbsp;square miles (81.7&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which 31.1&nbsp;square miles (80.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) is land and 0.4&nbsp;square mile (1.1&nbsp;km\u00b2) (1.39%) is water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/hurricanecityutah|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Hurricane city, Utah|website=www.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=right\n|1910= 336\n|1920= 1021\n|1930= 1197\n|1940= 1524\n|1950= 1271\n|1960= 1251\n|1970= 1408\n|1980= 2660\n|1990= 3915\n|2000= 8250\n|2010= 13748\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=18205\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAt the 2010 [[census]],<ref>http://cityofhurricane.com/uploads/fb/about/2010Census.pdf</ref> there were 13,748 people, 4,609 households and 3,545 families residing in the city.

Metropolitan Area]]. Its population was 13,748 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]]. Along with several other areas of southwestern Utah, the Hurricane area has undergone large population growth since the 1970s. Because of this, it has become a suburb of [[St. George, Utah|St. George]], while retaining its rural character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2018/08/07/on-the-edge-the-dilemma-of-rural-utah/|title=On the EDge: The dilemma of rural Utah|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nHurricane was first settled in 1896, and received its name after a whirlwind blew the top off a buggy in which [[Erastus Snow]] was riding. Snow exclaimed, \"Well, that was a Hurricane. We'll name this 'Hurricane Hill'.\"<ref>Daughters of the Utah Pioneers historic marker dated September 25, 1931, currently located at Heritage Park at 35 W. State Street, Hurricane, Utah.

There are several medical clinics in the area.\n\n===Hurricane Canal and Canal Trail===\nFor approximately 80 years, the [[Hurricane Canal]] was the lifeblood of the Hurricane Valley. Built over a period of 11 years (1893\u20131904), mostly by pick and shovel. Since 1985, the canal has lain empty. In 2000, special interest groups came together to preserve the canal, receiving grants and volunteering time to construct a trail to stand as a tribute to the early settlers put forth to make the canal a reality. A monument at the trailhead recounts the canal story in brief. Much of the trail, which only covers a small section of the canal, is the actual west bank of the canal, which \u201ccanal riders\u201d rode every day when the canal was in operation to ensure there were no leaks or other problems since the bank was somewhat unstable. Two of the trail's unique aspects are walking in the canal itself \u2013 on a steel flume across a wash and through a tunnel immediately thereafter. The trail provides excellent views of the towns of Hurricane and [[La Verkin, Utah|La Verkin]] throughout. The trail ends before reaching the [[Virgin River Gorge]], approximately five miles from the canal's former headwaters.\n\n=== State Route 59 crash ===\nOn December 30, 2006, an Arizona driver on the [[Utah State Route 59]] just outside Hurricane lost control and crashed though the guardrail at around 80&nbsp;mph. The truck struck the [[culvert]], flipped over, and rotated 180 degrees before landing on the opposite side of a ravine. Due to the rare nature of the event, photos of the crash were suspected to be a hoax, but the Hurricane City Police department confirmed the entire sequence of events.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Eliott C. |title=Amazing truck crash photos spark Web debate |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-09-06/us/utah.crash_1_pickup-truck-barricade-arizona-driver?_s=PM:US |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119173505/http://articles.cnn.com/2007-09-06/us/utah.crash_1_pickup-truck-barricade-arizona-driver?_s=PM:US |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 January 2013 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=29 October 2012 |date=6 September 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Truck Wreck: Livin' on the Edge|url=http://www.snopes.com/photos/accident/culvert.asp|publisher=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=29 October 2012|date=2 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 31.5&nbsp;square miles (81.7&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which 31.1&nbsp;square miles (80.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) is land and 0.4&nbsp;square mile (1.1&nbsp;km\u00b2) (1.39%) is water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/hurricanecityutah|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Hurricane city, Utah|website=www.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=right\n|1910= 336\n|1920= 1021\n|1930= 1197\n|1940= 1524\n|1950= 1271\n|1960= 1251\n|1970= 1408\n|1980= 2660\n|1990= 3915\n|2000= 8250\n|2010= 13748\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=18205\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAt the 2010 [[census]],<ref>http://cityofhurricane.com/uploads/fb/about/2010Census.pdf</ref> there were 13,748 people, 4,609 households and 3,545 families residing in the city.

[[Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]]. They also live as minorities in other regions of China (e.g. [[Xinjiang]]), as well as in [[Russia]]. Mongolian people belonging to the [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] subgroups live predominantly in the Russian federal subjects of [[Buryatia]] and [[Kalmykia]].\n\nThe Mongols are bound together by a common heritage and [[ethnic identity]]. Their indigenous dialects are collectively known as the [[Mongolian language]]. The ancestors of the modern-day Mongols are referred to as [[Proto-Mongols]].\n\n== Definition ==\nBroadly defined, the term includes the Mongols proper (also known as the [[Khalkha Mongols]]), [[Buryats]], [[Oirats]], the [[Kalmyk people]] and the Southern Mongols. The latter comprises the [[Abaga Mongols]], [[Abaganar]], [[Aohans]], [[Baarins]], [[Gorlos Mongols]], [[Jalaids]], [[Jaruud]], [[Khishigten]], [[Khuuchid]], [[Muumyangan]] and [[Onnigud]].\n\nThe designation \"Mongol\" briefly appeared in 8th century records of [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] to describe a tribe of [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]]. It resurfaced in the late 11th century during the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-ruled [[Liao dynasty]]. After the fall of the Liao in 1125, the [[Khamag Mongol]]s became a leading tribe on the [[Mongolian Plateau]]. However, their wars with the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-ruled [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and the [[Tatar confederation]] had weakened them.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, the word Mongol grew into an umbrella term for a large group of [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic-speaking]] tribes united under the rule of [[Genghis Khan]].<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia\n  | title = Mongolia: Ethnography of Mongolia\n  | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-27420/Mongolia#394579.hook\n  | encyclopedia = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]\n  | accessdate = 2007-07-22\n}}</ref>\n\n{{History of the Mongols}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Mongolia}}\n\nIn various times Mongolic peoples have been equated with the [[Scythians]], the [[Gog and Magog|Magog]], and the [[Tungusic peoples]]. Based on Chinese historical texts the ancestry of the Mongolic peoples can be traced back to the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], a nomadic confederation occupying eastern Mongolia and [[Manchuria]]. The identity of the [[Xiongnu]] (H\u00fcnn\u00fc) is still debated today. Although some scholars maintain that they were [[proto-Mongols]], they were more likely a multi-ethnic group of Mongolic and [[Turkic tribes]].<ref name=\"Geng 2005\">Geng 2005</ref> It has been suggested that the language of the [[Huns]] was related to the H\u00fcnn\u00fc.<ref>\u00c9tienne de la Vaissi\u00e8re, Xiongnu.

Katalin Csornai, 2007, Budapest, Hungary [http://hunsarecoming.oxyhost.com/articles/asianhuns_chinesesources.htm summary]</ref> -->\n\nThe Donghu, however, can be much more easily labeled proto-Mongol since the Chinese histories trace only Mongolic tribes and kingdoms ([[Xianbei]] and [[Wuhuan]] peoples) from them, although some historical texts claim a mixed Xiongnu-Donghu ancestry for some tribes (e.g. the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]).<ref>[[Frances Wood]], ''The Silk Road: two thousand years in the heart of Asia'', p. 48</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nSee [[Genetic history of East Asians]]\n\n=== In the Chinese classics ===\n{{see also|Timeline of Mongols prior to the Mongol Empire}}\nThe Donghu are mentioned by [[Sima Qian]] as already existing in [[Inner Mongolia]] north of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] in 699\u2013632 BCE along with the [[Shanrong]]. Mentions in the ''[[Yi Zhou Shu]]'' (\"Lost Book of Zhou\") and the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'' indicate the Donghu were also active during the [[Shang dynasty]] (1600\u20131046 BCE).\n\nThe Xianbei formed part of the Donghu confederation, but had earlier times of independence, as evidenced by a mention in the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'' (\"\u6649\u8a9e\u516b\" section), which states that during the reign of [[King Cheng of Zhou]] (reigned 1042\u20131021 BCE) they came to participate at a meeting of Zhou subject-lords at Qiyang (\u5c90\u9633) (now [[Qishan County]]) but were only allowed to perform the fire ceremony under the supervision of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] since they were not vassals by covenant (\u8bf8\u4faf). The Xianbei chieftain was appointed joint guardian of the ritual torch along with [[Xiong Yi]].\n\nThese early Xianbei came from the nearby [[Zhukaigou culture]] (2200\u20131500 BCE) in the [[Ordos Desert]], where maternal DNA corresponds to the Mongol [[Daur people]] and the Tungusic [[Evenks]]. The Zhukaigou Xianbei (part of the [[Ordos culture]] of Inner Mongolia and northern [[Shaanxi]]) had trade relations with the Shang. In the late 2nd century, the Han dynasty scholar Fu Qian (\u670d\u8654) wrote in his commentary \"Jixie\" (\u96c6\u89e3) that \"[[Shanrong]] and [[Beidi]] are ancestors of the present-day Xianbei\". Again in Inner Mongolia another closely connected core Mongolic Xianbei region was the [[Upper Xiajiadian culture]] (1000\u2013600 BCE) where the Donghu confederation was centered.\n\nAfter the Donghu were defeated by Xiongnu king [[Modu Chanyu]], the Xianbei and [[Wuhuan]] survived as the main remnants of the confederation. [[Tadun]] Khan of the Wuhuan (died 207 AD) was the ancestor of the proto-Mongolic [[Kumo Xi]].<ref>[[Xin Tangshu]] 219. 6173.</ref> The Wuhuan are of the direct Donghu royal line and the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' says that in 209 BCE, Modu Chanyu defeated the Wuhuan instead of using the word Donghu. The Xianbei, however, were of the lateral Donghu line and had a somewhat separate identity, although they shared the same language with the Wuhuan. In 49 CE the Xianbei ruler Bianhe (Bayan Khan?) raided and defeated the Xiongnu, killing 2000, after having received generous gifts from [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]]. The Xianbei reached their peak under Tanshihuai Khan (reigned 156\u2013181) who expanded the vast, but short lived, [[Xianbei state]] (93\u2013234).\n\nThree prominent groups split from the [[Xianbei state]] as recorded by the Chinese histories: the [[Rouran]] (claimed by some to be the [[Pannonian Avars]]), the [[Khitan people]] and the [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]] (a subtribe called the \"Shiwei Menggu\" is held to be the origin of the Genghisid Mongols).<ref>University of California, Berkeley. Project on Linguistic Analysis, ''Journal of Chinese linguistics'', p. 154</ref> Besides these three Xianbei groups, there were others such as the [[Murong]], [[Duan (tribe)|Duan]] and [[Tuoba]]. Their culture was nomadic, their religion [[shamanism]] or [[Buddhism]] and their military strength formidable. There is still no direct evidence that the Rouran spoke [[Mongolic languages]], although most scholars agree that they were Proto-Mongolic.<ref>Thomas Hoppe, ''Die ethnischen Gruppen Xinjiangs: Kulturunterschiede und interethnische'', p. 66</ref> The Khitan, however, had two scripts of their own and many Mongolic words are found in their half-deciphered writings.\n\nGeographically, the [[Tuoba]] Xianbei ruled the southern part of Inner Mongolia and northern China, the Rouran ([[Yujiul\u00fc Shelun]] was the first to use the title [[khagan]] in 402) ruled eastern Mongolia, western Mongolia, the northern part of Inner Mongolia and northern Mongolia, the Khitan were concentrated in eastern part of Inner Mongolia north of [[Korea]] and the Shiwei were located to the north of the Khitan. These tribes and kingdoms were soon overshadowed by the rise of the [[Turkic Khaganate]] in 555, the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] in 745 and the [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] states in 840. The Tuoba were eventually absorbed into China. The Rouran fled west from the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks and either disappeared into obscurity or, as some say, invaded Europe as the Avars under their Khan, [[Bayan I]]. Some Rouran under Tatar Khan migrated east, founding the [[Tatar confederation]], who became part of the [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]]. The Khitan, who were independent after their separation from the [[Kumo Xi]] (of [[Wuhuan]] origin) in 388, continued as a minor power in Manchuria until one of them, Ambagai (872\u2013926), established the [[Liao dynasty]] (907\u20131125) as [[Emperor Taizu of Liao]].\n\n=== Era of the Mongol Empire and Northern Yuan ===\n{{Main|Mongol Empire|Northern Yuan dynasty}}\n[[File:Asia 500ad.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.65|Asia in 500, showing the [[Rouran Khaganate]] and its neighbors, including the Northern Wei and the Tuyuhun Khanate, all of them were established by Proto-Mongols]]\n\nThe destruction of Uyghur Khaganate by the Kirghiz resulted in the end of Turkic dominance in Mongolia. According to historians, Kirghiz were not interested in assimilating newly acquired lands; instead, they controlled local tribes through various manaps (tribal leader). The Khitans occupied the areas vacated by the Turkic Uyghurs bringing them under their control. The [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] state was centered on [[Khakassia]] and they were expelled from Mongolia by the Khitans in 924. Beginning in the 10th century, the Khitans, under the leadership of [[Abaoji]], prevailed in several military campaigns against the [[Tang Dynasty]]{{'}}s border guards, and the [[Kumo Xi|Xi]], [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] nomadic groups.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = The Other Press| isbn = 978-983-9541-88-5| last = San| first = Tan Koon| title = Dynastic China: An Elementary History| date = 2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\nThe Khitan fled west after being defeated by the [[Jurchens]] (later known as [[Manchu people|Manchu]]) and founded the [[Qara Khitai]] (1125\u20131218) in eastern [[Kazakhstan]]. In 1218, Genghis Khan destroyed the Qara Khitai after which the Khitan passed into obscurity. With the expansion of the Mongol Empire, the Mongolic peoples settled over almost all [[Eurasia]] and carried on military campaigns from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to [[Indonesia]]n [[Java]] island and from [[Mongol invasion of Japan|Japan]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] ([[Gaza City|Gaza]]). They simultaneously became [[Padishah]]s of [[Persia]], [[Emperors of China]], and [[Great Khans]] of Mongolia, and one became [[Sultan of Egypt]] ([[Al-Adil Kitbugha]]). The Mongolic peoples of the [[Golden Horde]] established themselves to govern Russia by 1240.<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\">Jerry Bentley, \"Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchange in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 136.</ref> By 1279, they conquered the Song dynasty and brought all of China under control of the [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref name=\"Jerry Bentley 1993\"/>\n\n[[File:Mooko-Suenaga.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Mongols using [[China|Chinese]] [[gunpowder]] bombs during the [[Mongol Invasions of Japan]], 1281]]\n\nWith the breakup of the empire, the dispersed Mongolic peoples quickly adopted the mostly Turkic cultures surrounding them and were assimilated, forming parts of [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Karakalpaks]], [[Tatars]], [[Bashkirs]], [[Turkmens]], [[Uyghurs]], [[Nogays]], [[Kyrgyzs]], [[Kazakhs]], [[People of Caucasus|Caucasaus peoples]], [[Iranian peoples]] and [[Mughal (tribe)|Moghuls]]; linguistic and cultural [[Persianization]] also began to be prominent in these territories. Some Mongols assimilated into the [[Yakuts]] after their migration to Northern Siberia and about 30% of [[Yakut language|Yakut words]] have Mongol origin. However, most of the Yuan Mongols returned to Mongolia in 1368, retaining their language and culture. There were 250,000 Mongols in Southern China and many Mongols were massacred by the rebel army. The survivors were trapped in southern china and eventually assimilated. The [[Dongxiangs]], [[Bonans]], [[Yugur]] and [[Monguor people]] were invaded by Chinese [[Ming dynasty]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, the Mongols continued to rule the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]] in Mongolia homeland. However, the [[Oirad]]s began to challenge the Eastern Mongolic peoples under the [[Borjigin]] monarchs in the late 14th century and Mongolia was divided into two parts: [[Western Mongolia]] ([[Oirats]]) and Eastern Mongolia ([[Khalkha]], [[Inner Mongols]], [[Barga Mongols|Barga]], [[Buryats]]). The earliest written references to the [[plough]] in [[Middle Mongol language|Middle Mongolian]] language sources appear towards the end of the 14th c.<ref>MOLN\u00c1R, \u00c1D\u00c1M. \"THE PLOUGH AND PLOUGHING AMONG THE ALTAIC PEOPLES.\" Central Asiatic Journal 26, no. 3/4 (1982): 215-24.</ref>\n\nIn 1434, Eastern Mongolian [[Taisun Khan]]'s (1433\u20131452) prime minister Western Mongolian Togoon Taish reunited the Mongols after killing Eastern Mongolian another king Adai ([[Khorchin]]). Togoon died in 1439 and his son [[Esen Taish]] became prime minister. Esen carried out successful policy for Mongolian unification and independence. The Ming Empire attempted to invade Mongolia in the 14\u201316th centuries, however, the Ming Empire was defeated by the Oirat, Southern Mongol, Eastern Mongol and united Mongolian armies. Esen's 30,000 cavalries defeated 500,000 Chinese soldiers in [[Tumu Crisis|1449]]. Within eighteen months of his defeat of the titular Khan Taisun, in 1453, Esen himself took the title of [[Great Khan]] (1454\u20131455) of the [[Great Yuan]].<ref>Sechin Jagchid, Van Jay Symons \u2013 Peace, war, and trade along the Great Wall: Nomadic-Chinese interaction through two millennia, p.49</ref>\n\nThe Khalkha emerged during the reign of [[Dayan Khan]] (1479\u20131543) as one of the six [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]s of the Eastern Mongolic peoples. They quickly became the dominant Mongolic clan in Mongolia proper.<ref>[[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]] ''The Mongolic languages'', p.177</ref><ref>Elizabeth E.

The Mongols voluntarily reunified during Eastern Mongolian [[T\u00fcmen Zasagt Khan]] rule (1558\u20131592) for the last time (the Mongol Empire united all Mongols before this).\n\nEastern Mongolia was divided into three parts in the 17th century: [[Outer Mongolia]] (Khalkha), [[Inner Mongolia]] (Inner Mongols) and the Buryat region in southern [[Siberia]].\n\nThe last Mongol khagan was [[Ligdan Khan|Ligdan]] in the early 17th century. He got into conflicts with the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] over the looting of Chinese cities, and managed to alienate most Mongol tribes. In 1618, Ligdan signed a treaty with the [[Ming dynasty]] to protect their northern border from the Manchus attack in exchange for thousands of taels of silver. By the 1620s, only the [[Chahars]] remained under his rule.\n\n=== Qing-era Mongols ===\n{{see also|Mongolia under Qing rule}}\nThe Chahar army was defeated in 1625 and 1628 by the Inner Mongol and Manchu armies due to Ligdan's faulty tactics. The Qing forces secured their control over Inner Mongolia by 1635, and the army of the last khan Ligdan moved to battle against Tibetan [[Gelugpa]] sect (Yellow Hat sect) forces. The Gelugpa forces supported the Manchus, while Ligdan supported [[Kagyu]] sect (Red Hat sect) of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Ligden died in 1634 on his way to [[Tibet]]. By 1636, most Inner Mongolian nobles had submitted to the [[Qing dynasty]] founded by the Manchus. Inner Mongolian Tengis [[noyan]] revolted against the Qing in the 1640s and the Khalkha battled to protect Sunud.\n\nWestern Mongolian Oirats and Eastern Mongolian Khalkhas vied for domination in Mongolia since the 15th century and this conflict weakened Mongolian strength. In 1688, Western Mongolian [[Dzungar Khanate]]'s king [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan|Galdan Boshugtu]] attacked Khalkha after murder of his younger brother by Tusheet Khan Chakhundorj (main or Central Khalkha leader) and the Khalkha-Oirat War began. Galdan threatened to kill Chakhundorj and [[Zanabazar]] (Javzandamba Khutagt I, spiritual head of Khalkha) but they escaped to Sunud (Inner Mongolia). Many Khalkha nobles and folks fled to Inner Mongolia because of the war. Few Khalkhas fled to the Buryat region and Russia threatened to exterminate them if they did not submit, but many of them submitted to Galdan Boshugtu.\n\nIn 1683 [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan|Galdan]]'s armies reached [[Tashkent]] and the [[Syr Darya]] and crushed two armies of the [[Kazakhs]]. After that Galdan subjugated the [[Kyrgyz people|Black Khirgizs]] and ravaged the [[Fergana Valley]]. From 1685 Galdan's forces aggressively pushed the Kazakhs. While his general Rabtan took [[Taraz]], and his main force forced the Kazakhs to migrate westwards.<ref>Michael Khodarkovsky \u2013 Where Two Worlds Met: The Russian State and the Kalmyk Nomads, 1600\u20131771, p.211</ref> In 1687, he besieged the [[Turkistan (city)|City of Turkistan]].

The Mongol-Oirat's Code (a treaty of alliance) against foreign invasion between the Oirats and Khalkhas was signed in 1640, however, the Mongols could not unite against foreign invasions. Chakhundorj fought against Russian invasion of [[Outer Mongolia]] until 1688 and stopped Russian invasion of [[Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l Province]]. Zanabazar struggled to bring together the Oirats and Khalkhas before the war.\n\nGaldan Boshugtu sent his army to \"liberate\" Inner Mongolia after defeating the Khalkha's army and called Inner Mongolian nobles to fight for Mongolian independence. Some Inner Mongolian nobles, [[Tibetans]], [[Kumul Khanate]] and some [[Moghulistan]]'s nobles supported his war against the Manchus, however, Inner Mongolian nobles did not battle against the Qing.\n\nThere were three khans in Khalkha and Zasagt Khan Shar (Western Khalkha leader) was Galdan's ally. Tsetsen Khan (Eastern Khalkha leader) did not engage in this conflict. While Galdan was fighting in Eastern Mongolia, his nephew [[Tseveenravdan]] seized the Dzungarian throne in 1689 and this event made Galdan impossible to fight against the Qing Empire. The Russian and Qing Empires supported his action because this coup weakened Western Mongolian strength. Galdan Boshugtu's army was defeated by the outnumbering Qing army in 1696 and he died in 1697. The Mongols who fled to the Buryat region and Inner Mongolia returned after the war. Some Khalkhas mixed with the Buryats.\n\n[[File:Langshiming mao.JPG|thumb|250px|left|A Mongol soldier called [[Ayusi]] from the high Qing era, by [[Giuseppe Castiglione (Jesuit painter)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], 1755]]\n\nThe Buryats fought against Russian [[Russian conquest of Siberia|invasion]] since the [[Expansion of Russia 1500\u20131800|1620s]] and thousands of Buryats were massacred. The Buryat region was formally annexed to Russia by treaties in 1689 and 1727, when the territories on both the sides of [[Lake Baikal]] were separated from Mongolia. In 1689 the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] established the northern border of [[Manchuria]] north of the present line. The Russians retained [[Trans-Baikal]]ia between Lake Baikal and the [[Argun River (Asia)|Argun River]] north of Mongolia. The [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1727)|Treaty of Kyakhta]] (1727), along with the Treaty of Nerchinsk, regulated the relations between [[Imperial Russia]] and the Qing Empire until the mid-nineteenth century. It established the [[Mongolia-Russia border|northern border]] of Mongolia. [[Oka River (Siberia)|Oka]] Buryats revolted in 1767 and Russia completely conquered the Buryat region in the late 18th century.

Linguists have traditionally proposed a link to the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language families, included alongside Mongolic in the broader group of [[Altaic languages]], though this remains controversial. Today the Mongolian peoples speak at least one of several Mongolic languages including Mongolian, Buryat, Oirat, Dongxiang, Tu, Bonan, Hazaragi, and Aimaq. Additionally, many Mongols speak either Russian or Mandarin Chinese as languages of inter-ethnic communication.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Main|Buddhism in Mongolia|Mongolian Shamanism}}\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Buryatia August 2009-2.jpg|thumb|250px|Buddhist temple in [[Buryatia]], Russia]]\nThe original religion of the Mongolic peoples was [[Shamanism]]. The Xianbei came in contact with [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]] but eventually adopted [[Buddhism]]. However, the Xianbeis in Mongolia and Rourans followed a form of Shamanism. In the 5th century the Buddhist monk Dharmapriya was proclaimed State Teacher of the Rouran Khaganate and given 3000 families and some Rouran nobles became Buddhists. In 511 the Rouran [[Douluofubadoufa Khan]] sent Hong Xuan to the Tuoba court with a pearl-encrusted statue of the Buddha as a gift. The Tuoba Xianbei and Khitans were mostly Buddhists, although they still retained their original Shamanism. The Tuoba had a \"sacrificial castle\" to the west of their capital where ceremonies to spirits took place. Wooden statues of the spirits were erected on top of this sacrificial castle. One ritual involved seven princes with milk offerings who ascended the stairs with 20 female shamans and offered prayers, sprinkling the statues with the sacred milk. The Khitan had their holiest shrine on Mount Muye where portraits of their earliest ancestor Qishou Khagan, his wife Kedun and eight sons were kept in two temples. Mongolic peoples were also exposed to [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manicheism]], [[Nestorianism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Islam]] from the west. The Mongolic peoples, in particular the Borjigin, had their holiest shrine on [[Burkhan Khaldun|Mount Burkhan Khaldun]] where their ancestor B\u00f6rte Chono (Blue Wolf) and Goo Maral (Beautiful Doe) had given birth to them. [[Genghis Khan]] usually fasted, prayed and meditated on this mountain before his campaigns. As a young man he had thanked the mountain for saving his life and prayed at the foot of the mountain sprinkling offerings and bowing nine times to the east with his belt around his neck and his hat held at his chest. Genghis Khan kept a close watch on the Mongolic supreme shaman Kokochu Teb who sometimes conflicted with his authority. Later the imperial cult of Genghis Khan (centered on the [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|eight white gers]] and nine white banners in [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]]) grew into a highly organized indigenous religion with scriptures in the [[Mongolian script]]. Indigenous moral precepts of the Mongolic peoples were enshrined in oral wisdom sayings (now collected in several volumes), the anda (blood-brother) system and ancient texts such as the ''Chinggis-un Bilig'' (Wisdom of Genghis) and ''Oyun Tulkhuur'' (Key of Intelligence). These moral precepts were expressed in poetic form and mainly involved truthfulness, fidelity, help in hardship, unity, self-control, fortitude, veneration of nature, veneration of the state and veneration of parents.\n\n[[File:Tamerlan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Timur]] of Mongolic origin himself had converted almost all the [[Borjigin]] leaders to [[Islam]].]]\n\nIn 1254 [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] organized a formal religious debate (in which [[William of Rubruck]] took part) between Christians, Muslims and Buddhists in [[Karakorum]], a cosmopolitan city of many religions. The Mongolic Empire was known for its religious tolerance, but had a special leaning towards Buddhism and was sympathetic towards Christianity while still worshipping [[Tengri]]. The Mongolic leader [[Abaqa Khan]] sent a delegation of 13\u201316 to the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274), which created a great stir, particularly when their leader 'Zaganus' underwent a public baptism. A joint crusade was announced in line with the [[Franco-Mongol alliance]] but did not materialize because Pope Gregory X died in 1276. [[Yahballaha III]] (1245\u20131317) and [[Rabban Bar Sauma]] (c. 1220\u20131294) were famous Mongolic Nestorian Christians. The [[Keraites]] in central Mongolia were Christian. In Istanbul the [[Church of Saint Mary of the Mongols]] stands as a reminder of the [[Byzantine-Mongol alliance]]. The western Khanates, however, eventually adopted Islam (under [[Berke]] and [[Ghazan]]) and the Turkic languages (because of its commercial importance), although allegiance to the Great Khan and limited use of the Mongolic languages can be seen even in the 1330s. In 1521 the first Mughal emperor Babur took part in a military banner milk-sprinkling ceremony in the Chagatai Khanate where the Mongolian language was still used. [[Al-Adil Kitbugha]] (reigned 1294-1296), a Mongol Sultan of Egypt, and the half-Mongol [[An-Nasir Muhammad]] (reigned till 1341) built the [[Madrassa of Al-Nasir Muhammad]] in Cairo, Egypt. An-Nasir's Mongol mother was Ashlun bint Shaktay. The Mongolic nobility during the [[Yuan dynasty]] studied Confucianism, built Confucian temples (including [[Beijing Confucius Temple]]) and translated Confucian works into Mongolic but mainly followed the [[Sakya]] school of Tibetan Buddhism under [[Drog\u00f6n Ch\u00f6gyal Phagpa|Phags-pa Lama]]. The general populace still practised [[Shamanism]]. [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]] and [[Bonan people|Bonan Mongols]] adopted Islam, as did [[Moghol language|Moghol]]-speaking peoples in Afghanistan. In the 1576 the [[Gelug]] school of Tibetan Buddhism became the state religion of the Mongolia. The Red Hat school of Tibetan Buddhism coexisted with the Gelug Yellow Hat school which was founded by the half-Mongol [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357-1419). Shamanism was absorbed into the [[Buddhism in Mongolia|state religion]] while being marginalized in its purer forms, later only surviving in far northern Mongolia. Monks were some of the leading intellectuals in Mongolia, responsible for much of the literature and art of the pre-modern period. Many Buddhist philosophical works lost in Tibet and elsewhere are preserved in older and purer form in Mongolian ancient texts (e.g. the Mongol [[Kangyur|Kanjur]]). [[Zanabazar]] (1635\u20131723), [[Zaya Pandita]] (1599\u20131662) and [[Danzanravjaa]] (1803\u20131856) are among the most famous Mongol holy men. The 4th Dalai Lama [[Yonten Gyatso]] (1589\u20131617), a Mongol himself, is recognized as the only non-Tibetan [[Dalai Lama]] although the current 14th Dalai Lama is of Mongolic [[Monguor people|Monguor]] extraction.<ref name=\"hill\">Hill, Nathan.

Wives were brought for each of the sons, while daughters were married off to other clans. Wife-taking clans stood in a relation of inferiority to wife-giving clans.

The youngest son would remain in the parental tent caring for his parents, and after their death he would inherit the parental tent in addition to his own part of the herd.

The eldest son inherited the farthest camping lands and pastures, and each son in turn inherited camping lands and pastures closer to the family tent until the youngest son inherited the camping lands and pastures immediately surrounding the family tent. Family units would often remain near each other and in close cooperation, though extended families would inevitably break up after a few generations. It is probable that the Yasa simply put into written law the principles of customary law.\n{{quotation|It is apparent that in many cases, for example in family instructions, the yasa tacitly accepted the principles of customary law and avoided any interference with them. For example, Riasanovsky said that killing the man or the woman in case of adultery is a good illustration. Yasa permitted the institutions of polygamy and concubinage so characteristic of southerly nomadic peoples. Children born of concubines were legitimate. Seniority of children derived their status from their mother. Eldest son received more than the youngest after the death of father. But the latter inherited the household of the father. Children of concubines also received a share in the inheritance, in accordance with the instructions of their father (or with custom.)|Nilg\u00fcn Dalkesen|Gender roles and women's status in Central Asia and Anatolia between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries<ref>http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12608663/index.pdf</ref>}}\n\nAfter the family, the next largest social units were the subclan and clan. These units were derived from groups claiming patrilineal descent from a common ancestor, ranked in order of seniority (the \"conical clan\"). By the [[Chingissid]] era this ranking was symbolically expressed at formal feasts, in which tribal chieftains were seated and received particular portions of the slaughtered animal according to their status.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22Mongols%22+%22seniority%22+%22conical+clan%22#v=onepage&q=%22Mongols%22%20%22seniority%22%20%22conical%20clan%22&f=false | title=Agricultural and Pastoral Societies in Ancient and Classical History| isbn=9781566398329| last1=Adas| first1=Michael| year=2001}}</ref> The lineage structure of [[Central Asia]] had three different modes. It was organized on the basis of genealogical distance, or the proximity of individuals to one another on a graph of kinship; generational distance, or the rank of generation in relation to a common ancestor, and birth order, the rank of brothers in relation to each another.<ref>Cuisenier (1975:67)</ref> The paternal descent lines were collaterally ranked according to the birth of their founders, and were thus considered senior and junior to each other. Of the various collateral patrilines, the senior in order of descent from the founding ancestor, the line of eldest sons, was the most noble. In the steppe, no one had his exact equal; everyone found his place in a system of collaterally ranked lines of descent from a common ancestor.<ref>Krader (1963:322, 269)</ref> It was according to this idiom of superiority and inferiority of lineages derived from birth order that legal claims to superior rank were couched.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 178975|title = Kinship Structure and Political Authority: The Middle East and Central Asia|journal = Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume = 28|issue = 2|pages = 334\u2013355|last1 = Lindholm|first1 = Charles|year = 1986|doi = 10.1017/S001041750001389X|hdl = 2144/3845}}</ref>\n\nThe Mongol kinship is one of a particular patrilineal type classed as [[Omaha kinship|Omaha]], in which relatives are grouped together under separate terms that crosscut generations, age, and even sexual difference. Thus, a man's father's sister's children, his sister's children, and his daughter's children are all called by another term. A further attribute is strict terminological differentiation of siblings according to seniority.\n\nThe division of Mongolian society into senior elite lineages and subordinate junior lineages was waning by the twentieth century. During the 1920s the [[Communist]] regime was established. The remnants of the Mongolian aristocracy fought alongside the [[Japan]]ese and against [[China|Chinese]], [[Soviets]] and Communist Mongols during [[World War II]], but were defeated.\n\nThe anthropologist Herbert Harold Vreeland visited three Mongol communities in 1920 and published a highly detailed book with the results of his fieldwork, ''Mongol community and kinship structure''.<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008324819;view=1up;seq=1 Mongol community and kinship structure.

[[Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]]. They also live as minorities in other regions of China (e.g. [[Xinjiang]]), as well as in [[Russia]]. Mongolian people belonging to the [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] subgroups live predominantly in the Russian federal subjects of [[Buryatia]] and [[Kalmykia]].\n\nThe Mongols are bound together by a common heritage and [[ethnic identity]]. Their indigenous dialects are collectively known as the [[Mongolian language]]. The ancestors of the modern-day Mongols are referred to as [[Proto-Mongols]].\n\n== Definition ==\nBroadly defined, the term includes the Mongols proper (also known as the [[Khalkha Mongols]]), [[Buryats]], [[Oirats]], the [[Kalmyk people]] and the Southern Mongols. The latter comprises the [[Abaga Mongols]], [[Abaganar]], [[Aohans]], [[Baarins]], [[Gorlos Mongols]], [[Jalaids]], [[Jaruud]], [[Khishigten]], [[Khuuchid]], [[Muumyangan]] and [[Onnigud]].\n\nThe designation \"Mongol\" briefly appeared in 8th century records of [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] to describe a tribe of [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]]. It resurfaced in the late 11th century during the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]-ruled [[Liao dynasty]]. After the fall of the Liao in 1125, the [[Khamag Mongol]]s became a leading tribe on the [[Mongolian Plateau]]. However, their wars with the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-ruled [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and the [[Tatar confederation]] had weakened them.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, the word Mongol grew into an umbrella term for a large group of [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic-speaking]] tribes united under the rule of [[Genghis Khan]].<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia\n  | title = Mongolia: Ethnography of Mongolia\n  | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-27420/Mongolia#394579.hook\n  | encyclopedia = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]\n  | accessdate = 2007-07-22\n}}</ref>\n\n{{History of the Mongols}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Mongolia}}\n\nIn various times Mongolic peoples have been equated with the [[Scythians]], the [[Gog and Magog|Magog]], and the [[Tungusic peoples]]. Based on Chinese historical texts the ancestry of the Mongolic peoples can be traced back to the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], a nomadic confederation occupying eastern Mongolia and [[Manchuria]]. The identity of the [[Xiongnu]] (H\u00fcnn\u00fc) is still debated today. Although some scholars maintain that they were [[proto-Mongols]], they were more likely a multi-ethnic group of Mongolic and [[Turkic tribes]].<ref name=\"Geng 2005\">Geng 2005</ref> It has been suggested that the language of the [[Huns]] was related to the H\u00fcnn\u00fc.<ref>\u00c9tienne de la Vaissi\u00e8re, Xiongnu.

Katalin Csornai, 2007, Budapest, Hungary [http://hunsarecoming.oxyhost.com/articles/asianhuns_chinesesources.htm summary]</ref> -->\n\nThe Donghu, however, can be much more easily labeled proto-Mongol since the Chinese histories trace only Mongolic tribes and kingdoms ([[Xianbei]] and [[Wuhuan]] peoples) from them, although some historical texts claim a mixed Xiongnu-Donghu ancestry for some tribes (e.g. the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]).<ref>[[Frances Wood]], ''The Silk Road: two thousand years in the heart of Asia'', p. 48</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nSee [[Genetic history of East Asians]]\n\n=== In the Chinese classics ===\n{{see also|Timeline of Mongols prior to the Mongol Empire}}\nThe Donghu are mentioned by [[Sima Qian]] as already existing in [[Inner Mongolia]] north of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] in 699\u2013632 BCE along with the [[Shanrong]]. Mentions in the ''[[Yi Zhou Shu]]'' (\"Lost Book of Zhou\") and the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'' indicate the Donghu were also active during the [[Shang dynasty]] (1600\u20131046 BCE).\n\nThe Xianbei formed part of the Donghu confederation, but had earlier times of independence, as evidenced by a mention in the ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'' (\"\u6649\u8a9e\u516b\" section), which states that during the reign of [[King Cheng of Zhou]] (reigned 1042\u20131021 BCE) they came to participate at a meeting of Zhou subject-lords at Qiyang (\u5c90\u9633) (now [[Qishan County]]) but were only allowed to perform the fire ceremony under the supervision of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] since they were not vassals by covenant (\u8bf8\u4faf). The Xianbei chieftain was appointed joint guardian of the ritual torch along with [[Xiong Yi]].\n\nThese early Xianbei came from the nearby [[Zhukaigou culture]] (2200\u20131500 BCE) in the [[Ordos Desert]], where maternal DNA corresponds to the Mongol [[Daur people]] and the Tungusic [[Evenks]]. The Zhukaigou Xianbei (part of the [[Ordos culture]] of Inner Mongolia and northern [[Shaanxi]]) had trade relations with the Shang. In the late 2nd century, the Han dynasty scholar Fu Qian (\u670d\u8654) wrote in his commentary \"Jixie\" (\u96c6\u89e3) that \"[[Shanrong]] and [[Beidi]] are ancestors of the present-day Xianbei\". Again in Inner Mongolia another closely connected core Mongolic Xianbei region was the [[Upper Xiajiadian culture]] (1000\u2013600 BCE) where the Donghu confederation was centered.\n\nAfter the Donghu were defeated by Xiongnu king [[Modu Chanyu]], the Xianbei and [[Wuhuan]] survived as the main remnants of the confederation. [[Tadun]] Khan of the Wuhuan (died 207 AD) was the ancestor of the proto-Mongolic [[Kumo Xi]].<ref>[[Xin Tangshu]] 219. 6173.</ref> The Wuhuan are of the direct Donghu royal line and the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' says that in 209 BCE, Modu Chanyu defeated the Wuhuan instead of using the word Donghu. The Xianbei, however, were of the lateral Donghu line and had a somewhat separate identity, although they shared the same language with the Wuhuan. In 49 CE the Xianbei ruler Bianhe (Bayan Khan?) raided and defeated the Xiongnu, killing 2000, after having received generous gifts from [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]]. The Xianbei reached their peak under Tanshihuai Khan (reigned 156\u2013181) who expanded the vast, but short lived, [[Xianbei state]] (93\u2013234).\n\nThree prominent groups split from the [[Xianbei state]] as recorded by the Chinese histories: the [[Rouran]] (claimed by some to be the [[Pannonian Avars]]), the [[Khitan people]] and the [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]] (a subtribe called the \"Shiwei Menggu\" is held to be the origin of the Genghisid Mongols).<ref>University of California, Berkeley. Project on Linguistic Analysis, ''Journal of Chinese linguistics'', p. 154</ref> Besides these three Xianbei groups, there were others such as the [[Murong]], [[Duan (tribe)|Duan]] and [[Tuoba]]. Their culture was nomadic, their religion [[shamanism]] or [[Buddhism]] and their military strength formidable. There is still no direct evidence that the Rouran spoke [[Mongolic languages]], although most scholars agree that they were Proto-Mongolic.<ref>Thomas Hoppe, ''Die ethnischen Gruppen Xinjiangs: Kulturunterschiede und interethnische'', p. 66</ref> The Khitan, however, had two scripts of their own and many Mongolic words are found in their half-deciphered writings.\n\nGeographically, the [[Tuoba]] Xianbei ruled the southern part of Inner Mongolia and northern China, the Rouran ([[Yujiul\u00fc Shelun]] was the first to use the title [[khagan]] in 402) ruled eastern Mongolia, western Mongolia, the northern part of Inner Mongolia and northern Mongolia, the Khitan were concentrated in eastern part of Inner Mongolia north of [[Korea]] and the Shiwei were located to the north of the Khitan. These tribes and kingdoms were soon overshadowed by the rise of the [[Turkic Khaganate]] in 555, the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] in 745 and the [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] states in 840. The Tuoba were eventually absorbed into China. The Rouran fled west from the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks and either disappeared into obscurity or, as some say, invaded Europe as the Avars under their Khan, [[Bayan I]]. Some Rouran under Tatar Khan migrated east, founding the [[Tatar confederation]], who became part of the [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]]. The Khitan, who were independent after their separation from the [[Kumo Xi]] (of [[Wuhuan]] origin) in 388, continued as a minor power in Manchuria until one of them, Ambagai (872\u2013926), established the [[Liao dynasty]] (907\u20131125) as [[Emperor Taizu of Liao]].\n\n=== Era of the Mongol Empire and Northern Yuan ===\n{{Main|Mongol Empire|Northern Yuan dynasty}}\n[[File:Asia 500ad.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.65|Asia in 500, showing the [[Rouran Khaganate]] and its neighbors, including the Northern Wei and the Tuyuhun Khanate, all of them were established by Proto-Mongols]]\n\nThe destruction of Uyghur Khaganate by the Kirghiz resulted in the end of Turkic dominance in Mongolia. According to historians, Kirghiz were not interested in assimilating newly acquired lands; instead, they controlled local tribes through various manaps (tribal leader). The Khitans occupied the areas vacated by the Turkic Uyghurs bringing them under their control. The [[Yenisei Kirghiz]] state was centered on [[Khakassia]] and they were expelled from Mongolia by the Khitans in 924. Beginning in the 10th century, the Khitans, under the leadership of [[Abaoji]], prevailed in several military campaigns against the [[Tang Dynasty]]{{'}}s border guards, and the [[Kumo Xi|Xi]], [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] nomadic groups.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = The Other Press| isbn = 978-983-9541-88-5| last = San| first = Tan Koon| title = Dynastic China: An Elementary History| date = 2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\nThe Khitan fled west after being defeated by the [[Jurchens]] (later known as [[Manchu people|Manchu]]) and founded the [[Qara Khitai]] (1125\u20131218) in eastern [[Kazakhstan]]. In 1218, Genghis Khan destroyed the Qara Khitai after which the Khitan passed into obscurity. With the expansion of the Mongol Empire, the Mongolic peoples settled over almost all [[Eurasia]] and carried on military campaigns from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to [[Indonesia]]n [[Java]] island and from [[Mongol invasion of Japan|Japan]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] ([[Gaza City|Gaza]]). They simultaneously became [[Padishah]]s of [[Persia]], [[Emperors of China]], and [[Great Khans]] of Mongolia, and one became [[Sultan of Egypt]] ([[Al-Adil Kitbugha]]).

However, most of the Yuan Mongols returned to Mongolia in 1368, retaining their language and culture. There were 250,000 Mongols in Southern China and many Mongols were massacred by the rebel army. The survivors were trapped in southern china and eventually assimilated.

However, the [[Oirad]]s began to challenge the Eastern Mongolic peoples under the [[Borjigin]] monarchs in the late 14th century and Mongolia was divided into two parts: [[Western Mongolia]] ([[Oirats]]) and Eastern Mongolia ([[Khalkha]], [[Inner Mongols]], [[Barga Mongols|Barga]], [[Buryats]]).

The Ming Empire attempted to invade Mongolia in the 14\u201316th centuries, however, the Ming Empire was defeated by the Oirat, Southern Mongol, Eastern Mongol and united Mongolian armies. Esen's 30,000 cavalries defeated 500,000 Chinese soldiers in [[Tumu Crisis|1449]].

He got into conflicts with the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] over the looting of Chinese cities, and managed to alienate most Mongol tribes. In 1618, Ligdan signed a treaty with the [[Ming dynasty]] to protect their northern border from the Manchus attack in exchange for thousands of taels of silver. By the 1620s, only the [[Chahars]] remained under his rule.\n\n=== Qing-era Mongols ===\n{{see also|Mongolia under Qing rule}}\nThe Chahar army was defeated in 1625 and 1628 by the Inner Mongol and Manchu armies due to Ligdan's faulty tactics. The Qing forces secured their control over Inner Mongolia by 1635, and the army of the last khan Ligdan moved to battle against Tibetan [[Gelugpa]] sect (Yellow Hat sect) forces. The Gelugpa forces supported the Manchus, while Ligdan supported [[Kagyu]] sect (Red Hat sect) of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Ligden died in 1634 on his way to [[Tibet]]. By 1636, most Inner Mongolian nobles had submitted to the [[Qing dynasty]] founded by the Manchus. Inner Mongolian Tengis [[noyan]] revolted against the Qing in the 1640s and the Khalkha battled to protect Sunud.\n\nWestern Mongolian Oirats and Eastern Mongolian Khalkhas vied for domination in Mongolia since the 15th century and this conflict weakened Mongolian strength. In 1688, Western Mongolian [[Dzungar Khanate]]'s king [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan|Galdan Boshugtu]] attacked Khalkha after murder of his younger brother by Tusheet Khan Chakhundorj (main or Central Khalkha leader) and the Khalkha-Oirat War began. Galdan threatened to kill Chakhundorj and [[Zanabazar]] (Javzandamba Khutagt I, spiritual head of Khalkha) but they escaped to Sunud (Inner Mongolia). Many Khalkha nobles and folks fled to Inner Mongolia because of the war. Few Khalkhas fled to the Buryat region and Russia threatened to exterminate them if they did not submit, but many of them submitted to Galdan Boshugtu.\n\nIn 1683 [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan|Galdan]]'s armies reached [[Tashkent]] and the [[Syr Darya]] and crushed two armies of the [[Kazakhs]]. After that Galdan subjugated the [[Kyrgyz people|Black Khirgizs]] and ravaged the [[Fergana Valley]]. From 1685 Galdan's forces aggressively pushed the Kazakhs.

The Mongol-Oirat's Code (a treaty of alliance) against foreign invasion between the Oirats and Khalkhas was signed in 1640, however, the Mongols could not unite against foreign invasions. Chakhundorj fought against Russian invasion of [[Outer Mongolia]] until 1688 and stopped Russian invasion of [[Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l Province]]. Zanabazar struggled to bring together the Oirats and Khalkhas before the war.\n\nGaldan Boshugtu sent his army to \"liberate\" Inner Mongolia after defeating the Khalkha's army and called Inner Mongolian nobles to fight for Mongolian independence. Some Inner Mongolian nobles, [[Tibetans]], [[Kumul Khanate]] and some [[Moghulistan]]'s nobles supported his war against the Manchus, however, Inner Mongolian nobles did not battle against the Qing.\n\nThere were three khans in Khalkha and Zasagt Khan Shar (Western Khalkha leader) was Galdan's ally. Tsetsen Khan (Eastern Khalkha leader) did not engage in this conflict. While Galdan was fighting in Eastern Mongolia, his nephew [[Tseveenravdan]] seized the Dzungarian throne in 1689 and this event made Galdan impossible to fight against the Qing Empire. The Russian and Qing Empires supported his action because this coup weakened Western Mongolian strength. Galdan Boshugtu's army was defeated by the outnumbering Qing army in 1696 and he died in 1697. The Mongols who fled to the Buryat region and Inner Mongolia returned after the war. Some Khalkhas mixed with the Buryats.\n\n[[File:Langshiming mao.JPG|thumb|250px|left|A Mongol soldier called [[Ayusi]] from the high Qing era, by [[Giuseppe Castiglione (Jesuit painter)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], 1755]]\n\nThe Buryats fought against Russian [[Russian conquest of Siberia|invasion]] since the [[Expansion of Russia 1500\u20131800|1620s]] and thousands of Buryats were massacred. The Buryat region was formally annexed to Russia by treaties in 1689 and 1727, when the territories on both the sides of [[Lake Baikal]] were separated from Mongolia. In 1689 the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] established the northern border of [[Manchuria]] north of the present line.

Linguists have traditionally proposed a link to the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language families, included alongside Mongolic in the broader group of [[Altaic languages]], though this remains controversial. Today the Mongolian peoples speak at least one of several Mongolic languages including Mongolian, Buryat, Oirat, Dongxiang, Tu, Bonan, Hazaragi, and Aimaq. Additionally, many Mongols speak either Russian or Mandarin Chinese as languages of inter-ethnic communication.\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Main|Buddhism in Mongolia|Mongolian Shamanism}}\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Buryatia August 2009-2.jpg|thumb|250px|Buddhist temple in [[Buryatia]], Russia]]\nThe original religion of the Mongolic peoples was [[Shamanism]]. The Xianbei came in contact with [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]] but eventually adopted [[Buddhism]]. However, the Xianbeis in Mongolia and Rourans followed a form of Shamanism. In the 5th century the Buddhist monk Dharmapriya was proclaimed State Teacher of the Rouran Khaganate and given 3000 families and some Rouran nobles became Buddhists. In 511 the Rouran [[Douluofubadoufa Khan]] sent Hong Xuan to the Tuoba court with a pearl-encrusted statue of the Buddha as a gift. The Tuoba Xianbei and Khitans were mostly Buddhists, although they still retained their original Shamanism. The Tuoba had a \"sacrificial castle\" to the west of their capital where ceremonies to spirits took place. Wooden statues of the spirits were erected on top of this sacrificial castle. One ritual involved seven princes with milk offerings who ascended the stairs with 20 female shamans and offered prayers, sprinkling the statues with the sacred milk. The Khitan had their holiest shrine on Mount Muye where portraits of their earliest ancestor Qishou Khagan, his wife Kedun and eight sons were kept in two temples. Mongolic peoples were also exposed to [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manicheism]], [[Nestorianism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Islam]] from the west. The Mongolic peoples, in particular the Borjigin, had their holiest shrine on [[Burkhan Khaldun|Mount Burkhan Khaldun]] where their ancestor B\u00f6rte Chono (Blue Wolf) and Goo Maral (Beautiful Doe) had given birth to them. [[Genghis Khan]] usually fasted, prayed and meditated on this mountain before his campaigns. As a young man he had thanked the mountain for saving his life and prayed at the foot of the mountain sprinkling offerings and bowing nine times to the east with his belt around his neck and his hat held at his chest. Genghis Khan kept a close watch on the Mongolic supreme shaman Kokochu Teb who sometimes conflicted with his authority. Later the imperial cult of Genghis Khan (centered on the [[Mausoleum of Genghis Khan|eight white gers]] and nine white banners in [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]]) grew into a highly organized indigenous religion with scriptures in the [[Mongolian script]]. Indigenous moral precepts of the Mongolic peoples were enshrined in oral wisdom sayings (now collected in several volumes), the anda (blood-brother) system and ancient texts such as the ''Chinggis-un Bilig'' (Wisdom of Genghis) and ''Oyun Tulkhuur'' (Key of Intelligence). These moral precepts were expressed in poetic form and mainly involved truthfulness, fidelity, help in hardship, unity, self-control, fortitude, veneration of nature, veneration of the state and veneration of parents.\n\n[[File:Tamerlan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Timur]] of Mongolic origin himself had converted almost all the [[Borjigin]] leaders to [[Islam]].]]\n\nIn 1254 [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]] organized a formal religious debate (in which [[William of Rubruck]] took part) between Christians, Muslims and Buddhists in [[Karakorum]], a cosmopolitan city of many religions. The Mongolic Empire was known for its religious tolerance, but had a special leaning towards Buddhism and was sympathetic towards Christianity while still worshipping [[Tengri]]. The Mongolic leader [[Abaqa Khan]] sent a delegation of 13\u201316 to the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274), which created a great stir, particularly when their leader 'Zaganus' underwent a public baptism. A joint crusade was announced in line with the [[Franco-Mongol alliance]] but did not materialize because Pope Gregory X died in 1276. [[Yahballaha III]] (1245\u20131317) and [[Rabban Bar Sauma]] (c. 1220\u20131294) were famous Mongolic Nestorian Christians. The [[Keraites]] in central Mongolia were Christian. In Istanbul the [[Church of Saint Mary of the Mongols]] stands as a reminder of the [[Byzantine-Mongol alliance]]. The western Khanates, however, eventually adopted Islam (under [[Berke]] and [[Ghazan]]) and the Turkic languages (because of its commercial importance), although allegiance to the Great Khan and limited use of the Mongolic languages can be seen even in the 1330s. In 1521 the first Mughal emperor Babur took part in a military banner milk-sprinkling ceremony in the Chagatai Khanate where the Mongolian language was still used. [[Al-Adil Kitbugha]] (reigned 1294-1296), a Mongol Sultan of Egypt, and the half-Mongol [[An-Nasir Muhammad]] (reigned till 1341) built the [[Madrassa of Al-Nasir Muhammad]] in Cairo, Egypt. An-Nasir's Mongol mother was Ashlun bint Shaktay. The Mongolic nobility during the [[Yuan dynasty]] studied Confucianism, built Confucian temples (including [[Beijing Confucius Temple]]) and translated Confucian works into Mongolic but mainly followed the [[Sakya]] school of Tibetan Buddhism under [[Drog\u00f6n Ch\u00f6gyal Phagpa|Phags-pa Lama]]. The general populace still practised [[Shamanism]]. [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]] and [[Bonan people|Bonan Mongols]] adopted Islam, as did [[Moghol language|Moghol]]-speaking peoples in Afghanistan. In the 1576 the [[Gelug]] school of Tibetan Buddhism became the state religion of the Mongolia. The Red Hat school of Tibetan Buddhism coexisted with the Gelug Yellow Hat school which was founded by the half-Mongol [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357-1419). Shamanism was absorbed into the [[Buddhism in Mongolia|state religion]] while being marginalized in its purer forms, later only surviving in far northern Mongolia. Monks were some of the leading intellectuals in Mongolia, responsible for much of the literature and art of the pre-modern period. Many Buddhist philosophical works lost in Tibet and elsewhere are preserved in older and purer form in Mongolian ancient texts (e.g. the Mongol [[Kangyur|Kanjur]]). [[Zanabazar]] (1635\u20131723), [[Zaya Pandita]] (1599\u20131662) and [[Danzanravjaa]] (1803\u20131856) are among the most famous Mongol holy men. The 4th Dalai Lama [[Yonten Gyatso]] (1589\u20131617), a Mongol himself, is recognized as the only non-Tibetan [[Dalai Lama]] although the current 14th Dalai Lama is of Mongolic [[Monguor people|Monguor]] extraction.<ref name=\"hill\">Hill, Nathan.

During the socialist period religion was officially banned, although it was practiced in clandestine circles. Today, a sizable proportion of Mongolic peoples are [[atheism|atheist]] or [[agnosticism|agnostic]]. In the most recent census in Mongolia, almost forty percent of the population reported as being atheist, while the majority religion was Tibetan Buddhism, with 53%.<ref>[http://www.toollogo2010.mn/doc/Main%20results_20110615_to%20EZBH_for%20print.pdf National Census 2010 Preliminary results] '''(Mongolian)'''</ref> Having survived suppression by the Communists, Buddhism among the Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western Mongols is today primarily of the [[Gelugpa]] (Yellow Hat sect) school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

Wives were brought for each of the sons, while daughters were married off to other clans. Wife-taking clans stood in a relation of inferiority to wife-giving clans. Thus wife-giving clans were considered \"elder\" or \"bigger\" in relation to wife-taking clans, who were considered \"younger\" or \"smaller\".<ref>Vreeland 1962:160</ref><ref>Aberle 1953:23\u201324</ref> This distinction, symbolized in terms of \"elder\" and \"younger\" or \"bigger\" and \"smaller\", was carried into the clan and family as well, and all members of a lineage were terminologically distinguished by generation and age, with senior superior to junior.\n\nIn the traditional Mongolian family, each son received a part of the family herd as he married, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The youngest son would remain in the parental tent caring for his parents, and after their death he would inherit the parental tent in addition to his own part of the herd. This inheritance system was mandated by law codes such as the [[Yassa]], created by [[Genghis Khan]].<ref>[http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm THE INFLUENCE OF THE GREAT CODE \u201cYASA\u201d ON THE MONGOLIAN EMPIRE] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130615073730/http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm |date=2013-06-15 }}</ref> Likewise, each son inherited a part of the family's camping lands and pastures, with the elder son receiving more than the younger son. The eldest son inherited the farthest camping lands and pastures, and each son in turn inherited camping lands and pastures closer to the family tent until the youngest son inherited the camping lands and pastures immediately surrounding the family tent. Family units would often remain near each other and in close cooperation, though extended families would inevitably break up after a few generations. It is probable that the Yasa simply put into written law the principles of customary law.\n{{quotation|It is apparent that in many cases, for example in family instructions, the yasa tacitly accepted the principles of customary law and avoided any interference with them. For example, Riasanovsky said that killing the man or the woman in case of adultery is a good illustration. Yasa permitted the institutions of polygamy and concubinage so characteristic of southerly nomadic peoples. Children born of concubines were legitimate. Seniority of children derived their status from their mother. Eldest son received more than the youngest after the death of father. But the latter inherited the household of the father. Children of concubines also received a share in the inheritance, in accordance with the instructions of their father (or with custom.)|Nilg\u00fcn Dalkesen|Gender roles and women's status in Central Asia and Anatolia between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries<ref>http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12608663/index.pdf</ref>}}\n\nAfter the family, the next largest social units were the subclan and clan. These units were derived from groups claiming patrilineal descent from a common ancestor, ranked in order of seniority (the \"conical clan\"). By the [[Chingissid]] era this ranking was symbolically expressed at formal feasts, in which tribal chieftains were seated and received particular portions of the slaughtered animal according to their status.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22Mongols%22+%22seniority%22+%22conical+clan%22#v=onepage&q=%22Mongols%22%20%22seniority%22%20%22conical%20clan%22&f=false | title=Agricultural and Pastoral Societies in Ancient and Classical History| isbn=9781566398329| last1=Adas| first1=Michael| year=2001}}</ref> The lineage structure of [[Central Asia]] had three different modes. It was organized on the basis of genealogical distance, or the proximity of individuals to one another on a graph of kinship; generational distance, or the rank of generation in relation to a common ancestor, and birth order, the rank of brothers in relation to each another.<ref>Cuisenier (1975:67)</ref> The paternal descent lines were collaterally ranked according to the birth of their founders, and were thus considered senior and junior to each other. Of the various collateral patrilines, the senior in order of descent from the founding ancestor, the line of eldest sons, was the most noble. In the steppe, no one had his exact equal; everyone found his place in a system of collaterally ranked lines of descent from a common ancestor.<ref>Krader (1963:322, 269)</ref> It was according to this idiom of superiority and inferiority of lineages derived from birth order that legal claims to superior rank were couched.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 178975|title = Kinship Structure and Political Authority: The Middle East and Central Asia|journal = Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume = 28|issue = 2|pages = 334\u2013355|last1 = Lindholm|first1 = Charles|year = 1986|doi = 10.1017/S001041750001389X|hdl = 2144/3845}}</ref>\n\nThe Mongol kinship is one of a particular patrilineal type classed as [[Omaha kinship|Omaha]], in which relatives are grouped together under separate terms that crosscut generations, age, and even sexual difference. Thus, a man's father's sister's children, his sister's children, and his daughter's children are all called by another term. A further attribute is strict terminological differentiation of siblings according to seniority.\n\nThe division of Mongolian society into senior elite lineages and subordinate junior lineages was waning by the twentieth century. During the 1920s the [[Communist]] regime was established. The remnants of the Mongolian aristocracy fought alongside the [[Japan]]ese and against [[China|Chinese]], [[Soviets]] and Communist Mongols during [[World War II]], but were defeated.\n\nThe anthropologist Herbert Harold Vreeland visited three Mongol communities in 1920 and published a highly detailed book with the results of his fieldwork, ''Mongol community and kinship structure''.<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015008324819;view=1up;seq=1 Mongol community and kinship structure.

The diamond was part of the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] [[Peacock Throne]]. It changed hands between various factions in south and west Asia, until being ceded to [[Queen Victoria]] after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|British annexation]] of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] in 1849.\n\nOriginally, the stone was of a similar cut to other [[Mughal Empire|Mughal-era]] diamonds, like the [[Darya-i-Noor]], which are now in the [[Iranian Crown Jewels]]. In 1851, it went on display at the [[Great Exhibition]] in London, but the lacklustre cut failed to impress viewers.

Wafa Begum replied that if a strong man threw a stone in four cardinal directions and vertically, Koh-i-Noor would be worth more than the gold and precious stones filled in the space. Ranjit Singh grew paranoid about the Koh-i-Noor being stolen, because in the past, another valuable jewel had been stolen from him while he was intoxicated. He kept the diamond within a high-security facility at the [[Gobindgarh Fort]] when it was not in use. When the diamond was to be transported, it was placed in a [[pannier]] on a guarded camel; 39 other camels with identical panniers were included in the convoy; the diamond was always placed on the first camel immediately behind the guards, but great secrecy was maintained regarding which camel carried it.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=84}} Only Ranjit Singh's treasurer Misr Beli Ram knew which camel carried the diamond.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=106}}\n\nIn June 1839, Ranjit Singh suffered his third [[stroke]], and it became apparent that he would die soon. On his deathbed, he started giving away his valuable possessions to religious charities, and appointed his eldest son [[Kharak Singh]] as his successor.

Bhai Gobind Ram, the head [[Brahmin]] of Ranjit Singh, insisted that the king had willed Koh-i-Noor and other jewels to the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] in [[Puri]]: the king apparently supported this claim through gestures, as recorded in his court chronicle ''Umdat ul-Tawarikh''.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|pp=91-92}} However, treasurer Beli Ram insisted that it was a state property rather than Ranjit Singh's personal property, and therefore, should be handed over to Kharak Singh.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=92}}\n\nAfter Ranjit Singh's death, Beli Ram refused to send the diamond to the temple, and hid it in his vaults.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=107}} Meanwhile, Kharak Singh and prime minister [[Dhian Singh]] also issued orders stating that the diamond should not be taken out of Lahore.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=108}}\n\n=== In Gulab Singh's possession ===\nOn 8 October 1839 the new emperor Kharak Singh, was overthrown in a coup by his prime minister Dhian Singh.

Article III of the treaty read: \"The gem called the Koh-i-Noor, which was taken from Shah Sooja-ool-moolk by Maharajah Ranjeet Singh, shall be surrendered by the Maharajah of Lahore to the Queen of England (''sic'')\".<ref>Login, p. 126.</ref>\n\nThe lead signatory of the treaty for the eleven-year-old Maharaja Duleep Singh was his commander-in-chief [[Tej Singh]], a loyalist of Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] who had previously been in possession of the Koh-i-noor and gained [[Kashmir]] from the Sikh empire, via treaty with Britain, following the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]].\n\nThe [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] in charge of the ratification of this treaty was the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]]. The manner of his aiding in the transfer of the diamond was criticized even by some of his contemporaries in Britain.

They departed from Bombay on 6 April on board HMS ''Medea'', captained by Captain Lockyer.\n\nThe ship had a difficult voyage: an outbreak of [[cholera]] on board when the ship was in [[Mauritius]] had the locals demanding its departure, and they asked their governor to open fire on the vessel and destroy it if there was no response.

The diamond was part of the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] [[Peacock Throne]]. It changed hands between various factions in south and west Asia, until being ceded to [[Queen Victoria]] after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War|British annexation]] of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] in 1849.\n\nOriginally, the stone was of a similar cut to other [[Mughal Empire|Mughal-era]] diamonds, like the [[Darya-i-Noor]], which are now in the [[Iranian Crown Jewels]]. In 1851, it went on display at the [[Great Exhibition]] in London, but the lacklustre cut failed to impress viewers. [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], husband of Queen Victoria, ordered it to be re-cut as an oval brilliant by [[Coster Diamonds]]. By modern standards, the culet (point at the bottom of a gemstone) is unusually broad, giving the impression of a black hole when the stone is viewed head-on; it is nevertheless regarded by [[gemology|gemologists]] as \"full of life\".<ref>Howie, p. 293.</ref>\n\nBecause its history involves a great deal of fighting between men, the Koh-i-Noor acquired a reputation within the [[British royal family]] for bringing bad luck to any man who wears it.<!--cited end of paragraph--> Since arriving in the UK, it has only been worn by female members of the family.<ref>Mears, et al., p. 27.</ref> Victoria wore the stone in a brooch and a circlet. After she died in 1901, it was set in the [[Crown of Queen Alexandra]], wife of [[Edward VII]].

Wafa Begum replied that if a strong man threw a stone in four cardinal directions and vertically, Koh-i-Noor would be worth more than the gold and precious stones filled in the space. Ranjit Singh grew paranoid about the Koh-i-Noor being stolen, because in the past, another valuable jewel had been stolen from him while he was intoxicated. He kept the diamond within a high-security facility at the [[Gobindgarh Fort]] when it was not in use. When the diamond was to be transported, it was placed in a [[pannier]] on a guarded camel; 39 other camels with identical panniers were included in the convoy; the diamond was always placed on the first camel immediately behind the guards, but great secrecy was maintained regarding which camel carried it.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=84}} Only Ranjit Singh's treasurer Misr Beli Ram knew which camel carried the diamond.{{sfn|Dalrymple|Anand|2017|p=106}}\n\nIn June 1839, Ranjit Singh suffered his third [[stroke]], and it became apparent that he would die soon.

Article III of the treaty read: \"The gem called the Koh-i-Noor, which was taken from Shah Sooja-ool-moolk by Maharajah Ranjeet Singh, shall be surrendered by the Maharajah of Lahore to the Queen of England (''sic'')\".<ref>Login, p. 126.</ref>\n\nThe lead signatory of the treaty for the eleven-year-old Maharaja Duleep Singh was his commander-in-chief [[Tej Singh]], a loyalist of Maharaja [[Gulab Singh]] who had previously been in possession of the Koh-i-noor and gained [[Kashmir]] from the Sikh empire, via treaty with Britain, following the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]].\n\nThe [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] in charge of the ratification of this treaty was the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]]. The manner of his aiding in the transfer of the diamond was criticized even by some of his contemporaries in Britain.

It was then sent to England for presentation to Queen Victoria in the care of Captain J. Ramsay and Brevet Lt. Col F.

They departed from Bombay on 6 April on board HMS ''Medea'', captained by Captain Lockyer.\n\nThe ship had a difficult voyage: an outbreak of [[cholera]] on board when the ship was in [[Mauritius]] had the locals demanding its departure, and they asked their governor to open fire on the vessel and destroy it if there was no response.

Nuclear reactors are used at [[nuclear power plant]]s for [[electricity generation]] and in [[nuclear marine propulsion]]. Heat from [[nuclear fission]] is passed to a [[working fluid]] (water or gas), which in turn runs through [[steam turbine]]s. These either drive a ship's [[propeller]]s or turn [[electrical generator]]s' shafts. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for [[district heating]]. Some reactors are used to produce [[isotope]]s for [[Nuclear medicine|medical]] and [[industrial radiography|industrial]] use, or for production of [[weapons-grade]] [[plutonium]].  As of early 2019, the IAEA reports there are 454 nuclear power reactors and 226 nuclear research reactors in operation around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pris.iaea.org/pris/|title=PRIS \u2013 Home|website=pris.iaea.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nucleus.iaea.org/RRDB/RR/ReactorSearch.aspx?rf=1|title=RRDB Search|website=nucleus.iaea.org}}</ref>\n\n==How a nuclear reactor works==\n{{Main|Nuclear reactor physics}}\n\n[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|upright=1.15|thumb|An example of an induced nuclear fission event.

The heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, (the [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]]), releasing [[kinetic energy]], [[gamma rays|gamma radiation]], and [[free neutron]]s. A portion of these [[neutron]]s may be absorbed by other fissile atoms and trigger further fission events, which release more neutrons, and so on. This is known as a [[nuclear chain reaction]].\n\nTo control such a nuclear chain reaction, [[neutron poison]]s and [[neutron moderators]] can change the portion of neutrons that will go on to cause more fission.<ref name=\"DOE HAND\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1019/h1019v2.pdf|title=DOE Fundamentals Handbook: Nuclear Physics and Reactor Theory|publisher=US Department of Energy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423194722/http://www.hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1019/h1019v2.pdf|archivedate=23 April 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=24 September 2008}}\n</ref> Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to shut the fission reaction down if monitoring detects unsafe conditions.<ref>\n{{cite web |title=Reactor Protection & Engineered Safety Feature Systems |work=The Nuclear Tourist |url=http://www.nucleartourist.com/systems/rp.htm |accessdate=25 September 2008}}\n</ref>\n\n===Heat generation===\nThe reactor core generates heat in a number of ways:\n* The [[kinetic energy]] of fission products is converted to [[thermal energy]] when these nuclei collide with nearby atoms.\n* The reactor absorbs some of the [[gamma rays]] produced during fission and converts their energy into heat.\n* Heat is produced by the [[radioactive decay]] of fission products and materials that have been activated by [[neutron absorption]].

The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the [[turbines]], like the [[pressurized water reactor]]. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the [[reactor core]]; for example the [[boiling water reactor]].<ref name=\"HSWCOOLANT\">{{cite web | title=How nuclear power works |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com | url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-power3.htm | accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Reactivity control===\n{{main|Nuclear reactor control|Nuclear reactor physics|Passive nuclear safety|Delayed neutron|Iodine pit|SCRAM|Decay heat}}\nThe rate of fission reactions within a reactor core can be adjusted by controlling the quantity of neutrons that are able to induce further fission events. Nuclear reactors typically employ several methods of neutron control to adjust the reactor's power output. Some of these methods arise naturally from the physics of radioactive decay and are simply accounted for during the reactor's operation, while others are mechanisms engineered into the reactor design for a distinct purpose.\n\nThe fastest method for adjusting levels of fission-inducing neutrons in a reactor is via movement of the [[control rod]]s. Control rods are made of [[neutron poison]]s and therefore absorb neutrons. When a control rod is inserted deeper into the reactor, it absorbs more neutrons than the material it displaces\u2014often the moderator. This action results in fewer neutrons available to cause fission and reduces the reactor's power output. Conversely, extracting the control rod will result in an increase in the rate of fission events and an increase in power.\n\nThe physics of radioactive decay also affects neutron populations in a reactor. One such process is [[delayed neutron]] emission by a number of neutron-rich fission isotopes. These delayed neutrons account for about 0.65% of the total neutrons produced in fission, with the remainder (termed \"[[prompt neutron]]s\") released immediately upon fission. The fission products which produce delayed neutrons have half-lives for their [[Radioactive decay|decay]] by [[neutron emission]] that range from milliseconds to as long as several minutes, and so considerable time is required to determine exactly when a reactor reaches the [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical]] point. Keeping the reactor in the zone of chain reactivity where delayed neutrons are ''necessary'' to achieve a [[critical mass]] state allows mechanical devices or human operators to control a chain reaction in \"real time\"; otherwise the time between achievement of [[critical mass (nuclear)|criticality]] and [[nuclear meltdown]] as a result of an exponential power surge from the normal nuclear chain reaction, would be too short to allow for intervention. This last stage, where delayed neutrons are no longer required to maintain criticality, is known as the [[prompt critical]] point. There is a scale for describing criticality in numerical form, in which bare criticality is known as ''zero [[dollar (reactivity)|dollars]]'' and the prompt critical point is ''one dollar'', and other points in the process interpolated in cents.\n\nIn some reactors, the [[coolant]] also acts as a [[neutron moderator]]. A moderator increases the power of the reactor by causing the fast neutrons that are released from fission to lose energy and become thermal neutrons. [[Thermal neutron]]s are more likely than [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission. If the coolant is a moderator, then temperature changes can affect the density of the coolant/moderator and therefore change power output. A higher temperature coolant would be less dense, and therefore a less effective moderator.\n\nIn other reactors the coolant acts as a poison by absorbing neutrons in the same way that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to [[scram]] the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often [[boron]] in the form of [[boric acid]]) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.<ref name=\"TOURISTRP\">{{cite web |title=Reactor Protection & Engineered Safety Feature Systems |work=The Nuclear Tourist |url= http://www.nucleartourist.com/systems/rp.htm |accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMost types of reactors are sensitive to a process variously known as xenon poisoning, or the [[iodine pit]]. The common [[fission product]] [[Xenon-135]] produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption as fast as it is produced. Fission also produces [[iodine-135]], which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the \"iodine pit.\" If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a \"xenon burnoff (power) transient\". Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption of the lost xenon-135.

The concept of a nuclear chain reaction brought about by [[nuclear reaction]]s mediated by neutrons was first realized shortly thereafter, by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] scientist [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]], in 1933. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple reactor the following year while working at the [[Admiralty]] in London.<ref>L. Szil\u00e1rd, [http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=GB630726 \"Improvements in or relating to the transmutation of chemical elements,\"] British patent number: GB630726 (filed: 28 June 1934; published: 30 March 1936).</ref> However, Szil\u00e1rd's idea did not incorporate the idea of nuclear fission as a neutron source, since that process was not yet discovered. Szil\u00e1rd's ideas for nuclear reactors using neutron-mediated nuclear chain reactions in light elements proved unworkable.\n\nInspiration for a new type of reactor using uranium came from the discovery by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Fritz Strassmann]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in 1938 that bombardment of uranium with neutrons (provided by an alpha-on-beryllium fusion reaction, a \"[[neutron howitzer]]\") produced a [[barium]] residue, which they reasoned was created by the fissioning of the uranium nuclei. Subsequent studies in early 1939 (one of them by Szil\u00e1rd and Fermi) revealed that several neutrons were also released during the fissioning, making available the opportunity for the nuclear [[chain reaction]] that Szil\u00e1rd had envisioned six years previously.\n\nOn 2 August 1939 [[Albert Einstein]] signed a letter to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (written by Szil\u00e1rd) suggesting that the discovery of uranium's fission could lead to the development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\", giving impetus to the study of reactors and fission. Szil\u00e1rd and Einstein knew each other well and had worked together years previously, but Einstein had never thought about this possibility for nuclear energy until Szilard reported it to him, at the beginning of his quest to produce the [[Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter]] to alert the U.S. government.\n\nShortly after, [[Hitler]]'s Germany invaded Poland in 1939, starting [[World War II]] in Europe. The U.S. was not yet officially at war, but in October, when the Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter was delivered to him, Roosevelt commented that the purpose of doing the research was to make sure \"the Nazis don't blow us up.\" The U.S. nuclear project followed, although with some delay as there remained skepticism (some of it from Fermi) and also little action from the small number of officials in the government who were initially charged with moving the project forward.\n\nThe following year the U.S. Government received the [[Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum]] from the UK, which stated that the amount of [[uranium]] needed for a [[chain reaction]] was far lower than had previously been thought. The memorandum was a product of the [[MAUD Committee]], which was working on the UK atomic bomb project, known as [[Tube Alloys]], later [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|to be subsumed]] within the [[Manhattan Project]].\n\nEventually, the first artificial nuclear reactor, [[Chicago Pile-1]], was constructed at the [[University of Chicago]], by a team led by [[Italians|Italian]] physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], in late 1942. By this time, the program had been pressured for a year by U.S. entry into the war. The Chicago Pile achieved [[critical mass|criticality]] on 2 December 1942<ref>The First Reactor, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information</ref> at 3:25&nbsp;PM. The reactor support structure was made of wood, which supported a pile (hence the name) of graphite blocks, embedded in which was natural uranium oxide 'pseudospheres' or 'briquettes'.\n\nSoon after the Chicago Pile, the U.S. military developed a number of nuclear reactors for the [[Manhattan Project]] starting in 1943. The primary purpose for the largest reactors (located at the [[Hanford Site]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]), was the mass production of [[plutonium]] for nuclear weapons. Fermi and Szilard applied for a patent on reactors on 19 December 1944.

They generally use [[uranium]] and its product [[plutonium]] as [[nuclear fuel]], though a [[thorium fuel cycle]] is also possible. Fission reactors can be divided roughly into two classes, depending on the energy of the neutrons that sustain the fission [[chain reaction]]:\n* [[Thermal reactor|Thermal neutron reactor]]s (the most common type of nuclear reactor) use slowed or [[thermal neutron]]s to keep up the fission of their fuel. Almost all current reactors are of this type. These contain [[neutron moderator]] materials that slow neutrons until their [[neutron temperature]] is ''thermalized'', that is, until their [[kinetic energy]] approaches the average kinetic energy of the surrounding particles. Thermal neutrons have a far higher [[Nuclear cross section|cross section]] (probability) of fissioning the [[fissile]] nuclei [[uranium-235]], [[plutonium-239]], and [[plutonium-241]], and a relatively lower probability of [[neutron capture]] by [[uranium-238]] (U-238) compared to the faster neutrons that originally result from fission, allowing use of [[low-enriched uranium]] or even [[natural uranium]] fuel. The moderator is often also the [[coolant]], usually water under high pressure to increase the [[boiling point]]. These are surrounded by a [[reactor vessel]], instrumentation to monitor and control the reactor, [[radiation shielding]], and a [[containment building]].\n* [[Fast neutron reactor]]s use [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission in their fuel. They do not have a [[neutron moderator]], and use less-moderating coolants. Maintaining a chain reaction requires the fuel to be more highly [[isotope separation|enriched]] in [[fissile]] material (about 20% or more) due to the relatively lower probability of fission versus capture by U-238. Fast reactors have the potential to produce less [[transuranic]] waste because all [[actinides]] are fissionable with fast neutrons,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00750983| title = Fast-reactor actinoid transmutation| journal = Atomic Energy| volume = 74| page = 83| year = 1993| last1 = Golubev | first1 = V.

Some early power stations were fast reactors, as are some Russian naval propulsion units. Construction of prototypes is continuing (see [[fast breeder]] or [[Generation IV reactor#Fast reactors|generation IV reactors]]).\n\nIn principle, [[fusion power]] could be produced by [[nuclear fusion]] of elements such as the [[deuterium]] isotope of [[hydrogen]].

Most commercial PWRs and naval reactors use pressurizers. During normal operation, a pressurizer is partially filled with water, and a steam bubble is maintained above it by heating the water with submerged heaters. During normal operation, the pressurizer is connected to the primary reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and the pressurizer \"bubble\" provides an expansion space for changes in water volume in the reactor. This arrangement also provides a means of pressure control for the reactor by increasing or decreasing the steam pressure in the pressurizer using the pressurizer heaters.\n*** [[Pressurized heavy water reactor]]s are a subset of pressurized water reactors, sharing the use of a pressurized, isolated heat transport loop, but using [[heavy water]] as coolant and moderator for the greater neutron economies it offers.\n** [[Boiling water reactor]] (BWR)\n*** BWRs are characterized by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor pressure vessel. A boiling water reactor uses <sup>235</sup>U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity.<ref name=\"nuclear_energy\">{{cite web|last1=Lipper |first1=Ilan |first2=Jon |last2=Stone |url=http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |title=Nuclear Energy and Society |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=3 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401172451/http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |archivedate=1 April 2009 }}</ref> During normal operation, pressure is controlled by the amount of steam flowing from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.\n** [[Pool-type reactor]]\n* [[Liquid metal cooled reactor]].

India also operates a number of PHWRs, often termed 'CANDU derivatives', built after the Government of Canada halted nuclear dealings with India following the 1974 [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear weapon test.\n:[[File:Elektrownia Ignalina.jpg|thumb|The [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] \u2014 a RBMK type (closed 2009)]]\n* Reaktor Bolshoy Moschnosti Kanalniy (High Power Channel Reactor) ([[RBMK]]) [moderator: graphite; coolant: high-pressure water]\n\n:: A Soviet design, RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU in that they are refuelable during power operation and employ a pressure tube design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are very unstable and large, making [[containment building]]s for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Their main attraction is their use of light water and unenriched uranium. As of 2019, 10 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the DOE. Despite these safety improvements, RBMK reactors are still considered one of the most dangerous reactor designs in use. RBMK reactors were deployed only in the former [[Soviet Union]].\n[[File:Sizewell A.jpg|thumb|The [[Magnox]] [[Sizewell A]] nuclear power station]]\n[[File:Torness Nuclear Power Station, Scotland.JPG|thumb|The [[Torness nuclear power station]] \u2014 an AGR]]\n* [[Gas-cooled reactor]] (GCR) and [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]] (AGR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: carbon dioxide]\n\n:: These designs an have a high thermal efficiency compared with PWRs due to higher operating temperatures. There are a number of operating reactors of this design, mostly in the United Kingdom, where the concept was developed. Older designs (i.e. [[Magnox]] stations) are either shut down or will be in the near future. However, the AGRs have an anticipated life of a further 10 to 20&nbsp;years. This is a thermal neutron reactor design. Decommissioning costs can be high due to large volume of reactor core.\n* [[Breeder reactor|Liquid metal]] [[Fast breeder reactor#Fast breeder reactor|fast-breeder reactor]] (LMFBR) [moderator: none; coolant: liquid metal]\n[[File:Topaz nuclear reactor.jpg|thumb|right| Scaled \u2013 down model of [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]]]]\n\n:: This totally unmoderated reactor design produces more fuel than it consumes. They are said to \"breed\" fuel, because they produce fissionable fuel during operation because of [[neutron capture]]. These reactors can function much like a PWR in terms of efficiency, and do not require much high-pressure containment, as the liquid metal does not need to be kept at high pressure, even at very high temperatures. These reactors are [[fast neutron]], not thermal neutron designs. These reactors come in two types:\n[[File:Superph\u00e9nix.jpg|thumb|The [[Superph\u00e9nix]], closed in 1998, was one of the few FBRs]]\n\n:::[[Lead-cooled fast reactor|Lead-cooled]]\n:::: Using lead as the liquid metal provides excellent radiation shielding, and allows for operation at very high temperatures. Also, lead is (mostly) transparent to neutrons, so fewer neutrons are lost in the coolant, and the coolant does not become radioactive. Unlike sodium, lead is mostly inert, so there is less risk of explosion or accident, but such large quantities of lead may be problematic from toxicology and disposal points of view. Often a reactor of this type would use a [[lead-bismuth eutectic]] mixture. In this case, the bismuth would present some minor radiation problems, as it is not quite as transparent to neutrons, and can be transmuted to a radioactive isotope more readily than lead. The Russian [[Alfa class submarine]] uses a lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor as its main power plant.\n::: [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor|Sodium-cooled]]\n:::: Most LMFBRs are of this type. The [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor|TOPAZ]], [[BN-350]] and [[BN-600]] in USSR; [[Superph\u00e9nix]] in France; and [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station|Fermi-I]] in the United States were reactors of this type. The sodium is relatively easy to obtain and work with, and it also manages to actually prevent corrosion on the various reactor parts immersed in it. However, sodium explodes violently when exposed to water, so care must be taken, but such explosions would not be more violent than (for example) a leak of superheated fluid from a pressurized-water reactor. The [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju reactor]] in Japan suffered a sodium leak in 1995 and could not be [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant#Restart|restarted]] until May 2010. The [[EBR-I]], the first reactor to have a core meltdown, in 1955, was also a sodium-cooled reactor. \n* [[Pebble-bed reactor]]s (PBR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: helium]\n:: These use fuel molded into ceramic balls, and then circulate gas through the balls. The result is an efficient, low-maintenance, very safe reactor with inexpensive, standardized fuel. The prototype was the [[AVR reactor|AVR]] and the [[HTR-10]] is operating in China, where the [[HTR-PM]] is being developed. The HTR-PM is expected to be the first generation IV reactor to enter operation.<ref name=\"WNN2018\">{{cite news|url=https://www.neimagazine.com/features/featurehtr-pm-making-dreams-come-true-7009889/|title=HTR-PM: Making dreams come true|last=|first=|date=|work=Nuclear Engineering International}}</ref>\n*[[Molten salt reactor]]s (MSR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: molten salt mixture]\n::These dissolve the fuels in [[fluoride]] salts, or use fluoride salts for coolant. These have many safety features, high efficiency and a high power density suitable for vehicles. Notably, they have no high pressures or flammable components in the core. The prototype was the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment|MSRE]], which also used the Thorium [[fuel cycle]]. As a breeder reactor type, it reprocesses the spent fuel, extracting both Uranium and transuranics, leaving [[Liquid fluoride thorium reactor|only 0.1% of transuranic waste]] compared to conventional once-through uranium-fueled light water reactors currently in use. A separate issue is the radioactive fission products, which are not reprocessable and need to be disposed of as with conventional reactors.\n* [[Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor]] (AHR) [moderator: high-pressure light or heavy water; coolant: high-pressure light or heavy water]\n\n:: These reactors use as fuel soluble nuclear salts (usually [[uranium sulfate]] or [[uranium nitrate]]) dissolved in water and mixed with the coolant and the moderator.

It uses ceramic fuels so its safe operating temperatures exceed the power-reduction temperature range. Most designs are cooled by inert helium. Helium is not subject to steam explosions, resists neutron absorption leading to radioactivity, and does not dissolve contaminants that can become radioactive. Typical designs have more layers (up to 7) of passive containment than light water reactors (usually&nbsp;3). A unique feature that may aid safety is that the fuel balls actually form the core's mechanism, and are replaced one by one as they age. The design of the fuel makes fuel reprocessing expensive.\n* The [[Small, sealed, transportable, autonomous reactor]] (SSTAR) is being primarily researched and developed in the US, intended as a fast breeder reactor that is passively safe and could be remotely shut down in case the suspicion arises that it is being tampered with.\n* The [[Clean and Environmentally Safe Advanced Reactor]] (CAESAR) is a nuclear reactor concept that uses steam as a moderator \u2013 this design is still in development.\n* The [[Reduced moderation water reactor]] builds upon the [[Advanced boiling water reactor]](ABWR) that is presently in use, it is not a complete fast reactor instead using mostly [[epithermal neutron]]s, which are between thermal and fast neutrons in speed.\n* The [[hydrogen-moderated self-regulating nuclear power module]] (HPM) is a reactor design emanating from the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] that uses [[uranium hydride]] as fuel.\n* [[Subcritical reactor]]s are designed to be safer and more stable, but pose a number of engineering and economic difficulties.

These designs are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030. Current reactors in operation around the world are generally considered second- or third-generation systems, with the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago. Research into these reactor types was officially started by the Generation&nbsp;IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals. The primary goals being to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste and natural resource utilization, and to decrease the cost to build and run such plants.<ref name=\"UIC1\">{{cite web |title=Generation IV Nuclear Reactors |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf77.html |accessdate=29 January 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Gas-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Lead-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Molten salt reactor]]\n* [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Supercritical water reactor]]\n* [[Very-high-temperature reactor]]\n\n====Generation V+ reactors====\nGeneration V reactors are designs which are theoretically possible, but which are not being actively considered or researched at present.

In theory, using UF<sub>6</sub> as a working fuel directly (rather than as a stage to one, as is done now) would mean lower processing costs, and very small reactors. In practice, running a reactor at such high power densities would probably produce unmanageable [[neutron flux]], weakening most [[IFMIF|reactor materials]], and therefore as the flux would be similar to that expected in fusion reactors, it would require similar materials to those selected by the [[IFMIF|International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility]].\n** Gas core EM reactor.

A fission fragment reactor is a nuclear reactor that generates electricity by decelerating an ion beam of fission byproducts instead of using nuclear reactions to generate heat. By doing so, it bypasses the [[Carnot cycle]] and can achieve efficiencies of up to 90% instead of 40\u201345% attainable by efficient turbine-driven thermal reactors. The fission fragment ion beam would be passed through a [[magnetohydrodynamic generator]] to produce electricity.\n* [[Hybrid nuclear fusion]]. Would use the neutrons emitted by fusion to fission a [[breeder reactor|blanket]] of [[fertile material]], like [[Uranium-238|U-238]] or [[thorium|Th-232]] and [[Nuclear transmutation|transmute]] other reactor's [[spent nuclear fuel]]/nuclear waste into relatively more benign isotopes.\n\n====Fusion reactors====\n{{Main|Fusion power}}\nControlled [[nuclear fusion]] could in principle be used in [[fusion power]] plants to produce power without the complexities of handling [[actinides]], but significant scientific and technical obstacles remain. Several fusion reactors have been built, but only recently have reactors have been able to release more energy than the amount of energy used in the process. Despite research having started in the 1950s, no commercial fusion reactor is expected before 2050. The [[ITER]] project is currently leading the effort to harness fusion power.\n\n==Nuclear fuel cycle==\n{{Main|Nuclear fuel cycle}}\nThermal reactors generally depend on refined and [[enriched uranium]]. Some nuclear reactors can operate with a mixture of plutonium and uranium (see [[MOX]]). The process by which uranium ore is mined, processed, enriched, used, possibly [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]] and disposed of is known as the [[nuclear fuel cycle]].\n\nUnder 1% of the uranium found in nature is the easily fissionable U-235 [[isotope]] and as a result most reactor designs require enriched fuel.\nEnrichment involves increasing the percentage of U-235 and is usually done by means of [[gaseous diffusion]] or [[gas centrifuge]]. The enriched result is then converted into [[uranium dioxide]] powder, which is pressed and fired into pellet form. These pellets are stacked into tubes which are then sealed and called [[Nuclear fuel|fuel rods]]. Many of these fuel rods are used in each nuclear reactor.\n\nMost BWR and PWR commercial reactors use uranium enriched to about 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors with a high [[neutron economy]] do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that is, they can use natural uranium). According to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] there are at least 100 [[research reactor]]s in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment) uranium. Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).<ref>{{cite web | work=IAEA | url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/heu_symposium.html | title=Improving Security at World's Nuclear Research Reactors: Technical and Other Issues Focus of June Symposium in Norway | date=7 June 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Fissile]] U-235 and non-fissile but [[fissionable]] and [[Fertile material|fertile]] U-238 are both used in the fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 is more likely to capture a neutron when the neutron is moving very fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions will dominate the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the initial loading of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.\n\nMost reactor designs in existence are thermal reactors and typically use water as a neutron moderator (moderator means that it slows down the neutron to a thermal speed) and as a coolant. But in a [[fast breeder reactor]], some other kind of coolant is used which will not moderate or slow the neutrons down much. This enables fast neutrons to dominate, which can effectively be used to constantly replenish the fuel supply. By merely placing cheap unenriched uranium into such a core, the non-fissionable U-238 will be turned into Pu-239, \"breeding\" fuel.\n\nIn [[thorium fuel cycle]] [[thorium-232]] absorbs a [[neutron]] in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 [[beta decay]]s to [[protactinium]]-233 and then to [[uranium-233]], which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like [[uranium-238]], thorium-232 is a [[fertile material]].\n\n===Fueling of nuclear reactors===\nThe amount of energy in the reservoir of [[nuclear fuel]] is frequently expressed in terms of \"full-power days,\" which is the number of 24-hour periods (days) a reactor is scheduled for operation at full power output for the generation of heat energy. The number of full-power days in a reactor's operating cycle (between refueling outage times) is related to the amount of [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] (U-235) contained in the fuel assemblies at the beginning of the cycle. A higher percentage of U-235 in the core at the beginning of a cycle will permit the reactor to be run for a greater number of full-power days.\n\nAt the end of the operating cycle, the fuel in some of the assemblies is \"spent\", having spent 4 to 6 years in the reactor producing power.  This spent fuel is discharged and replaced with new (fresh) fuel assemblies.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Though considered \"spent,\" these fuel assemblies contain a large quantity of fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  In practice it is economics that determines the lifetime of nuclear fuel in a reactor.  Long before all possible fission has taken place, the reactor is unable to maintain 100%, full output power, and therefore, income for the utility lowers as plant output power lowers.  Most nuclear plants operate at a very low profit margin due to operating overhead, mainly regulatory costs, so operating below 100% power is not economically viable for very long.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The fraction of the reactor's fuel core replaced during refueling is typically one-third, but depends on how long the plant operates between refueling.  Plants typically operate on 18 month refueling cycles, or 24 month refueling cycles.  This means that 1 refueling, replacing only one-third of the fuel, can keep a nuclear reactor at full power for nearly 2 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The disposition and storage of this spent fuel is one of the most challenging aspects of the operation of a commercial nuclear power plant.  This nuclear waste is highly radioactive and its toxicity presents a danger for thousands of years.<ref name=\"nuclear_energy\"/>  After being discharged from the reactor, spent nuclear fuel is transferred to the on-site spent fuel pool.  The spent fuel pool is a large pool of water that provides cooling and shielding of the spent nuclear fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Once the energy has decayed somewhat (approximately 5 years), the fuel can be transferred from the fuel pool to dry shielded casks, that can be safely stored for thousands of years.  After loading into dry shielded casks, the casks are stored on-site in a specially guarded facility in impervious concrete bunkers.  On-site fuel storage facilities are designed to withstand the impact of commercial airliners, with little to no damage to the spent fuel.  An average on-site fuel storage facility can hold 30 years of spent fuel in a space smaller that a football field.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nNot all reactors need to be shut down for refueling; for example, [[pebble bed reactor]]s, [[RBMK|RBMK reactors]], [[molten salt reactor]]s, [[Magnox]], [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor|AGR]] and [[CANDU]] reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running. In a CANDU reactor, this also allows individual fuel elements to be situated within the reactor core that are best suited to the amount of U-235 in the fuel element.\n\nThe amount of energy extracted from nuclear fuel is called its [[burnup]], which is expressed in terms of the heat energy produced per initial unit of fuel weight. Burn up is commonly expressed as megawatt days thermal per metric ton of initial heavy metal.\n\n==Nuclear safety concerns and controversy==\n{{Main|Nuclear safety}}\nNuclear safety covers the actions taken to prevent [[nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents]] or to limit their consequences. The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly.<ref name=globen/> Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at [[Timeline of the Fukushima nuclear accidents|Fukushima]] in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake,<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |title=The lessons of Fukushima  |author=Gusterson, Hugh  |date=16 March 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606023005/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |archivedate=6 June 2013    }}</ref> despite multiple warnings by the NRG and the Japanese nuclear safety administration.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} According to [[UBS]] AG, the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |title=Fukushima Crisis Worse for Atomic Power Than Chernobyl, UBS Says |author=Paton, James |date=4 April 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515064305/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}</ref> Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.<ref name=globen>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=6 }}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}</ref> An interdisciplinary team from [[MIT]] has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005\u20132055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-full.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2003 |page=48 }}</ref>\n\n==Nuclear accidents and controversy==\n{{See also|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}\n[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumb|Three of the reactors at [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima I]] overheated, causing the coolant water to [[Water splitting|dissociate]] and led to the hydrogen explosions.

Radioactive decay of formerly more abundant uranium-235 over the time span of hundreds of millions of years has reduced the proportion of this naturally occurring fissile isotope to below the amount required to sustain a chain reaction with only plain water as a moderator.\n\nThe natural nuclear reactors formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that acted as a neutron moderator, and a strong chain reaction took place. The water moderator would boil away as the reaction increased, slowing it back down again and preventing a meltdown. The fission reaction was sustained for hundreds of thousands of years, cycling on the order of hours to a few days.\n\nThese natural reactors are extensively studied by scientists interested in geologic radioactive waste disposal. They offer a case study of how radioactive isotopes migrate through the Earth's crust. This is a significant area of controversy as opponents of geologic waste disposal fear that isotopes from stored waste could end up in water supplies or be carried into the environment.\n\n== Emissions ==\nNuclear reactors produce [[tritium]] as part of normal operations, which is eventually released into the environment in trace quantities.\n\nAs an [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]], tritium (T) frequently binds to oxygen and forms [[tritiated water|T<sub>2</sub>O]]. This molecule is chemically identical to [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]] and so is both colorless and odorless, however the additional neutrons in the hydrogen nuclei cause the tritium to undergo [[beta decay]] with a [[half-life]] of 12.3 years. Despite being measurable, the tritium released by nuclear power plants is minimal. The United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] estimates that a person drinking water for one year out of a well contaminated by what they would consider to be a significant tritiated water spill would receive a radiation dose of 0.3 millirem.<ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder>{{cite report|date=February 2016|title=Backgrounder: Tritium, Radiation Protection Limits, and Drinking Water Standards|url=https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0620/ML062020079.pdf|publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> For comparison, this is an order of magnitude less than the 4 millirem a person receives on a round trip flight from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, a consequence of less atmospheric protection against highly energetic [[cosmic ray]]s at high altitudes.<ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder />\n\nThe amounts of [[strontium-90]] released from nuclear power plants under normal operations is so low as to be undetectable above natural background radiation. Detectable strontium-90 in ground water and the general environment can be traced to weapons testing that occurred during the mid-20th century (accounting for 99% of the Strontium-90 in the environment) and the Chernobyl accident (accounting for the remaining 1%).<ref>{{cite web|title=Radionuclides in Groundwater|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/tritium/rn-groundwater.html|website=U.S. NRC|publisher=nrc.gov|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|The Atomic Age}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[List of nuclear reactors]]\n* [[List of small modular reactor designs]]\n* [[List of United States Naval reactors]]\n* [[Neutron transport]]\n* [[Nuclear marine propulsion]]\n* [[Nuclear power by country]]\n* [[One Less Nuclear Power Plant]]\n* [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]\n* [[Safety engineering]]\n* [[Sayonara Nuclear Power Plants]]\n* [[Small modular reactor]]\n* [[Thorium-based nuclear power]]\n* [[Traveling wave reactor|Traveling-wave reactor (TWR)]]\n* ''[[World Nuclear Industry Status Report]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Nuclear reactors}}\n* [http://www.iaea.org/pris/ The Database on Nuclear Power Reactors \u2013 IAEA]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110427113431/http://www.nmt.edu/nmt-news/336-2011/4101-uranium-conference-adds-session-reviewing-implications-of-japan-accident Uranium Conference adds discussion of Japan accident]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040929083915/https://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04%2F09%2F24%2F1359225 A Debate: Is Nuclear Power The Solution to Global Warming?]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050826111231/http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/nuclear_safety/page.cfm?pageID=1408 Union of Concerned Scientists, Concerns re: US nuclear reactor program]\n* [http://www.vega.org.uk/video/programme/67 Freeview Video 'Nuclear Power Plants \u2014 What's the Problem' A Royal Institution Lecture by John Collier by the Vega Science Trust.]\n* [http://www.nei.org/howitworks/electricpowergeneration/ Nuclear Energy Institute \u2014 How it Works: Electric Power Generation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061010034414/http://alsos.wlu.edu/qsearch.aspx?browse=science%2FNuclear+Reactors Annotated bibliography of nuclear reactor technology from the Alsos Digital Library]\n**{{in lang|ja}} [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zui6mGN5fT0C34rMCQMtG0ygCAu1MEWF/view \u30bd\u30f4\u30a3\u30a8\u30c8\u9023\u90a6\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u5b87\u5b99\u7528\u539f\u5b50\u7089\u306e\u958b\u767a\u3068\u305d\u306e\u5b9f\u7528]\n\n{{Nuclear technology}}\n{{Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents}}\n{{Portal bar|Nuclear technology|Energy}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nuclear Reactor Technology}}\n[[Category:Energy conversion]]\n[[Category:Nuclear technology]]\n[[Category:Power station technology]]\n[[Category:Nuclear reactors| ]]\n[[Category:Pressure vessels]]\n[[Category:Nuclear research reactors|Nuclear research reactors]]\n[[Category:Nuclear power reactor types|Nuclear power reactor types]]\n[[Category:Neutron sources]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|constructed nuclear fission reactors|nuclear fusion reactors|Fusion power|natural nuclear reactors|Natural nuclear fission reactor}}\n[[File:Crocus-p1020491.jpg|thumb|upright=1.30|Core of [[CROCUS]], a small nuclear reactor used for research at the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne|EPFL]] in Switzerland]]\n\nA '''nuclear reactor''', formerly known as an '''atomic pile''', is a device used to initiate and control a self-sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Nuclear reactors are used at [[nuclear power plant]]s for [[electricity generation]] and in [[nuclear marine propulsion]]. Heat from [[nuclear fission]] is passed to a [[working fluid]] (water or gas), which in turn runs through [[steam turbine]]s.

The heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, (the [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]]), releasing [[kinetic energy]], [[gamma rays|gamma radiation]], and [[free neutron]]s. A portion of these [[neutron]]s may be absorbed by other fissile atoms and trigger further fission events, which release more neutrons, and so on.

The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the [[turbines]], like the [[pressurized water reactor]]. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the [[reactor core]]; for example the [[boiling water reactor]].<ref name=\"HSWCOOLANT\">{{cite web | title=How nuclear power works |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com | url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-power3.htm | accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Reactivity control===\n{{main|Nuclear reactor control|Nuclear reactor physics|Passive nuclear safety|Delayed neutron|Iodine pit|SCRAM|Decay heat}}\nThe rate of fission reactions within a reactor core can be adjusted by controlling the quantity of neutrons that are able to induce further fission events. Nuclear reactors typically employ several methods of neutron control to adjust the reactor's power output. Some of these methods arise naturally from the physics of radioactive decay and are simply accounted for during the reactor's operation, while others are mechanisms engineered into the reactor design for a distinct purpose.\n\nThe fastest method for adjusting levels of fission-inducing neutrons in a reactor is via movement of the [[control rod]]s. Control rods are made of [[neutron poison]]s and therefore absorb neutrons. When a control rod is inserted deeper into the reactor, it absorbs more neutrons than the material it displaces\u2014often the moderator. This action results in fewer neutrons available to cause fission and reduces the reactor's power output. Conversely, extracting the control rod will result in an increase in the rate of fission events and an increase in power.\n\nThe physics of radioactive decay also affects neutron populations in a reactor. One such process is [[delayed neutron]] emission by a number of neutron-rich fission isotopes. These delayed neutrons account for about 0.65% of the total neutrons produced in fission, with the remainder (termed \"[[prompt neutron]]s\") released immediately upon fission. The fission products which produce delayed neutrons have half-lives for their [[Radioactive decay|decay]] by [[neutron emission]] that range from milliseconds to as long as several minutes, and so considerable time is required to determine exactly when a reactor reaches the [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical]] point. Keeping the reactor in the zone of chain reactivity where delayed neutrons are ''necessary'' to achieve a [[critical mass]] state allows mechanical devices or human operators to control a chain reaction in \"real time\"; otherwise the time between achievement of [[critical mass (nuclear)|criticality]] and [[nuclear meltdown]] as a result of an exponential power surge from the normal nuclear chain reaction, would be too short to allow for intervention. This last stage, where delayed neutrons are no longer required to maintain criticality, is known as the [[prompt critical]] point. There is a scale for describing criticality in numerical form, in which bare criticality is known as ''zero [[dollar (reactivity)|dollars]]'' and the prompt critical point is ''one dollar'', and other points in the process interpolated in cents.\n\nIn some reactors, the [[coolant]] also acts as a [[neutron moderator]]. A moderator increases the power of the reactor by causing the fast neutrons that are released from fission to lose energy and become thermal neutrons. [[Thermal neutron]]s are more likely than [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission. If the coolant is a moderator, then temperature changes can affect the density of the coolant/moderator and therefore change power output. A higher temperature coolant would be less dense, and therefore a less effective moderator.\n\nIn other reactors the coolant acts as a poison by absorbing neutrons in the same way that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to [[scram]] the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often [[boron]] in the form of [[boric acid]]) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.<ref name=\"TOURISTRP\">{{cite web |title=Reactor Protection & Engineered Safety Feature Systems |work=The Nuclear Tourist |url= http://www.nucleartourist.com/systems/rp.htm |accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMost types of reactors are sensitive to a process variously known as xenon poisoning, or the [[iodine pit]]. The common [[fission product]] [[Xenon-135]] produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption as fast as it is produced. Fission also produces [[iodine-135]], which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the \"iodine pit.\" If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a \"xenon burnoff (power) transient\". Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption of the lost xenon-135. Failure to properly follow such a procedure was a key step in the [[Chernobyl disaster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |title=Chernobyl: what happened and why? by CM Meyer, technical journalist. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073343/http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\nReactors used in [[nuclear marine propulsion]] (especially [[nuclear submarine]]s) often cannot be run at continuous power around the clock in the same way that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life without [[Reactor refueling|refueling]].

A common method of harnessing this [[thermal energy]] is to use it to boil water to produce pressurized steam which will then drive a [[steam turbine]] that turns an [[alternator]] and generates electricity.<ref name=\"TOURISTRP\"/>\n\n==Early reactors==\n{{See also|Nuclear fission#History}}\n[[File:Stagg Field reactor.jpg|thumb|The [[Chicago Pile-1|Chicago Pile]], the first nuclear reactor, built in secrecy at the University of Chicago in 1942 during World War II as part of the US's [[Manhattan project]]. ]]\n[[File:Otto Hahn und Lise Meitner.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in their laboratory.]]\n[[File:ChicagoPileTeam.png|right|thumb|Some of the [[Chicago Pile-1|Chicago Pile Team]], including [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]].]]\nThe [[neutron]] was discovered in 1932 by British physicist [[James Chadwick]]. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction brought about by [[nuclear reaction]]s mediated by neutrons was first realized shortly thereafter, by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] scientist [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]], in 1933. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple reactor the following year while working at the [[Admiralty]] in London.<ref>L. Szil\u00e1rd, [http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=GB630726 \"Improvements in or relating to the transmutation of chemical elements,\"] British patent number: GB630726 (filed: 28 June 1934; published: 30 March 1936).</ref> However, Szil\u00e1rd's idea did not incorporate the idea of nuclear fission as a neutron source, since that process was not yet discovered. Szil\u00e1rd's ideas for nuclear reactors using neutron-mediated nuclear chain reactions in light elements proved unworkable.\n\nInspiration for a new type of reactor using uranium came from the discovery by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Fritz Strassmann]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in 1938 that bombardment of uranium with neutrons (provided by an alpha-on-beryllium fusion reaction, a \"[[neutron howitzer]]\") produced a [[barium]] residue, which they reasoned was created by the fissioning of the uranium nuclei. Subsequent studies in early 1939 (one of them by Szil\u00e1rd and Fermi) revealed that several neutrons were also released during the fissioning, making available the opportunity for the nuclear [[chain reaction]] that Szil\u00e1rd had envisioned six years previously.\n\nOn 2 August 1939 [[Albert Einstein]] signed a letter to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (written by Szil\u00e1rd) suggesting that the discovery of uranium's fission could lead to the development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\", giving impetus to the study of reactors and fission. Szil\u00e1rd and Einstein knew each other well and had worked together years previously, but Einstein had never thought about this possibility for nuclear energy until Szilard reported it to him, at the beginning of his quest to produce the [[Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter]] to alert the U.S. government.\n\nShortly after, [[Hitler]]'s Germany invaded Poland in 1939, starting [[World War II]] in Europe. The U.S. was not yet officially at war, but in October, when the Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter was delivered to him, Roosevelt commented that the purpose of doing the research was to make sure \"the Nazis don't blow us up.\" The U.S. nuclear project followed, although with some delay as there remained skepticism (some of it from Fermi) and also little action from the small number of officials in the government who were initially charged with moving the project forward.\n\nThe following year the U.S. Government received the [[Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum]] from the UK, which stated that the amount of [[uranium]] needed for a [[chain reaction]] was far lower than had previously been thought. The memorandum was a product of the [[MAUD Committee]], which was working on the UK atomic bomb project, known as [[Tube Alloys]], later [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|to be subsumed]] within the [[Manhattan Project]].\n\nEventually, the first artificial nuclear reactor, [[Chicago Pile-1]], was constructed at the [[University of Chicago]], by a team led by [[Italians|Italian]] physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], in late 1942. By this time, the program had been pressured for a year by U.S. entry into the war. The Chicago Pile achieved [[critical mass|criticality]] on 2 December 1942<ref>The First Reactor, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information</ref> at 3:25&nbsp;PM. The reactor support structure was made of wood, which supported a pile (hence the name) of graphite blocks, embedded in which was natural uranium oxide 'pseudospheres' or 'briquettes'.\n\nSoon after the Chicago Pile, the U.S. military developed a number of nuclear reactors for the [[Manhattan Project]] starting in 1943. The primary purpose for the largest reactors (located at the [[Hanford Site]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]), was the mass production of [[plutonium]] for nuclear weapons. Fermi and Szilard applied for a patent on reactors on 19 December 1944.

They generally use [[uranium]] and its product [[plutonium]] as [[nuclear fuel]], though a [[thorium fuel cycle]] is also possible. Fission reactors can be divided roughly into two classes, depending on the energy of the neutrons that sustain the fission [[chain reaction]]:\n* [[Thermal reactor|Thermal neutron reactor]]s (the most common type of nuclear reactor) use slowed or [[thermal neutron]]s to keep up the fission of their fuel. Almost all current reactors are of this type. These contain [[neutron moderator]] materials that slow neutrons until their [[neutron temperature]] is ''thermalized'', that is, until their [[kinetic energy]] approaches the average kinetic energy of the surrounding particles. Thermal neutrons have a far higher [[Nuclear cross section|cross section]] (probability) of fissioning the [[fissile]] nuclei [[uranium-235]], [[plutonium-239]], and [[plutonium-241]], and a relatively lower probability of [[neutron capture]] by [[uranium-238]] (U-238) compared to the faster neutrons that originally result from fission, allowing use of [[low-enriched uranium]] or even [[natural uranium]] fuel. The moderator is often also the [[coolant]], usually water under high pressure to increase the [[boiling point]]. These are surrounded by a [[reactor vessel]], instrumentation to monitor and control the reactor, [[radiation shielding]], and a [[containment building]].\n* [[Fast neutron reactor]]s use [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission in their fuel. They do not have a [[neutron moderator]], and use less-moderating coolants. Maintaining a chain reaction requires the fuel to be more highly [[isotope separation|enriched]] in [[fissile]] material (about 20% or more) due to the relatively lower probability of fission versus capture by U-238. Fast reactors have the potential to produce less [[transuranic]] waste because all [[actinides]] are fissionable with fast neutrons,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00750983| title = Fast-reactor actinoid transmutation| journal = Atomic Energy| volume = 74| page = 83| year = 1993| last1 = Golubev | first1 = V.

Some early power stations were fast reactors, as are some Russian naval propulsion units. Construction of prototypes is continuing (see [[fast breeder]] or [[Generation IV reactor#Fast reactors|generation IV reactors]]).\n\nIn principle, [[fusion power]] could be produced by [[nuclear fusion]] of elements such as the [[deuterium]] isotope of [[hydrogen]].  While an ongoing rich research topic since at least the 1940s, no self-sustaining fusion reactor for power generation has ever been built.\n\n====By moderator material====\nUsed by thermal reactors:\n* [[Graphite-moderated reactor]]s\n* Water moderated reactors\n**[[Heavy-water reactor]]s (Used in Canada,<ref name=\"hyperphysics\">{{cite web|last1=Nave|first1=R|title=Light Water Nuclear Reactors|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/NucEne/ligwat.html |website=Hyperphysics |publisher = Georgia State University|accessdate=5 March 2018}}</ref> India, Argentina, China, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Joyce|first=Malcolm|date=2018|title=Nuclear Engineering|journal=Elsevier|chapter=10.6|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/c2015-0-05557-5|isbn=9780081009628}}</ref>\n** [[Light-water reactor|Light-water-moderated reactors]] (LWRs).

That [[negative feedback]] stabilizes the reaction rate. Graphite and heavy-water reactors tend to be more thoroughly thermalized than light water reactors. Due to the extra thermalization, these types can use [[natural uranium]]/unenriched fuel.\n* Light-element-moderated reactors.\n** [[Molten salt reactor]]s (MSRs) are moderated by light elements such as lithium or beryllium, which are constituents of the coolant/fuel matrix salts LiF and BeF<sub>2</sub>.\n** [[Liquid metal cooled reactor]]s, such as those whose coolant is a mixture of lead and bismuth, may use BeO as a moderator.\n* Organically moderated reactors (OMR) use [[biphenyl]] and [[terphenyl]] as moderator and coolant.\n\n====By coolant====\n[[File:RIAN archive 450312 Treatment of interior part of reactor frame.jpg|thumb|Treatment of the interior part of a [[VVER|VVER-1000]] reactor frame on [[Atommash]].]]\n[[File:Thermal reactor diagram.png|thumb|In thermal nuclear reactors (LWRs in specific), the coolant acts as a moderator that must slow down the neutrons before they can be efficiently absorbed by the fuel.]]\n* Water cooled reactor. These constitute the great majority of operational nuclear reactors: as of 2014, 93% of the world's nuclear reactors are water cooled, providing about 95% of the world's total nuclear generation capacity.<ref name=\"IAEA_reactors_stats\" />\n** [[Pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) Pressurized water reactors constitute the large majority of all Western nuclear power plants.\n*** A primary characteristic of PWRs is a pressurizer, a specialized [[pressure vessel]]. Most commercial PWRs and naval reactors use pressurizers. During normal operation, a pressurizer is partially filled with water, and a steam bubble is maintained above it by heating the water with submerged heaters. During normal operation, the pressurizer is connected to the primary reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and the pressurizer \"bubble\" provides an expansion space for changes in water volume in the reactor. This arrangement also provides a means of pressure control for the reactor by increasing or decreasing the steam pressure in the pressurizer using the pressurizer heaters.\n*** [[Pressurized heavy water reactor]]s are a subset of pressurized water reactors, sharing the use of a pressurized, isolated heat transport loop, but using [[heavy water]] as coolant and moderator for the greater neutron economies it offers.\n** [[Boiling water reactor]] (BWR)\n*** BWRs are characterized by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor pressure vessel. A boiling water reactor uses <sup>235</sup>U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity.<ref name=\"nuclear_energy\">{{cite web|last1=Lipper |first1=Ilan |first2=Jon |last2=Stone |url=http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |title=Nuclear Energy and Society |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=3 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401172451/http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |archivedate=1 April 2009 }}</ref> During normal operation, pressure is controlled by the amount of steam flowing from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.\n** [[Pool-type reactor]]\n* [[Liquid metal cooled reactor]].

Some reactors run hot enough that the gas can directly power a gas turbine.

The hot radioactive water that leaves the pressure vessel is looped through a steam generator, which in turn heats a secondary (nonradioactive) loop of water to steam that can run turbines. They represent the majority (around 80%) of current reactors. This is a [[thermal neutron]] reactor design, the newest of which are the Russian [[VVER-1200]], Japanese [[Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor]], American [[AP1000]], Chinese [[Hualong One|Hualong Pressurized Reactor]] and the Franco-German [[European Pressurized Reactor]]. All the [[United States Naval reactor]]s are of this type.\n* [[Boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) [moderator: low-pressure water; coolant: low-pressure water]\n\n:: A BWR is like a PWR without the steam generator. The lower pressure of its cooling water allows it to boil inside the pressure vessel, producing the steam that runs the turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and secondary loop. The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, and they can be simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the [[Advanced Boiling Water Reactor]] and the [[Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor]].\n[[File:CANDU at Qinshan.jpg|thumb|The [[CANDU]] [[Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant]]]]\n* [[Pressurised heavy water reactor|Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor]] (PHWR) [moderator: high-pressure heavy water; coolant: high-pressure heavy water]\n\n:: A Canadian design (known as [[CANDU]]), very similar to PWRs but using [[heavy water]]. While heavy water is significantly more expensive than ordinary water, it has greater [[neutron economy]] (creates a higher number of thermal neutrons), allowing the reactor to operate without [[Isotope separation|fuel enrichment facilities]]. Instead of using a single large pressure vessel as in a PWR, the fuel is contained in hundreds of pressure tubes. These reactors are fueled with natural [[uranium]] and are thermal neutron reactor designs. PHWRs can be refueled while at full power, which makes them very efficient in their use of uranium (it allows for precise flux control in the core). CANDU PHWRs have been built in Canada, [[Argentina]], China, [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Romania]], and [[South Korea]]. India also operates a number of PHWRs, often termed 'CANDU derivatives', built after the Government of Canada halted nuclear dealings with India following the 1974 [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear weapon test.\n:[[File:Elektrownia Ignalina.jpg|thumb|The [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] \u2014 a RBMK type (closed 2009)]]\n* Reaktor Bolshoy Moschnosti Kanalniy (High Power Channel Reactor) ([[RBMK]]) [moderator: graphite; coolant: high-pressure water]\n\n:: A Soviet design, RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU in that they are refuelable during power operation and employ a pressure tube design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are very unstable and large, making [[containment building]]s for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Their main attraction is their use of light water and unenriched uranium. As of 2019, 10 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the DOE. Despite these safety improvements, RBMK reactors are still considered one of the most dangerous reactor designs in use. RBMK reactors were deployed only in the former [[Soviet Union]].\n[[File:Sizewell A.jpg|thumb|The [[Magnox]] [[Sizewell A]] nuclear power station]]\n[[File:Torness Nuclear Power Station, Scotland.JPG|thumb|The [[Torness nuclear power station]] \u2014 an AGR]]\n* [[Gas-cooled reactor]] (GCR) and [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]] (AGR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: carbon dioxide]\n\n:: These designs an have a high thermal efficiency compared with PWRs due to higher operating temperatures. There are a number of operating reactors of this design, mostly in the United Kingdom, where the concept was developed. Older designs (i.e. [[Magnox]] stations) are either shut down or will be in the near future. However, the AGRs have an anticipated life of a further 10 to 20&nbsp;years. This is a thermal neutron reactor design. Decommissioning costs can be high due to large volume of reactor core.\n* [[Breeder reactor|Liquid metal]] [[Fast breeder reactor#Fast breeder reactor|fast-breeder reactor]] (LMFBR) [moderator: none; coolant: liquid metal]\n[[File:Topaz nuclear reactor.jpg|thumb|right| Scaled \u2013 down model of [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]]]]\n\n:: This totally unmoderated reactor design produces more fuel than it consumes. They are said to \"breed\" fuel, because they produce fissionable fuel during operation because of [[neutron capture]]. These reactors can function much like a PWR in terms of efficiency, and do not require much high-pressure containment, as the liquid metal does not need to be kept at high pressure, even at very high temperatures. These reactors are [[fast neutron]], not thermal neutron designs. These reactors come in two types:\n[[File:Superph\u00e9nix.jpg|thumb|The [[Superph\u00e9nix]], closed in 1998, was one of the few FBRs]]\n\n:::[[Lead-cooled fast reactor|Lead-cooled]]\n:::: Using lead as the liquid metal provides excellent radiation shielding, and allows for operation at very high temperatures. Also, lead is (mostly) transparent to neutrons, so fewer neutrons are lost in the coolant, and the coolant does not become radioactive. Unlike sodium, lead is mostly inert, so there is less risk of explosion or accident, but such large quantities of lead may be problematic from toxicology and disposal points of view. Often a reactor of this type would use a [[lead-bismuth eutectic]] mixture. In this case, the bismuth would present some minor radiation problems, as it is not quite as transparent to neutrons, and can be transmuted to a radioactive isotope more readily than lead. The Russian [[Alfa class submarine]] uses a lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor as its main power plant.\n::: [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor|Sodium-cooled]]\n:::: Most LMFBRs are of this type. The [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor|TOPAZ]], [[BN-350]] and [[BN-600]] in USSR; [[Superph\u00e9nix]] in France; and [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station|Fermi-I]] in the United States were reactors of this type. The sodium is relatively easy to obtain and work with, and it also manages to actually prevent corrosion on the various reactor parts immersed in it. However, sodium explodes violently when exposed to water, so care must be taken, but such explosions would not be more violent than (for example) a leak of superheated fluid from a pressurized-water reactor. The [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju reactor]] in Japan suffered a sodium leak in 1995 and could not be [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant#Restart|restarted]] until May 2010. The [[EBR-I]], the first reactor to have a core meltdown, in 1955, was also a sodium-cooled reactor. \n* [[Pebble-bed reactor]]s (PBR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: helium]\n:: These use fuel molded into ceramic balls, and then circulate gas through the balls. The result is an efficient, low-maintenance, very safe reactor with inexpensive, standardized fuel. The prototype was the [[AVR reactor|AVR]] and the [[HTR-10]] is operating in China, where the [[HTR-PM]] is being developed. The HTR-PM is expected to be the first generation IV reactor to enter operation.<ref name=\"WNN2018\">{{cite news|url=https://www.neimagazine.com/features/featurehtr-pm-making-dreams-come-true-7009889/|title=HTR-PM: Making dreams come true|last=|first=|date=|work=Nuclear Engineering International}}</ref>\n*[[Molten salt reactor]]s (MSR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: molten salt mixture]\n::These dissolve the fuels in [[fluoride]] salts, or use fluoride salts for coolant.

The prototype was the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment|MSRE]], which also used the Thorium [[fuel cycle]]. As a breeder reactor type, it reprocesses the spent fuel, extracting both Uranium and transuranics, leaving [[Liquid fluoride thorium reactor|only 0.1% of transuranic waste]] compared to conventional once-through uranium-fueled light water reactors currently in use. A separate issue is the radioactive fission products, which are not reprocessable and need to be disposed of as with conventional reactors.\n* [[Aqueous Homogeneous Reactor]] (AHR) [moderator: high-pressure light or heavy water; coolant: high-pressure light or heavy water]\n\n:: These reactors use as fuel soluble nuclear salts (usually [[uranium sulfate]] or [[uranium nitrate]]) dissolved in water and mixed with the coolant and the moderator.

It uses ceramic fuels so its safe operating temperatures exceed the power-reduction temperature range. Most designs are cooled by inert helium. Helium is not subject to steam explosions, resists neutron absorption leading to radioactivity, and does not dissolve contaminants that can become radioactive. Typical designs have more layers (up to 7) of passive containment than light water reactors (usually&nbsp;3). A unique feature that may aid safety is that the fuel balls actually form the core's mechanism, and are replaced one by one as they age.

These designs are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030. Current reactors in operation around the world are generally considered second- or third-generation systems, with the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago. Research into these reactor types was officially started by the Generation&nbsp;IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals. The primary goals being to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste and natural resource utilization, and to decrease the cost to build and run such plants.<ref name=\"UIC1\">{{cite web |title=Generation IV Nuclear Reactors |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf77.html |accessdate=29 January 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Gas-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Lead-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Molten salt reactor]]\n* [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Supercritical water reactor]]\n* [[Very-high-temperature reactor]]\n\n====Generation V+ reactors====\nGeneration V reactors are designs which are theoretically possible, but which are not being actively considered or researched at present.

In theory, using UF<sub>6</sub> as a working fuel directly (rather than as a stage to one, as is done now) would mean lower processing costs, and very small reactors. In practice, running a reactor at such high power densities would probably produce unmanageable [[neutron flux]], weakening most [[IFMIF|reactor materials]], and therefore as the flux would be similar to that expected in fusion reactors, it would require similar materials to those selected by the [[IFMIF|International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility]].\n** Gas core EM reactor.

Since X-rays can go through far greater material thickness than electrons, many hundreds or thousands of layers are needed to absorb the X-rays.<ref>Quimby, D.C., High Thermal Efficiency X-ray energy conversion scheme for advanced fusion reactors, ASTM Special technical Publication, v.2, 1977, pp. 1161\u20131165</ref>\n* [[Fission fragment reactor]]. A fission fragment reactor is a nuclear reactor that generates electricity by decelerating an ion beam of fission byproducts instead of using nuclear reactions to generate heat. By doing so, it bypasses the [[Carnot cycle]] and can achieve efficiencies of up to 90% instead of 40\u201345% attainable by efficient turbine-driven thermal reactors. The fission fragment ion beam would be passed through a [[magnetohydrodynamic generator]] to produce electricity.\n* [[Hybrid nuclear fusion]]. Would use the neutrons emitted by fusion to fission a [[breeder reactor|blanket]] of [[fertile material]], like [[Uranium-238|U-238]] or [[thorium|Th-232]] and [[Nuclear transmutation|transmute]] other reactor's [[spent nuclear fuel]]/nuclear waste into relatively more benign isotopes.\n\n====Fusion reactors====\n{{Main|Fusion power}}\nControlled [[nuclear fusion]] could in principle be used in [[fusion power]] plants to produce power without the complexities of handling [[actinides]], but significant scientific and technical obstacles remain. Several fusion reactors have been built, but only recently reactors have been able to release more energy than the amount of energy used in the process. Despite research having started in the 1950s, no commercial fusion reactor is expected before 2050. The [[ITER]] project is currently leading the effort to harness fusion power.\n\n==Nuclear fuel cycle==\n{{Main|Nuclear fuel cycle}}\nThermal reactors generally depend on refined and [[enriched uranium]]. Some nuclear reactors can operate with a mixture of plutonium and uranium (see [[MOX]]). The process by which uranium ore is mined, processed, enriched, used, possibly [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]] and disposed of is known as the [[nuclear fuel cycle]].\n\nUnder 1% of the uranium found in nature is the easily fissionable U-235 [[isotope]] and as a result most reactor designs require enriched fuel.\nEnrichment involves increasing the percentage of U-235 and is usually done by means of [[gaseous diffusion]] or [[gas centrifuge]]. The enriched result is then converted into [[uranium dioxide]] powder, which is pressed and fired into pellet form. These pellets are stacked into tubes which are then sealed and called [[Nuclear fuel|fuel rods]]. Many of these fuel rods are used in each nuclear reactor.\n\nMost BWR and PWR commercial reactors use uranium enriched to about 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors with a high [[neutron economy]] do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that is, they can use natural uranium). According to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] there are at least 100 [[research reactor]]s in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment) uranium. Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).<ref>{{cite web | work=IAEA | url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/heu_symposium.html | title=Improving Security at World's Nuclear Research Reactors: Technical and Other Issues Focus of June Symposium in Norway | date=7 June 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Fissile]] U-235 and non-fissile but [[fissionable]] and [[Fertile material|fertile]] U-238 are both used in the fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 is more likely to capture a neutron when the neutron is moving very fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions will dominate the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the initial loading of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.\n\nMost reactor designs in existence are thermal reactors and typically use water as a neutron moderator (moderator means that it slows down the neutron to a thermal speed) and as a coolant. But in a [[fast breeder reactor]], some other kind of coolant is used which will not moderate or slow the neutrons down much. This enables fast neutrons to dominate, which can effectively be used to constantly replenish the fuel supply. By merely placing cheap unenriched uranium into such a core, the non-fissionable U-238 will be turned into Pu-239, \"breeding\" fuel.\n\nIn [[thorium fuel cycle]] [[thorium-232]] absorbs a [[neutron]] in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 [[beta decay]]s to [[protactinium]]-233 and then to [[uranium-233]], which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like [[uranium-238]], thorium-232 is a [[fertile material]].\n\n===Fueling of nuclear reactors===\nThe amount of energy in the reservoir of [[nuclear fuel]] is frequently expressed in terms of \"full-power days,\" which is the number of 24-hour periods (days) a reactor is scheduled for operation at full power output for the generation of heat energy. The number of full-power days in a reactor's operating cycle (between refueling outage times) is related to the amount of [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] (U-235) contained in the fuel assemblies at the beginning of the cycle. A higher percentage of U-235 in the core at the beginning of a cycle will permit the reactor to be run for a greater number of full-power days.\n\nAt the end of the operating cycle, the fuel in some of the assemblies is \"spent\", having spent 4 to 6 years in the reactor producing power.  This spent fuel is discharged and replaced with new (fresh) fuel assemblies.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Though considered \"spent,\" these fuel assemblies contain a large quantity of fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  In practice it is economics that determines the lifetime of nuclear fuel in a reactor.  Long before all possible fission has taken place, the reactor is unable to maintain 100%, full output power, and therefore, income for the utility lowers as plant output power lowers.  Most nuclear plants operate at a very low profit margin due to operating overhead, mainly regulatory costs, so operating below 100% power is not economically viable for very long.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The fraction of the reactor's fuel core replaced during refueling is typically one-third, but depends on how long the plant operates between refueling.  Plants typically operate on 18 month refueling cycles, or 24 month refueling cycles.  This means that 1 refueling, replacing only one-third of the fuel, can keep a nuclear reactor at full power for nearly 2 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The disposition and storage of this spent fuel is one of the most challenging aspects of the operation of a commercial nuclear power plant.  This nuclear waste is highly radioactive and its toxicity presents a danger for thousands of years.<ref name=\"nuclear_energy\"/>  After being discharged from the reactor, spent nuclear fuel is transferred to the on-site spent fuel pool.  The spent fuel pool is a large pool of water that provides cooling and shielding of the spent nuclear fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Once the energy has decayed somewhat (approximately 5 years), the fuel can be transferred from the fuel pool to dry shielded casks, that can be safely stored for thousands of years.  After loading into dry shielded casks, the casks are stored on-site in a specially guarded facility in impervious concrete bunkers.  On-site fuel storage facilities are designed to withstand the impact of commercial airliners, with little to no damage to the spent fuel.  An average on-site fuel storage facility can hold 30 years of spent fuel in a space smaller that a football field.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nNot all reactors need to be shut down for refueling; for example, [[pebble bed reactor]]s, [[RBMK|RBMK reactors]], [[molten salt reactor]]s, [[Magnox]], [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor|AGR]] and [[CANDU]] reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running. In a CANDU reactor, this also allows individual fuel elements to be situated within the reactor core that are best suited to the amount of U-235 in the fuel element.\n\nThe amount of energy extracted from nuclear fuel is called its [[burnup]], which is expressed in terms of the heat energy produced per initial unit of fuel weight. Burn up is commonly expressed as megawatt days thermal per metric ton of initial heavy metal.\n\n==Nuclear safety concerns and controversy==\n{{Main|Nuclear safety}}\nNuclear safety covers the actions taken to prevent [[nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents]] or to limit their consequences. The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly.<ref name=globen/> Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at [[Timeline of the Fukushima nuclear accidents|Fukushima]] in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake,<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |title=The lessons of Fukushima  |author=Gusterson, Hugh  |date=16 March 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606023005/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |archivedate=6 June 2013    }}</ref> despite multiple warnings by the NRG and the Japanese nuclear safety administration.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} According to [[UBS]] AG, the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |title=Fukushima Crisis Worse for Atomic Power Than Chernobyl, UBS Says |author=Paton, James |date=4 April 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515064305/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}</ref> Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.<ref name=globen>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=6 }}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}</ref> An interdisciplinary team from [[MIT]] has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005\u20132055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-full.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2003 |page=48 }}</ref>\n\n==Nuclear accidents and controversy==\n{{See also|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}\n[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumb|Three of the reactors at [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima I]] overheated, causing the coolant water to [[Water splitting|dissociate]] and led to the hydrogen explosions.

Radioactive decay of formerly more abundant uranium-235 over the time span of hundreds of millions of years has reduced the proportion of this naturally occurring fissile isotope to below the amount required to sustain a chain reaction with only plain water as a moderator.\n\nThe natural nuclear reactors formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that acted as a neutron moderator, and a strong chain reaction took place. The water moderator would boil away as the reaction increased, slowing it back down again and preventing a meltdown. The fission reaction was sustained for hundreds of thousands of years, cycling on the order of hours to a few days.\n\nThese natural reactors are extensively studied by scientists interested in geologic radioactive waste disposal. They offer a case study of how radioactive isotopes migrate through the Earth's crust. This is a significant area of controversy as opponents of geologic waste disposal fear that isotopes from stored waste could end up in water supplies or be carried into the environment.\n\n== Emissions ==\nNuclear reactors produce [[tritium]] as part of normal operations, which is eventually released into the environment in trace quantities.\n\nAs an [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]], tritium (T) frequently binds to oxygen and forms [[tritiated water|T<sub>2</sub>O]]. This molecule is chemically identical to [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]] and so is both colorless and odorless, however the additional neutrons in the hydrogen nuclei cause the tritium to undergo [[beta decay]] with a [[half-life]] of 12.3 years. Despite being measurable, the tritium released by nuclear power plants is minimal. The United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] estimates that a person drinking water for one year out of a well contaminated by what they would consider to be a significant tritiated water spill would receive a radiation dose of 0.3 millirem.<ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder>{{cite report|date=February 2016|title=Backgrounder: Tritium, Radiation Protection Limits, and Drinking Water Standards|url=https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0620/ML062020079.pdf|publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> For comparison, this is an order of magnitude less than the 4 millirem a person receives on a round trip flight from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, a consequence of less atmospheric protection against highly energetic [[cosmic ray]]s at high altitudes.<ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder />\n\nThe amounts of [[strontium-90]] released from nuclear power plants under normal operations is so low as to be undetectable above natural background radiation.
