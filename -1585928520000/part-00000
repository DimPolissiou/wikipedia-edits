The one pictorial element that was definitely not visible from Van Gogh's cell is the village,<ref name=\" Boime, p. 89\">{{harvnb|Boime|1984|p=89}}</ref> which is based on a sketch F1541v made from a hillside above the village of Saint-R\u00e9my.<ref name=\" Naifeh & Smith, p. 760\">{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=760}}</ref> Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Proven\u00e7al, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his [[Vincent van Gogh#Nuenen and Antwerp .281883.E2.80.931886.29|Nuenen period]], and thus the first of his \"[[Houses at Auvers#.22Reminisces of the North.22|reminisces of the North]]\" he was to paint and draw early the following year.<ref name= \"Pickvance, p. 103\"/> Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse F1541r was also a study for the painting.<ref>{{harvnb|Hulsker|1986|p=396}}</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"154px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Vincent van Gogh - Wheatfield, Saint-R\u00e9my de Provence - F1548 JH1726.jpg|F1548 ''Wheatfield, Saint-R\u00e9my de Provence'', [[Morgan Library & Museum]]\nFile:Vincent van Gogh - Green Field - Google Art Project.jpg|F719 ''Green Field'', [[National Gallery in Prague]]\nFile:Vincent van Gogh - The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm F1547 JH1724.jpg|F1547 ''The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm'', [[Van Gogh Museum]]\nFile:Vincent van Gogh - Landscape from Saint-R\u00e9my - Google Art Project.jpg|F611 ''Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-R\u00e9my'', [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]]\nFile:Vincent van Gogh - Bird's-Eye View of the Village F1541v JH1729.jpg|F1541v ''Bird's-Eye View of the Village'', [[Van Gogh Museum]]\nFile:Vincent van Gogh - Landscape with Cypresses F1541r JH 1730.jpg|F1541r ''Landscape with Cypresses'', [[Van Gogh Museum]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Interpretations==\nDespite the large number of letters Van Gogh wrote, he said very little about ''The Starry Night''.<ref name= \"Pickvance, p. 103\"/> After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a \"night study.\"<ref>Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 805</ref> Of this list of paintings, he wrote, \"All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me\"; \"the rest\" would include ''The Starry Night''.

But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall. .  .

If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\" And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"<ref>Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 816</ref>\n\nBut although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|pp=626, 680}}</ref> and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=778}}</ref> Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially [[Claude Monet]], Van Gogh also favored working in series. He had painted his series of [[Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)|sunflowers]] in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|wheat fields]] at Saint-R\u00e9my. ''The Starry Night'' belongs to this latter series,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schapiro|first1=Meyer|title=Vincent van Gogh|date=1950|publisher=H. N. Abrams|location=New York|page=110}}</ref> as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.\n\n[[File:Starry Night Over the Rhone.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Van Gogh's ''[[Starry Night Over the Rh\u00f4ne]]'', 1888, oil on canvas]]\nThe nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.e., at night.<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=650}}</ref> The first painting in the series was ''[[Caf\u00e9 Terrace at Night]]'', painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by ''[[Starry Night Over the Rhone|Starry Night Over the Rh\u00f4ne]]'' later that same month. Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and ''The Starry Night'' in particular.\n\nSoon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat; there are some really beautiful nights here.\" That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 649\">{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=649}}</ref> He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=611}}</ref> Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,<ref>{{harvnb|Soth|1986|p=301}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=766}}</ref> he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife. He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted ''Starry Night Over the Rh\u00f4ne'', confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=651}}</ref>\n\nHe wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky. \"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=858n}}</ref> \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 649\"/> And he stated flatly that ''The Starry Night'' was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=767}}</ref>\n\nNoted art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] highlights the expressionistic aspects of ''The Starry Night'', saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"<ref name=\"Schapiro, p. 100\">Schapiro, p. 100</ref> Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"<ref name=\"Schapiro, p. 100\"/> of the work makes reference to the New Testament book of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"<ref>Schapiro, p. 33</ref> (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in [[Olive Trees (Van Gogh series)|''Landscape with Olive Trees'']],<ref>Schapiro, p. 108</ref> painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to ''The Starry Night''.)<ref>{{harvnb|Pickvance|1986|p=101}}</ref>\n\nArt historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling ''The Starry Night'' a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=172}}</ref> He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|pp=172\u201373}}</ref> Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]].<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=181}}</ref> He calls ''The Starry Night'' \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=182}}</ref> Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=183}}</ref> and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis.]]<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=186}}</ref> Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of ''The Starry Night'' \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"<ref name=\"Loevgren, p. 184\">{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=184}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Van Gogh Starry Night Drawing.jpg|thumb|The drawing ''Cypresses in Starry Night'', a [[reed pen]] copy executed by Van Gogh after the painting in 1889.

He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Soth|1986|p=309}}</ref>\n\nIt is in light of such symbolist interpretations of ''The Starry Night'' that art historian [[Albert Boime]] presents his study of the painting. As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.<ref name=\"Boime, p. 88\"/> He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous Moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.<ref name=\"Boime, p. 89\"/> He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Jules Verne]] as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.<ref>{{harvnb|Boime|1984|p=95}}</ref> And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.\n\nBoime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] in his letters,<ref name=\"Boime, p. 96\">{{harvnb|Boime|1984|p=96}}</ref> he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes. Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in ''The Starry Night'' to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.<ref name=\"Boime, p. 89\"/> He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky. These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.<ref>{{harvnb|Boime|1984|p=92}}</ref>\n\nHarvard astronomer Charles A. Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of ''The Starry Night'' contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.C.L.A.).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rourke|first1=Mary|title=Art historian viewed works from social, political standpoints|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/23/local/me-boime23|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,<ref>{{harvnb|Whitney|1986|p=352}}</ref> he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.<ref name=\"Whitney, p. 356\"/> He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]], whose work Flammarion reproduced.<ref>{{harvnb|Whitney|1986|p=351}}</ref>\n\n[[File:M51Sketch.jpg|thumb|right|Sketch of the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] in 1845, 44 years before Van Gogh's painting]]\nWhitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the [[Mistral (wind)|mistral]] that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.<ref name=\"Whitney, p. 358\"/> (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting ''The Starry Night''.)<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 771\">{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=771}}</ref> Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.<ref name=\"Boime, p. 89\"/>\n\nThe village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,<ref name= \"Pickvance, p. 103\"/><ref>Schapiro, p. 34</ref> or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-R\u00e9my.<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 760\"/><ref name=\"Boime, p. 89\"/> In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.\n\nCypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in ''The Starry Night'' is the subject of an open debate. In an April 1888, letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"<ref>{{harvnb|Pickvance|1984|p=181}}</ref> though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\" One week after painting ''The Starry Night'', he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts. I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=758}}</ref> In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"<ref>Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 783</ref> These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.\n\nSchapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"<ref name=\"Schapiro, p. 100\"/> Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"<ref name=\"Boime, p. 96\"/> Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"<ref>Jirat-Wasiutynski, p. 657</ref> (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.) Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"<ref name=\"Loevgren, p. 184\"/>\n\nArt historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" ''The Starry Night'' \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"<ref name=\"Pickvance 1986, p. 106\">{{harvnb|Pickvance|1986|p=106}}</ref> Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.<ref name= \"Pickvance, p. 103\"/> Boime asserts that the cypresses ''were'' visible in the east,<ref name=\"Boime, p. 88\"/> as does Jirat-Wasiuty\u0144ski.<ref>Jirat-Wasiutynski, p. 667</ref> Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 759\"/> and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star. Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.\n\nSoth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that ''The Starry Night'' is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Soth|1986|p=305}}</ref> However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\" Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was ''The Starry Night'', when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\" The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects. What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in ''The Starry Night''.\n\nOn two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] used the term. In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens. As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"<ref>Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 739</ref> (The painting he is referring to is ''La Berceuse'', which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.) And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished. Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something \u2014 must one say the word \u2014 something artificial \u2014 something affected.\"<ref>Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 822</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=675}}</ref>\n\nWhen Van Gogh calls ''The Starry Night'' a failure for being an \"abstraction,\" he places the blame on his having painted \"stars that are too big.\"\n\nWhile stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss ''The Starry Night'' in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|pp=762\u2013763}}</ref> \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a ''mental'' epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=749}}; emphasis in the original</ref> Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 762\"/>\n\nVan Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 771\"/> Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted ''The Starry Night'', that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=763}}</ref> On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=761}}</ref> Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 762\"/>\n\n==Provenance==\nAfter having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent ''The Starry Night'' to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.<ref name=\"Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 806\"/><ref name=\"Pickvance 1986, p. 106\"/> Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891. Theo's widow, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo]], then became the caretaker of Van Gogh's legacy. She sold the painting to poet [[Julien Leclercq (poet)|Julien Leclercq]] in Paris in 1900, who turned around and sold it to [[\u00c9mile Schuffenecker]], Gauguin's old friend, in 1901. Jo then bought the painting back from Schuffenecker before selling it to the Oldenzeel Gallery in Rotterdam in 1906. From 1906 to 1938 it was owned by Georgette P. van Stolk, of Rotterdam, who sold it to [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], of Paris and New York.

But that was delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall. .  .

If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe that in the long run you'd get used to it.\" And later in the same letter, he wrote, \"I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.\"<ref>Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 816</ref>\n\nBut although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|pp=626, 680}}</ref> and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature.<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=778}}</ref> Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially [[Claude Monet]], Van Gogh also favored working in series. He had painted his series of [[Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)|sunflowers]] in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|wheat fields]] at Saint-R\u00e9my. ''The Starry Night'' belongs to this latter series,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schapiro|first1=Meyer|title=Vincent van Gogh|date=1950|publisher=H. N.

Van Gogh's written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and ''The Starry Night'' in particular.\n\nSoon after his arrival in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, \"I need a starry night with cypresses or\u2014perhaps above a field of ripe wheat; there are some really beautiful nights here.\" That same week, he wrote to Bernard, \"A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.\"<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 649\">{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=649}}</ref> He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, \"we take death to reach a star.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=611}}</ref> Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion,<ref>{{harvnb|Soth|1986|p=301}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=766}}</ref> he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife. He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted ''Starry Night Over the Rh\u00f4ne'', confessing to a \"tremendous need for, shall I say the word\u2014for religion\u2014so I go outside at night to paint the stars.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=651}}</ref>\n\nHe wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky. \"It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so, if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=858n}}</ref> \"Hope is in the stars,\" he wrote, but he was quick to point out that \"earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.\"<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 649\"/> And he stated flatly that ''The Starry Night'' was \"not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=767}}</ref>\n\nNoted art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] highlights the expressionistic aspects of ''The Starry Night'', saying it was created under the \"pressure of feeling\" and that it is a \"visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.\"<ref name=\"Schapiro, p. 100\">Schapiro, p. 100</ref> Schapiro theorizes that the \"hidden content\"<ref name=\"Schapiro, p. 100\"/> of the work makes reference to the New Testament book of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], revealing an \"apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.\"<ref>Schapiro, p. 33</ref> (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in [[Olive Trees (Van Gogh series)|''Landscape with Olive Trees'']],<ref>Schapiro, p. 108</ref> painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to ''The Starry Night''.)<ref>{{harvnb|Pickvance|1986|p=101}}</ref>\n\nArt historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro's approach, again calling ''The Starry Night'' a \"visionary painting\" which \"was conceived in a state of great agitation.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=172}}</ref> He writes of the \"hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,\" although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh's incapacitating breakdowns.<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|pp=172\u201373}}</ref> Loevgren compares Van Gogh's \"religiously inclined longing for the beyond\" to the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]].<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=181}}</ref> He calls ''The Starry Night'' \"an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos\" and which \"gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=182}}</ref> Loevgren praises Schapiro's \"eloquent interpretation\" of the painting as an apocalyptic vision<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=183}}</ref> and advances his own symbolist theory with reference to the eleven stars in one of Joseph's dreams in the Old Testament book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis.]]<ref>{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=186}}</ref> Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of ''The Starry Night'' \"are visualized in purely symbolic terms\" and notes that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"<ref name=\"Loevgren, p. 184\">{{harvnb|Loevgren|1971|p=184}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Van Gogh Starry Night Drawing.jpg|thumb|The drawing ''Cypresses in Starry Night'', a [[reed pen]] copy executed by Van Gogh after the painting in 1889.

He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing \"consolation.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Soth|1986|p=309}}</ref>\n\nIt is in light of such symbolist interpretations of ''The Starry Night'' that art historian [[Albert Boime]] presents his study of the painting. As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh's view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries.<ref name=\"Boime, p. 88\"/> He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous Moon but \"reverted to a more traditional image\" of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version.<ref name=\"Boime, p. 89\"/> He recounts Van Gogh's interest in the writings of [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Jules Verne]] as possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets.<ref>{{harvnb|Boime|1984|p=95}}</ref> And he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh's lifetime.\n\nBoime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] in his letters,<ref name=\"Boime, p. 96\">{{harvnb|Boime|1984|p=96}}</ref> he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion's popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes. Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in ''The Starry Night'' to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media.<ref name=\"Boime, p. 89\"/> He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky. These swirls represent Van Gogh's understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.<ref>{{harvnb|Boime|1984|p=92}}</ref>\n\nHarvard astronomer Charles A. Whitney conducted his own astronomical study of ''The Starry Night'' contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.C.L.A.).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rourke|first1=Mary|title=Art historian viewed works from social, political standpoints|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/23/local/me-boime23|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> While Whitney does not share Boime's certainty with regard to the constellation Aries,<ref>{{harvnb|Whitney|1986|p=352}}</ref> he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed.<ref name=\"Whitney, p. 356\"/> He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]], whose work Flammarion reproduced.<ref>{{harvnb|Whitney|1986|p=351}}</ref>\n\n[[File:M51Sketch.jpg|thumb|right|Sketch of the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] in 1845, 44 years before Van Gogh's painting]]\nWhitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the [[Mistral (wind)|mistral]] that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence.<ref name=\"Whitney, p. 358\"/> (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting ''The Starry Night''.)<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 771\">{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=771}}</ref> Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.<ref name=\"Boime, p. 89\"/>\n\nThe village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh's Dutch homeland,<ref name= \"Pickvance, p. 103\"/><ref>Schapiro, p. 34</ref> or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-R\u00e9my.<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 760\"/><ref name=\"Boime, p. 89\"/> In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.\n\nCypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in ''The Starry Night'' is the subject of an open debate. In an April 1888, letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to \"funereal cypresses,\"<ref>{{harvnb|Pickvance|1984|p=181}}</ref> though this is possibly similar to saying \"stately oaks\" or \"weeping willows.\" One week after painting ''The Starry Night'', he wrote to his brother Theo, \"The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts. I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=758}}</ref> In the same letter he mentioned \"two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.\"<ref>Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 783</ref> These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.\n\nSchapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a \"vague symbol of a human striving.\"<ref name=\"Schapiro, p. 100\"/> Boime calls it the \"symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh's own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.\"<ref name=\"Boime, p. 96\"/> Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses \"function as rustic and natural obelisks\" providing a \"link between the heavens and the earth.\"<ref>Jirat-Wasiutynski, p. 657</ref> (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.) Loevgren reminds the reader that \"the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.\"<ref name=\"Loevgren, p. 184\"/>\n\nArt historian Ronald Pickvance says that with \"its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,\" ''The Starry Night'' \"is overtly stamped as an 'abstraction'.\"<ref name=\"Pickvance 1986, p. 106\">{{harvnb|Pickvance|1986|p=106}}</ref> Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh's room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh's imagination.<ref name= \"Pickvance, p. 103\"/> Boime asserts that the cypresses ''were'' visible in the east,<ref name=\"Boime, p. 88\"/> as does Jirat-Wasiuty\u0144ski.<ref>Jirat-Wasiutynski, p. 667</ref> Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh \"telescoped\" the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window,<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 759\"/> and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star. Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.\n\nSoth uses Van Gogh's statement to his brother, that ''The Starry Night'' is \"an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement\" to further his argument that the painting is \"an amalgam of images.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Soth|1986|p=305}}</ref> However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using \"arrangement\" as a synonym for \"composition.\" Van Gogh was, in fact, speaking of three paintings, one of which was ''The Starry Night'', when he made this comment: \"The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,\" as he called it, \"these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.\" The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects. What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his \"search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things\" in ''The Starry Night''.\n\nOn two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word \"arrangement\" to refer to color, similar to the way [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] used the term. In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, \"As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens. As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I\u2019ve never devised anything better.\"<ref>Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 739</ref> (The painting he is referring to is ''La Berceuse'', which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.) And to Bernard in late November 1889: \"But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished. Ah, you\u2019re exchanging that for something \u2014 must one say the word \u2014 something artificial \u2014 something affected.\"<ref>Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 822</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=675}}</ref>\n\nWhen Van Gogh calls ''The Starry Night'' a failure for being an \"abstraction,\" he places the blame on his having painted \"stars that are too big.\"\n\nWhile stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss ''The Starry Night'' in the context of Van Gogh's mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy.<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|pp=762\u2013763}}</ref> \"Not the kind,\" they write, \"known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse ('the falling sickness', as it was sometimes called), but a ''mental'' epilepsy\u2014a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=749}}; emphasis in the original</ref> Symptoms of the seizures \"resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.\"<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 762\"/>\n\nVan Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889.<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 771\"/> Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted ''The Starry Night'', that in giving himself over to his imagination \"his defenses had been breached.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=763}}</ref> On that day in mid-June, in a \"state of heightened reality,\" with all the other elements of the painting in place,<ref>{{harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2011|p=761}}</ref> Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, \"a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.\"<ref name=\"Naifeh & Smith, p. 762\"/>\n\n==Provenance==\nAfter having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent ''The Starry Night'' to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings.<ref name=\"Van Gogh Letters Project, no. 806\"/><ref name=\"Pickvance 1986, p. 106\"/> Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891. Theo's widow, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo]], then became the caretaker of Van Gogh's legacy. She sold the painting to poet [[Julien Leclercq (poet)|Julien Leclercq]] in Paris in 1900, who turned around and sold it to [[\u00c9mile Schuffenecker]], Gauguin's old friend, in 1901. Jo then bought the painting back from Schuffenecker before selling it to the Oldenzeel Gallery in Rotterdam in 1906. From 1906 to 1938 it was owned by Georgette P. van Stolk, of Rotterdam, who sold it to [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], of Paris and New York.

Her frail health led her parents to seek treatment for her in [[Murano]] and [[Cannes]] before the family returned to Poland in 1865.<ref name=SN/>\n\nThe death of her father in 1870 allowed her the freedom to pursue her dream and she became part of the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]] in 1870 in [[Lublin]].<ref name=SQPN/> On 12 April 1873 with guidance from Father Lendzian she was encouraged to found an order inspired by the notion that \"it was God's will that she should do so\". Siedliska was granted a private audience with [[Pope Pius IX]] on 1 October 1873 and \"her idea\" received his apostolic blessing; she founded her new congregation in [[Rome]] at the beginning of [[Advent]] in 1875.<ref name=SEB/>\n\nSiedliska made her solemn profession as a nun on 1 May 1884 and took the religious name of \"Maria of Jesus, the Good Shepherd\".

Her writings received the approval of theologians on 27 November 1937 who determined that her spiritual writings did not contravene official doctrine. The formal introduction to the cause came under [[Pope Pius XII]] on 5 February 1941 and she received the title of [[Servant of God]] as a result. Cardinal [[Francesco Marchetti Selvaggiani]] oversaw the apostolic process from 6 June 1941 to 6 March 1946 with additional testimonies coming again from places she had visited in her lifetime. The [[Congregation for Rites]] validated the previous processes on 2 March 1952 and the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] and their consultants met and approved her cause on 21 June 1979; the C.C.S. alone approved it later on 22 February 1980. [[Pope John Paul II]] confirmed her life of [[heroic virtue]] and named her [[Venerable]] on 29 April 1980.\n\nThe miracle needed for beatification was investigated in Warsaw in a diocesan process overseen by Cardinal [[J\u00f3zef Glemp]] from 21 February to 9 June 1986. The C.C.S. validated this process in Rome on 21 November 1986 before a medical board approved it on 18 November 1987. Theologians also assented to this on 15 April 1988 as did the C.C.S. on 5 July 1988 before John Paul II gave the final approval needed for it on 1 September 1988.
