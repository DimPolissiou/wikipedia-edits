In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

The first TIE was ''The Intruder'', which introduced T.O.M.'s companion, an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] matrix known as Sara (voiced by country singer \"Cowboy\" [[Sally Timms]].) ''The Intruder'' was an eight episode mini-series that aired during Toonami from September 18\u201322, 2000. It involved the Absolution being attacked by an alien blob known only as \"the Intruder\", which ultimately devoured T.O.M.\n\n====2000\u20132003: T.O.M. 2 era====\n[[File:Toonami logo.svg|thumb|250px|Toonami logo used from February 21, 2000 to March 14, 2003; revived in 2017 for its 20th anniversary]]\nThough ''The Intruder'' resulted in the destruction of T.O.M., he was soon after upgraded by S.A.R.A. from a short [[Bomberman]]-esque character to a taller, sleeker, deeper-voiced incarnation dubbed T.O.M. 2 (voiced by [[Steven Blum]], who has since been the voice of all subsequent incarnations of the character).\n\nA Saturday morning incarnation, Toonami Rising Sun, ran from 2000 to 2001 at 9:00&nbsp;am to noon. It later ran from 10:00&nbsp;am to 1:00&nbsp;pm, then 11:00&nbsp;am to 1:00&nbsp;pm. This block was somewhat hampered to avoid competing with sister network Kids' WB.\n\nFrom July 30, 2001, until June 28, 2002, [[Kids' WB]] (also owned by [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]]) aired a Toonami block that was, more or less, the Kids' WB lineup with the Toonami name. It was critically panned by industry observers, who noticed that the action branding of the block - which had added shows such as ''[[Generation O!]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', and ''[[The Nightmare Room]]'', a live-action series created by ''[[Goosebumps]]'' author [[R. L. Stine]] - did not translate content-wise. In spring 2002, Kids' WB announced that they would drop the Toonami name from their weekday lineup, once again making the Toonami brand exclusive to Cartoon Network.\n\nThe TIE, ''Lockdown'', aired between September 17\u201321, 2001, and included the introduction of [[CartoonNetwork.com#Online|CartoonNetwork.com's]] first [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]], as well as a record-breaking amount of page views and ratings for the network.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cartoon Network Breaks Rating Records in 2001|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-03-11/cartoon-network-breaks-rating-records-in-2001|work=AnimeNewsNetwork.com|accessdate=April 1, 2012|date=March 11, 2002}}</ref> In ''Lockdown'' T.O.M. fights to save the Absolution from an attack by a giant trash compactor.<ref>{{cite web|last=King|first=Brad|title=Game Is on for Cartoon Host|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2001/09/46529|work=Wired.com|publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast|accessdate=April 1, 2012|date=September 17, 2001}}</ref> ''Trapped in Hyperspace'', the next TIE, ran the week of September 16\u201320, 2002.

This was explained in-universe as him being rebuilt after fighting a space pirate. His voice also became more humanlike.\n\nIn September 2003, a mini series premiered introducing a new, [[2D computer graphics|2D]] universe. ''[[Immortal Grand Prix]]'' (''IGPX''), created by Toonami producers Sean Akins and Jason DeMarco, and produced by [[anime]] studio [[Production I.G]], aired in five short installments, serving as a pilot for the second Toonami original series, which premiered in November 2005<ref>{{cite web|last=Bynum|first=Aaron H.|title=CN Upfront: TOONAMI Programming|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=597|work=AnimationInsider.net|accessdate=April 2, 2012|date=February 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nOn April 17, 2004, Toonami was moved from weekday afternoons to a Saturday evening slot, where it aired regularly for four hours starting at 7:00&nbsp;pm EST.<ref name=\"miguzi\">{{cite web|title=Cartoon Network Announces New Action-Adventure Programming Strategy|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2004-02-26/cartoon-network-announces-new-action-adventure-programming-strategy|work=AnimeNewsNetwork.com|accessdate=April 2, 2012|date=February 26, 2004}}</ref> A new lighter-toned action block, Miguzi, to weekdays in its place.<ref name=\"miguzi\"/> Toonami also replaced the block known as Saturday Video Entertainment System (SVES).  One reason for the move from weekdays to Saturday nights was because some of the shows on the weekday lineup became too violent for a weekday broadcast on the network. The new Toonami lineup showcased anime such as ''[[Naruto]]'', ''Rave Master'', ''[[Duel Masters]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED]]'', ''[[One Piece (TV series)|One Piece]]'', ''[[Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo]]'', ''[[Zatch Bell]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Chronicles]]'', as well as premiered North American productions including ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', ''[[Megas XLR]]'', ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', and ''[[IGPX]]'', Toonami's first and only original production co-produced by [[Production I.G]] and [[Bandai Entertainment]]. Sara got a full body during this period, and became more anime-esque, along with her voice actress being changed to British actress and ''Red Dwarf'' star [[Samantha Robson]].\n\nAlthough ''[[Megas XLR]]'' was the first original American-made franchise to actually debut on the block, it was initially a Cartoon Network original that was planned to air on Friday nights.  Other Cartoon Network action properties, namely ''[[Samurai Jack]]'', ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', and ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', aired on Toonami, but were not exclusive to the block until their final seasons.\n\n====2007\u20132008: T.O.M. 4 era and cancellation====\nOn January 27, 2007, a [[teaser trailer|teaser]] commercial aired during the ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' marathon on Cartoon Network, featuring closeup shots of larger Clydes (the remote robot explorers that have been a fixture of Toonami since the beginning) and two new robot A.I's along with the date \"3/17/07\" and T.O.M.'s chest emblem glowing blue. On March 17, Toonami celebrated its 10th anniversary with a new packaging and numerous [[Montage (filmmaking)|montages]] celebrating the block. T.O.M. was revamped into a shorter robot, who was a commander of a jungle control room and aided by two new robots, Flash ([[Dave Wittenberg]]) and D ([[Tom Kenny]]). The montages included a look at past hosts, former logos, and a decade's worth of clips and [[voice-over]]s from shows that aired on Toonami. There were a total of four montages, each with different clips, and three were one minute long.\n\nAs part of the anniversary (and to coincide with Cartoon Network's March Movie Madness event), Toonami planned another month of movies:\n* March 3 \u2013 ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (film)|The Invincible Iron Man]]''\n* March 10 \u2013 ''[[Mosaic (film)|Mosaic]]''\n* March 17 \u2013 ''[[Hellboy: Blood and Iron]]''\n* March 24 \u2013 ''[[Stan Lee Presents: The Condor]]''\n* March 31 \u2013 ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and ''[[Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo]]''\n\nOn September 20, 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-20/cartoon-network-to-reportedly-end-toonami-tonight|title=Cartoon Network to End Toonami on September 20 (Updated)|date=September 20, 2008|work=AnimeNewsNetwork.com|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> at the [[Anime Weekend Atlanta]] convention in Atlanta, Georgia, Cartoon Network announced that they had cancelled the Toonami block due to low ratings. Toonami then aired its final broadcast later that same evening. The final show to air on the block was a rerun of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' at 10:30 PM. Employees who worked on the block moved to other parts of the channel, except for Dennis Moloney, who left Turner to work for [[Disney]]. Toonami Jetstream remained with the Toonami name until January 30, 2009.

It was created by Sean Akins and Jason DeMarco and produced by [[Williams Street]], a division of [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]]. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of the words \"[[cartoon]]\" and \"[[tsunami]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.tvguide.com/news/tsunami-wake-episodes-36301/|title = Tsunami's Wake Pulls Episodes|work = [[TV Guide]]|last1 = Fretts|first1 = Bruce|date = 2005-01-19|accessdate = 2018-05-17}}</ref> It currently broadcasts every Saturday night from 12 a.m. to 3 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]].\n\nToonami initially ran as an afternoon and evening block on [[Cartoon Network]] and was primarily aimed at boys aged 9\u201314. In its original run from 1997 to 2008, the block was known for showcasing action genre anime that became widely popular with American audiences. Toonami is recognized for its distinctive space-themed backdrop, [[anime music video]]s, [[drum and bass]]-flavored soundtrack, and robot host T.O.M. (short for Toonami Operations Module).\n\nOn May 26, 2012, Toonami was relaunched as a block on [[Adult Swim]]. The current incarnation is a rebrand of Adult Swim's Saturday night action block (itself inherited from Toonami's ''Midnight Run'' block), which primarily airs mature Japanese animation.\n\n\n==Broadcast History==\n{{OriginalResearch|section}}\n===Daytime block on Cartoon Network (1997\u20132008)===\n{{Infobox programming block\n| name      = Toonami<br />(Cartoon Network)\n| premiered = {{Start date and age|1997|03|17}}\n| closed    = {{End date and age|2008|9|20}}\n| owner     = [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] (through [[Turner Broadcasting System]])\n| channel   = [[Cartoon Network]] <small>(1997\u20132008)</small><br />[[Kids' WB]] <small>(2001\u20132002)</small>\n| country   = United States\n| headquarters = [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\n| format    = [[Anime]] and [[Action film|action]] [[animation]]\n| voices    = {{plainlist|\n* [[C.

The block premiered on March 17, 1997. It initially replaced Power Zone, Cartoon Network's most recent incarnation of the Super Adventures block, which had been a staple on the network since its debut on October 1, 1992. Toonami was originally a weekday afternoon cartoon and action block hosted by ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'' villain-turned-producer [[Moltar]] (voiced by [[C. Martin Croker]]) at the Ghost Planet Industries building from 1997 to July 9, 1999.\n\n====1999\u20132000: T.O.M. 1 era====\nOn Saturday, July 10, 1999, Cartoon Network relaunched Toonami with a new environment, the Ghost Planet Spaceship ''Absolution'', and a new host named T.O.M. (voiced by [[Sonny Strait]]), which introduced viewers to him with this speech:\n{{cquote|So it's a brand new Toonami, but the mission objectives remain the same. My name is TOM. I'm the new Moltar. Welcome aboard the Ghost Planet Spaceship Absolution, Cartoon Network's first and only interstellar broadcast and exploration vehicle. I'll give you the tour later. From this day forward she is completely responsible for all Toonami transmissions. I'm taking you guys into the new millennium! No big changes now, same show, same attitude; new place to do it, new guy to do it with. I'm not going to waste any more time, let's get back into it. Later.}}\n\nAlso introduced that day was the Midnight Run, a late night block. It was originally a five-hour Saturday night block (technically Sunday) at midnight EST until March 2000, when it moved to weeknights in an hour-long format until January 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991117093658/http://cartoonnetwork.com/favorites/toonami/index.html|title=Data Screen|accessdate=November 2, 2016|publisher=cartoonnetwork.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021201080928/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com:80/toonami/watch/tv_shows/ggundam/index.html|title=Tune in: Weekday Afternoons 5.0-7.0 P.M.

These TIEs took place both on-air during Toonami and online at the official site, Toonami.com, and always occurred the week that the block's most popular series, ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Toonami Ratings Continue to Rise|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2001-03-21/toonami-ratings-continue-to-rise|work=AnimeNewsNetwork.com|accessdate=April 1, 2012|date=March 31, 2001}}</ref> returned for a new season. The first TIE was ''The Intruder'', which introduced T.O.M.'s companion, an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] matrix known as Sara (voiced by country singer \"Cowboy\" [[Sally Timms]].) ''The Intruder'' was an eight episode mini-series that aired during Toonami from September 18\u201322, 2000. It involved the Absolution being attacked by an alien blob known only as \"the Intruder\", which ultimately devoured T.O.M.\n\n====2000\u20132003: T.O.M. 2 era====\n[[File:Toonami logo.svg|thumb|250px|Toonami logo used from February 21, 2000 to March 14, 2003; revived in 2017 for its 20th anniversary]]\nThough ''The Intruder'' resulted in the destruction of T.O.M., he was soon after upgraded by S.A.R.A. from a short [[Bomberman]]-esque character to a taller, sleeker, deeper-voiced incarnation dubbed T.O.M. 2 (voiced by [[Steven Blum]], who has since been the voice of all subsequent incarnations of the character).\n\nA Saturday morning incarnation, Toonami Rising Sun, ran from 2000 to 2001 at 9:00&nbsp;am to noon. It later ran from 10:00&nbsp;am to 1:00&nbsp;pm, then 11:00&nbsp;am to 1:00&nbsp;pm. This block was somewhat hampered to avoid competing with sister network Kids' WB.\n\nFrom July 30, 2001, until June 28, 2002, [[Kids' WB]] (also owned by [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]]) aired a Toonami block that was, more or less, the Kids' WB lineup with the Toonami name. It was critically panned by industry observers, who noticed that the action branding of the block - which had added shows such as ''[[Generation O!]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', and ''[[The Nightmare Room]]'', a live-action series created by ''[[Goosebumps]]'' author [[R. L. Stine]] - did not translate content-wise. In spring 2002, Kids' WB announced that they would drop the Toonami name from their weekday lineup, once again making the Toonami brand exclusive to Cartoon Network.\n\nThe TIE, ''Lockdown'', aired between September 17\u201321, 2001, and included the introduction of [[CartoonNetwork.com#Online|CartoonNetwork.com's]] first [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]], as well as a record-breaking amount of page views and ratings for the network.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cartoon Network Breaks Rating Records in 2001|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-03-11/cartoon-network-breaks-rating-records-in-2001|work=AnimeNewsNetwork.com|accessdate=April 1, 2012|date=March 11, 2002}}</ref> In ''Lockdown'' T.O.M. fights to save the Absolution from an attack by a giant trash compactor.<ref>{{cite web|last=King|first=Brad|title=Game Is on for Cartoon Host|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2001/09/46529|work=Wired.com|publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast|accessdate=April 1, 2012|date=September 17, 2001}}</ref> ''Trapped in Hyperspace'', the next TIE, ran the week of September 16\u201320, 2002.

Vision]].  The series shown were ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''[[Gigantor]]'', ''[[Robotech]]'', ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'', and ''[[Dai-Guard]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evangelion, Nadesico, Dai-Guard, Robotech to Air on Cartoon Network|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2003-01-28/evangelion-nadesico-dai-guard-robotech-to-air-on-cartoon-network|work=AnimeNewsNetwork.com|date=January 28, 2003|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn May 15, 2001, Cartoon Network released ''[[Toonami: Deep Space Bass]]'', the official soundtrack album to the TV block.\n\n====2003\u20132007: T.O.M. 3 era====\nIn March 2003, TOM was revamped into a more muscular figure. This was explained in-universe as him being rebuilt after fighting a space pirate. His voice also became more humanlike.\n\nIn September 2003, a mini series premiered introducing a new, [[2D computer graphics|2D]] universe. ''[[Immortal Grand Prix]]'' (''IGPX''), created by Toonami producers Sean Akins and Jason DeMarco, and produced by [[anime]] studio [[Production I.G]], aired in five short installments, serving as a pilot for the second Toonami original series, which premiered in November 2005<ref>{{cite web|last=Bynum|first=Aaron H.|title=CN Upfront: TOONAMI Programming|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=597|work=AnimationInsider.net|accessdate=April 2, 2012|date=February 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nOn April 17, 2004, Toonami was moved from weekday afternoons to a Saturday evening slot, where it aired regularly for four hours starting at 7:00&nbsp;pm EST.<ref name=\"miguzi\">{{cite web|title=Cartoon Network Announces New Action-Adventure Programming Strategy|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2004-02-26/cartoon-network-announces-new-action-adventure-programming-strategy|work=AnimeNewsNetwork.com|accessdate=April 2, 2012|date=February 26, 2004}}</ref> A new lighter-toned action block, Miguzi, to weekdays in its place.<ref name=\"miguzi\"/> Toonami also replaced the block known as Saturday Video Entertainment System (SVES).  One reason for the move from weekdays to Saturday nights was because some of the shows on the weekday lineup became too violent for a weekday broadcast on the network. The new Toonami lineup showcased anime such as ''[[Naruto]]'', ''Rave Master'', ''[[Duel Masters]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED]]'', ''[[One Piece (TV series)|One Piece]]'', ''[[Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo]]'', ''[[Zatch Bell]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Chronicles]]'', as well as premiered North American productions including ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', ''[[Megas XLR]]'', ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', and ''[[IGPX]]'', Toonami's first and only original production co-produced by [[Production I.G]] and [[Bandai Entertainment]]. Sara got a full body during this period, and became more anime-esque, along with her voice actress being changed to British actress and ''Red Dwarf'' star [[Samantha Robson]].\n\nAlthough ''[[Megas XLR]]'' was the first original American-made franchise to actually debut on the block, it was initially a Cartoon Network original that was planned to air on Friday nights.  Other Cartoon Network action properties, namely ''[[Samurai Jack]]'', ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', and ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', aired on Toonami, but were not exclusive to the block until their final seasons.\n\n====2007\u20132008: T.O.M. 4 era and cancellation====\nOn January 27, 2007, a [[teaser trailer|teaser]] commercial aired during the ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' marathon on Cartoon Network, featuring closeup shots of larger Clydes (the remote robot explorers that have been a fixture of Toonami since the beginning) and two new robot A.I's along with the date \"3/17/07\" and T.O.M.'s chest emblem glowing blue. On March 17, Toonami celebrated its 10th anniversary with a new packaging and numerous [[Montage (filmmaking)|montages]] celebrating the block. T.O.M. was revamped into a shorter robot, who was a commander of a jungle control room and aided by two new robots, Flash ([[Dave Wittenberg]]) and D ([[Tom Kenny]]). The montages included a look at past hosts, former logos, and a decade's worth of clips and [[voice-over]]s from shows that aired on Toonami. There were a total of four montages, each with different clips, and three were one minute long.\n\nAs part of the anniversary (and to coincide with Cartoon Network's March Movie Madness event), Toonami planned another month of movies:\n* March 3 \u2013 ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (film)|The Invincible Iron Man]]''\n* March 10 \u2013 ''[[Mosaic (film)|Mosaic]]''\n* March 17 \u2013 ''[[Hellboy: Blood and Iron]]''\n* March 24 \u2013 ''[[Stan Lee Presents: The Condor]]''\n* March 31 \u2013 ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and ''[[Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo]]''\n\nOn September 20, 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-20/cartoon-network-to-reportedly-end-toonami-tonight|title=Cartoon Network to End Toonami on September 20 (Updated)|date=September 20, 2008|work=AnimeNewsNetwork.com|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> at the [[Anime Weekend Atlanta]] convention in Atlanta, Georgia, Cartoon Network announced that they had cancelled the Toonami block due to low ratings. Toonami then aired its final broadcast later that same evening. The final show to air on the block was a rerun of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' at 10:30 PM. Employees who worked on the block moved to other parts of the channel, except for Dennis Moloney, who left Turner to work for [[Disney]]. Toonami Jetstream remained with the Toonami name until January 30, 2009. At the end of Toonami's final airing, T.O.M. 4 ended the block with a brief, final monologue, backed by the song \"Cascade\" by [[Tycho (musician)|Tycho]]:\n\n{{cquote|Well, [[The End (The Doors song)|this is the end, beautiful friends.]] After more than 11 years, this is Toonami's final broadcast.

The original television series aired from September 10, 1993 to May 19, 2002 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox.]] The program spanned [[List of The X-Files episodes|nine seasons, with 202 episodes]]. A short [[The X-Files (season 10)|tenth season]] consisting of six episodes premiered on January 24, 2016, and concluded on February 22, 2016. Following the ratings success of this [[revival (television)|revival]], Fox announced in April 2017 that ''The X-Files'' would be returning for an [[The X-Files (season 11)|eleventh season]] of ten episodes. The season premiered on January 3, 2018, concluding on March 21, 2018. In addition to the television series, two [[feature film]]s have been released: The 1998 film ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', which took place as part of the TV series continuity, and the stand-alone film ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', released in 2008, six years after the original television run had ended.\n\nThe series revolves around [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]), and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who investigate [[X-files unit|X-Files]]: marginalized, unsolved cases involving [[paranormal]] phenomena. Mulder believes in the existence of aliens and the paranormal while Scully, a medical doctor and a skeptic, is assigned to scientifically analyze Mulder's discoveries, offer alternate rational theories to his work, and thus return him to mainstream cases. Early in the series, both agents become pawns in a larger conflict and come to trust only each other and a few select people. The agents also discover an agenda of the government to keep the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]] a secret. They develop a close relationship which begins as a [[platonic love|platonic]] friendship, but becomes a romance by the end of the series. In addition to the series-spanning [[story arc]], \"[[monster of the week]]\" episodes form roughly two-thirds of all episodes.\n\n''The X-Files'' was inspired by earlier television series which featured elements of suspense and speculative fiction, including ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', and especially ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]''. When creating the main characters, Carter sought to reverse [[gender stereotypes]] by making Mulder a believer and Scully a skeptic. The first seven seasons featured Duchovny and Anderson equally. In the eighth and ninth seasons, Anderson took precedence while Duchovny appeared intermittently. New main characters were introduced: FBI agents [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]). Mulder and Scully's boss, Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]), also became a main character. The first five seasons of ''The X-Files'' were filmed and produced in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], before eventually moving to Los Angeles to accommodate Duchovny. The series later returned to Vancouver to film ''The X-Files: I Want to Believe'' as well as the tenth and eleventh seasons of the series.\n\n''The X-Files'' was a hit for the Fox network and received largely positive reviews, although its long-term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, it turned into a [[popular culture|pop culture]] touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and [[spirituality]]. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple [[List of accolades received by The X-Files|awards and nominations]], and by its conclusion the show was the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a [[The X-Files (franchise)|franchise]] which includes ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' and ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'' spin-offs, two theatrical films and accompanying [[The X-Files merchandise|merchandise]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Premise ==\n\n=== General ===\n''The X-Files'' follows the careers and personal lives of [[Special agent|FBI Special Agents]] [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). Mulder is a talented [[Offender profiling|profiler]] and strong believer in the [[supernatural]]. He is also adamant about the existence of intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]] and its presence on Earth. This set of beliefs earns him the nickname \"Spooky Mulder\" and an assignment to a little-known department that deals with unsolved cases, known as the [[X-files unit|X-Files]]. His belief in the paranormal springs from the claimed [[alien abduction|abduction]] of his sister Samantha Mulder by extraterrestrials when Mulder was 12. Her abduction drives Mulder throughout most of the series. Because of this, as well as more nebulous desires for vindication and the revelation of truths kept hidden by human authorities, Mulder struggles to maintain [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in his investigations.{{sfn|Lowry|1995|pp=99{{en dash}}101}}\n\nAgent Scully is a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for Mulder in this regard. As a [[Physician|medical doctor]] and natural skeptic, Scully approaches cases with complete detachment even when Mulder, despite his considerable training, loses his objectivity.{{sfn|Lowry|1995|pp=99{{en dash}}156}} She is partnered with Mulder initially so that she can debunk Mulder's nonconforming theories, often supplying logical, scientific explanations for the cases' apparently unexplainable phenomena. Although she is frequently able to offer scientific alternatives to Mulder's deductions, she is rarely able to refute them completely. Over the course of the series, she becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her own ability to approach the cases scientifically.{{sfn|Hurwitz|Knowles|2008|p=137}} After Mulder's abduction at the hands of aliens in the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] finale \"[[Requiem (The X-Files)|Requiem]]\", Scully becomes a \"reluctant believer\" who manages to explain the paranormal with science.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Terry |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1119302 |title=Interview with Chris Carter |work=Fresh Air from WHYY |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=March 1, 2001 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nVarious episodes also deal with the relationship between Mulder and Scully, originally platonic, but that later develops romantically.<ref name=botched/> Mulder and Scully are joined by [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) late in the series, after Mulder is abducted.

Some of the Monster-of-the-Week episodes even featured [[satire|satiric]] elements and [[comedy|comedic]] story lines.{{sfn|Lavery|1995|p=339{{en dash}}40}} The main story arc involves the agents' efforts to uncover a [[Conspiracy (criminal)|government conspiracy]] that covers up the existence of extraterrestrials and their sinister collaboration with said government. Mysterious men comprising a [[shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow]] element within the U.S. government, known as \"[[Syndicate (The X-Files)|The Syndicate]]\", are the major villains in the series; late in the series it is revealed that The Syndicate acts as the only liaison between mankind and a group of extraterrestrials that intends to destroy the human species. They are usually represented by [[Cigarette Smoking Man]] ([[William B.

It is revealed that the extraterrestrials plan on using a sentient virus, known as the [[Black oil (The X-Files)|black oil]] (also known as \"Purity\"), to infect mankind and turn the population of the world into a slave race. The Syndicate\u2014having made a deal to be spared by the aliens\u2014have been working to develop an alien-human hybrid that will be able to withstand the effects of the black oil. The group has also been secretly working on a vaccine to overcome the black oil; this vaccine is revealed in the latter parts of [[The X-Files (season 5)|season five]], as well as the [[The X-Files (film)|1998 film]]. Counter to the alien colonization effort, another faction of aliens, the faceless rebels, are working to stop alien colonization. Eventually, in the [[The X-Files (season 6)|season six]] episodes \"[[Two Fathers]]\"/\"[[One Son]]\", the rebels manage to destroy the Syndicate. The colonists, now without human liaisons, dispatch the \"[[Super Soldiers (The X-Files)|Super Soldiers]]\": beings that resemble humans, but are biologically alien.

Initially Carter had no candidates. A little over a dozen people were considered, but Goodwin continued to press for Snow, who auditioned around three times with no sign from the production staff as to whether they wanted him. One day, however, Snow's agent called him, talking about the \"pilot episode\" and hinting that he had got the job.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=19 |title=The S Files |website=Soundtrack.net |accessdate=June 6, 2008 |date=May 27, 1998}}</ref>\n\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; color:black; width:130px;\"\n| {{Listen|filename=X-Files Theme.ogg|title=\"The X-Files\" (sample)|description=\"The X-Files\", the theme from the television series, as performed by [[Mark Snow]].

After attempting to craft the theme with different sound effects, Snow used a [[E-mu Proteus|Proteus 2]] rackmount [[sound module]] with a preset sound called \"Whistling Joe\". After hearing this sound, Carter was \"taken aback\" and noted it was \"going to be good\".{{sfn|Hurwitz|Knowles|2008|pp=34{{en dash}}35}} According to the \"Behind the Truth\" segment on the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]] DVD, Snow created the [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] effect on the track by accident. He felt that after several revisions, something still was not right. Carter walked out of the room and Snow put his hand and forearm on his [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]] in frustration. By doing so, he accidentally activated an echo effect setting. The resulting [[riff]] pleased Carter; Snow said, \"this sound was in the keyboard.

The original television series aired from September 10, 1993 to May 19, 2002 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox.]] The program spanned [[List of The X-Files episodes|nine seasons, with 202 episodes]]. A short [[The X-Files (season 10)|tenth season]] consisting of six episodes premiered on January 24, 2016, and concluded on February 22, 2016. Following the ratings success of this [[revival (television)|revival]], Fox announced in April 2017 that ''The X-Files'' would be returning for an [[The X-Files (season 11)|eleventh season]] of ten episodes. The season premiered on January 3, 2018, concluding on March 21, 2018. In addition to the television series, two [[feature film]]s have been released: The 1998 film ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', which took place as part of the TV series continuity, and the stand-alone film ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', released in 2008, six years after the original television run had ended.\n\nThe series revolves around [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]), and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who investigate [[X-files unit|X-Files]]: marginalized, unsolved cases involving [[paranormal]] phenomena. Mulder believes in the existence of aliens and the paranormal while Scully, a medical doctor and a skeptic, is assigned to scientifically analyze Mulder's discoveries, offer alternate rational theories to his work, and thus return him to mainstream cases. Early in the series, both agents become pawns in a larger conflict and come to trust only each other and a few select people. The agents also discover an agenda of the government to keep the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]] a secret. They develop a close relationship which begins as a [[platonic love|platonic]] friendship, but becomes a romance by the end of the series. In addition to the series-spanning [[story arc]], \"[[monster of the week]]\" episodes form roughly two-thirds of all episodes.\n\n''The X-Files'' was inspired by earlier television series which featured elements of suspense and speculative fiction, including ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', and especially ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]''. When creating the main characters, Carter sought to reverse [[gender stereotypes]] by making Mulder a believer and Scully a skeptic. The first seven seasons featured Duchovny and Anderson equally. In the eighth and ninth seasons, Anderson took precedence while Duchovny appeared intermittently. New main characters were introduced: FBI agents [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]). Mulder and Scully's boss, Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]), also became a main character. The first five seasons of ''The X-Files'' were filmed and produced in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], before eventually moving to Los Angeles to accommodate Duchovny. The series later returned to Vancouver to film ''The X-Files: I Want to Believe'' as well as the tenth and eleventh seasons of the series.\n\n''The X-Files'' was a hit for the Fox network and received largely positive reviews, although its long-term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, it turned into a [[popular culture|pop culture]] touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and [[spirituality]]. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple [[List of accolades received by The X-Files|awards and nominations]], and by its conclusion the show was the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a [[The X-Files (franchise)|franchise]] which includes ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' and ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'' spin-offs, two theatrical films and accompanying [[The X-Files merchandise|merchandise]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Premise ==\n\n=== General ===\n''The X-Files'' follows the careers and personal lives of [[Special agent|FBI Special Agents]] [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). Mulder is a talented [[Offender profiling|profiler]] and strong believer in the [[supernatural]]. He is also adamant about the existence of intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]] and its presence on Earth. This set of beliefs earns him the nickname \"Spooky Mulder\" and an assignment to a little-known department that deals with unsolved cases, known as the [[X-files unit|X-Files]]. His belief in the paranormal springs from the claimed [[alien abduction|abduction]] of his sister Samantha Mulder by extraterrestrials when Mulder was 12. Her abduction drives Mulder throughout most of the series. Because of this, as well as more nebulous desires for vindication and the revelation of truths kept hidden by human authorities, Mulder struggles to maintain [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in his investigations.{{sfn|Lowry|1995|pp=99{{en dash}}101}}\n\nAgent Scully is a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for Mulder in this regard. As a [[Physician|medical doctor]] and natural skeptic, Scully approaches cases with complete detachment even when Mulder, despite his considerable training, loses his objectivity.{{sfn|Lowry|1995|pp=99{{en dash}}156}} She is partnered with Mulder initially so that she can debunk Mulder's nonconforming theories, often supplying logical, scientific explanations for the cases' apparently unexplainable phenomena. Although she is frequently able to offer scientific alternatives to Mulder's deductions, she is rarely able to refute them completely. Over the course of the series, she becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her own ability to approach the cases scientifically.{{sfn|Hurwitz|Knowles|2008|p=137}} After Mulder's abduction at the hands of aliens in the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] finale \"[[Requiem (The X-Files)|Requiem]]\", Scully becomes a \"reluctant believer\" who manages to explain the paranormal with science.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Terry |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1119302 |title=Interview with Chris Carter |work=Fresh Air from WHYY |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=March 1, 2001 |accessdate=December 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nVarious episodes also deal with the relationship between Mulder and Scully, originally platonic, but that later develops romantically.<ref name=botched/> Mulder and Scully are joined by [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) late in the series, after Mulder is abducted.

These episodes, comprising the majority of the series, dealt with [[paranormal]] phenomena, including: [[cryptid]]s, [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]]s, [[science fiction]] technology, [[Horror fiction|horror]] monsters, and religious phenomena. Some of the Monster-of-the-Week episodes even featured [[satire|satiric]] elements and [[comedy|comedic]] story lines.{{sfn|Lavery|1995|p=339{{en dash}}40}} The main story arc involves the agents' efforts to uncover a [[Conspiracy (criminal)|government conspiracy]] that covers up the existence of extraterrestrials and their sinister collaboration with said government. Mysterious men comprising a [[shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow]] element within the U.S. government, known as \"[[Syndicate (The X-Files)|The Syndicate]]\", are the major villains in the series; late in the series it is revealed that The Syndicate acts as the only liaison between mankind and a group of extraterrestrials that intends to destroy the human species. They are usually represented by [[Cigarette Smoking Man]] ([[William B. Davis]]), a ruthless killer, masterful politician, negotiator, failed novelist, and the series' principal antagonist.{{sfn|Kowalski|2007|pp=243{{en dash}}46}}\n\nAs the series goes along, Mulder and Scully learn about evidence of the alien invasion piece by piece. It is revealed that the extraterrestrials plan on using a sentient virus, known as the [[Black oil (The X-Files)|black oil]] (also known as \"Purity\"), to infect mankind and turn the population of the world into a slave race. The Syndicate\u2014having made a deal to be spared by the aliens\u2014have been working to develop an alien-human hybrid that will be able to withstand the effects of the black oil. The group has also been secretly working on a vaccine to overcome the black oil; this vaccine is revealed in the latter parts of [[The X-Files (season 5)|season five]], as well as the [[The X-Files (film)|1998 film]]. Counter to the alien colonization effort, another faction of aliens, the faceless rebels, are working to stop alien colonization. Eventually, in the [[The X-Files (season 6)|season six]] episodes \"[[Two Fathers]]\"/\"[[One Son]]\", the rebels manage to destroy the Syndicate. The colonists, now without human liaisons, dispatch the \"[[Super Soldiers (The X-Files)|Super Soldiers]]\": beings that resemble humans, but are biologically alien. In the latter parts of [[The X-Files (season 8)|season eight]], and the whole of [[The X-Files (season 9)|season nine]], the Super Soldiers manage to replace key individuals in the government, forcing Mulder and Scully to go into hiding.{{sfn|Kowalski|2007|pp=243{{en dash}}46}}\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{main|List of The X-Files characters|List of minor The X-Files characters}}\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Fox Mulder]] (seasons 1{{en dash}}7, 10{{en dash}}11, main; season 8{{en dash}}9, intermittent lead{{refn|Duchovny appeared in only half of season eight's episodes and only two episodes in season nine.

The race was controversial due to the failure of most competitors to finish the race and because of the [[suicide]] of one entrant; however, it ultimately led to the founding of the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race|''BOC Challenge'']] and ''[[Vend\u00e9e Globe]]'' round-the-world races, both of which continue to be successful and popular.\n\nThe race was sponsored by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[The Sunday Times (UK)|''Sunday Times'']] newspaper and was designed to capitalise on a number of individual round-the-world voyages which were already being planned by various sailors; for this reason, there were no qualification requirements, and competitors were offered the opportunity to join and permitted to start at any time between 1 June and 31 October 1968. The '''Golden Globe''' [[trophy]] was offered to the first person to complete an unassisted, non-stop single-handed circumnavigation of the world via the [[great capes]], and a separate [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]5,000 prize was offered for the fastest single-handed circumnavigation.\n\nNine sailors started the race; four retired before leaving the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Of the five remaining, [[Chay Blyth]], who had set off with absolutely no sailing experience, sailed past the [[Cape of Good Hope]] before retiring; [[Nigel Tetley]] sank with {{convert|1100|nmi|km}} to go while leading; [[Donald Crowhurst]], who, in desperation, attempted to fake a round-the-world voyage to avoid financial ruin, began to show signs of mental illness, and then committed suicide; and [[Bernard Moitessier]], who rejected the philosophy behind a commercialised competition, abandoned the race while in a strong position to win and kept sailing non-stop until he reached [[Tahiti]] after circling the globe one and a half times.  [[Robin Knox-Johnston]] was the only entrant to complete the race, becoming the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world.  He was awarded both prizes, and later donated the \u00a35,000 to a fund supporting Crowhurst's family.\n\n==Genesis of the race==\n\nLong-distance [[single-handed sailing]] has its beginnings in the nineteenth century, when a number of sailors made notable single-handed crossings of the Atlantic. The first single-handed [[circumnavigation]] of the world was made by [[Joshua Slocum]], between 1895 and 1898,<ref>{{cite book |title=Sailing Alone Around the World |first=Joshua |last=Slocum |publisher=Sheridan House |year=1954 |isbn=0-911378-20-0}}</ref> and many sailors have since followed in his wake, completing leisurely circumnavigations with numerous stopovers. However, the first person to tackle a single-handed circumnavigation as a speed challenge{{cn|date=April 2018}} was [[Francis Chichester]], who, in 1960, had won the inaugural ''[[Observer Single-handed Trans-Atlantic Race]]'' (''OSTAR'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rwyc.org/racing/oceanic-racing/ostar10/ostar-history/ostar1960/ |title=OSTAR 1960 |website=Royal Western Yacht Club |language=en-GB |access-date=2018-04-20|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, Chichester set out to sail around the world by the [[clipper route]], starting and finishing in England with a stop in [[Sydney]], in an attempt to beat the speed records of the [[clipper ships]] in a small boat. His voyage was a great success, as he set an impressive round-the-world time of nine months and one day{{spaced ndash}}with 226 days of sailing time{{spaced ndash}}and, soon after his return to England on 28 May 1967, was [[knight]]ed by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Gipsy Moth Circles the World |first=Francis |last=Chichester |publisher=International Marine |year=2001 |isbn=0-07-136449-8}}</ref>  Even before his return, however, a number of other sailors had turned their attention to the next logical challenge{{spaced ndash}}a ''non-stop'' single-handed circumnavigation of the world.\n\n===Plans laid===\n\nIn March 1967, a 28-year-old British [[merchant marine]] officer, [[Robin Knox-Johnston]], realised that a non-stop solo circumnavigation was \"about all there's left to do now\".  Knox-Johnston had a {{convert|32|foot}} wooden [[ketch]], ''[[Suhaili]]'', which he and some friends had built in India to the William Atkin ''Eric'' design; two of the friends had then sailed the boat to South Africa, and in 1966 Knox-Johnston had single-handedly sailed her the remaining {{convert|10000|nmi|mi km|sigfig=3}} to London.{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=1\u201312}}\n\nKnox-Johnston was determined that the first person to make a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation should be British, and he decided that he would attempt to achieve this feat. To fund his preparations he went looking for sponsorship from Chichester's [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]], the British [[The Sunday Times (UK)|''Sunday Times'']]. The ''Sunday Times'' was by this time interested in being associated with a successful non-stop voyage but decided that, of all the people rumoured to be preparing for a voyage, Knox-Johnston and his small wooden ketch were the least likely to succeed. Knox-Johnston finally arranged sponsorship from the [[The Daily Mirror|''Sunday Mirror'']].{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|p=17}}{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nSeveral other sailors were interested. [[William King (Royal Navy officer)|Bill King]], a former [[Royal Navy]] submarine commander, built a {{convert|42|foot|1}} [[junk (ship)|junk]]-rigged [[schooner]], ''Galway Blazer II'', designed for heavy conditions. He was able to secure sponsorship from the [[Daily Express|''Express'']] newspapers. [[John Ridgway (sailor)|John Ridgway]] and [[Chay Blyth]], a [[British Army]] captain and sergeant, had [[ocean rowing|rowed]] a {{convert|20|foot}} boat across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in 1966. They independently decided to attempt the non-stop sail, but despite their rowing achievement were hampered by a lack of sailing experience. They both made arrangements to get boats, but ended up with entirely unsuitable vessels, {{convert|30|foot}} boats designed for cruising protected waters and too lightly built for [[Southern Ocean]] conditions. Ridgway managed to secure sponsorship from ''The People'' newspaper.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=12\u201328}}\n\nOne of the most serious sailors considering a non-stop circumnavigation in late 1967 was the French sailor and author [[Bernard Moitessier]]. Moitessier had a custom-built {{convert|39|foot|1}} steel ketch, ''Joshua'', named after Slocum, in which he and his wife Fran\u00e7oise had sailed from France to Tahiti. They had then sailed her home again by way of [[Cape Horn]], simply because they wanted to go home quickly to see their children. He had already achieved some recognition based on two successful books which he had written on his sailing experiences. However, he was disenchanted with the material aspect of his fame{{spaced ndash}}he believed that by writing his books for quick commercial success he had sold out what was for him an almost spiritual experience. He hit upon the idea of a non-stop circumnavigation as a new challenge, which would be the basis for a new and better book.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=19\u201326}}\n\n===The birth of the race===\nBy January 1968, word of all these competing plans was spreading. The ''Sunday Times'', which had profited to an unexpected extent from its [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship of Chichester, wanted to get involved with the first non-stop circumnavigation, but had the problem of selecting the sailor most likely to succeed. King and Ridgway, two likely candidates, already had sponsorship, and there were several other strong candidates preparing. \"Tahiti\" Bill Howell, an Australian cruising sailor, had made a good performance in the 1964 ''OSTAR'', Moitessier was also considered{{bywhom|date=April 2014}} a strong contender, and there may have been other potential circumnavigators already making preparations.{{cn|date = April 2014}}\n\n[[File:GoldenGlobeRaceRoute.png|thumb|250px|left|The route of the '''Golden Globe Race'''.]]\nThe ''Sunday Times'' did not want to sponsor someone for the first non-stop solo circumnavigation only to have them beaten by another sailor, so the paper hit upon the idea of a sponsored race, which would cover all the sailors setting off that year. To circumvent the possibility of a non-entrant completing his voyage first and scooping the story, they made entry automatic: anyone sailing single-handed around the world that year would be considered in the race.{{cn|date = April 2014}}\n\nThis still left them with a dilemma in terms of the prize. A race for the fastest time around the world was a logical subject for a prize, but there would obviously be considerable interest in the ''first'' person to complete a non-stop circumnavigation, and there was no possibility of persuading the possible candidates to wait for a combined start. The ''Sunday Times'' therefore decided to award two prizes: the ''Golden Globe'' trophy for the first person to sail single-handed, non-stop around the world; and a \u00a35,000 prize ({{Inflation|UK|5000|1968|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) for the fastest time.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nThis automatic entry provision had the drawback that the race organisers could not vet entrants for their ability to take on this challenge safely. This was in contrast to the ''OSTAR'', for example, which in the same year required entrants to complete a solo 500-nautical mile (930&nbsp;km) qualifying passage.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|p=17}} The one concession to safety was the requirement that all competitors must start between 1 June and 31 October, in order to pass through the [[Southern Ocean]] in summer.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|p=30}}\n\nTo make the speed record meaningful, competitors had to start from the British Isles. However Moitessier, the most likely person to make a successful circumnavigation, was preparing to leave from [[Toulon]], in France. When the ''Sunday Times'' went to invite him to join the race, he was horrified, seeing the commercialisation of his voyage as a violation of the spiritual ideal which had inspired it. A few days later, Moitessier relented, thinking that he would join the race and that if he won, he would take the prizes and leave again without a word of thanks.  In typical style, he refused the offer of a free radio to make progress reports, saying that this intrusion of the outside world would taint his voyage; he did, however, take a camera, agreeing to drop off packages of film if he got the chance.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|p=5}}\n\n===The race declared===\n\nThe race was announced on 17 March 1968, by which time King, Ridgway, Howell (who later dropped out), Knox-Johnston, and Moitessier were registered as competitors. Chichester, despite expressing strong misgivings about the preparedness of some of the interested parties, was to chair the panel of judges.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nFour days later, British [[electronics]] engineer [[Donald Crowhurst]] announced his intention to take part. Crowhurst was the manufacturer of a modestly successful [[radio navigation]] aid for sailors, who impressed many people with his apparent knowledge of sailing.  With his electronics business failing, he saw a successful adventure, and the attendant publicity, as the solution to his financial troubles{{spaced ndash}}essentially the mirror opposite of Moitessier, who saw publicity and financial rewards as inimical to his adventure.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=19\u201326}}\n\nCrowhurst planned to sail in a [[trimaran]]. These boats were starting to gain a reputation, still very much unproven, for speed, along with a darker reputation for unseaworthiness; they were known to be very stable under normal conditions, but extremely difficult to right if knocked over, for example by a [[freak wave|rogue wave]]. Crowhurst planned to tackle the deficiencies of the trimaran with a revolutionary self-righting system, based on an automatically inflated air bag at the masthead. He would prove the system on his voyage, then go into business manufacturing it, thus making trimarans into safe boats for [[cruising (maritime)|cruisers]].{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=33\u201335, 39\u201340}}\n\nBy June, Crowhurst had secured some financial backing, essentially by [[Chattel mortgage|mortgaging]] the boat, and later his family home. Crowhurst's boat, however, had not yet been built; despite the lateness of his entry, he pressed ahead with the idea of a custom boat, which started construction in late June. Crowhurst's belief was that a trimaran would give him a good chance of the prize for the fastest circumnavigation, and with the help of a wildly optimistic table of probable performances, he even predicted that he would be first to finish{{spaced ndash}}despite a planned departure on 1 October.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==The race==\n\n===The start (1 June to 28 July)===\nGiven the design of the race, there was no organised start; the competitors set off whenever they were ready, over a period of several months. On 1 June 1968, the first allowable day, John Ridgway sailed from [[Inishmore]], Ireland<!--didn't the racers have to start from England?-->, in his weekend cruiser ''English Rose IV''. Just a week later, on 8 June, Chay Blyth followed suit{{spaced ndash}}despite having absolutely no sailing experience. On the day he set sail, he had friends rig the boat ''Dytiscus'' for him and then sail in front of him in another boat to show him the correct manoeuvres.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=45\u201350}}\n\nKnox-Johnston got underway from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] soon after, on 14 June. He was undisturbed by the fact that it was a Friday, contrary to the common sailors' superstition that it is bad luck to begin a voyage on a <!-- DO NOT UNLINK -->[[Friday#Folklore|Friday]].<!-- PLEASE NOTE: this Friday is linked because the link explains the relevance of sailing on a Friday, with regard to superstition. In other words, this link adds specific contextual information to this sentence. PLEASE DON'T UNLINK IT without discussing on the talk page. JohanTheGhost, 24 April 2006. --> ''Suhaili'', crammed with tinned food, was low in the water and sluggish, but the much more seaworthy boat soon started gaining on Ridgway and Blyth.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nIt soon became clear to Ridgway that his boat was not up to a serious voyage, and he was also becoming affected by loneliness. On 17 June, at [[Madeira]], he made an arranged rendezvous with a friend to drop off his photos and logs, and received some mail in exchange. While reading a recent issue of the ''Sunday Times'' that he had just received, he discovered that the rules against assistance prohibited receiving mail{{spaced ndash}}including the newspaper in which he was reading this{{spaced ndash}}and so he was technically disqualified. While he dismissed this as overly petty, he continued the voyage in bad spirits. The boat continued to deteriorate, and he finally decided that it would not be able to handle the heavy conditions of the Southern Ocean. On 21 July he put into [[Recife]], [[Brazil]], and retired from the race.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=66, 85\u201387}}\n\nEven with the race underway, other competitors continued to declare their intention to join. On 30 June, Royal Navy officer Nigel Tetley announced that he would race in the [[trimaran]] he and his wife lived aboard.  He obtained sponsorship from [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure]], a British budget record label, and started preparing his boat, ''Victress'', in [[Plymouth]], where Moitessier, King, and Frenchman Lo\u00efck Fougeron were also getting ready.  Fougeron was a friend of Moitessier, who managed a motorcycle company in [[Casablanca]], and planned to race on ''Captain Browne'', a {{convert|30|foot}} steel [[Gaff rig|gaff]] [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]]. Crowhurst, meanwhile, was far from ready{{spaced ndash}}assembly of the three hulls of his trimaran only began on 28 July at a boatyard in [[Norfolk]].{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=15\u201317}}{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=56, 63\u201364}}{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|p=39}}\n\n===Attrition begins (29 July to 31 October)===\n[[File:Satellite image of Cape peninsula.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cape Town]] and the [[Cape Peninsula]], with the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on the bottom right]]\nBlyth and Knox-Johnston were well down the Atlantic by this time. Knox-Johnston, the experienced seaman, was enjoying himself, but ''Suhaili'' had problems with leaking seams near the [[keel]]. However, Knox-Johnston had managed a good repair by [[underwater diving|diving]] and [[caulking]] the seams underwater.{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nBlyth was not far ahead, and although leading the race, he was having far greater problems with his boat, which was suffering in the hard conditions. He had also discovered that the fuel for his [[electrical generator|generator]] had been contaminated, which effectively put his radio out of action. On 15 August, Blyth went in to [[Tristan da Cunha]] to pass a message to his wife, and spoke to crew from an anchored cargo ship, ''Gillian Gaggins''. On being invited aboard by her captain, a fellow [[Scottish people|Scot]], Blyth found the offer impossible to refuse and went aboard, while the ship's engineers fixed his generator and replenished his fuel supply.{{cn|date = April 2014}}\n\nBy this time he had already shifted his focus from the race to a more personal quest to discover his own limits; and so, despite his technical disqualification for receiving assistance, he continued sailing towards [[Cape Town]]. His boat continued to deteriorate, however, and on 13 September he put into [[East London, South Africa|East London]]. Having successfully sailed the length of the Atlantic and rounded [[Cape Agulhas]] in an unsuitable boat, he decided that he would take on the challenge of the sea again, but in a better boat and on his own terms.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=92\u2013101}}\n\nDespite the retirements, other racers were still getting started. On Thursday, 22 August, Moitessier and Fougeron set off, with King following on Saturday (none of them wanted to leave on a Friday).{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|p=3}} With ''Joshua'' lightened for a race, Moitessier set a fast pace{{spaced ndash}}more than twice as fast as Knox-Johnston over the same part of the course. Tetley sailed on 16 September,{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=23\u201324}} and on 23 September, Crowhurst's boat, ''Teignmouth Electron'', was finally launched in Norfolk. Under severe time pressure, Crowhurst planned to sail to [[Teignmouth]], his planned departure point, in three days; but although the boat performed well downwind, the struggle against headwinds in the [[English Channel]] showed severe deficiencies in the boat's upwind performance, and the trip to Teignmouth took 13 days.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=50\u201356}}\n\nMeanwhile, Moitessier was making excellent progress. On 29 September he passed [[Trindade and Martim Vaz|Trindade]] in the south Atlantic, and on 20 October he reached Cape Town, where he managed to leave word of his progress. He sailed on east into the [[Southern Ocean]], where he continued to make good speed, covering {{convert|188|nmi|mi km}} on 28 October.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|pp=19\u201329, 36\u201345, 56}}\n\nOthers were not so comfortable with the ocean conditions. On 30 October, Fougeron passed Tristan da Cunha, with King a few hundred nautical miles ahead.  The next day{{spaced ndash}}[[Halloween]]{{spaced ndash}}they both found themselves in a severe storm. Fougeron [[heaving to|hove-to]], but still suffered a severe knockdown.  King, who allowed his boat to tend to herself (a recognised procedure known as ''[[Lying ahull|lying ahull]]''), had a much worse experience; his boat was rolled and lost its foremast. Both men decided to retire from the race.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=142, 149\u2013151}}\n\n===The last starters (31 October to 23 December)===\nFour of the starters had decided to retire at this point, at which time Moitessier was {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km}} east of Cape Town, Knox-Johnston was {{convert|4000|nmi|mi km}} ahead in the middle of the [[Great Australian Bight]], and Tetley was just nearing Trindade.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|p=56}}{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=93\u201394}}{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=60\u201361}} However, 31 October was also the last allowable day for racers to start, and was the day that the last two competitors, Donald Crowhurst and Alex Carozzo, got under way. Carozzo, a highly regarded Italian sailor, had competed in (but not finished) that year's ''OSTAR''. Considering himself unready for sea, he \"sailed\" on 31 October, to comply with the race's mandatory start date, but went straight to a [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] to continue preparing his boat without outside assistance. Crowhurst was also far from ready{{spaced ndash}}his boat, barely finished, was a chaos of unstowed supplies, and his self-righting system was unbuilt. He left anyway, and started slowly making his way against the prevailing winds of the English Channel.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=75\u201381}}\n\n[[File:GoldenGlobeRaceOct31.png|thumb|250px|left|The approximate positions of the racers on 31 October 1968, the last day on which racers could start]]\nBy mid-November Crowhurst was already having problems with his boat. Hastily built, the boat was already showing signs of being unprepared, and in the rush to depart, Crowhurst had left behind crucial repair materials. On 15 November, he made a careful appraisal of his outstanding problems and of the risks he would face in the [[Southern Ocean]]; he was also acutely aware of the financial problems awaiting him at home. Despite his analysis that ''Teignmouth Electron'' was not up to the severe conditions which she would face in the [[Roaring Forties]], he pressed on.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=79\u201397}}\n\nCarozzo retired on 14 November, as he had started vomiting blood due to a [[peptic ulcer]], and put into [[Porto]], [[Portugal]], for medical attention.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|p=181}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/06/03/reviews/010603.03hightot.html|title=Sailors Take Warning!|last=Hightower|first=Elizabeth|date=3 June 2001|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}</ref> Two more retirements were reported in rapid succession, as King made Cape Town on 22 November, and Fougeron stopped in [[Saint Helena]] on 27 November.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=155\u2013156}} This left four boats in the race at the beginning of December: Knox-Johnston's ''Suhaili'', battling frustrating and unexpected headwinds in the south [[Pacific Ocean]],{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=125\u2013128}} Moitessier's ''Joshua'', closing on [[Tasmania]],{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|pp=83\u201387}} Tetley's ''Victress'', just passing the [[Cape of Good Hope]],{{sfn|Tetley|1970|p=79}} and Crowhurst's ''Teignmouth Electron'', still in the north Atlantic.\n\nTetley was just entering the Roaring Forties, and encountering strong winds.  He experimented with self-steering systems based on various combinations of headsails, but had to deal with some frustrating headwinds.  On 21 December he encountered a calm and took the opportunity to clean the hull somewhat; while doing so, he saw a {{convert|7|foot}} shark prowling around the boat.  He later caught it, using a shark hook baited with a tin of [[Corned beef|bully beef (corned beef)]], and hoisted it on board for a photo.  His log is full of sail changes and other such sailing technicalities and gives little impression of how he was coping with the voyage emotionally; still, describing a heavy low<!--low barometric pressure, or a psychological low?--> on 15 December he hints at his feelings, wondering \"why the hell I was on this voyage anyway\".{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=79\u201391}}\n\nKnox-Johnston was having problems, as ''Suhaili'' was showing the strains of the long and hard voyage. On 3 November, his self-steering gear had failed for the last time, as he had used up all his spares. He was also still having leak problems, and his rudder was loose. Still, he felt that the boat was fundamentally sound, so he braced the rudder as well as he could, and started learning to balance the boat in order to sail a constant course on her own. On 7 November, he dropped mail off in [[Melbourne]], and on 19 November he made an arranged meeting off the Southern Coast of New Zealand with a ''Sunday Mirror'' journalist from [[Otago, New Zealand]].{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=97, 101\u2013102, 117\u2013123}}{{clarify |date=April 2018 |reason=how did this not disqualify him? explain!}}\n\n===Crowhurst's false voyage (6 to 23 December)===\nOn 10 December, Crowhurst reported that he had had some fast sailing at last, including a day's run on 8 December of {{convert|243|nmi|mi km}}, a new 24-hour record. [[Francis Chichester]] was sceptical of Crowhurst's sudden change in performance, and with good reason{{spaced ndash}}on 6 December, Crowhurst had started creating a faked record of his voyage, showing his position advancing much faster than it actually was.  The creation of this fake log was an incredibly intricate process, involving working celestial navigation in reverse.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=98\u2013116}}\n\nThe motivation for this initial deception was most likely to allow him to claim an attention-getting record prior to entering the [[doldrums]].  However, from that point on, he started to keep two logs{{spaced ndash}}his actual navigation log, and a second log in which he could enter a faked description of a round-the-world voyage.  This would have been an immensely difficult task, involving the need to make up convincing descriptions of weather and sailing conditions in a different part of the world, as well as complex reverse navigation.  He tried to keep his options open as long as possible, mainly by giving only extremely vague position reports; but on 17 December he sent a deliberately false message indicating that he was over the [[Equator]], which he was not.  From this point his radio reports{{spaced ndash}}while remaining ambiguous{{spaced ndash}}indicated steadily more impressive progress around the world; but he never left the Atlantic, and it seems that after December the mounting problems with his boat had caused him to give up on ever doing so.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=117\u2013126}}\n\n===Christmas at sea (24 to 25 December)===\n\nChristmas Day 1968 was a strange day for the four racers, who were very far from friends and family. Crowhurst made a radio call to his wife on Christmas Eve, during which he was pressed for a precise position, but refused to give one. Instead, he told her he was \"off Cape Town\", a position far in advance of his plotted fake position, and even farther from his actual position, {{convert|20|nmi|km}} off the easternmost point in [[Brazil]], just 7 degrees ({{convert|480|nmi|mi km}}) south of the equator.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=126, 133}}\n\nLike Crowhurst, Tetley was depressed. He had a lavish Christmas dinner of roast pheasant, but was suffering badly from loneliness.{{sfn|Tetley|1970|p=93}} Knox-Johnston, thoroughly at home on the sea, treated himself to a generous dose of whisky and held a rousing solo carol service, then drank a [[The Loyal Toast|toast to the Queen]] at 3pm. He managed to pick up some radio stations from the U.S., and heard for the first time about the [[Apollo 8]] astronauts, who had just made the first orbit of the Moon.{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=140\u2013142}} Moitessier, meanwhile, was sunbathing in a flat calm, deep in the roaring forties south-west of New Zealand.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|p=93}}\n\n===Rounding the Horn (26 December to 18 March)===\n[[File:GoldenGlobeRaceJan19.png|thumb|250px|left|The approximate positions of the racers on 19 January 1969]]\nBy January, concern was growing for Knox-Johnston. He was having problems with his radio transmitter and nothing had been heard since he had passed south of New Zealand.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|p=213}} He was actually making good progress, rounding [[Cape Horn]] on 17 January 1969. Elated by this successful climax to his voyage, he briefly considered continuing east, to sail around the Southern Ocean a second time, but soon gave up the idea and turned north for home.{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=160\u2013161, 175}}\n\nCrowhurst's deliberately vague position reporting was also causing consternation for the press, who were desperate for hard facts. On 19 January, he finally yielded to the pressure and stated himself to be {{convert|100|nmi|mi km}} south-east of [[Gough Island]] in the south Atlantic. He also reported that due to generator problems he was shutting off his radio for some time. His position was misunderstood on the receiving end to be {{convert|100|nmi|km}} south-east of the Cape of Good Hope; the high speed this erroneous position implied fuelled newspaper speculation in the following radio silence, and his position was optimistically reported as rapidly advancing around the globe. Crowhurst's actual position, meanwhile, was off Brazil, where he was making slow progress south, and carefully monitoring weather reports from around the world to include in his fake log. He was also becoming increasingly concerned about ''Teignmouth Electron'', which was starting to come apart, mainly due to slapdash construction.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=143\u2013147}}\n\nMoitessier also had not been heard from since New Zealand, but he was still making good progress and coping easily with the conditions of the \"furious fifties\". He was carrying letters from old Cape Horn sailors describing conditions in the Southern Ocean, and he frequently consulted these to get a feel for chances of encountering ice. He reached the Horn on 6 February, but when he started to contemplate the voyage back to Plymouth he realised that he was becoming increasingly disenchanted with the race concept.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|pp=109\u2013111, 140\u2013142}}\n\n[[File:CapeHorn.jpg|thumb|right|Cape Horn from the South.]]\nAs he sailed past the [[Falkland Islands]]{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|p=146}} he was sighted, and this first news of him since [[Tasmania]] caused considerable excitement. It was predicted that he would arrive home on 24 April as the winner (in fact, Knox-Johnston finished on 22 April). A huge reception was planned in Britain, from where he would be escorted to France by a fleet of French warships for an even more grand reception. There was even said to be a [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] waiting for him there.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=241\u2013242}}\n\nMoitessier had a very good idea of this, but throughout his voyage he had been developing an increasing disgust with the excesses of the modern world; the planned celebrations seemed to him to be yet another example of brash materialism. After much debate with himself, and many thoughts of those waiting for him in England, he decided to continue sailing{{spaced ndash}}past the Cape of Good Hope, and across the Indian Ocean for a second time, into the Pacific.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|pp=148, 158\u2013165}} Unaware of this, the newspapers continued to publish \"assumed\" positions progressing steadily up the Atlantic, until, on 18 March, Moitessier fired a slingshot message in a can onto a ship near the shore of Cape Town, announcing his new plans to a stunned world: {{cquote|My intention is to continue the voyage, still nonstop, toward the Pacific Islands, where there is plenty of sun and more peace than in Europe. Please do not think I am trying to break a record. 'Record' is a very stupid word at sea. I am continuing nonstop because I am happy at sea, and perhaps because I want to save my soul.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=242\u2013244}}}}\n\nOn the same day, Tetley rounded Cape Horn, becoming the first to accomplish the feat in a [[multihull]] sailboat.  Badly battered by his Southern Ocean voyage, he turned north with considerable relief.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=241\u2013242}}<ref>''Trimran Solo'', pages 124\u2014131.</ref>\n\n===Re-establishing contact (19 March to 22 April)===\n''Teignmouth Electron'' was also battered and Crowhurst badly wanted to make repairs, but without the spares that had been left behind he needed new supplies. After some planning, on 8 March he put into the tiny settlement of R\u00edo Salado, in [[Argentina]], just south of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]]. Although the village turned out to be the home of a small [[coastguard]] station, and his presence was logged, he got away with his supplies and without publicity. He started heading south again, intending to get some film and experience of Southern Ocean conditions to bolster his false log.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=151\u2013162}}\n\nThe concern for Knox-Johnston turned to alarm in March, with no news of him since New Zealand; aircraft taking part in a [[NATO]] exercise in the North Atlantic mounted a search operation in the region of the [[Azores]]. However, on 6 April he finally managed to make contact with a British [[tanker (ship)|tanker]] using his [[signal lamp]], which reported the news of his position, {{convert|1200|nmi|mi km}} from home. This created a sensation in Britain, with Knox-Johnston now clearly set to win the Golden Globe trophy, and Tetley predicted to win the \u00a35,000 prize for the fastest time.{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=205\u2013206}}{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=248, 251}}\n\n[[File:GoldenGlobeRaceApr10.png|thumb|250px|left|The approximate positions of the racers on 10 April 1969]]\nCrowhurst re-opened radio contact on 10 April, reporting himself to be \"heading\" towards the [[Diego Ramirez Islands]], near Cape Horn. This news caused another sensation, as with his projected arrival in the UK at the start of July he now seemed to be a contender for the fastest time, and (very optimistically) even for a close finish with Tetley. Once his projected false position approached his actual position, he started heading north at speed.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=170\u2013172, 185\u2013186}}\n\nTetley, informed that he might be robbed of the fastest-time prize, started pushing harder, despite that his boat was having significant problems{{spaced ndash}}he made major repairs at sea in an attempt to stop the port hull of his trimaran falling off, and kept racing. On 22 April, he crossed his outbound track, one definition of a [[circumnavigation]].{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=136\u2013141}}\n\n===The finish (22 April to 1 July)===\nOn the same day, 22 April, Knox-Johnston completed his voyage where it had started, in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. This made him the winner of the Golden Globe trophy, and the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world, which he had done in 312 days.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|p=267}} This left Tetley and Crowhurst apparently fighting for the \u00a35,000 prize for fastest time.\n\nHowever, Tetley knew that he was pushing his boat too hard. On 20 May he ran into a storm near the Azores and began to worry about the boat's severely weakened state. Hoping that the storm would soon blow over, he lowered all sail and went to sleep with the boat lying a-hull. In the early hours of the next day he was awoken by the sounds of tearing wood. Fearing that the bow of the port hull might have broken off, he went on deck to cut it loose, only to discover that in breaking away it had made a large hole in the main hull, from which ''Victress'' was now taking on water too rapidly to stop. He sent a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]], and luckily got an almost immediate reply. He abandoned ship just before ''Victress'' finally sank and was rescued from his [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|liferaft]] that evening, having come to within {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km}} of finishing what would have been the most significant voyage ever made in a multi-hulled boat.{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=149\u2013160}}\n\nCrowhurst was left as the only person in the race, and{{spaced ndash}}given his high reported speeds{{spaced ndash}}virtually guaranteed the \u00a35,000 prize. This would, however, also guarantee intense scrutiny of himself, his stories, and his logs by genuine Cape Horn veterans such as the sceptical Chichester. Although he had put great effort into his fabricated log, such a deception would in practice be extremely difficult to carry off, particularly for someone who did not have actual experience of the Southern Ocean; something of which he must have been aware at heart. Although he had been sailing fast{{spaced ndash}}at one point making over {{convert|200|nmi|mi km}} in a day{{spaced ndash}}as soon as he learned of Tetley's sinking, he slowed down to a wandering crawl.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=186, 190\u2013191}}\n\nCrowhurst's main radio failed at the beginning of June, shortly after he had learned that he was the sole remaining competitor. Plunged into unwilling solitude, he spent the following weeks attempting to repair the radio, and on 22 June was finally able to transmit and receive in [[morse code]]. The following days were spent exchanging [[telegraphy|cables]] with his agent and the press, during which he was bombarded with news of syndication rights, a welcoming fleet of boats and helicopters, and a rapturous welcome by the British people. It became clear that he could not now avoid the spotlight.\n\nUnable to see a way out of his predicament, he plunged into abstract philosophy, attempting to find an escape in [[metaphysics]], and on 24 June he started writing a long essay to express his ideas. Inspired (in a misguided way) by the work of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], whose book ''[[wikisource:Relativity: The Special and General Theory|Relativity: The Special and General Theory]]'' he had aboard, the theme of Crowhurst's writing was that a sufficiently intelligent mind can overcome the constraints of the real world. Over the following eight days, he wrote 25,000 words of increasingly tortured prose, drifting farther and farther from reality, as ''Teignmouth Electron'' continued sailing slowly north, largely untended. Finally, on 1 July, he concluded his writing with a garbled suicide note and, it is assumed, jumped overboard.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=195\u2013251}}\n\nMoitessier, meanwhile, had concluded his own personal voyage more happily. He had circumnavigated the world and sailed almost two-thirds of the way round a second time, all non-stop and mostly in the roaring forties. Despite heavy weather and a couple of severe knockdowns, he contemplated rounding the Horn again. However, he decided that he and ''Joshua'' had had enough and sailed to Tahiti, where he and his wife had set out for Alicante. He thus completed his second personal circumnavigation of the world (including the previous voyage with his wife) on 21 June 1969. He started work on his book.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|pp=172\u2013175}}\n\n==Aftermath of the race==\nKnox-Johnston, as the only finisher, was awarded both the Golden Globe trophy and the \u00a35,000 prize for fastest time. He continued to sail and circumnavigated three more times.

Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall, two of the journalists connected with the race, wrote a 1970 book on Crowhurst's voyage, ''The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst'', described by [[Hammond Innes]] in its ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' review as \"fascinating, uncomfortable reading\" and a \"meticulous investigation\" of Crowhurst's downfall.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hodder.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781473635364 |title=The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |accessdate=2018-04-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTetley found it impossible to adapt to his old way of life after his adventure. He was awarded a consolation prize of \u00a31,000, with which he decided to build a new trimaran for a round-the-world speed record attempt. His {{convert|60|foot}} boat ''Miss Vicky'' was built in 1971, but his search for sponsorship to pay for fitting-out met with consistent rejection. His book, ''Trimaran Solo'', sold poorly.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Although he outwardly seemed to be coping, the repeated failures must have taken their toll.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=275\u2013282}} In February 1972, he went missing from his home in [[Dover, England|Dover]]. His body was found in nearby woods hanging from a tree three days later. His death was originally believed to be a suicide. At the [[inquest]], it was revealed that the body had been discovered wearing lingerie and the hands were bound. The attending pathologist suggested the likelihood of masochistic sexual activity. Finding no evidence to suggest that Tetley had killed himself, the coroner recorded an [[open verdict]]. Tetley was cremated; Knox-Johnson and Blyth were among the mourners in attendance.{{sfn|Eakin|2009}}{{pn|date=April 2018}}\n\nBlyth devoted his life to the sea and to introducing others to its challenge. In 1970\u20131971 he sailed a sponsored boat, ''British Steel'', single-handedly around the world \"the wrong way\", against the prevailing winds. He subsequently took part in the [[Volvo Ocean Race|Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race]] and founded the [[Global Challenge]] race, which allows amateurs to race around the world. His old rowing partner, John Ridgway, followed a similar course; he started an adventure school in Scotland, and circumnavigated the world twice under sail: once in the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race, and once with his wife. King finally completed a circumnavigation in ''Galway Blazer II'' in 1973.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=294\u2013295}}\n\n''Suhaili'' was sailed for some years more, including a trip to [[Greenland]], and spent some years on display at the [[National Maritime Museum]] at [[Greenwich]]. However, her planking began to shrink because of the dry conditions and, unwilling to see her deteriorate, Knox-Johnston removed her from the museum and had her refitted in 2002. She was returned to the water and is now based at the [[National Maritime Museum Cornwall]].{{cn|date = April 2014}}\n\n''Teignmouth Electron'' was sold to a tour operator in [[Jamaica]] and eventually ended up damaged and abandoned on [[Cayman Brac]], where she lies to this day.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=295\u2013296}}\n\nAfter being driven ashore during a storm at [[Cabo San Lucas]], the restored ''Joshua'' was acquired by the maritime museum in [[La Rochelle]], France, where it serves as part of a cruising school.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=295\u2013296}}\n\nGiven the failure of most starters and the tragic outcome of Crowhurst's voyage, considerable controversy was raised over the race and its organisation.  No follow-up race was held for some time. However, in 1982 the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race|''BOC Challenge'']] race was organised; this single-handed round-the-world race with stops was inspired by the Golden Globe and has been held every four years since. In 1989, [[Philippe Jeantot]] founded the ''[[Vend\u00e9e Globe]]'' race, a non-stop, single-handed, round-the-world race.

The race was controversial due to the failure of most competitors to finish the race and because of the [[suicide]] of one entrant; however, it ultimately led to the founding of the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race|''BOC Challenge'']] and ''[[Vend\u00e9e Globe]]'' round-the-world races, both of which continue to be successful and popular.\n\nThe race was sponsored by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[The Sunday Times (UK)|''Sunday Times'']] newspaper and was designed to capitalise on a number of individual round-the-world voyages which were already being planned by various sailors; for this reason, there were no qualification requirements, and competitors were offered the opportunity to join and permitted to start at any time between 1 June and 31 October 1968. The '''Golden Globe''' [[trophy]] was offered to the first person to complete an unassisted, non-stop single-handed circumnavigation of the world via the [[great capes]], and a separate [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]5,000 prize was offered for the fastest single-handed circumnavigation.\n\nNine sailors started the race; four retired before leaving the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Of the five remaining, [[Chay Blyth]], who had set off with absolutely no sailing experience, sailed past the [[Cape of Good Hope]] before retiring; [[Nigel Tetley]] sank with {{convert|1100|nmi|km}} to go while leading; [[Donald Crowhurst]], who, in desperation, attempted to fake a round-the-world voyage to avoid financial ruin, began to show signs of mental illness, and then committed suicide; and [[Bernard Moitessier]], who rejected the philosophy behind a commercialised competition, abandoned the race while in a strong position to win and kept sailing non-stop until he reached [[Tahiti]] after circling the globe one and a half times.  [[Robin Knox-Johnston]] was the only entrant to complete the race, becoming the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world.  He was awarded both prizes, and later donated the \u00a35,000 to a fund supporting Crowhurst's family.\n\n==Genesis of the race==\n\nLong-distance [[single-handed sailing]] has its beginnings in the nineteenth century, when a number of sailors made notable single-handed crossings of the Atlantic. The first single-handed [[circumnavigation]] of the world was made by [[Joshua Slocum]], between 1895 and 1898,<ref>{{cite book |title=Sailing Alone Around the World |first=Joshua |last=Slocum |publisher=Sheridan House |year=1954 |isbn=0-911378-20-0}}</ref> and many sailors have since followed in his wake, completing leisurely circumnavigations with numerous stopovers. However, the first person to tackle a single-handed circumnavigation as a speed challenge{{cn|date=April 2018}} was [[Francis Chichester]], who, in 1960, had won the inaugural ''[[Observer Single-handed Trans-Atlantic Race]]'' (''OSTAR'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rwyc.org/racing/oceanic-racing/ostar10/ostar-history/ostar1960/ |title=OSTAR 1960 |website=Royal Western Yacht Club |language=en-GB |access-date=2018-04-20|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, Chichester set out to sail around the world by the [[clipper route]], starting and finishing in England with a stop in [[Sydney]], in an attempt to beat the speed records of the [[clipper ships]] in a small boat. His voyage was a great success, as he set an impressive round-the-world time of nine months and one day{{spaced ndash}}with 226 days of sailing time{{spaced ndash}}and, soon after his return to England on 28 May 1967, was [[knight]]ed by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Gipsy Moth Circles the World |first=Francis |last=Chichester |publisher=International Marine |year=2001 |isbn=0-07-136449-8}}</ref>  Even before his return, however, a number of other sailors had turned their attention to the next logical challenge{{spaced ndash}}a ''non-stop'' single-handed circumnavigation of the world.\n\n===Plans laid===\n\nIn March 1967, a 28-year-old British [[merchant marine]] officer, [[Robin Knox-Johnston]], realised that a non-stop solo circumnavigation was \"about all there's left to do now\".  Knox-Johnston had a {{convert|32|foot}} wooden [[ketch]], ''[[Suhaili]]'', which he and some friends had built in India to the William Atkin ''Eric'' design; two of the friends had then sailed the boat to South Africa, and in 1966 Knox-Johnston had single-handedly sailed her the remaining {{convert|10000|nmi|mi km|sigfig=3}} to London.{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=1\u201312}}\n\nKnox-Johnston was determined that the first person to make a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation should be British, and he decided that he would attempt to achieve this feat. To fund his preparations he went looking for sponsorship from Chichester's [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]], the British [[The Sunday Times (UK)|''Sunday Times'']]. The ''Sunday Times'' was by this time interested in being associated with a successful non-stop voyage but decided that, of all the people rumoured to be preparing for a voyage, Knox-Johnston and his small wooden ketch were the least likely to succeed. Knox-Johnston finally arranged sponsorship from the [[The Daily Mirror|''Sunday Mirror'']].{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|p=17}}{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nSeveral other sailors were interested. [[William King (Royal Navy officer)|Bill King]], a former [[Royal Navy]] submarine commander, built a {{convert|42|foot|1}} [[junk (ship)|junk]]-rigged [[schooner]], ''Galway Blazer II'', designed for heavy conditions. He was able to secure sponsorship from the [[Daily Express|''Express'']] newspapers. [[John Ridgway (sailor)|John Ridgway]] and [[Chay Blyth]], a [[British Army]] captain and sergeant, had [[ocean rowing|rowed]] a {{convert|20|foot}} boat across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in 1966. They independently decided to attempt the non-stop sail, but despite their rowing achievement were hampered by a lack of sailing experience. They both made arrangements to get boats, but ended up with entirely unsuitable vessels, {{convert|30|foot}} boats designed for cruising protected waters and too lightly built for [[Southern Ocean]] conditions. Ridgway managed to secure sponsorship from ''The People'' newspaper.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=12\u201328}}\n\nOne of the most serious sailors considering a non-stop circumnavigation in late 1967 was the French sailor and author [[Bernard Moitessier]]. Moitessier had a custom-built {{convert|39|foot|1}} steel ketch, ''Joshua'', named after Slocum, in which he and his wife Fran\u00e7oise had sailed from France to Tahiti. They had then sailed her home again by way of [[Cape Horn]], simply because they wanted to go home quickly to see their children. He had already achieved some recognition based on two successful books which he had written on his sailing experiences. However, he was disenchanted with the material aspect of his fame{{spaced ndash}}he believed that by writing his books for quick commercial success he had sold out what was for him an almost spiritual experience. He hit upon the idea of a non-stop circumnavigation as a new challenge, which would be the basis for a new and better book.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=19\u201326}}\n\n===The birth of the race===\nBy January 1968, word of all these competing plans was spreading. The ''Sunday Times'', which had profited to an unexpected extent from its [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship of Chichester, wanted to get involved with the first non-stop circumnavigation, but had the problem of selecting the sailor most likely to succeed. King and Ridgway, two likely candidates, already had sponsorship, and there were several other strong candidates preparing. \"Tahiti\" Bill Howell, an Australian cruising sailor, had made a good performance in the 1964 ''OSTAR'', Moitessier was also considered{{bywhom|date=April 2014}} a strong contender, and there may have been other potential circumnavigators already making preparations.{{cn|date = April 2014}}\n\n[[File:GoldenGlobeRaceRoute.png|thumb|250px|left|The route of the '''Golden Globe Race'''.]]\nThe ''Sunday Times'' did not want to sponsor someone for the first non-stop solo circumnavigation only to have them beaten by another sailor, so the paper hit upon the idea of a sponsored race, which would cover all the sailors setting off that year. To circumvent the possibility of a non-entrant completing his voyage first and scooping the story, they made entry automatic: anyone sailing single-handed around the world that year would be considered in the race.{{cn|date = April 2014}}\n\nThis still left them with a dilemma in terms of the prize. A race for the fastest time around the world was a logical subject for a prize, but there would obviously be considerable interest in the ''first'' person to complete a non-stop circumnavigation, and there was no possibility of persuading the possible candidates to wait for a combined start. The ''Sunday Times'' therefore decided to award two prizes: the ''Golden Globe'' trophy for the first person to sail single-handed, non-stop around the world; and a \u00a35,000 prize ({{Inflation|UK|5000|1968|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) for the fastest time.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nThis automatic entry provision had the drawback that the race organisers could not vet entrants for their ability to take on this challenge safely. This was in contrast to the ''OSTAR'', for example, which in the same year required entrants to complete a solo 500-nautical mile (930&nbsp;km) qualifying passage.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|p=17}} The one concession to safety was the requirement that all competitors must start between 1 June and 31 October, in order to pass through the [[Southern Ocean]] in summer.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|p=30}}\n\nTo make the speed record meaningful, competitors had to start from the British Isles. However Moitessier, the most likely person to make a successful circumnavigation, was preparing to leave from [[Toulon]], in France. When the ''Sunday Times'' went to invite him to join the race, he was horrified, seeing the commercialisation of his voyage as a violation of the spiritual ideal which had inspired it. A few days later, Moitessier relented, thinking that he would join the race and that if he won, he would take the prizes and leave again without a word of thanks.  In typical style, he refused the offer of a free radio to make progress reports, saying that this intrusion of the outside world would taint his voyage; he did, however, take a camera, agreeing to drop off packages of film if he got the chance.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|p=5}}\n\n===The race declared===\n\nThe race was announced on 17 March 1968, by which time King, Ridgway, Howell (who later dropped out), Knox-Johnston, and Moitessier were registered as competitors. Chichester, despite expressing strong misgivings about the preparedness of some of the interested parties, was to chair the panel of judges.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nFour days later, British [[electronics]] engineer [[Donald Crowhurst]] announced his intention to take part. Crowhurst was the manufacturer of a modestly successful [[radio navigation]] aid for sailors, who impressed many people with his apparent knowledge of sailing.  With his electronics business failing, he saw a successful adventure, and the attendant publicity, as the solution to his financial troubles{{spaced ndash}}essentially the mirror opposite of Moitessier, who saw publicity and financial rewards as inimical to his adventure.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=19\u201326}}\n\nCrowhurst planned to sail in a [[trimaran]]. These boats were starting to gain a reputation, still very much unproven, for speed, along with a darker reputation for unseaworthiness; they were known to be very stable under normal conditions, but extremely difficult to right if knocked over, for example by a [[freak wave|rogue wave]]. Crowhurst planned to tackle the deficiencies of the trimaran with a revolutionary self-righting system, based on an automatically inflated air bag at the masthead. He would prove the system on his voyage, then go into business manufacturing it, thus making trimarans into safe boats for [[cruising (maritime)|cruisers]].{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=33\u201335, 39\u201340}}\n\nBy June, Crowhurst had secured some financial backing, essentially by [[Chattel mortgage|mortgaging]] the boat, and later his family home. Crowhurst's boat, however, had not yet been built; despite the lateness of his entry, he pressed ahead with the idea of a custom boat, which started construction in late June. Crowhurst's belief was that a trimaran would give him a good chance of the prize for the fastest circumnavigation, and with the help of a wildly optimistic table of probable performances, he even predicted that he would be first to finish{{spaced ndash}}despite a planned departure on 1 October.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==The race==\n\n===The start (1 June to 28 July)===\nGiven the design of the race, there was no organised start; the competitors set off whenever they were ready, over a period of several months. On 1 June 1968, the first allowable day, John Ridgway sailed from [[Inishmore]], Ireland<!--didn't the racers have to start from England?-->, in his weekend cruiser ''English Rose IV''. Just a week later, on 8 June, Chay Blyth followed suit{{spaced ndash}}despite having absolutely no sailing experience. On the day he set sail, he had friends rig the boat ''Dytiscus'' for him and then sail in front of him in another boat to show him the correct manoeuvres.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=45\u201350}}\n\nKnox-Johnston got underway from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] soon after, on 14 June.

On 17 June, at [[Madeira]], he made an arranged rendezvous with a friend to drop off his photos and logs, and received some mail in exchange. While reading a recent issue of the ''Sunday Times'' that he had just received, he discovered that the rules against assistance prohibited receiving mail{{spaced ndash}}including the newspaper in which he was reading this{{spaced ndash}}and so he was technically disqualified. While he dismissed this as overly petty, he continued the voyage in bad spirits. The boat continued to deteriorate, and he finally decided that it would not be able to handle the heavy conditions of the Southern Ocean. On 21 July he put into [[Recife]], [[Brazil]], and retired from the race.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=66, 85\u201387}}\n\nEven with the race underway, other competitors continued to declare their intention to join. On 30 June, Royal Navy officer Nigel Tetley announced that he would race in the [[trimaran]] he and his wife lived aboard.  He obtained sponsorship from [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure]], a British budget record label, and started preparing his boat, ''Victress'', in [[Plymouth]], where Moitessier, King, and Frenchman Lo\u00efck Fougeron were also getting ready.  Fougeron was a friend of Moitessier, who managed a motorcycle company in [[Casablanca]], and planned to race on ''Captain Browne'', a {{convert|30|foot}} steel [[Gaff rig|gaff]] [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]]. Crowhurst, meanwhile, was far from ready{{spaced ndash}}assembly of the three hulls of his trimaran only began on 28 July at a boatyard in [[Norfolk]].{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=15\u201317}}{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=56, 63\u201364}}{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|p=39}}\n\n===Attrition begins (29 July to 31 October)===\n[[File:Satellite image of Cape peninsula.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cape Town]] and the [[Cape Peninsula]], with the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on the bottom right]]\nBlyth and Knox-Johnston were well down the Atlantic by this time. Knox-Johnston, the experienced seaman, was enjoying himself, but ''Suhaili'' had problems with leaking seams near the [[keel]]. However, Knox-Johnston had managed a good repair by [[underwater diving|diving]] and [[caulking]] the seams underwater.{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nBlyth was not far ahead, and although leading the race, he was having far greater problems with his boat, which was suffering in the hard conditions. He had also discovered that the fuel for his [[electrical generator|generator]] had been contaminated, which effectively put his radio out of action. On 15 August, Blyth went in to [[Tristan da Cunha]] to pass a message to his wife, and spoke to crew from an anchored cargo ship, ''Gillian Gaggins''. On being invited aboard by her captain, a fellow [[Scottish people|Scot]], Blyth found the offer impossible to refuse and went aboard, while the ship's engineers fixed his generator and replenished his fuel supply.{{cn|date = April 2014}}\n\nBy this time he had already shifted his focus from the race to a more personal quest to discover his own limits; and so, despite his technical disqualification for receiving assistance, he continued sailing towards [[Cape Town]]. His boat continued to deteriorate, however, and on 13 September he put into [[East London, South Africa|East London]]. Having successfully sailed the length of the Atlantic and rounded [[Cape Agulhas]] in an unsuitable boat, he decided that he would take on the challenge of the sea again, but in a better boat and on his own terms.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=92\u2013101}}\n\nDespite the retirements, other racers were still getting started. On Thursday, 22 August, Moitessier and Fougeron set off, with King following on Saturday (none of them wanted to leave on a Friday).{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|p=3}} With ''Joshua'' lightened for a race, Moitessier set a fast pace{{spaced ndash}}more than twice as fast as Knox-Johnston over the same part of the course. Tetley sailed on 16 September,{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=23\u201324}} and on 23 September, Crowhurst's boat, ''Teignmouth Electron'', was finally launched in Norfolk. Under severe time pressure, Crowhurst planned to sail to [[Teignmouth]], his planned departure point, in three days; but although the boat performed well downwind, the struggle against headwinds in the [[English Channel]] showed severe deficiencies in the boat's upwind performance, and the trip to Teignmouth took 13 days.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=50\u201356}}\n\nMeanwhile, Moitessier was making excellent progress. On 29 September he passed [[Trindade and Martim Vaz|Trindade]] in the south Atlantic, and on 20 October he reached Cape Town, where he managed to leave word of his progress. He sailed on east into the [[Southern Ocean]], where he continued to make good speed, covering {{convert|188|nmi|mi km}} on 28 October.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|pp=19\u201329, 36\u201345, 56}}\n\nOthers were not so comfortable with the ocean conditions. On 30 October, Fougeron passed Tristan da Cunha, with King a few hundred nautical miles ahead.  The next day{{spaced ndash}}[[Halloween]]{{spaced ndash}}they both found themselves in a severe storm. Fougeron [[heaving to|hove-to]], but still suffered a severe knockdown.  King, who allowed his boat to tend to herself (a recognised procedure known as ''[[lying a-hull]]''), had a much worse experience; his boat was rolled and lost its foremast. Both men decided to retire from the race.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=142, 149\u2013151}}\n\n===The last starters (31 October to 23 December)===\nFour of the starters had decided to retire at this point, at which time Moitessier was {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km}} east of Cape Town, Knox-Johnston was {{convert|4000|nmi|mi km}} ahead in the middle of the [[Great Australian Bight]], and Tetley was just nearing Trindade.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|p=56}}{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=93\u201394}}{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=60\u201361}} However, 31 October was also the last allowable day for racers to start, and was the day that the last two competitors, Donald Crowhurst and Alex Carozzo, got under way. Carozzo, a highly regarded Italian sailor, had competed in (but not finished) that year's ''OSTAR''. Considering himself unready for sea, he \"sailed\" on 31 October, to comply with the race's mandatory start date, but went straight to a [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] to continue preparing his boat without outside assistance. Crowhurst was also far from ready{{spaced ndash}}his boat, barely finished, was a chaos of unstowed supplies, and his self-righting system was unbuilt. He left anyway, and started slowly making his way against the prevailing winds of the English Channel.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=75\u201381}}\n\n[[File:GoldenGlobeRaceOct31.png|thumb|250px|left|The approximate positions of the racers on 31 October 1968, the last day on which racers could start]]\nBy mid-November Crowhurst was already having problems with his boat. Hastily built, the boat was already showing signs of being unprepared, and in the rush to depart, Crowhurst had left behind crucial repair materials. On 15 November, he made a careful appraisal of his outstanding problems and of the risks he would face in the [[Southern Ocean]]; he was also acutely aware of the financial problems awaiting him at home. Despite his analysis that ''Teignmouth Electron'' was not up to the severe conditions which she would face in the [[Roaring Forties]], he pressed on.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=79\u201397}}\n\nCarozzo retired on 14 November, as he had started vomiting blood due to a [[peptic ulcer]], and put into [[Porto]], [[Portugal]], for medical attention.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|p=181}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/06/03/reviews/010603.03hightot.html|title=Sailors Take Warning!|last=Hightower|first=Elizabeth|date=3 June 2001|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}</ref> Two more retirements were reported in rapid succession, as King made Cape Town on 22 November, and Fougeron stopped in [[Saint Helena]] on 27 November.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=155\u2013156}} This left four boats in the race at the beginning of December: Knox-Johnston's ''Suhaili'', battling frustrating and unexpected headwinds in the south [[Pacific Ocean]],{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=125\u2013128}} Moitessier's ''Joshua'', closing on [[Tasmania]],{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|pp=83\u201387}} Tetley's ''Victress'', just passing the [[Cape of Good Hope]],{{sfn|Tetley|1970|p=79}} and Crowhurst's ''Teignmouth Electron'', still in the north Atlantic.\n\nTetley was just entering the Roaring Forties, and encountering strong winds.  He experimented with self-steering systems based on various combinations of headsails, but had to deal with some frustrating headwinds.  On 21 December he encountered a calm and took the opportunity to clean the hull somewhat; while doing so, he saw a {{convert|7|foot}} shark prowling around the boat.  He later caught it, using a shark hook baited with a tin of [[Corned beef|bully beef (corned beef)]], and hoisted it on board for a photo.  His log is full of sail changes and other such sailing technicalities and gives little impression of how he was coping with the voyage emotionally; still, describing a heavy low<!--low barometric pressure, or a psychological low?--> on 15 December he hints at his feelings, wondering \"why the hell I was on this voyage anyway\".{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=79\u201391}}\n\nKnox-Johnston was having problems, as ''Suhaili'' was showing the strains of the long and hard voyage. On 3 November, his self-steering gear had failed for the last time, as he had used up all his spares. He was also still having leak problems, and his rudder was loose. Still, he felt that the boat was fundamentally sound, so he braced the rudder as well as he could, and started learning to balance the boat in order to sail a constant course on her own. On 7 November, he dropped mail off in [[Melbourne]], and on 19 November he made an arranged meeting off the Southern Coast of New Zealand with a ''Sunday Mirror'' journalist from [[Otago, New Zealand]].{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=97, 101\u2013102, 117\u2013123}}{{clarify |date=April 2018 |reason=how did this not disqualify him? explain!}}\n\n===Crowhurst's false voyage (6 to 23 December)===\nOn 10 December, Crowhurst reported that he had had some fast sailing at last, including a day's run on 8 December of {{convert|243|nmi|mi km}}, a new 24-hour record. [[Francis Chichester]] was sceptical of Crowhurst's sudden change in performance, and with good reason{{spaced ndash}}on 6 December, Crowhurst had started creating a faked record of his voyage, showing his position advancing much faster than it actually was.  The creation of this fake log was an incredibly intricate process, involving working celestial navigation in reverse.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=98\u2013116}}\n\nThe motivation for this initial deception was most likely to allow him to claim an attention-getting record prior to entering the [[doldrums]].  However, from that point on, he started to keep two logs{{spaced ndash}}his actual navigation log, and a second log in which he could enter a faked description of a round-the-world voyage.  This would have been an immensely difficult task, involving the need to make up convincing descriptions of weather and sailing conditions in a different part of the world, as well as complex reverse navigation.  He tried to keep his options open as long as possible, mainly by giving only extremely vague position reports; but on 17 December he sent a deliberately false message indicating that he was over the [[Equator]], which he was not.  From this point his radio reports{{spaced ndash}}while remaining ambiguous{{spaced ndash}}indicated steadily more impressive progress around the world; but he never left the Atlantic, and it seems that after December the mounting problems with his boat had caused him to give up on ever doing so.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=117\u2013126}}\n\n===Christmas at sea (24 to 25 December)===\n\nChristmas Day 1968 was a strange day for the four racers, who were very far from friends and family. Crowhurst made a radio call to his wife on Christmas Eve, during which he was pressed for a precise position, but refused to give one. Instead, he told her he was \"off Cape Town\", a position far in advance of his plotted fake position, and even farther from his actual position, {{convert|20|nmi|km}} off the easternmost point in [[Brazil]], just 7 degrees ({{convert|480|nmi|mi km}}) south of the equator.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=126, 133}}\n\nLike Crowhurst, Tetley was depressed. He had a lavish Christmas dinner of roast pheasant, but was suffering badly from loneliness.{{sfn|Tetley|1970|p=93}} Knox-Johnston, thoroughly at home on the sea, treated himself to a generous dose of whisky and held a rousing solo carol service, then drank a [[The Loyal Toast|toast to the Queen]] at 3pm. He managed to pick up some radio stations from the U.S., and heard for the first time about the [[Apollo 8]] astronauts, who had just made the first orbit of the Moon.{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=140\u2013142}} Moitessier, meanwhile, was sunbathing in a flat calm, deep in the roaring forties south-west of New Zealand.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|p=93}}\n\n===Rounding the Horn (26 December to 18 March)===\n[[File:GoldenGlobeRaceJan19.png|thumb|250px|left|The approximate positions of the racers on 19 January 1969]]\nBy January, concern was growing for Knox-Johnston. He was having problems with his radio transmitter and nothing had been heard since he had passed south of New Zealand.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|p=213}} He was actually making good progress, rounding [[Cape Horn]] on 17 January 1969. Elated by this successful climax to his voyage, he briefly considered continuing east, to sail around the Southern Ocean a second time, but soon gave up the idea and turned north for home.{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=160\u2013161, 175}}\n\nCrowhurst's deliberately vague position reporting was also causing consternation for the press, who were desperate for hard facts. On 19 January, he finally yielded to the pressure and stated himself to be {{convert|100|nmi|mi km}} south-east of [[Gough Island]] in the south Atlantic. He also reported that due to generator problems he was shutting off his radio for some time. His position was misunderstood on the receiving end to be {{convert|100|nmi|km}} south-east of the Cape of Good Hope; the high speed this erroneous position implied fuelled newspaper speculation in the following radio silence, and his position was optimistically reported as rapidly advancing around the globe. Crowhurst's actual position, meanwhile, was off Brazil, where he was making slow progress south, and carefully monitoring weather reports from around the world to include in his fake log. He was also becoming increasingly concerned about ''Teignmouth Electron'', which was starting to come apart, mainly due to slapdash construction.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=143\u2013147}}\n\nMoitessier also had not been heard from since New Zealand, but he was still making good progress and coping easily with the conditions of the \"furious fifties\". He was carrying letters from old Cape Horn sailors describing conditions in the Southern Ocean, and he frequently consulted these to get a feel for chances of encountering ice. He reached the Horn on 6 February, but when he started to contemplate the voyage back to Plymouth he realised that he was becoming increasingly disenchanted with the race concept.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|pp=109\u2013111, 140\u2013142}}\n\n[[File:CapeHorn.jpg|thumb|right|Cape Horn from the South.]]\nAs he sailed past the [[Falkland Islands]]{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|p=146}} he was sighted, and this first news of him since [[Tasmania]] caused considerable excitement. It was predicted that he would arrive home on 24 April as the winner (in fact, Knox-Johnston finished on 22 April). A huge reception was planned in Britain, from where he would be escorted to France by a fleet of French warships for an even more grand reception. There was even said to be a [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] waiting for him there.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=241\u2013242}}\n\nMoitessier had a very good idea of this, but throughout his voyage he had been developing an increasing disgust with the excesses of the modern world; the planned celebrations seemed to him to be yet another example of brash materialism. After much debate with himself, and many thoughts of those waiting for him in England, he decided to continue sailing{{spaced ndash}}past the Cape of Good Hope, and across the Indian Ocean for a second time, into the Pacific.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|pp=148, 158\u2013165}} Unaware of this, the newspapers continued to publish \"assumed\" positions progressing steadily up the Atlantic, until, on 18 March, Moitessier fired a slingshot message in a can onto a ship near the shore of Cape Town, announcing his new plans to a stunned world: {{cquote|My intention is to continue the voyage, still nonstop, toward the Pacific Islands, where there is plenty of sun and more peace than in Europe. Please do not think I am trying to break a record. 'Record' is a very stupid word at sea. I am continuing nonstop because I am happy at sea, and perhaps because I want to save my soul.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=242\u2013244}}}}\n\nOn the same day, Tetley rounded Cape Horn, becoming the first to accomplish the feat in a [[multihull]] sailboat.  Badly battered by his Southern Ocean voyage, he turned north with considerable relief.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=241\u2013242}}<ref>''Trimran Solo'', pages 124\u2014131.</ref>\n\n===Re-establishing contact (19 March to 22 April)===\n''Teignmouth Electron'' was also battered and Crowhurst badly wanted to make repairs, but without the spares that had been left behind he needed new supplies. After some planning, on 8 March he put into the tiny settlement of R\u00edo Salado, in [[Argentina]], just south of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]]. Although the village turned out to be the home of a small [[coastguard]] station, and his presence was logged, he got away with his supplies and without publicity. He started heading south again, intending to get some film and experience of Southern Ocean conditions to bolster his false log.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=151\u2013162}}\n\nThe concern for Knox-Johnston turned to alarm in March, with no news of him since New Zealand; aircraft taking part in a [[NATO]] exercise in the North Atlantic mounted a search operation in the region of the [[Azores]]. However, on 6 April he finally managed to make contact with a British [[tanker (ship)|tanker]] using his [[signal lamp]], which reported the news of his position, {{convert|1200|nmi|mi km}} from home. This created a sensation in Britain, with Knox-Johnston now clearly set to win the Golden Globe trophy, and Tetley predicted to win the \u00a35,000 prize for the fastest time.{{sfn|Knox-Johnston|1969|pp=205\u2013206}}{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=248, 251}}\n\n[[File:GoldenGlobeRaceApr10.png|thumb|250px|left|The approximate positions of the racers on 10 April 1969]]\nCrowhurst re-opened radio contact on 10 April, reporting himself to be \"heading\" towards the [[Diego Ramirez Islands]], near Cape Horn. This news caused another sensation, as with his projected arrival in the UK at the start of July he now seemed to be a contender for the fastest time, and (very optimistically) even for a close finish with Tetley. Once his projected false position approached his actual position, he started heading north at speed.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=170\u2013172, 185\u2013186}}\n\nTetley, informed that he might be robbed of the fastest-time prize, started pushing harder, despite that his boat was having significant problems{{spaced ndash}}he made major repairs at sea in an attempt to stop the port hull of his trimaran falling off, and kept racing. On 22 April, he crossed his outbound track, one definition of a [[circumnavigation]].{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=136\u2013141}}\n\n===The finish (22 April to 1 July)===\nOn the same day, 22 April, Knox-Johnston completed his voyage where it had started, in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. This made him the winner of the Golden Globe trophy, and the first person to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world, which he had done in 312 days.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|p=267}} This left Tetley and Crowhurst apparently fighting for the \u00a35,000 prize for fastest time.\n\nHowever, Tetley knew that he was pushing his boat too hard. On 20 May he ran into a storm near the Azores and began to worry about the boat's severely weakened state. Hoping that the storm would soon blow over, he lowered all sail and went to sleep with the boat lying a-hull. In the early hours of the next day he was awoken by the sounds of tearing wood. Fearing that the bow of the port hull might have broken off, he went on deck to cut it loose, only to discover that in breaking away it had made a large hole in the main hull, from which ''Victress'' was now taking on water too rapidly to stop. He sent a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]], and luckily got an almost immediate reply. He abandoned ship just before ''Victress'' finally sank and was rescued from his [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|liferaft]] that evening, having come to within {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km}} of finishing what would have been the most significant voyage ever made in a multi-hulled boat.{{sfn|Tetley|1970|pp=149\u2013160}}\n\nCrowhurst was left as the only person in the race, and{{spaced ndash}}given his high reported speeds{{spaced ndash}}virtually guaranteed the \u00a35,000 prize. This would, however, also guarantee intense scrutiny of himself, his stories, and his logs by genuine Cape Horn veterans such as the sceptical Chichester. Although he had put great effort into his fabricated log, such a deception would in practice be extremely difficult to carry off, particularly for someone who did not have actual experience of the Southern Ocean; something of which he must have been aware at heart. Although he had been sailing fast{{spaced ndash}}at one point making over {{convert|200|nmi|mi km}} in a day{{spaced ndash}}as soon as he learned of Tetley's sinking, he slowed down to a wandering crawl.{{sfn|Tomalin|Hall|2003|pp=186, 190\u2013191}}\n\nCrowhurst's main radio failed at the beginning of June, shortly after he had learned that he was the sole remaining competitor. Plunged into unwilling solitude, he spent the following weeks attempting to repair the radio, and on 22 June was finally able to transmit and receive in [[morse code]]. The following days were spent exchanging [[telegraphy|cables]] with his agent and the press, during which he was bombarded with news of syndication rights, a welcoming fleet of boats and helicopters, and a rapturous welcome by the British people. It became clear that he could not now avoid the spotlight.\n\nUnable to see a way out of his predicament, he plunged into abstract philosophy, attempting to find an escape in [[metaphysics]], and on 24 June he started writing a long essay to express his ideas. Inspired (in a misguided way) by the work of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], whose book ''[[wikisource:Relativity: The Special and General Theory|Relativity: The Special and General Theory]]'' he had aboard, the theme of Crowhurst's writing was that a sufficiently intelligent mind can overcome the constraints of the real world. Over the following eight days, he wrote 25,000 words of increasingly tortured prose, drifting farther and farther from reality, as ''Teignmouth Electron'' continued sailing slowly north, largely untended. Finally, on 1 July, he concluded his writing with a garbled suicide note and, it is assumed, jumped overboard.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=195\u2013251}}\n\nMoitessier, meanwhile, had concluded his own personal voyage more happily. He had circumnavigated the world and sailed almost two-thirds of the way round a second time, all non-stop and mostly in the roaring forties. Despite heavy weather and a couple of severe knockdowns, he contemplated rounding the Horn again. However, he decided that he and ''Joshua'' had had enough and sailed to Tahiti, where he and his wife had set out for Alicante. He thus completed his second personal circumnavigation of the world (including the previous voyage with his wife) on 21 June 1969. He started work on his book.{{sfn|Moitessier|1995|pp=172\u2013175}}\n\n==Aftermath of the race==\nKnox-Johnston, as the only finisher, was awarded both the Golden Globe trophy and the \u00a35,000 prize for fastest time. He continued to sail and circumnavigated three more times. He was awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1969 and was knighted in 1995.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sir-cliff-stars-in-nostalgia-birthday-honours-1586748.html|title=Sir Cliff stars in nostalgia Birthday Honours|last=Goodwin|first=Stephen|date=17 June 1995|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=3 February 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Joshua001.jpg|thumb|right|''Joshua'', restored, at the Maritime Museum at [[La Rochelle]]]]\nIt is impossible to say that Moitessier would have won if he had completed the race, as he would have been sailing in different weather conditions than Knox-Johnston did, but based on his time from the start to Cape Horn being about 77% of that of Knox-Johnston, it would have been extremely close. However Moitessier is on record as stating that he would not have won.{{sfn|Eakin|2009}}{{pn|date=April 2018}} His book, ''The Long Way'', tells the story of his voyage as a spiritual journey as much as a sailing adventure and is still regarded as a classic of sailing literature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sailnet.com/collections/articles/index.cfm?articleid=jkrets0054|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828235230/http://www.sailnet.com/collections/articles/index.cfm?articleid=jkrets0054|archivedate=28 August 2005|title=Overlooked Books|first=John|last=Kretschmer|publisher=SailNet|accessdate=3 February 2010}} Originally retrieved 6 March 2006.</ref> ''Joshua'' was beached, along with many other yachts, by a storm at [[Cabo San Lucas]] in December 1982; with a new boat, ''Tamata'', Moitessier sailed back to Tahiti from the [[San Francisco Bay]].

Nicholas Tomalin and Ron Hall, two of the journalists connected with the race, wrote a 1970 book on Crowhurst's voyage, ''The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst'', described by [[Hammond Innes]] in its ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'' review as \"fascinating, uncomfortable reading\" and a \"meticulous investigation\" of Crowhurst's downfall.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hodder.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781473635364 |title=The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |accessdate=2018-04-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTetley found it impossible to adapt to his old way of life after his adventure. He was awarded a consolation prize of \u00a31,000, with which he decided to build a new trimaran for a round-the-world speed record attempt. His {{convert|60|foot}} boat ''Miss Vicky'' was built in 1971, but his search for sponsorship to pay for fitting-out met with consistent rejection. His book, ''Trimaran Solo'', sold poorly.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Although he outwardly seemed to be coping, the repeated failures must have taken their toll.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=275\u2013282}} In February 1972, he went missing from his home in [[Dover, England|Dover]]. His body was found in nearby woods hanging from a tree three days later. His death was originally believed to be a suicide. At the [[inquest]], it was revealed that the body had been discovered wearing lingerie and the hands were bound. The attending pathologist suggested the likelihood of masochistic sexual activity. Finding no evidence to suggest that Tetley had killed himself, the coroner recorded an [[open verdict]]. Tetley was cremated; Knox-Johnson and Blyth were among the mourners in attendance.{{sfn|Eakin|2009}}{{pn|date=April 2018}}\n\nBlyth devoted his life to the sea and to introducing others to its challenge. In 1970\u20131971 he sailed a sponsored boat, ''British Steel'', single-handedly around the world \"the wrong way\", against the prevailing winds. He subsequently took part in the [[Volvo Ocean Race|Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race]] and founded the [[Global Challenge]] race, which allows amateurs to race around the world. His old rowing partner, John Ridgway, followed a similar course; he started an adventure school in Scotland, and circumnavigated the world twice under sail: once in the Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race, and once with his wife. King finally completed a circumnavigation in ''Galway Blazer II'' in 1973.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=294\u2013295}}\n\n''Suhaili'' was sailed for some years more, including a trip to [[Greenland]], and spent some years on display at the [[National Maritime Museum]] at [[Greenwich]]. However, her planking began to shrink because of the dry conditions and, unwilling to see her deteriorate, Knox-Johnston removed her from the museum and had her refitted in 2002. She was returned to the water and is now based at the [[National Maritime Museum Cornwall]].{{cn|date = April 2014}}\n\n''Teignmouth Electron'' was sold to a tour operator in [[Jamaica]] and eventually ended up damaged and abandoned on [[Cayman Brac]], where she lies to this day.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=295\u2013296}}\n\nAfter being driven ashore during a storm at [[Cabo San Lucas]], the restored ''Joshua'' was acquired by the maritime museum in [[La Rochelle]], France, where it serves as part of a cruising school.{{sfn|Nichols|2001|pp=295\u2013296}}\n\nGiven the failure of most starters and the tragic outcome of Crowhurst's voyage, considerable controversy was raised over the race and its organisation.  No follow-up race was held for some time. However, in 1982 the [[VELUX 5 Oceans Race|''BOC Challenge'']] race was organised; this single-handed round-the-world race with stops was inspired by the Golden Globe and has been held every four years since. In 1989, [[Philippe Jeantot]] founded the ''[[Vend\u00e9e Globe]]'' race, a non-stop, single-handed, round-the-world race. Essentially the successor to the Golden Globe, this race is also held every four years and has attracted public following for the sport.{{cn|date = April 2014}}\n\n==2018 Golden Globe Race==\n{{main|2018 Golden Globe Race}}\nFor the 50th anniversary of the first race, there was another Golden Globe Race in 2018. Entrants were limited to sailing similar yachts and equipment to what was available to Sir Robin in the original race. This race started from [[Les Sables-d'Olonne]] on 1 July 2018. The prize purse has been confirmed as \u00a375,000, with all sailors that finish before 15:25 on 22 April 2019 winning their entry fee back.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2015/04/22/2018-golden-globe-solo-non-stop-around-the-world-yacht-race-announcement/ |title=2018 Golden Globe: solo non-stop, around the world yacht race announcement |date=2015-04-22 |work=Scuttlebutt Sailing News |access-date=2018-04-20 |language=en-US|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Competitors==\n<!--{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}} all these items are cited elsewhere in the article-->\nNine competitors participated in the race.

It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - a [[naval orange]] and the main protagonist of the show. He is thought to be incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises (even his \"Nya Nya\" and his \"motorboat\"), and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths. Orange's laugh is recognizable and likes to make puns and jokes.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - a Bartlet pear and the deuteragonist of the show. He is the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series. As a result, Pear has confirmed to try to perform extreme things to deny the idea of him being boring.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel. His catchphrase is \"Neato burrito!\"\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is a cute marshmallow Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances. Marshmallow says, \"Yay!\" a lot and has a cheeky giggle.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods, although he usually fails at his tasks.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment. Grapefruit is also in love with Passion, although she doesn't like him.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies,\" a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four. His Gourd is a zucchini, and was gifted the power of the Mussel Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Pink''' (voiced by [[Shira Lazar]]) - Pink is a gymnast and the sole female member of the team. Her Gourd is a pumpkin, and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team. His Gourd is a squash, and was gifted the power of the Clam Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Green''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - Green is the always-ignored voice of reason, as his logical ideas on how to deal with villains are always shot down by his teammates, even though they would be very effective, much to his chagrin. His Gourd is a courgette, and was gifted the power of an unknown Chowdergourd in the fourth episode (presumed to be a scallop).\n\n==Videos==\n{{Main|List of The Annoying Orange episodes}}\n[[File:Annoying Orange - Orange Coin (Ft iJustine, Steve Zaragoza, and Mikey Bolts).webm|thumb|\"Orange Coin\" episode]]\nThe first Annoying Orange episode was released on October 9, 2009.

While Pear gives useful and proper advice, Orange gives advice that is misleading, confusing, or off-topic. It was released on {{Start date|2016|1|27}} with How To Tie a Tie, and despite that Orange ends much of the videos by surviving an explosion of TNT - in How to Make a Halloween Costume on {{Start date|2017|10|11}}, Pear ended the video with TNT due to Orange going overboard with terms of cows, which has become a running gag since How to be a Rapper on {{Start date|2017|8|2}}. There were 3 Christmas/New Year specials in 2016, 4 in 2017, 1 in 2018 and 12 Halloween/Shocktober-themed episodes, four in 2016, 2017, & 2018 each. As of {{Start date|2019|7|24}}, there have been ??? HOW2 episodes.\n\n====Emoji Raps====\nThe Emoji Raps star Orange rapping about several things using emojis, including himself. The first rap was released on {{Start date|2017|7|3}}. As of {{Start date|2017|12|18}}, there have been eleven raps. The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble!

This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone\n#Dumbo}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.

Despite only slightly resembling the \"Talking Orange\", the Annoying Orange was looked into by H2M's attorneys as an intellectual property matter. Boedigheimer stated he had not watched the \"Talking Orange\" videos before he was told about the disagreement, also believing that the characters were not very similar.<ref>Benshoof, Sam (November 16, 2011). \"[http://www.wdaz.com/event/article/id/11190/ Fargo Man Created Online Sensation 'Annoying Orange'] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130209024950/http://www.wdaz.com/event/article/id/11190/ |date=2013-02-09 }}\".

The game was later released in [[high-definition video|HD]] for the [[iPad]] on May 6, 2011, and for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices on October 14, 2011. The Christmas version of the game was released in December 2011 and the free version of the game, Kitchen Carnage Lite, was released March 2, 2012.\n\nThe aim of the game is to throw different items across the kitchen into a series of blenders before the time runs out. The player is given [[apple]]s and [[banana]]s at the start. When the second level is reached, [[tomato]]es are added. Level 3 adds [[cantaloupe]]s, level 4 [[pineapple]]s, level 5 [[strawberry|strawberries]] and level 6 adds Fred FiggleCorns.\n\n===''Splatter Up''===\n{{Main|Annoying Orange: Splatter Up}}\n''[[Annoying Orange: Splatter Up]]'' is the second game by the Annoying Orange, after ''Kitchen Carnage''. The game is based on baseball, and the player slides a finger while a fruit enters the home plate. The faster the player slides, the farther he gets. The game sprites are the same as the ''Kitchen Carnage'' game, the only one that does not appear in this game but appear in ''Kitchen Carnage'' is Fred Figglecorn.\n\n==Pay withdrawal lawsuit==\nOn December 23, 2014, Dane Boedigheimer announced that ''The Annoying Orange'' has not been funded by Collective Digital Studios since November 2014. This has led Boedigheimer to take legal action to get paid.

It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - the main character who is incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth, and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises, and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck, and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel.\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster, and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy, and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies\", a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four. His Gourd is a zucchini, and was gifted the power of the Mussel Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Pink''' (voiced by [[Shira Lazar]]) - Pink is a gymnast and the sole female member of the team. Her Gourd is a pumpkin, and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team. His Gourd is a squash, and was gifted the power of the Clam Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Green''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - Green is the always-ignored voice of reason, as his logical ideas on how to deal with villains are always shot down by his teammates, even though they would be very effective, much to his chagrin.

While Pear gives useful and proper advice, Orange gives advice that is misleading, confusing, or off-topic. It was released on {{Start date|2016|1|27}} with How To Tie a Tie, and despite that Orange ends much of the videos by surviving an explosion of TNT - in How to Make a Halloween Costume on {{Start date|2017|10|11}}, Pear ended the video with TNT due to Orange going overboard with terms of cows, which has become a running gag since How to be a Rapper on {{Start date|2017|8|2}}. There were 3 Christmas/New Year specials in 2016, 4 in 2017, 1 in 2018 and 12 Halloween/Shocktober-themed episodes, four in 2016, 2017, & 2018 each. As of {{Start date|2019|7|24}}, there have been ??? HOW2 episodes.\n\n====Emoji Raps====\nThe Emoji Raps star Orange rapping about several things using emojis, including himself. The first rap was released on {{Start date|2017|7|3}}. As of {{Start date|2017|12|18}}, there have been eleven raps. The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble!

This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone\n#Dumbo}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.

The character was created by writer [[Robert E. Howard]] in 1932 for a series of fantasy stories published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine.\n\n==Publication history==\nConan the Barbarian was created by Robert E. Howard in a series of fantasy stories published in ''Weird Tales'' in 1932.<ref>Herron (1984). p. 149: \"Robert E. Howard of Cross Plains, Texas, created one of the great mythic figures in modern popular culture, the Dark Barbarian... [which] put Howard in the select ranks of the literary legend-makers\"</ref> For months, Howard had been in search of a new character to market to the burgeoning pulp outlets of the early 1930s. In October 1931, he submitted the short story \"People of the Dark\" to Clayton Publications' new magazine, ''[[Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror]]'' (June 1932). \"People of the Dark\" is a remembrance story of \"[[past lives]]\", and in its first-person narrative the protagonist describes one of his previous incarnations; Conan is a black-haired [[barbarian]] hero who swears by a deity called [[Crom (fictional deity)|Crom]]. Some Howard scholars believe this Conan to be a forerunner of the more famous character.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\">Louinet, pp. 429-453</ref>\n\nIn February 1932, Howard vacationed at a border town on the lower [[Rio Grande]]. During this trip, he further conceived the character of Conan and also wrote the poem \"[[Cimmeria (poem)|Cimmeria]]\", much of which echoes specific passages in [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]''.<ref>\"Hyborean Genesis: Notes on the Creation of the Conan Stories\", by Patrice Louinet; in [https://books.google.com/books?id=mTFV7Q5Nd4IC The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian], by Robert Ervin Howard, Del Rey/Ballantine Books, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mTFV7Q5Nd4IC&pg=PA424&dq=howard%20conan%201932%20rio%20grande%20cimmeria#v=onepage p. 424]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SRDUAAAAQBAJ Conversations with Texas Writers], by Frances Leonard and Ramona Cearley, University of Texas Press, 1 Jan 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRDUAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT217&dq=howard%20conan%201932%20rio%20grande%20cimmeria#v=onepage p. 217]</ref> According to some scholars, Howard's conception of Conan and the [[Hyborian Age]] may have originated in [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Thomas Bulfinch|The Outline of Mythology]]'' (1913) which inspired Howard to \"coalesce into a coherent whole his literary aspirations and the strong physical, autobiographical elements underlying the creation of Conan\".<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nHaving digested these prior influences after he returned from his trip, Howard rewrote a rejected story, \"[[By This Axe I Rule!]]\" (May 1929), replacing his existing character [[Kull of Atlantis]] with his new hero, and retitling it \"[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]\". Howard also wrote \"[[The Scarlet Citadel]]\" and \"[[The Frost-Giant's Daughter]]\", inspired by the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of [[Daphne]],{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and submitted both stories to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. Although \"[[The Frost-Giant's Daughter]]\" was rejected, the magazine accepted \"The Phoenix on the Sword\" after it received the requested polishing, and published it in the December 1932 issue. \"The Scarlet Citadel\" was published the following month. .<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\n\"The Phoenix on the Sword\" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' [[cover-date]]d December&nbsp;1932. Editor [[Farnsworth Wright]] subsequently prompted Howard to write an 8,000-word essay for personal use detailing \"the [[Hyborian Age]]\", the fictional setting for Conan. Using this essay as his guideline, Howard began plotting \"[[The Tower of the Elephant]]\", a new Conan story that was the first to truly integrate his new conception of the Hyborian world.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nThe publication and success of \"The Tower of the Elephant\" spurred Howard to write many more Conan stories for ''Weird Tales''. By the time of Howard's suicide in 1936, he had written 21&nbsp;complete stories, 17&nbsp;of&nbsp;which had been published, as well as a number of unfinished fragments.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nFollowing Howard's death, the copyright of the Conan stories passed through several hands.  Eventually, under the guidance of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]], the stories were edited, revised, and sometimes rewritten. For roughly 40 years, the original versions of Howard's Conan stories remained out of print. In 1977, the publisher Berkley Books issued three volumes using the earliest published form of the texts from ''Weird Tales'',{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} but these failed to displace the edited versions. In the 1980s and 1990s, the copyright holders of the Conan franchise permitted Howard's stories to go out of print entirely,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} while continuing to sell Conan works by other authors.\n\nIn 2000, the British publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz Science Fiction]] issued a two-volume, complete edition of Howard's Conan stories as part of its Fantasy Masterworks imprint, which included several stories that had never seen print in their original form. The Gollancz edition mostly used the versions of the stories as published in ''Weird Tales''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superherouniverse.com/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian/|title=Conan the Barbarian - Superhero Wiki Encyclopedia|website=superherouniverse.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe two volumes were combined and the stories resorted into chronological order as ''The Complete Chronicles of Conan: Centenary Edition'' ([[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz Science Fiction]], 2006; edited and with an Afterword by Steve Jones).\n\nIn 2003, another British publisher, Wandering Star Books,<ref>[http://www.wanderingstarbooks.com/ Wandering Star Books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718135237/http://wanderingstarbooks.com/ |date=2013-07-18 }}, official website</ref> made an effort both to restore Howard's original manuscripts and to provide a more scholarly and historical view of the Conan stories. It published hardcover editions in England, which were republished in the United States by the Del Rey imprint of [[Ballantine Books]]. The first book, ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932&ndash;1933)'' (2003; published in the US as ''[[The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian]]'') includes Howard's notes on his fictional setting, as well as letters and poems concerning the genesis of his ideas. This was followed by ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume Two (1934)'' (2004; published in the US as ''[[The Bloody Crown of Conan]]'') and ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume Three (1935&ndash;1936)'' (2005; published in the US as ''[[The Conquering Sword of Conan]]''). These three volumes combined include all of the original, unedited Conan stories.\n\n==Setting==\n{{main|Hyborian Age}}\n\nThe various stories of '''Conan the Barbarian''' occur in the pseudo-historical \"[[Hyborian Age]]\", set after the destruction of [[Atlantis]] and before the rise of any known [[Ancient history|ancient civilization]]. This is a specific epoch in a fictional timeline created by Howard for many of the [[low fantasy]] tales of his [[artificial mythology|artificial legendary]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525135846/http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm | archivedate=25 May 2011|title=The Hyborian Age|author=Howard, Robert E., adapted by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Walt Simonson]]|journal=Conan Saga |issue= 50\u201354, 56|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe reasons behind the invention of the Hyborian Age were perhaps commercial: Howard had an intense love for history and historical dramas; however, at the same time, he recognized the difficulties and the time-consuming research work needed in maintaining historical accuracy\u2014and moreover, the poorly-stocked libraries in the rural part of Texas where Howard lived just didn't have the material needed for such historical research. By conceiving a timeless setting\u2014\"a ''vanished'' age\"\u2014and by carefully choosing names that resembled human history, Howard shrewdly avoided the problem of historical anachronisms and  his need for lengthy exposition.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nAccording to \"The Phoenix on the Sword\", the adventures of Conan take place \"Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the [[Aryan|Sons of Aryas]].\"<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=Robert E. Howard|last=Howard|first= Robert E. |title=The Phoenix on the Sword|journal=[[Weird Tales]]|issue=20|date=6 December 1932|title-link=The Phoenix on the Sword}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and character==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2011}}\n\nConan is a [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerian]]. From the writings of Robert E. Howard ([[The Hyborian Age]] among others) it is known that his Cimmerians are based on the [[Celts]] or perhaps the historic [[Cimmerians]], based on the described geography and the existence of said people. He was born on a battlefield and is the son of a village [[blacksmith]]. Conan matured quickly as a youth and, by age fifteen, he was already a respected [[warrior]] who had participated in the destruction of the [[Aquilonia (Conan)|Aquilonian]] fortress of Venarium.<ref>''Conan the Warrior'' (1935): \"[[Beyond the Black River]]\"</ref> After its demise, he was struck by wanderlust and began the adventures chronicled by Howard, encountering skulking monsters, evil [[Magicians in fantasy|wizard]]s, tavern wenches, and beautiful [[princess]]es. He roamed throughout the [[Hyborian Age]] nations as a [[thief]], [[outlaw]], [[mercenary]], and [[pirate]].<ref>''Conan the Cimmerian'': \"[[Queen of the Black Coast]]\" (1934)</ref> As he grew older, he began commanding vast units of warriors and escalating his ambitions. In his forties, he seized the crown from the tyrannical [[monarch|king]] of Aquilonia, the most powerful kingdom of the Hyborian Age, having strangled the previous ruler on the steps of his own throne.<ref>''Conan the Cimmerian'': \"[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]\" (1932)</ref> Conan's adventures often result in him performing heroic feats, though his motivation for doing so is largely to protect his own survival or for personal gain.\n\nA conspicuous element of Conan's character is his [[chivalry]]. He is extremely reluctant to fight women (even when they fight him) and has a strong tendency to save a [[damsels in distress]]. In \"[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]\", he has to make a split-second decision whether to save the dancing girl Muriela or the chest of priceless gems which he spent months in search of. So, without hesitation, he rescues Muriela and allows for the treasure to be irrevocably lost. In \"[[The Black Stranger]]\", Conan saves the exile Zingaran Lady Belesa at considerable risk to himself, giving her as a parting gift his fortune in gems big enough to have a comfortable and wealthy life in Zingara, while asking for no sexual favors in return. Reviewer Jennifer Bard also noted<ref>Dr. Jennifer Agatha Bard, \"Gender Roles in Science Fiction and Fantasy\", Bulletin of Gender Equality, Summer 1986.</ref> that when Conan is in a pirate crew or a robber gang led by another male, his tendency is to subvert and undermine the leader's authority, and eventually supplant (and often, kill) him (e.g. \"[[The Pool of the Black One|Pool of the Black One]]\", \"[[A Witch Shall be Born]]\", \"[[Shadows in the Moonlight (story)|Shadows in the Moonlight]]\"). Conversely, in \"[[Queen of the Black Coast]]\", it is noted that Conan \"generally agreed to Belit's plan. Hers was the mind that directed their raids, his the arm that carried out her ideas. It was a good life.\" And at the end of \"[[Red Nails]]\", Conan and Valeria seem to be headed towards a reasonably amicable piratical partnership.\n\nGeorge Baxter noted that \"Conan's recorded history mentions him as being prominently involved, at one time or another, with four different pirate fraternities, on two different seas, as well being a noted leader of land robbers at three different locales. Yet, we hardly ever see him involved in, well, robbing people. To be sure, he speaks about it often and with complete candor: \"We [[Cossack|Kozaks]] took to plundering the outlying dominions of Koth, Zamora, and Turan impartially\" he says in \"[[Shadows in the Moonlight (story)|Shadows in the Moonlight]]\". But that was ''before'' the story began. And \"We're bound for waters where the seaports are fat, and the merchant ships are crammed with plunder!\" Conan declares at the end of \"[[The Pool of the Black One]]\". But this plundering will take place ''after'' the story ends. When we see Conan onstage, we see him do many other things: he intervenes in the politics and dynastic struggles of various kingdoms; he hunts for hidden treasure; he explores desert islands and lost cities; he fights countless terrible monsters and evil sorcerers; he saves countless beautiful women and makes them fall in love with him... What we virtually never see Conan do is engage in the proper business of an armed robber, on land or by sea\u2014which is to attack people who never threatened or provoked you, take away their possessions by main force, and run your sword through them if they dare to resist. A bit messy business, that. Armchair adventurers, who like to enjoy a good yarn in the perfect safety and comfort of their suburban homes, might not have liked to read it.\"<ref>George Xavier Baxter, \"Heroic Fantasy and Mundane Reality\", in Winifred Stromberg (ed.) \"Multi-Disciplinary Round Table on Twentieth Century Popular Culture\"</ref>\n\n===Appearance===\n{{Quote box\n|quote = Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet.\" |source = [[Robert E. Howard]], ''[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]'', 1932.|width = 40%|bgcolor =}}\nConan has \"sullen\", \"smoldering\", and \"volcanic\" blue eyes with a black \"square-cut mane\". Howard once describes him as having a hairy chest and, while comic book interpretations often portray Conan as wearing a loincloth or other minimalist clothing to give him a more barbaric image, Howard describes the character as wearing whatever garb is typical for the kingdom and culture in which Conan finds himself. Howard never gave a strict height or weight for Conan in a story, only describing him in loose terms like \"giant\" and \"massive\".<ref>Howard, Robert E. \"[[A Witch Shall Be Born]]\": \"the man was almost a giant in stature\"; \"Knots and bunches of muscle started out of the massive arms\".</ref> In the tales, no human is ever described as being stronger than Conan, although several are mentioned as taller (such as the strangler Baal-pteor) or of larger bulk. In a letter to [[P. Schuyler Miller]] and [[John Drury Clark|John D. Clark]] in 1936, only three months before Howard's death, Conan is described as standing 6&nbsp;ft/183&nbsp;cm and weighing {{convert|180|lb}} when he takes part in an attack on Venarium at only 14 years old, though being far from fully grown. Conan himself says in \"[[Beyond the Black River]]\" that he had \"...not yet seen 15 snows\".\n[[File:ConanCreepsLarge.png|alt=Conan|thumb|Typical depiction of Conan the Barbarian (this drawing is a study of Henrik Sahlstrom's Conan artwork)]]\n\nAlthough Conan is muscular, Howard frequently compares his agility and way of moving to that of a panther (see, for instance, \"[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]\", \"[[Beyond the Black River]]\", or \"[[Rogues in the House]]\"). His skin is frequently characterized as bronzed from constant exposure to the sun. In his younger years, he is often depicted wearing a light [[Chainmail|chain]] shirt and a horned helmet, though appearances vary with different stories.\n\nDuring his reign as king of Aquilonia, Conan was\n::... a tall man, mightily shouldered and deep of chest, with a massive corded neck and heavily muscled limbs. He was clad in silk and velvet, with the royal lions of Aquilonia worked in gold upon his rich jupon, and the crown of Aquilonia shone on his square-cut black mane; but the great sword at his side seemed more natural to him than the regal accoutrements. His brow was low and broad, his eyes a volcanic blue that smoldered as if with some inner fire. His dark, scarred, almost sinister face was that of a fighting-man, and his velvet garments could not conceal the hard, dangerous lines of his limbs.<ref>Howard, Robert E. Howard ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]'', reprinted ''The Bloody Crown of Conan'', pp. 89-90</ref>\n\nHoward [[Cimmeria (Conan)|imagined the Cimmerians]] as a [[pre-Celtic]] people with mostly black hair and blue or grey eyes. Ethnically, the [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerians to which Conan belongs]] are descendants of the [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], though they do not remember their ancestry. In his fictional historical essay \"[[The Hyborian Age]]\", Howard describes how the people of Atlantis\u2014the land where his character [[King Kull]] originated\u2014had to move east after a great cataclysm changed the face of the world and sank their island, settling where [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] would eventually be located. Thus they are (in Howard's work) the ancestors of the Irish and Scottish (the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Gaels]]) and not the [[Picts]], the other ancestor of modern Scots who also appear in Howard's work. In the same work, Howard also described how the [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerians]] eventually moved south and east after the [[The Hyborian Age|age of Conan]] (presumably in the vicinity of the [[Black Sea]], where the [[Cimmerian|historical Cimmerians]] dwelt).\n\n===Abilities===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\nDespite his brutish appearance, Conan uses his brains as well as his brawn. The [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerian]] is a highly skilled warrior, possibly without peer with a sword, but his travels have given him vast experience in other trades, especially as a [[Thief (character class)|thief]]. He's also a talented commander, tactician, and strategist, as well as a born leader. In addition, Conan has advanced knowledge of languages and codes and is able to recognize, or even decipher, certain ancient or secret signs and writings. For example, in \"[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]\" Howard states: \"In his roaming about the world the giant adventurer had picked up a wide smattering of knowledge, particularly including the speaking and reading of many alien tongues. Many a sheltered scholar would have been astonished at the Cimmerian's linguistic abilities.\" He also has incredible stamina, enabling him to go without sleep for a few days. In \"[[A Witch Shall be Born]]\", Conan fights armed men until he is overwhelmed, captured, and [[crucifixion|crucified]], before going an entire night and day without water. However, Conan still possesses the strength to pull the nails from his feet, while hoisting himself into a horse's saddle and riding for ten miles.\n\nAnother noticeable trait is his sense of humor, largely absent in the comics and movies, but very much a part of Howard's original vision of the character (particularly apparent in \"[[Xuthal of the Dusk]]\", also known as \"The Slithering Shadow.\") His sense of humor can also be rather grimly ironic, as was demonstrated by how he unleashes his own version of justice on the treacherous\u2014and ill-fated\u2014innkeeper Aram Baksh in \"[[Shadows in Zamboula]]\".\n\nHe is a loyal friend to those true to him, with a barbaric code of conduct that often marks him as more honorable than the more sophisticated people he meets in his travels. Indeed, his straightforward nature and barbarism are constants in all the tales.\n\nConan is a formidable combatant both armed and unarmed. With his back to the wall, Conan is capable of engaging and killing opponents by the score. This is seen in several stories, such as \"[[Queen of the Black Coast]]\", \"[[The Scarlet Citadel]]\", and \"[[A Witch Shall Be Born]]\". Conan is not superhuman, though; he needed the providential help of Zelata's wolf to defeat four Nemedian soldiers in Howard's novel ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]''. Some of his hardest victories have come from fighting single opponents of inhuman strength: one such as Thak, an ape-like humanoid from \"[[Rogues in the House]]\", or the strangler Baal-Pteor in \"Shadows in Zamboula\". Conan is far from untouchable and has been captured or defeated several times (on one occasion, knocking himself out drunkenly after running into a wall).\n\n===Influences===\n{{main|Robert E. Howard}}\nHoward frequently corresponded with [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and the two would sometimes insert references or elements of each other's settings in their works. Later editors reworked many of the original Conan stories by Howard, thus diluting this connection. Nevertheless, many of Howard's unedited Conan stories are arguably part of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].<ref>Louinet, p. 436</ref> Additionally, many of the Conan stories by Howard, de Camp, and Carter used geographical place names from [[Clark Ashton Smith]]'s [[Hyperborean Cycle]].\n\n==Original Robert E.

Sprague de Camp]], [[Roland J. Green]], [[John C. Hocking]], [[Robert Jordan]], [[Sean A. Moore]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Nyberg]], [[Andrew J. Offutt]], [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]], [[John Maddox Roberts]], [[Harry Turtledove]], and [[Karl Edward Wagner]]. Some of these writers have finished incomplete Conan manuscripts by Howard. Others were created by rewriting Howard stories which originally featured entirely different characters from entirely different milieus. Most, however, are completely original works. In total, more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories featuring the Conan character have been written by authors other than Howard.\n\nThe [[Conan (books)#Gnome Press editions, 1950-1957|Gnome Press edition]] (1950\u20131957) was the first hardcover collection of Howard's Conan stories, including all the original Howard material known to exist at the time, some left unpublished in his lifetime. The later volumes contain some stories rewritten by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] (like \"[[The Treasure of Tranicos]]\"), including several non-Conan Howard stories, mostly historical exotica situated in the [[Levant]] at the time of the [[Crusades]], which he turned into Conan yarns. The Gnome edition also issued the first Conan story written by an author other than Howard\u2014the final volume published, which is by [[Bj\u00f6rn Nyberg]] and revised by de Camp.\n\nThe [[Conan (books)#Lancer/Ace paperback editions, 1966-1977|Lancer/Ace editions]] (1966\u20131977), under the direction of [[L. Sprague de Camp|de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]], were the first comprehensive paperbacks, compiling the material from the Gnome Press series together in chronological order with all the remaining original Howard material, including that left unpublished in his lifetime and fragments and outlines. These were completed by de Camp and Carter. The series also included Howard stories originally featuring other protagonists that were rewritten by de Camp as Conan stories. New Conan stories written entirely by de Camp and Carter were added as well. Lancer Books went out of business before bringing out the entire series, the publication of which was completed by Ace Books. Eight of the eventual twelve volumes published featured dynamic cover paintings by [[Frank Frazetta]] that, for many fans,{{who|date=December 2017}} presented the definitive, iconic impression of Conan and his world. For decades to come, most other portrayals of the Cimmerian and his imitators were heavily influenced by the cover paintings of this series.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nMost editions after the Lancer/Ace series have been of either the original Howard stories or Conan material by others, but not both. The exception are the [[Conan (books)#Ace Maroto editions, 1978-1981|Ace Maroto editions]] (1978&ndash;1981), which include both new material by other authors and older material by Howard, though the latter are some of the non-Conan tales rewritten as Conan stories by de Camp. Notable later editions of the original Howard Conan stories include the [[Conan (books)#Donald M. Grant editions, 1974-1989|Donald M. Grant editions]] (1974&ndash;1989, incomplete); [[Conan (books)#Berkley editions, 1977|Berkley editions]] (1977); [[Conan (books)#Gollancz editions, 2000-2006|Gollancz editions]] (2000\u20132006), and [[Conan (books)#Wandering Star/Del Rey editions, 2003-2005|Wandering Star/Del Rey editions]] (2003\u20132005). Later series of new Conan material include the [[Conan (books)#Bantam editions, 1978-1982|Bantam editions]] (1978&ndash;1982) and [[Conan (books)#Tor editions, 1982-2004|Tor editions]] (1982\u20132004).\n\n==Conan chronologies==\n{{main|Conan chronologies}}\n\nIn an attempt to provide a coherent timeline which fit the numerous adventures of Conan penned by Robert E. Howard and later writers, various \"Conan chronologies\" have been prepared by many people from the 1930s onward. Note that no consistent timeline has yet accommodated every single Conan story. The following are the principal theories that have been advanced over the years.\n* [[Conan chronologies#Miller/Clark/de Camp chronology|Miller/Clark chronology]] \u2013 ''A Probable Outline of Conan's Career'' (1936) was the first effort to put the tales in chronological order. Completed by [[P. Schuyler Miller]] and [[John Drury Clark]], the chronology was later revised by Clark and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] in ''An Informal Biography of Conan the Cimmerian'' (1952).\n* [[Conan chronologies#Robert Jordan chronology|Robert Jordan chronology]] \u2013 ''A Conan Chronology by Robert Jordan'' (1987) was a new chronology written by Conan writer [[Robert Jordan]] that included all written Conan material up to that point. It was heavily influenced by the Miller/Clark/de Camp chronologies, though it departed from them in a number of idiosyncratic instances.\n* [[Conan chronologies#William Galen Gray chronology|William Galen Gray chronology]] \u2013 ''Timeline of Conan's Journeys'' (1997, rev.&nbsp;2004), was fan William Galen Gray's attempt to create \"a chronology of all the stories, both Howard and pastiche.\" Drawing on the earlier Miller/Clark and Jordan chronologies, it represents the ultimate expression of their tradition to date.\n* [[Conan chronologies#Joe Marek chronology|Joe Marek chronology]] \u2013 Joe Marek's chronology is limited to stories written (or devised) by Howard, though within that context it is essentially a revision of the Miller/Clark tradition to better reflect the internal evidence of the stories and avoid forcing Conan into what he perceives as a \"mad dash\" around the Hyborian world within timeframes too rapid to be credible.\n* [[Conan chronologies#Dale Rippke chronology|Dale Rippke chronology]] \u2013 ''The Darkstorm Conan Chronology'' (2003) was a completely revised and heavily researched chronology, radically repositioning a number of stories and including only those stories written or devised by Howard. The [[Conan (Dark Horse comic)|Dark Horse comic series]] follows this chronology.\n\n==Media==\n{{See also|Adaptations of works by Robert E. Howard}}\n\n===Films===\n<!-- Please do not include overviews of the Kull or Red Sonja films as such data belongs on their respective articles. -->\n\n====''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982) and ''Conan the Destroyer'' (1984)====\n{{main|Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Destroyer}}\n\nThe very first Conan cinematic project was planned by [[Edward Summer]]. Summer envisioned a series of Conan films, much like the [[James Bond]] franchise. He outlined six stories for this film series, but none were ever made. An original screenplay by Summer and [[Roy Thomas]] was written, but their lore-authentic screen story was never filmed. However, the resulting film, ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982), was a combination of director [[John Milius]]' ideas and plots from Conan stories (written also by Howard's successors, notably [[Lin Carter]] and [[L. Sprague de Camp]]). The addition of [[Nietzschean]] motto and Conan's life philosophy were crucial for bringing the spirit of Howard's literature to the screen.\n\nThe plot of ''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982) begins with Conan being enslaved by the Vanir raiders of [[Thulsa Doom (character)|Thulsa Doom]], a malevolent [[warlord]] who is responsible for the slaying of Conan's parents and the genocide of his people. Later, Thulsa Doom becomes a cult leader of a [[religion]] that worships Set, a Snake God. The vengeful Conan, the [[Archery|archer]] Subotai and the [[thief]] Valeria set out on a quest to rescue a princess held captive by Thulsa Doom. The film was directed by John Milius and produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]]. The character of Conan was played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and was his break-through role as an actor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Ephraim |authorlink= |title=Film Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |location= |isbn=978-0-06-074214-0}}</ref>\n\nThis film was followed by a less popular sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' in 1984.<ref name=\"tessay\">{{cite news|first=Clark |last=Collis |title=Empire Essay: The Terminator |url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |work=Empire magazine |accessdate=2007-04-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235924/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> This sequel was a more typical [[fantasy]]-genre film and was even less faithful to Howard's Conan stories, being just a [[picaresque]] story of an assorted bunch of adventurers.\n\nThe third film in the ''Conan'' trilogy was planned for 1987 to be titled ''Conan the Conqueror''. The director was to be either [[Guy Hamilton]] or [[John Guillermin]]. Since Arnold Schwarzenegger was committed to the film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and De Laurentiis's contract with the star had expired after his obligation to ''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]'' and ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'', he wasn't keen to negotiate a new one; thus the third Conan film sank into [[development hell]].

The series involved Conan chasing [[Serpent Men]] across the world in an attempt to release his parents from eternal imprisonment as living statues.\n** '''''[[Conan and the Young Warriors]]''''' is an animated television series that premiered in 1994 and ran for 13 episodes. [[DiC Entertainment]] produced the show and [[CBS]] aired this series as a spin-off to the previous animated series. This cartoon took place after the finale of ''Conan the Adventurer'' with Wrath-Amon vanquished and Conan's family returned to life from living stone. Conan soon finds that the family of one of his friends are being turned into wolves by an evil sorceress and he must train three warriors in order to aid him in rescuing them.\n* '''[[Conan the Adventurer (1997 TV series)|''Conan the Adventurer'']]''' is a [[live-action]] television series that premiered on September 22, 1997, and ran for 22 episodes. It starred German bodybuilder [[Ralf M\u00f6ller]] as Conan and [[Danny Woodburn]] as his sidekick Otli. The storyline was quite different from the Conan lore of Howard. In this adaptation, Conan is a pleasant and jovial person. Also in this version, Conan is not a loner but one member of a merry band of adventurers.\n* In February 2018, Deadline reported that a new Conan TV series was in the works at [[Amazon Prime]] with [[Ryan Condal]], [[Miguel Sapochnik]], [[Warren Littlefield]], [[Pathfinder Media]] and [[Endeavor Content]] working on the project.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/amazon-developing-conan-drama-based-robert-e-howard-books-colony-co-creator-1202278547/|title=Conan the Barbarian TV Series In Works At Amazon From Ryan Condal, Miguel Sapochnik & Warren Littlefield|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 5, 2018|work=Deadline Hollywood}}</ref>\n\n===Comics===\n{{main|Conan (comics)}}\n{{See also|Conan (Marvel Comics)||Conan (Dark Horse Comics)}}\nConan the Barbarian has appeared in comics nearly non-stop since 1970.

Marvel Comics launched ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1970\u20131993) and the classic ''[[Savage Sword of Conan]]'' (1974\u20131995). Dark Horse launched their ''[[Conan The Legend|Conan]]'' series in 2003. Dark Horse Comics is currently publishing compilations of the 1970s Marvel Comics series in [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] format.\n\n[[Barack Obama]], former President of the United States, is a collector of Conan the Barbarian comic books and a big fan of the character<ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Swaine |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/3401168/Barack-Obama-The-50-facts-you-might-not-know.html |title=Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=7 November 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2008 |location=London}}</ref> and appeared [[Barack Obama in comics|as a character]] in a comic book called ''[[Barack the Barbarian]]'' from [[Devil's Due Publishing|Devil's Due]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Mail Foreign Service |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1168213/Barack-Barbarian-takes-scantily-clad-nemesis-Sarah-Palin-new-comic-superhero-role.html |title=Meet Barack the Barbarian taking on scantily clad nemesis Sarah Palin in new comic superhero role |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=7 August 2009 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Spillius |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/5120374/Barack-Obama-and-Sarah-Palin-appear-in-comic-series.html |title=Barack Obama and Sarah Palin appear in comic series |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=26 November 2009 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/08/obama-comic-palin |title=Obama battles Red Sarah in comic clash |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 April 2009 |accessdate=26 November 2009 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n[[Marvel Comics]] introduced a relatively lore-faithful version of Conan the Barbarian in 1970 with ''Conan the Barbarian'', written by [[Roy Thomas]] and illustrated by [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]. Smith was succeeded by [[penciller]] [[John Buscema]], while Thomas continued to write for many years. Later writers included [[J.M. DeMatteis]], [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]], [[Michael Fleisher]], [[Doug Moench]], [[Jim Owsley]], [[Alan Zelenetz]], [[Chuck Dixon]] and Don Kraar. In 1974, ''Conan the Barbarian'' series spawned the more adult-oriented, black-and-white comics magazine ''Savage Sword of Conan'', written by Thomas with art mostly by Buscema or [[Alfredo Alcala]]. Marvel also published several [[graphic novels]] starring the character {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}, and a [[Official Handbook of the Conan Universe|handbook]] with detailed information about the Hyborian world. Conan the Barbarian is also officially considered to be part of the larger [[Marvel Universe]] and has interacted with heroes and villains alike.\n\nThe Marvel Conan stories were also adapted as a newspaper [[comic strip]] which appeared daily and Sunday from 4&nbsp;September 1978 to 12&nbsp;April 1981. Originally written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by John Buscema, the strip was continued by several different Marvel artists and writers.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics]] began their comic adaptation of the Conan saga in 2003. Entitled simply ''Conan'', the series was first written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and pencilled by [[Cary Nord]]. [[Tim Truman]] replaced Busiek when Busiek signed an exclusive contract with [[DC Comics]]; however, Busiek issues were sometimes used for filler. This series is an interpretation of the original Conan material by Robert E. Howard with no connection whatsoever to the earlier Marvel comics or any Conan story not written or envisioned by Howard supplemented by wholly original material.\n\nA second series, ''[[Conan the Cimmerian (comics)|Conan the Cimmerian]]'' was released in 2008 by [[Tim Truman]] (writer) and [[Tom\u00e1s Giorello]] (artist).  The series ran for twenty-six issues, including an introductory \"zero\" issue.\n\nDark Horse's third series, ''[[Conan: Road of Kings]]'', began in December 2010 by [[Roy Thomas]] (writer) and [[Mike Hawthorne]] (artist) and ran for twelve issues.\n\nA fourth series, ''Conan the Barbarian'', began in February 2012 by [[Brian Wood (comic creator)|Brian Wood]] (writer) and [[Becky Cloonan]] (artist).  It ran for twenty-five issues, and expanded on Robert E. Howard's ''[[Queen of the Black Coast]]''.\n\nA fifth series, ''Conan the Avenger'', began in April 2014 by [[Fred Van Lente]] (writer) and [[Brian Ching]] (artist). It ran for twenty-five issues, and expanded on Robert E. Howard's [[The Snout in the Dark]] and [[A Witch Shall Be Born]].\n\nDark Horse's sixth series, ''Conan the Slayer'', began in July 2016 by [[Cullen Bunn]] (writer) and Sergio D\u00e1vila (artist).\n\nIn 2018, Marvel reacquired the rights and started new runs of both Conan the Barbarian and Savage Sword of Conan in January/February 2019.\n\n===Games===\n{{See also|List of games based on Conan the Barbarian}}\n\n====Board games====\n* In 2009, [[Fantasy Flight Games]] released the ''Age of Conan'' strategy board game, depicting warfare between the Hyborian nations in the Conan's adventures.\n* In 2016, Monolith Board Games LLC will release a new boardgame with miniatures directly based on Howard's short stories.

The character was created by writer [[Robert E. Howard]] in 1932 for a series of fantasy stories published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine.\n\n==Publication history==\nConan the Barbarian was created by Robert E. Howard in a series of fantasy stories published in ''Weird Tales'' in 1932.<ref>Herron (1984). p. 149: \"Robert E. Howard of Cross Plains, Texas, created one of the great mythic figures in modern popular culture, the Dark Barbarian... [which] put Howard in the select ranks of the literary legend-makers\"</ref> For months, Howard had been in search of a new character to market to the burgeoning pulp outlets of the early 1930s. In October 1931, he submitted the short story \"People of the Dark\" to Clayton Publications' new magazine, ''[[Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror]]'' (June 1932). \"People of the Dark\" is a remembrance story of \"[[past lives]]\", and in its first-person narrative the protagonist describes one of his previous incarnations; Conan is a black-haired [[barbarian]] hero who swears by a deity called [[Crom (fictional deity)|Crom]]. Some Howard scholars believe this Conan to be a forerunner of the more famous character.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\">Louinet, pp. 429-453</ref>\n\nIn February 1932, Howard vacationed at a border town on the lower [[Rio Grande]]. During this trip, he further conceived the character of Conan and also wrote the poem \"[[Cimmeria (poem)|Cimmeria]]\", much of which echoes specific passages in [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]''.<ref>\"Hyborean Genesis: Notes on the Creation of the Conan Stories\", by Patrice Louinet; in [https://books.google.com/books?id=mTFV7Q5Nd4IC The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian], by Robert Ervin Howard, Del Rey/Ballantine Books, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mTFV7Q5Nd4IC&pg=PA424&dq=howard%20conan%201932%20rio%20grande%20cimmeria#v=onepage p. 424]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SRDUAAAAQBAJ Conversations with Texas Writers], by Frances Leonard and Ramona Cearley, University of Texas Press, 1 Jan 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRDUAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT217&dq=howard%20conan%201932%20rio%20grande%20cimmeria#v=onepage p. 217]</ref> According to some scholars, Howard's conception of Conan and the [[Hyborian Age]] may have originated in [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Thomas Bulfinch|The Outline of Mythology]]'' (1913) which inspired Howard to \"coalesce into a coherent whole his literary aspirations and the strong physical, autobiographical elements underlying the creation of Conan\".<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nHaving digested these prior influences after he returned from his trip, Howard rewrote a rejected story, \"[[By This Axe I Rule!]]\" (May 1929), replacing his existing character [[Kull of Atlantis]] with his new hero, and retitling it \"[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]\". Howard also wrote \"[[The Scarlet Citadel]]\" and \"[[The Frost-Giant's Daughter]]\", inspired by the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of [[Daphne]],{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and submitted both stories to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. Although \"[[The Frost-Giant's Daughter]]\" was rejected, the magazine accepted \"The Phoenix on the Sword\" after it received the requested polishing, and published it in the December 1932 issue. \"The Scarlet Citadel\" was published the following month. .<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\n\"The Phoenix on the Sword\" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' [[cover-date]]d December&nbsp;1932. Editor [[Farnsworth Wright]] subsequently prompted Howard to write an 8,000-word essay for personal use detailing \"the [[Hyborian Age]]\", the fictional setting for Conan. Using this essay as his guideline, Howard began plotting \"[[The Tower of the Elephant]]\", a new Conan story that was the first to truly integrate his new conception of the Hyborian world.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nThe publication and success of \"The Tower of the Elephant\" spurred Howard to write many more Conan stories for ''Weird Tales''. By the time of Howard's suicide in 1936, he had written 21&nbsp;complete stories, 17&nbsp;of&nbsp;which had been published, as well as a number of unfinished fragments.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nFollowing Howard's death, the copyright of the Conan stories passed through several hands.  Eventually, under the guidance of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]], the stories were edited, revised, and sometimes rewritten. For roughly 40 years, the original versions of Howard's Conan stories remained out of print. In 1977, the publisher Berkley Books issued three volumes using the earliest published form of the texts from ''Weird Tales'',{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} but these failed to displace the edited versions. In the 1980s and 1990s, the copyright holders of the Conan franchise permitted Howard's stories to go out of print entirely,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} while continuing to sell Conan works by other authors.\n\nIn 2000, the British publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz Science Fiction]] issued a two-volume, complete edition of Howard's Conan stories as part of its Fantasy Masterworks imprint, which included several stories that had never seen print in their original form.

It published hardcover editions in England, which were republished in the United States by the Del Rey imprint of [[Ballantine Books]]. The first book, ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932&ndash;1933)'' (2003; published in the US as ''[[The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian]]'') includes Howard's notes on his fictional setting, as well as letters and poems concerning the genesis of his ideas. This was followed by ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume Two (1934)'' (2004; published in the US as ''[[The Bloody Crown of Conan]]'') and ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume Three (1935&ndash;1936)'' (2005; published in the US as ''[[The Conquering Sword of Conan]]''). These three volumes combined include all of the original, unedited Conan stories.\n\n==Setting==\n{{main|Hyborian Age}}\n\nThe various stories of '''Conan the Barbarian''' occur in the pseudo-historical \"[[Hyborian Age]]\", set after the destruction of [[Atlantis]] and before the rise of any known [[Ancient history|ancient civilization]]. This is a specific epoch in a fictional timeline created by Howard for many of the [[low fantasy]] tales of his [[artificial mythology|artificial legendary]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525135846/http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm | archivedate=25 May 2011|title=The Hyborian Age|author=Howard, Robert E., adapted by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Walt Simonson]]|journal=Conan Saga |issue= 50\u201354, 56|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe reasons behind the invention of the Hyborian Age were perhaps commercial: Howard had an intense love for history and historical dramas; however, at the same time, he recognized the difficulties and the time-consuming research work needed in maintaining historical accuracy\u2014and moreover, the poorly-stocked libraries in the rural part of Texas where Howard lived just didn't have the material needed for such historical research. By conceiving a timeless setting\u2014\"a ''vanished'' age\"\u2014and by carefully choosing names that resembled human history, Howard shrewdly avoided the problem of historical anachronisms and  his need for lengthy exposition.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nAccording to \"The Phoenix on the Sword\", the adventures of Conan take place \"Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the [[Aryan|Sons of Aryas]].\"<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=Robert E.

From the writings of Robert E. Howard ([[The Hyborian Age]] among others) it is known that his Cimmerians are based on the [[Celts]] or perhaps the historic [[Cimmerians]], based on the described geography and the existence of said people. He was born on a battlefield and is the son of a village [[blacksmith]]. Conan matured quickly as a youth and, by age fifteen, he was already a respected [[warrior]] who had participated in the destruction of the [[Aquilonia (Conan)|Aquilonian]] fortress of Venarium.<ref>''Conan the Warrior'' (1935): \"[[Beyond the Black River]]\"</ref> After its demise, he was struck by wanderlust and began the adventures chronicled by Howard, encountering skulking monsters, evil [[Magicians in fantasy|wizard]]s, tavern wenches, and beautiful [[princess]]es. He roamed throughout the [[Hyborian Age]] nations as a [[thief]], [[outlaw]], [[mercenary]], and [[pirate]].<ref>''Conan the Cimmerian'': \"[[Queen of the Black Coast]]\" (1934)</ref> As he grew older, he began commanding vast units of warriors and escalating his ambitions. In his forties, he seized the crown from the tyrannical [[monarch|king]] of Aquilonia, the most powerful kingdom of the Hyborian Age, having strangled the previous ruler on the steps of his own throne.<ref>''Conan the Cimmerian'': \"[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]\" (1932)</ref> Conan's adventures often result in him performing heroic feats, though his motivation for doing so is largely to protect his own survival or for personal gain.\n\nA conspicuous element of Conan's character is his [[chivalry]]. He is extremely reluctant to fight women (even when they fight him) and has a strong tendency to save a [[damsels in distress]]. In \"[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]\", he has to make a split-second decision whether to save the dancing girl Muriela or the chest of priceless gems which he spent months in search of. So, without hesitation, he rescues Muriela and allows for the treasure to be irrevocably lost. In \"[[The Black Stranger]]\", Conan saves the exile Zingaran Lady Belesa at considerable risk to himself, giving her as a parting gift his fortune in gems big enough to have a comfortable and wealthy life in Zingara, while asking for no sexual favors in return. Reviewer Jennifer Bard also noted<ref>Dr. Jennifer Agatha Bard, \"Gender Roles in Science Fiction and Fantasy\", Bulletin of Gender Equality, Summer 1986.</ref> that when Conan is in a pirate crew or a robber gang led by another male, his tendency is to subvert and undermine the leader's authority, and eventually supplant (and often, kill) him (e.g. \"[[The Pool of the Black One|Pool of the Black One]]\", \"[[A Witch Shall be Born]]\", \"[[Shadows in the Moonlight (story)|Shadows in the Moonlight]]\"). Conversely, in \"[[Queen of the Black Coast]]\", it is noted that Conan \"generally agreed to Belit's plan. Hers was the mind that directed their raids, his the arm that carried out her ideas. It was a good life.\" And at the end of \"[[Red Nails]]\", Conan and Valeria seem to be headed towards a reasonably amicable piratical partnership.\n\nGeorge Baxter noted that \"Conan's recorded history mentions him as being prominently involved, at one time or another, with four different pirate fraternities, on two different seas, as well being a noted leader of land robbers at three different locales. Yet, we hardly ever see him involved in, well, robbing people. To be sure, he speaks about it often and with complete candor: \"We [[Cossack|Kozaks]] took to plundering the outlying dominions of Koth, Zamora, and Turan impartially\" he says in \"[[Shadows in the Moonlight (story)|Shadows in the Moonlight]]\". But that was ''before'' the story began. And \"We're bound for waters where the seaports are fat, and the merchant ships are crammed with plunder!\" Conan declares at the end of \"[[The Pool of the Black One]]\". But this plundering will take place ''after'' the story ends. When we see Conan onstage, we see him do many other things: he intervenes in the politics and dynastic struggles of various kingdoms; he hunts for hidden treasure; he explores desert islands and lost cities; he fights countless terrible monsters and evil sorcerers; he saves countless beautiful women and makes them fall in love with him... What we virtually never see Conan do is engage in the proper business of an armed robber, on land or by sea\u2014which is to attack people who never threatened or provoked you, take away their possessions by main force, and run your sword through them if they dare to resist. A bit messy business, that. Armchair adventurers, who like to enjoy a good yarn in the perfect safety and comfort of their suburban homes, might not have liked to read it.\"<ref>George Xavier Baxter, \"Heroic Fantasy and Mundane Reality\", in Winifred Stromberg (ed.) \"Multi-Diciplinary Round Table on Twentieth Century Popular Culture\"</ref>\n\n===Appearance===\n{{Quote box\n|quote = Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet.\" |source = [[Robert E. Howard]], ''[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]'', 1932.|width = 40%|bgcolor =}}\nConan has \"sullen\", \"smoldering\", and \"volcanic\" blue eyes with a black \"square-cut mane\". Howard once describes him as having a hairy chest and, while comic book interpretations often portray Conan as wearing a loincloth or other minimalist clothing to give him a more barbaric image, Howard describes the character as wearing whatever garb is typical for the kingdom and culture in which Conan finds himself. Howard never gave a strict height or weight for Conan in a story, only describing him in loose terms like \"giant\" and \"massive\".<ref>Howard, Robert E. \"[[A Witch Shall Be Born]]\": \"the man was almost a giant in stature\"; \"Knots and bunches of muscle started out of the massive arms\".</ref> In the tales, no human is ever described as being stronger than Conan, although several are mentioned as taller (such as the strangler Baal-pteor) or of larger bulk. In a letter to [[P. Schuyler Miller]] and [[John Drury Clark|John D. Clark]] in 1936, only three months before Howard's death, Conan is described as standing 6&nbsp;ft/183&nbsp;cm and weighing {{convert|180|lb}} when he takes part in an attack on Venarium at only 14 years old, though being far from fully grown. Conan himself says in \"[[Beyond the Black River]]\" that he had \"...not yet seen 15 snows\".\n[[File:ConanCreepsLarge.png|alt=Conan|thumb|Typical depiction of Conan the Barbarian (this drawing is a study of Henrik Sahlstrom\u00b4s Conan artwork)]]\n\nAlthough Conan is muscular, Howard frequently compares his agility and way of moving to that of a panther (see, for instance, \"[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]\", \"[[Beyond the Black River]]\", or \"[[Rogues in the House]]\"). His skin is frequently characterized as bronzed from constant exposure to the sun. In his younger years, he is often depicted wearing a light [[Chainmail|chain]] shirt and a horned helmet, though appearances vary with different stories.\n\nDuring his reign as king of Aquilonia, Conan was\n::... a tall man, mightily shouldered and deep of chest, with a massive corded neck and heavily muscled limbs. He was clad in silk and velvet, with the royal lions of Aquilonia worked in gold upon his rich jupon, and the crown of Aquilonia shone on his square-cut black mane; but the great sword at his side seemed more natural to him than the regal accoutrements. His brow was low and broad, his eyes a volcanic blue that smoldered as if with some inner fire. His dark, scarred, almost sinister face was that of a fighting-man, and his velvet garments could not conceal the hard, dangerous lines of his limbs.<ref>Howard, Robert E. Howard ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]'', reprinted ''The Bloody Crown of Conan'', pp. 89-90</ref>\n\nHoward [[Cimmeria (Conan)|imagined the Cimmerians]] as a [[pre-Celtic]] people with mostly black hair and blue or grey eyes. Ethnically, the [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerians to which Conan belongs]] are descendants of the [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], though they do not remember their ancestry. In his fictional historical essay \"[[The Hyborian Age]]\", Howard describes how the people of Atlantis\u2014the land where his character [[King Kull]] originated\u2014had to move east after a great cataclysm changed the face of the world and sank their island, settling where [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] would eventually be located. Thus they are (in Howard's work) the ancestors of the Irish and Scottish (the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Gaels]]) and not the [[Picts]], the other ancestor of modern Scots who also appear in Howard's work. In the same work, Howard also described how the [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerians]] eventually moved south and east after the [[The Hyborian Age|age of Conan]] (presumably in the vicinity of the [[Black Sea]], where the [[Cimmerian|historical Cimmerians]] dwelt).\n\n===Abilities===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\nDespite his brutish appearance, Conan uses his brains as well as his brawn. The [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerian]] is a highly skilled warrior, possibly without peer with a sword, but his travels have given him vast experience in other trades, especially as a [[Thief (character class)|thief]]. He's also a talented commander, tactician, and strategist, as well as a born leader. In addition, Conan has advanced knowledge of languages and codes and is able to recognize, or even decipher, certain ancient or secret signs and writings. For example, in \"[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]\" Howard states: \"In his roaming about the world the giant adventurer had picked up a wide smattering of knowledge, particularly including the speaking and reading of many alien tongues. Many a sheltered scholar would have been astonished at the Cimmerian's linguistic abilities.\" He also has incredible stamina, enabling him to go without sleep for a few days. In \"[[A Witch Shall be Born]]\", Conan fights armed men until he is overwhelmed, captured, and [[crucifixion|crucified]], before going an entire night and day without water. However, Conan still possesses the strength to pull the nails from his feet, while hoisting himself into a horse's saddle and riding for ten miles.\n\nAnother noticeable trait is his sense of humor, largely absent in the comics and movies, but very much a part of Howard's original vision of the character (particularly apparent in \"[[Xuthal of the Dusk]]\", also known as \"The Slithering Shadow.\") His sense of humor can also be rather grimly ironic, as was demonstrated by how he unleashes his own version of justice on the treacherous\u2014and ill-fated\u2014innkeeper Aram Baksh in \"[[Shadows in Zamboula]]\".\n\nHe is a loyal friend to those true to him, with a barbaric code of conduct that often marks him as more honorable than the more sophisticated people he meets in his travels. Indeed, his straightforward nature and barbarism are constants in all the tales.\n\nConan is a formidable combatant both armed and unarmed. With his back to the wall, Conan is capable of engaging and killing opponents by the score. This is seen in several stories, such as \"[[Queen of the Black Coast]]\", \"[[The Scarlet Citadel]]\", and \"[[A Witch Shall Be Born]]\". Conan is not superhuman, though; he needed the providential help of Zelata's wolf to defeat four Nemedian soldiers in Howard's novel ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]''. Some of his hardest victories have come from fighting single opponents of inhuman strength: one such as Thak, an ape-like humanoid from \"[[Rogues in the House]]\", or the strangler Baal-Pteor in \"Shadows in Zamboula\". Conan is far from untouchable and has been captured or defeated several times (on one occasion, knocking himself out drunkenly after running into a wall).\n\n===Influences===\n{{main|Robert E. Howard}}\nHoward frequently corresponded with [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and the two would sometimes insert references or elements of each other's settings in their works. Later editors reworked many of the original Conan stories by Howard, thus diluting this connection. Nevertheless, many of Howard's unedited Conan stories are arguably part of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].<ref>Louinet, p. 436</ref> Additionally, many of the Conan stories by Howard, de Camp, and Carter used geographical place names from [[Clark Ashton Smith]]'s [[Hyperborean Cycle]].\n\n==Original Robert E.

Sprague de Camp]], [[Roland J. Green]], [[John C. Hocking]], [[Robert Jordan]], [[Sean A. Moore]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Nyberg]], [[Andrew J. Offutt]], [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]], [[John Maddox Roberts]], [[Harry Turtledove]], and [[Karl Edward Wagner]]. Some of these writers have finished incomplete Conan manuscripts by Howard. Others were created by rewriting Howard stories which originally featured entirely different characters from entirely different milieus. Most, however, are completely original works. In total, more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories featuring the Conan character have been written by authors other than Howard.\n\nThe [[Conan (books)#Gnome Press editions, 1950-1957|Gnome Press edition]] (1950\u20131957) was the first hardcover collection of Howard's Conan stories, including all the original Howard material known to exist at the time, some left unpublished in his lifetime. The later volumes contain some stories rewritten by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] (like \"[[The Treasure of Tranicos]]\"), including several non-Conan Howard stories, mostly historical exotica situated in the [[Levant]] at the time of the [[Crusades]], which he turned into Conan yarns. The Gnome edition also issued the first Conan story written by an author other than Howard\u2014the final volume published, which is by [[Bj\u00f6rn Nyberg]] and revised by de Camp.\n\nThe [[Conan (books)#Lancer/Ace paperback editions, 1966-1977|Lancer/Ace editions]] (1966\u20131977), under the direction of [[L. Sprague de Camp|de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]], were the first comprehensive paperbacks, compiling the material from the Gnome Press series together in chronological order with all the remaining original Howard material, including that left unpublished in his lifetime and fragments and outlines. These were completed by de Camp and Carter. The series also included Howard stories originally featuring other protagonists that were rewritten by de Camp as Conan stories. New Conan stories written entirely by de Camp and Carter were added as well. Lancer Books went out of business before bringing out the entire series, the publication of which was completed by Ace Books. Eight of the eventual twelve volumes published featured dynamic cover paintings by [[Frank Frazetta]] that, for many fans,{{who|date=December 2017}} presented the definitive, iconic impression of Conan and his world. For decades to come, most other portrayals of the Cimmerian and his imitators were heavily influenced by the cover paintings of this series.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nMost editions after the Lancer/Ace series have been of either the original Howard stories or Conan material by others, but not both. The exception are the [[Conan (books)#Ace Maroto editions, 1978-1981|Ace Maroto editions]] (1978&ndash;1981), which include both new material by other authors and older material by Howard, though the latter are some of the non-Conan tales rewritten as Conan stories by de Camp. Notable later editions of the original Howard Conan stories include the [[Conan (books)#Donald M. Grant editions, 1974-1989|Donald M. Grant editions]] (1974&ndash;1989, incomplete); [[Conan (books)#Berkley editions, 1977|Berkley editions]] (1977); [[Conan (books)#Gollancz editions, 2000-2006|Gollancz editions]] (2000\u20132006), and [[Conan (books)#Wandering Star/Del Rey editions, 2003-2005|Wandering Star/Del Rey editions]] (2003\u20132005). Later series of new Conan material include the [[Conan (books)#Bantam editions, 1978-1982|Bantam editions]] (1978&ndash;1982) and [[Conan (books)#Tor editions, 1982-2004|Tor editions]] (1982\u20132004).\n\n==Conan chronologies==\n{{main|Conan chronologies}}\n\nIn an attempt to provide a coherent timeline which fit the numerous adventures of Conan penned by Robert E. Howard and later writers, various \"Conan chronologies\" have been prepared by many people from the 1930s onward. Note that no consistent timeline has yet accommodated every single Conan story. The following are the principal theories that have been advanced over the years.\n* [[Conan chronologies#Miller/Clark/de Camp chronology|Miller/Clark chronology]] \u2013 ''A Probable Outline of Conan's Career'' (1936) was the first effort to put the tales in chronological order. Completed by [[P. Schuyler Miller]] and [[John Drury Clark]], the chronology was later revised by Clark and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] in ''An Informal Biography of Conan the Cimmerian'' (1952).\n* [[Conan chronologies#Robert Jordan chronology|Robert Jordan chronology]] \u2013 ''A Conan Chronology by Robert Jordan'' (1987) was a new chronology written by Conan writer [[Robert Jordan]] that included all written Conan material up to that point. It was heavily influenced by the Miller/Clark/de Camp chronologies, though it departed from them in a number of idiosyncratic instances.\n* [[Conan chronologies#William Galen Gray chronology|William Galen Gray chronology]] \u2013 ''Timeline of Conan's Journeys'' (1997, rev.&nbsp;2004), was fan William Galen Gray's attempt to create \"a chronology of all the stories, both Howard and pastiche.\" Drawing on the earlier Miller/Clark and Jordan chronologies, it represents the ultimate expression of their tradition to date.\n* [[Conan chronologies#Joe Marek chronology|Joe Marek chronology]] \u2013 Joe Marek's chronology is limited to stories written (or devised) by Howard, though within that context it is essentially a revision of the Miller/Clark tradition to better reflect the internal evidence of the stories and avoid forcing Conan into what he perceives as a \"mad dash\" around the Hyborian world within timeframes too rapid to be credible.\n* [[Conan chronologies#Dale Rippke chronology|Dale Rippke chronology]] \u2013 ''The Darkstorm Conan Chronology'' (2003) was a completely revised and heavily researched chronology, radically repositioning a number of stories and including only those stories written or devised by Howard. The [[Conan (Dark Horse comic)|Dark Horse comic series]] follows this chronology.\n\n==Media==\n{{See also|Adaptations of works by Robert E. Howard}}\n\n===Films===\n<!-- Please do not include overviews of the Kull or Red Sonja films as such data belongs on their respective articles. -->\n\n====''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982) and ''Conan the Destroyer'' (1984)====\n{{main|Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Destroyer}}\n\nThe very first Conan cinematic project was planned by [[Edward Summer]]. Summer envisioned a series of Conan films, much like the [[James Bond]] franchise. He outlined six stories for this film series, but none were ever made. An original screenplay by Summer and [[Roy Thomas]] was written, but their lore-authentic screen story was never filmed. However, the resulting film, ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982), was a combination of director [[John Milius]]' ideas and plots from Conan stories (written also by Howard's successors, notably [[Lin Carter]] and [[L. Sprague de Camp]]). The addition of [[Nietzschean]] motto and Conan's life philosophy were crucial for bringing the spirit of Howard's literature to the screen.\n\nThe plot of ''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982) begins with Conan being enslaved by the Vanir raiders of [[Thulsa Doom (character)|Thulsa Doom]], a malevolent [[warlord]] who is responsible for the slaying of Conan's parents and the genocide of his people. Later, Thulsa Doom becomes a cult leader of a [[religion]] that worships Set, a Snake God. The vengeful Conan, the [[Archery|archer]] Subotai and the [[thief]] Valeria set out on a quest to rescue a princess held captive by Thulsa Doom. The film was directed by John Milius and produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]]. The character of Conan was played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and was his break-through role as an actor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Ephraim |authorlink= |title=Film Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |location= |isbn=978-0-06-074214-0}}</ref>\n\nThis film was followed by a less popular sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' in 1984.<ref name=\"tessay\">{{cite news|first=Clark |last=Collis |title=Empire Essay: The Terminator |url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |work=Empire magazine |accessdate=2007-04-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235924/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> This sequel was a more typical [[fantasy]]-genre film and was even less faithful to Howard's Conan stories, being just a [[picaresque]] story of an assorted bunch of adventurers.\n\nThe third film in the ''Conan'' trilogy was planned for 1987 to be titled ''Conan the Conqueror''. The director was to be either [[Guy Hamilton]] or [[John Guillermin]]. Since Arnold Schwarzenegger was committed to the film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and De Laurentiis's contract with the star had expired after his obligation to ''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]'' and ''[[Raw Deal (1986 film)|Raw Deal]]'', he wasn't keen to negotiate a new one; thus the third Conan film sank into [[development hell]].

The series involved Conan chasing [[Serpent Men]] across the world in an attempt to release his parents from eternal imprisonment as living statues.\n** '''''[[Conan and the Young Warriors]]''''' is an animated television series that premiered in 1994 and ran for 13 episodes. [[DiC Entertainment]] produced the show and [[CBS]] aired this series as a spin-off to the previous animated series. This cartoon took place after the finale of ''Conan the Adventurer'' with Wrath-Amon vanquished and Conan's family returned to life from living stone. Conan soon finds that the family of one of his friends are being turned into wolves by an evil sorceress and he must train three warriors in order to aid him in rescuing them.\n* '''[[Conan the Adventurer (1997 TV series)|''Conan the Adventurer'']]''' is a [[live-action]] television series that premiered on September 22, 1997, and ran for 22 episodes. It starred German bodybuilder [[Ralf M\u00f6ller]] as Conan and [[Danny Woodburn]] as his sidekick Otli. The storyline was quite different from the Conan lore of Howard. In this adaptation, Conan is a pleasant and jovial person. Also in this version, Conan is not a loner but one member of a merry band of adventurers.\n* In February 2018, Deadline reported that a new Conan TV series was in the works at [[Amazon Prime]] with [[Ryan Condal]], [[Miguel Sapochnik]], [[Warren Littlefield]], [[Pathfinder Media]] and [[Endeavor Content]] working on the project.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/amazon-developing-conan-drama-based-robert-e-howard-books-colony-co-creator-1202278547/|title=Conan the Barbarian TV Series In Works At Amazon From Ryan Condal, Miguel Sapochnik & Warren Littlefield|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 5, 2018|work=Deadline Hollywood}}</ref>\n\n===Comics===\n{{main|Conan (comics)}}\n{{See also|Conan (Marvel Comics)||Conan (Dark Horse Comics)}}\nConan the Barbarian has appeared in comics nearly non-stop since 1970.

Smith was succeeded by [[penciller]] [[John Buscema]], while Thomas continued to write for many years. Later writers included [[J.M. DeMatteis]], [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]], [[Michael Fleisher]], [[Doug Moench]], [[Jim Owsley]], [[Alan Zelenetz]], [[Chuck Dixon]] and Don Kraar. In 1974, ''Conan the Barbarian'' series spawned the more adult-oriented, black-and-white comics magazine ''Savage Sword of Conan'', written by Thomas with art mostly by Buscema or [[Alfredo Alcala]]. Marvel also published several [[graphic novels]] starring the character {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}, and a [[Official Handbook of the Conan Universe|handbook]] with detailed information about the Hyborian world. Conan the Barbarian is also officially considered to be part of the larger [[Marvel Universe]] and has interacted with heroes and villains alike.\n\nThe Marvel Conan stories were also adapted as a newspaper [[comic strip]] which appeared daily and Sunday from 4&nbsp;September 1978 to 12&nbsp;April 1981. Originally written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by John Buscema, the strip was continued by several different Marvel artists and writers.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics]] began their comic adaptation of the Conan saga in 2003. Entitled simply ''Conan'', the series was first written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and pencilled by [[Cary Nord]]. [[Tim Truman]] replaced Busiek when Busiek signed an exclusive contract with [[DC Comics]]; however, Busiek issues were sometimes used for filler. This series is an interpretation of the original Conan material by Robert E. Howard with no connection whatsoever to the earlier Marvel comics or any Conan story not written or envisioned by Howard supplemented by wholly original material.\n\nA second series, ''[[Conan the Cimmerian (comics)|Conan the Cimmerian]]'' was released in 2008 by [[Tim Truman]] (writer) and [[Tom\u00e1s Giorello]] (artist).  The series ran for twenty-six issues, including an introductory \"zero\" issue.\n\nDark Horse's third series, ''[[Conan: Road of Kings]]'', began in December 2010 by [[Roy Thomas]] (writer) and [[Mike Hawthorne]] (artist) and ran for twelve issues.\n\nA fourth series, ''Conan the Barbarian'', began in February 2012 by [[Brian Wood (comic creator)|Brian Wood]] (writer) and [[Becky Cloonan]] (artist).  It ran for twenty-five issues, and expanded on Robert E. Howard's ''[[Queen of the Black Coast]]''.\n\nA fifth series, ''Conan the Avenger'', began in April 2014 by [[Fred Van Lente]] (writer) and [[Brian Ching]] (artist). It ran for twenty-five issues, and expanded on Robert E. Howard's [[The Snout in the Dark]] and [[A Witch Shall Be Born]].\n\nDark Horse's sixth series, ''Conan the Slayer'', began in July 2016 by [[Cullen Bunn]] (writer) and Sergio D\u00e1vila (artist).\n\nIn 2018, Marvel reacquired the rights and started new runs of both Conan the Barbarian and Savage Sword of Conan in January/February 2019.\n\n===Games===\n{{See also|List of games based on Conan the Barbarian}}\n\n====Board games====\n* In 2009, [[Fantasy Flight Games]] released the ''Age of Conan'' strategy board game, depicting warfare between the Hyborian nations in the Conan's adventures.\n* In 2016, Monolith Board Games LLC will release a new boardgame with miniatures directly based on Howard's short stories.

The game ran the [[OGL System]] of rules that Mongoose established for its ''OGL series'' of games:\n* ''[[Conan: The Roleplaying Game]]'' (2004), with many supplements.\n\nIn 2010 Mongoose Publishing dropped the Conan license.

When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros.

Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

|url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/108/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |page=108}}</ref>\n\nThe series contained the following two segments:\n\n*''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (a revival of ''The Flintstones'') \u2013 one episode, 30 minutes\n*''The Thing'' (based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]) \u2013 two episodes, 11 minutes each\n \nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8, [[Ant-Man]] and [[Dragon Man]] give pink-haired rock star turned reluctant superhero Darla Deering her own Thing Rings to summon Ben Grimm's old rocky Thing-bodied [[powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]]

{"title_page": "Solar cooker", "text_new": "[[File:Solar funnel cooker with hot dogs.jpg|thumb|300px|Hot dogs being cooked with a solar funnel cooker]]\n\nA '''solar cooker''' is a device which uses the energy of direct sunlight to heat, cook or [[pasteurize]] drink and other food materials. Many solar cookers currently in use are relatively inexpensive, [[low-tech]] devices, although some are as powerful or as expensive as traditional stoves,<ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Cookers: Varieties and Styles|url=http://www.solarcooker-at-cantinawest.com/solarcookers-types.html|publisher=CantinaWest|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref> and advanced, large-scale solar cookers can cook for hundreds of people.<ref>{{cite web|title=World's Largest 38500-meal Solar Kitchen in India|url=http://inhabitat.com/world%E2%80%99s-largest-solar-kitchen-in-india-can-cook-upto-38500-meals-per-day/|publisher=inhabitat|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref> Because they use no fuel and cost nothing to operate, many nonprofit organizations are promoting their use worldwide in order to help reduce fuel costs (especially where monetary reciprocity is low) and air pollution, and to slow down the [[deforestation]] and [[desertification]] caused by gathering firewood for cooking.\n\n== History ==\nThe first academic description of the principles of a solar cooker is by the Swiss geologist, meteorologist, physicist, mountaineer and Alpine explorer [[Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure]], in [[1767]]. The principle of cooking meals from the sun was largely developed in the [[French Foreign Legion]], in the 1870s.<ref>Nichols, C. Alan. [http://solarcooking.org/plans/Cookerbo.pdf THE TRACKING SOLAR COOKER]. solarcooking.org</ref> \n\n==Working Principles ==\n1) Concentrating sunlight: A mirrored surface with high [[specular reflection]] is used to concentrate light from the sun into a small cooking area. Depending on the geometry of the surface, sunlight could  be [[Concentrated solar power|concentrated]] by several orders of magnitude producing temperatures high enough to melt salt and metal. For most household solar cooking applications, such high temperatures are not really required. Solar cooking products are typically designed to achieve temperatures of {{convert|65|C|-1}} (baking temperatures) to {{convert|400|C|-1}} (grilling/searing temperatures) on a sunny day.\n\n2) Converting light energy to heat energy: Solar cookers concentrate sunlight onto a receiver such as a cooking pan. The interaction between the light energy and the receiver material converts light to heat and this is called conduction. This conversion is maximized by using materials that conduct and retain heat. Pots and pans used on solar cookers should be matte black in color to maximize the absorption.\n\n3) Trapping heat energy: It is important to reduce [[convection]] by isolating the air inside the cooker from the air outside the cooker. Simply using a glass lid on your pot enhances light absorption from the top of the pan and provides a [[greenhouse effect]] that improves heat retention and minimizes [[Heat transfer|convection loss]]. This \"glazing\" transmits incoming visible sunlight but is opaque to escaping infrared thermal radiation. In resource constrained settings, a high-temperature plastic bag can serve a similar function, trapping air inside and making it possible to reach temperatures on cold and windy days similar to those possible on hot days.\nBelow is the basic science for solar panel cookers and solar box cookers. Another style of solar cooker is a parabolic solar cooker. They typically require more frequent reorientation to the sun, but will cook more quickly at higher temperatures, and can fry foods. Evacuated tube solar cookers use a highly insulated double-wall glass tube for the cooking chamber, and do not require large reflectors\n\n==Operation ==\n[[File:Solar oven Portugal 2007.jpg|thumb|Solar oven in use]]\n\nDifferent kinds of solar cookers (more than 300 models of solar cooker had been made so far) use somewhat different methods of cooking, but most follow the same basic principles.\n\nFood is prepared as if for an oven or stove top. However, because food cooks faster when it is in smaller pieces, food placed inside a solar cooker is usually cut into smaller pieces than it might otherwise be.<ref name=\"isbn0-8117-3402-1\" /> For example, potatoes are usually cut into bite-sized pieces rather than roasted whole.<ref name=\"isbn0-9629069-2-1\" /> For very simple cooking, such as melting butter or cheese, a lid may not be needed and the food may be placed on an uncovered [[Sheet pan|tray]] or in a bowl. If several foods are to be cooked separately, then they are placed in different containers.\n\nThe container of food is placed inside the solar cooker, which may be elevated on a brick, rock, metal [[trivet]], or other [[heat sink]], and the solar cooker is placed in direct sunlight.<ref name=\"isbn0-8117-3402-1\" /> Foods that cook quickly may be added to the solar cooker later. Rice for a mid-day meal might be started early in the morning, with vegetables, cheese, or soup added to the solar cooker in the middle of the morning. Depending on the size of the solar cooker and the number and quantity of cooked foods, a family may use one or more solar cookers.\n\nA solar oven is turned towards the sun and left until the food is cooked. Unlike cooking on a stove or over a fire, which may require more than an hour of constant supervision, food in a solar oven is generally not stirred or turned over, both because it is unnecessary and because opening the solar oven allows the trapped heat to escape and thereby slows the cooking process. If wanted, the solar oven may be checked every one to two hours, to turn the oven to face the sun more precisely and to ensure that shadows from nearby buildings or plants have not blocked the sunlight. If the food is to be left untended for many hours during the day, then the solar oven is often turned to face the point where the sun will be when it is highest in the sky, instead of towards its current position.<ref name=\"Halacy\" />\n\nThe cooking time depends primarily on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity of food that needs to be cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, it might be possible to melt butter in 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic solar cooker, you may be able to grill a steak in minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.\n\nIt is difficult to burn food in a solar cooker.<ref name=\"isbn0-9629069-2-1\" /> Food that has been cooked even an hour longer than necessary is usually indistinguishable from minimally cooked food. The exception to this rule is some green vegetables, which quickly change from a perfectly cooked bright green to [[olive drab]], while still retaining the desirable texture.\n\nFor most foods, such as rice, the typical person would be unable to tell how it was cooked from looking at the final product. There are some differences, however: Bread and cakes brown on their tops instead of on the bottom. Compared to cooking over a fire, the food does not have a smoky flavor.\n\n== Box and panel designs ==\n[[File:HotPot d.PNG|thumb|left|HotPot panel solar cooker]]\nA box cooker has a transparent glass or plastic top, and it may have additional reflectors to concentrate sunlight into the box. The top can usually be removed to allow dark pots containing food to be placed inside. One or more reflectors of shiny metal or foil-lined material may be positioned to bounce extra light into the interior of the oven chamber. Cooking containers and the inside bottom of the cooker should be dark-colored or black. Inside walls should be reflective to reduce radiative heat loss and bounce the light towards the pots and the dark bottom, which is in contact with the pots. The box should have insulated sides. [[Thermal insulation]] for the solar box cooker must be able to withstand temperatures up to 150&nbsp;\u00b0C (300&nbsp;\u00b0F) without melting or out-gassing. Crumpled newspaper, wool, rags, dry grass, sheets of cardboard, etc. can be used to insulate the walls of the cooker. Metal pots and/or bottom trays can be darkened either with flat-black spray paint (one that is non-toxic when warmed), black [[tempera]] paint, or soot from a fire. The solar box cooker typically reaches a temperature of 150&nbsp;\u00b0C (300&nbsp;\u00b0F). This is not as hot as a standard oven, but still hot enough to cook food over a somewhat longer period of time.\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Cardboard Box and Duct Tape Solar Oven.jpeg|thumb|A Solar Oven made of cardboard, newspapers, and reflective tape]]\nPanel solar cookers are inexpensive solar cookers that use reflective panels to direct sunlight to a cooking pot that is enclosed in a clear plastic bag.\n\nSolar Oven science experiments are regularly done as projects in high schools and colleges, such as the \"Solar Oven Throwdown\" at the [[University of Arizona]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/photos/solar-oven-throwdown-heats-ua-mall|title=Solar Oven Throwdown Heats Up UA Mall|website=UANews|date=October 23, 2013}}</ref> These projects prove that it is possible to both achieve high temperatures, as well as predict the high temperatures using mathematical models.\n\n== Parabolic reflectors ==\n{{Main|parabolic reflector}}\nParabolic solar cookers concentrate sunlight to a single point. When this point is focused on the bottom of a pot, it can heat the pot quickly to very high temperatures which can often be comparable with the temperatures achieved in gas and charcoal grills. These types of solar cookers are widely used in several regions of the world, most notably in China and India where hundreds of thousands of families currently use parabolic solar cookers for preparing food and heating water. Some parabolic solar cooker projects in China abate between 1\u20134 tons of carbon dioxide per year and receive carbon credits through the [http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)] and [http://www.goldstandard.org/ Gold Standard].\n\n[[File:Solar tea kettle.JPG|thumb|Solar tea kettle in Tibet]]\nSome parabolic solar cookers incorporate cutting edge materials and designs which lead to solar energy efficiencies >90%. Others are large enough to feed thousands of people each day, such as the solar bowl at Auroville in India, which makes 2 meals per day for 1,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.auroville.org/research/ren_energy/solar_bowl.htm |title=The solar bowl |date=22 December 2014 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222040320/http://archive.auroville.org/research/ren_energy/solar_bowl.htm |archivedate=22 December 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIf a reflector is axially symmetrical and shaped so its cross-section is a [[parabola]], it has the property of bringing parallel rays of light (such as sunlight) to a point ''[[Focus (optics)|focus]]''. If the axis of symmetry is aimed at the sun, any object that is located at the focus receives highly concentrated sunlight, and therefore becomes very hot. This is the basis for the use of this kind of reflector for solar cooking.\n\n=== Paraboloidal reflectors ===\n[[File:ALSOL.jpg|thumb|left|A parabolic solar cooker with segmented construction .<ref>[http://www.solarcookingatlas.com/solar-cooking-pictures.php Solar cooker pictures] Solar Cooking Atlas official website</ref>]]\n\n[[Paraboloid]]s are [[wikt:compound curve|compound curves]], which are more difficult to make with simple equipment than [[wikt:single curve|single curves]]. Although paraboloidal solar cookers can cook as well as or better than a conventional stove, they are difficult to construct by hand. Frequently, these reflectors are made using many small segments that are all single curves which together approximate compound curves.\n\nAlthough paraboloids are difficult to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be made quite simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally takes the form of a paraboloid. [[Centrifugal force]] causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See [[Liquid-mirror telescope]].) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as [[rotating furnace]]s.\n\nParaboloidal reflectors generate high temperatures and cook quickly, but require frequent adjustment and supervision for safe operation. Several hundred thousand exist, mainly in China.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} They are especially useful for individual household and large-scale institutional cooking.\n\n[[File:Parabole de cuisson solaire Scheffler coccion solar cooking.jpg|thumb|A Scheffler cooker. This reflector has an area of {{convert|16|m2|abbr=on}}, and concentrates 3 kW of heat]]\n\nA Scheffler cooker (named after its inventor, [[Wolfgang Scheffler (inventor)|Wolfgang Scheffler]]) uses a large ideally paraboloidal reflector which is rotated around an axis that is parallel with the earth's using a mechanical mechanism, turning at 15 degrees per hour to compensate for the earth's rotation. The axis passes through the reflector's centre of mass, allowing the reflector to be turned easily. The cooking vessel is located at the focus which is on the axis of rotation, so the mirror concentrates sunlight onto it all day. The mirror has to be occasionally tilted about a perpendicular axis to compensate for the seasonal variation in the sun's [[declination]]. This perpendicular axis does not pass through the cooking vessel. Therefore, if the reflector were a rigid paraboloid, its focus would not remain stationary at the cooking vessel as the reflector tilts. To keep the focus stationary, the reflector's shape has to vary. It remains paraboloidal, but its focal length and other parameters change as it tilts. The Scheffler reflector is therefore flexible, and can be bent to adjust its shape. It is often made up of a large number of small plane sections, such as glass mirrors, joined together by flexible plastic. A framework that supports the reflector includes a mechanism that can be used to tilt it and also bend it appropriately. The mirror is never exactly paraboloidal, but it is always close enough for cooking purposes.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nSometimes the rotating reflector is located outdoors and the reflected sunlight passes through an opening in a wall into an indoor kitchen, often a large communal one, where the cooking is done.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n{{clear}}\n[[File:focus-balanced parabolic reflector.svg|thumb|300px|An [[oblique projection]] of a focus-balanced parabolic reflector]]\nParaboloidal reflectors that have their centres of mass coincident with their focal points are useful. They can be easily turned to follow the sun's motions in the sky, rotating about any axis that passes through the focus. Two perpendicular axes can be used, intersecting at the focus, to allow the paraboloid to follow both the sun's daily motion and its seasonal one. The cooking pot stays stationary at the focus. If the paraboloidal reflector is axially symmetrical and is made of material of uniform thickness, its centre of mass coincides with its focus if the depth of the reflector, measured along its axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim, is 1.8478 times its focal length. The radius of the rim of the reflector is 2.7187 times the focal length. The angular radius of the rim, as seen from the focal point, is 72.68 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Parabolic troughs ===\n[[Parabolic trough]]s are used to concentrate sunlight for solar-energy purposes. Some solar cookers have been built that use them in the same way.<ref>{{cite book|author=Shah, Yatish T. |title=Thermal Energy: Sources, Recovery, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdArDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT340|date=12 January 2018|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-315-30593-6|pages=340\u2013}}</ref> Generally, the trough is aligned with its focal line horizontal and east-west. The food to be cooked is arranged along this line. The trough is pointed so its axis of symmetry aims at the sun at noon. This requires the trough to be tilted up and down as the seasons progress. At the equinoxes, no movement of the trough is needed during the day to track the sun.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Solar Tracking |author=Prinsloo, GJ |author2=Dobson, RT |last-author-amp=yes |doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.4265.6329/1 |ISBN=978-0-620-61576-1|pages=1 |date=2015}}</ref> At other times of year, there is a period of several hours around noon each day when no tracking is needed. Usually, the cooker is used only during this period, so no automatic sun tracking is incorporated into it. This simplicity makes the design attractive, compared with using a paraboloid. Also, being a [[wikt:single curve|single curve]], the trough reflector is simpler to construct. However, it suffers from lower efficiency.\n\nIt is possible to use two parabolic troughs, curved in perpendicular directions, to bring sunlight to a point focus as does a paraboloidal reflector.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}The incoming light strikes one of the troughs, which sends it toward a line focus. The second trough intercepts the converging light and focuses it to a point.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nCompared with a single paraboloid, using two partial troughs has important advantages. Each trough is a [[wikt:single curve|single curve]], which can be made simply by bending a flat sheet of metal. Also, the light that reaches the targeted cooking pot is directed approximately downward, which reduces the danger of damage to the eyes of anyone nearby. On the other hand, there are disadvantages. More mirror material is needed, increasing the cost, and the light is reflected by two surfaces instead of one, which inevitably increases the amount that is lost.\n\nThe two troughs are held in a fixed orientation relative to each other by being both fixed to a frame.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The whole assembly of frame and troughs has to be moved to track the sun as it moves in the sky. Commercially made cookers that use this method are available.In practical applications (like in car-headlights), concave mirrors are of parabolic shape\n\n=== Spherical reflectors ===\n[[File:Auroville Solar Bowl.JPG|thumb|The Solar Bowl in [[Auroville]]]]\n\nSpherical reflectors operate much like paraboloidal reflectors, such that the axis of symmetry is pointed towards the sun so that light is concentrated to a focus.  However, the focus of a spherical reflector will not be a point focus because it suffers from a phenomenon known as [[spherical aberration]].  Some concentrating dishes (such as satellite dishes) that do not require a precise focus opt for a spherical curvature over a paraboloid. If the radius of the rim of spherical reflector is small compared with the radius of curvature of its surface (the radius of the sphere of which the reflector is a part), the reflector approximates a paraboloidal one with focal length equal to half of the radius of curvature.<ref>See [[Parabola#Focal length and radius of curvature at the vertex]]</ref>\n\n=== Vacuum tube technology ===\n\nEvacuated tube solar cookers are essentially a vacuum sealed between two layers of glass.  The vacuum allows the tube to act both as a \"super\" greenhouse and an insulator. The central cooking tube is made from borosilicate glass, which is resistant to thermal shock, and has a vacuum beneath the surface to insulate the interior. The inside of the tube is lined with copper, stainless steel, and aluminum nitrile to better absorb and conduct heat from the sun's rays. Some vacuum tube solar cookers incorporate lightweight designs which allow great portability (such as the GoSun stove)\n<ref>{{cite news|last=Fincher|first=Johnathan |title=GoSun:Portable solar oven cooks food in as little as 10 minutes |url=https://newatlas.com/gosun-stove-portable-solar-cooker/29072/ |date=September 16, 2013|work=New Atlas}}</ref>\nPortable vacuum tube cookers such as the GoSun allow users to cook freshly caught fish on the beach without needing to light a fire.<ref>{{cite news|last=Twmffat|first=Tecwyn |title=Solar cooked mackerel on the rocks|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Cooked-Wild-Mackerel-on-the-Rocks/ |accessdate=September 26, 2016|work=instructables.com}}</ref>\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\n\n'''Advantages'''\n* High-performance parabolic solar cookers and vacuum tube cookers can attain temperatures above 290&nbsp;\u00b0C (550&nbsp;\u00b0F). They can be used to grill meats, stir-fry vegetables, make soup, bake bread, and boil water in minutes. Vacuum tube type cookers can heat up even in the clouds and freezing cold.\n* Conventional solar box cookers attain temperatures up to 165&nbsp;\u00b0C (325&nbsp;\u00b0F). They can sterilize water or prepare most foods that can be made in a conventional oven or stove, including bread, vegetables and meat over a period of hours.\n* Solar cookers use no fuel. This saves cost as well as reducing environmental damage caused by fuel use. Since 2.5 billion people cook on open fires using biomass fuels, solar cookers could have large economic and environmental benefits by reducing deforestation.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO: Household Air Pollution and Health|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref>\n* When solar cookers are used outside, they do not contribute inside heat, potentially saving fuel costs for cooling as well. Any type of cooking may evaporate grease, oil, and other material into the air, hence there may be less cleanup.\n*Reduces your carbon footprint by cooking without the use of carbon based fuels or grid electricity from traditional sources.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thetinylife.com/the-complete-solar-oven-guide-best-solar-oven-reviews/|title=The Complete Solar Oven Guide: 6 Best Solar Oven Reviews {{!}} The Tiny Life|work=The Tiny Life|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}</ref>  \n\n'''Disadvantages'''\n* Solar cookers are less useful in cloudy weather and near the poles (where the sun is low in the sky or below the horizon), so an alternative cooking source is still required in these conditions. Solar cooking advocates suggest three devices for an integrated cooking solution: a) a solar cooker; b) a fuel-efficient [[cookstove]]; c) an insulated storage container such as a basket filled with straw to store heated food. Very hot food may continue to cook for hours in a well-insulated container. With this three-part solution, fuel use is minimized while still providing hot meals at any hour, reliably.\n* Some solar cookers, especially solar ovens, take longer to cook food than a conventional stove or oven. Using solar cookers may require food preparation start hours before the meal. However, it requires less hands-on time during the cooking, so this is often considered a reasonable trade-off.\n* Cooks may need to learn special cooking techniques to fry common foods, such as fried eggs or [[flatbread]]s like [[chapati]]s and [[tortilla]]s. It may not be possible to safely or completely cook some thick foods, such as large roasts, loaves of bread, or pots of soup, particularly in small panel cookers; the cook may need to divide these into smaller portions before cooking.\n* Some solar cooker designs are affected by strong winds, which can slow the cooking process, cool the food due to convective losses, and disturb the reflector. It may be necessary to anchor the reflector, such as with string and weighted objects like bricks.\n\n== Projects ==\n[[File:SOLAR COOKER 001.JPG|thumb|Students perform an experiment using a solar cooker built out of an umbrella]]\n\nCardboard, aluminium foil, and plastic bags for well over 10,000 solar cookers have been donated to the Iridimi refugee camp and Touloum refugee camps in [[Chad]] by the combined efforts of the [[Jewish World Watch]], the Dutch foundation [[KoZon]], and [[Solar Cookers International]]. The refugees construct the cookers themselves, using the donated supplies and locally purchased [[Arabic gum]].<ref name=\"CNN\" />  It has also significantly reduced the amount of time women spend tending open fires each day, with the results that they are healthier and they have more time to grow vegetables for their families and make handicrafts for export.<ref name=\"CNN\" /> By 2007, the [[Jewish World Watch]] had trained 4,500 women and had provided 10,000 solar cookers to refugees. The project has also reduced the number of foraging trips by as much as 70 percent, thus reducing the number of attacks.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Heliostat]]\n* [[Kyoto box]]\n* [[Liquid-mirror telescope]]\n* [[List of stoves]]\n* [[Paraboloid#Dimensions of a paraboloidal dish]]\n* [[Solar Cookers International]]\n* [[Solar still]]\n* [[Solar updraft tower]]\n* [[Solar water disinfection]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"CNN\">{{ cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/12/solar.darfur/index.html?iref=mpstoryview | title = Solar lifeline saves Darfur women | accessdate = 2008-03-06 | format = | publisher = CNN | date=2007-09-17}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"isbn0-8117-3402-1\">{{ cite book | author = Yaffe, Linda Frederick | title = Solar Cooking for Home and Camp | publisher = Stackpole Books | location = Mechanicsburg, PA | year = 2007 | pages = 16\u201320 | isbn = 0-8117-3402-1 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"isbn0-9629069-2-1\">{{ cite book |author1=Halacy, D.

Many solar cookers currently in use are relatively inexpensive, [[low-tech]] devices, although some are as powerful or as expensive as traditional stoves,<ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Cookers: Varieties and Styles|url=http://www.solarcooker-at-cantinawest.com/solarcookers-types.html|publisher=CantinaWest|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref> and advanced, large-scale solar cookers can cook for hundreds of people.<ref>{{cite web|title=World's Largest 38500-meal Solar Kitchen in India|url=http://inhabitat.com/world%E2%80%99s-largest-solar-kitchen-in-india-can-cook-upto-38500-meals-per-day/|publisher=inhabitat|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref> Because they use no fuel and cost nothing to operate, many nonprofit organizations are promoting their use worldwide in order to help reduce fuel costs (especially where monetary reciprocity is low) and air pollution, and to slow down the [[deforestation]] and [[desertification]] caused by gathering firewood for cooking.\n\n== History ==\nThe first academic description of the principles of a solar cooker is by the Swiss geologist, meteorologist, physicist, mountaineer and Alpine explorer [[Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure]], in [[1767]]. The principle of cooking meals from the sun was largely developed in the [[French Foreign Legion]], in the 1870s.<ref>Nichols, C. Alan. [http://solarcooking.org/plans/Cookerbo.pdf THE TRACKING SOLAR COOKER]. solarcooking.org</ref> \n\n==Working Principles ==\n1) Concentrating sunlight: A mirrored surface with high [[specular reflection]] is used to concentrate light from the sun into a small cooking area. Depending on the geometry of the surface, sunlight could  be [[Concentrated solar power|concentrated]] by several orders of magnitude producing temperatures high enough to melt salt and metal. For most household solar cooking applications, such high temperatures are not really required. Solar cooking products are typically designed to achieve temperatures of {{convert|65|C|-1}} (baking temperatures) to {{convert|400|C|-1}} (grilling/searing temperatures) on a sunny day.\n\n2) Converting light energy to heat energy: Solar cookers concentrate sunlight onto a receiver such as a cooking pan. The interaction between the light energy and the receiver material converts light to heat and this is called conduction. This conversion is maximized by using materials that conduct and retain heat. Pots and pans used on solar cookers should be matte black in color to maximize the absorption.\n\n3) Trapping heat energy: It is important to reduce [[convection]] by isolating the air inside the cooker from the air outside the cooker. Simply using a glass lid on your pot enhances light absorption from the top of the pan and provides a [[greenhouse effect]] that improves heat retention and minimizes [[Heat transfer|convection loss]]. This \"glazing\" transmits incoming visible sunlight but is opaque to escaping infrared thermal radiation. In resource constrained settings, a high-temperature plastic bag can serve a similar function, trapping air inside and making it possible to reach temperatures on cold and windy days similar to those possible on hot days.\nBelow is the basic science for solar panel cookers and solar box cookers. Another style of solar cooker is a parabolic solar cooker. They typically require more frequent reorientation to the sun, but will cook more quickly at higher temperatures, and can fry foods. Evacuated tube solar cookers use a highly insulated double-wall glass tube for the cooking chamber, and do not require large reflectors\n\n==Operation ==\n[[File:Solar oven Portugal 2007.jpg|thumb|Solar oven in use]]\n\nDifferent kinds of solar cookers (more than 300 models of solar cooker had been made so far) use somewhat different methods of cooking, but most follow the same basic principles.\n\nFood is prepared as if for an oven or stove top. However, because food cooks faster when it is in smaller pieces, food placed inside a solar cooker is usually cut into smaller pieces than it might otherwise be.<ref name=\"isbn0-8117-3402-1\" /> For example, potatoes are usually cut into bite-sized pieces rather than roasted whole.<ref name=\"isbn0-9629069-2-1\" /> For very simple cooking, such as melting butter or cheese, a lid may not be needed and the food may be placed on an uncovered [[Sheet pan|tray]] or in a bowl. If several foods are to be cooked separately, then they are placed in different containers.\n\nThe container of food is placed inside the solar cooker, which may be elevated on a brick, rock, metal [[trivet]], or other [[heat sink]], and the solar cooker is placed in direct sunlight.<ref name=\"isbn0-8117-3402-1\" /> Foods that cook quickly may be added to the solar cooker later. Rice for a mid-day meal might be started early in the morning, with vegetables, cheese, or soup added to the solar cooker in the middle of the morning. Depending on the size of the solar cooker and the number and quantity of cooked foods, a family may use one or more solar cookers.\n\nA solar oven is turned towards the sun and left until the food is cooked. Unlike cooking on a stove or over a fire, which may require more than an hour of constant supervision, food in a solar oven is generally not stirred or turned over, both because it is unnecessary and because opening the solar oven allows the trapped heat to escape and thereby slows the cooking process. If wanted, the solar oven may be checked every one to two hours, to turn the oven to face the sun more precisely and to ensure that shadows from nearby buildings or plants have not blocked the sunlight. If the food is to be left untended for many hours during the day, then the solar oven is often turned to face the point where the sun will be when it is highest in the sky, instead of towards its current position.<ref name=\"Halacy\" />\n\nThe cooking time depends primarily on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity of food that needs to be cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, it might be possible to melt butter in 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic solar cooker, you may be able to grill a steak in minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.\n\nIt is difficult to burn food in a solar cooker.<ref name=\"isbn0-9629069-2-1\" /> Food that has been cooked even an hour longer than necessary is usually indistinguishable from minimally cooked food. The exception to this rule is some green vegetables, which quickly change from a perfectly cooked bright green to [[olive drab]], while still retaining the desirable texture.\n\nFor most foods, such as rice, the typical person would be unable to tell how it was cooked from looking at the final product. There are some differences, however: Bread and cakes brown on their tops instead of on the bottom. Compared to cooking over a fire, the food does not have a smoky flavor.\n\n== Box and panel designs ==\n[[File:HotPot d.PNG|thumb|left|HotPot panel solar cooker]]\nA box cooker has a transparent glass or plastic top, and it may have additional reflectors to concentrate sunlight into the box. The top can usually be removed to allow dark pots containing food to be placed inside. One or more reflectors of shiny metal or foil-lined material may be positioned to bounce extra light into the interior of the oven chamber. Cooking containers and the inside bottom of the cooker should be dark-colored or black. Inside walls should be reflective to reduce radiative heat loss and bounce the light towards the pots and the dark bottom, which is in contact with the pots. The box should have insulated sides. [[Thermal insulation]] for the solar box cooker must be able to withstand temperatures up to 150&nbsp;\u00b0C (300&nbsp;\u00b0F) without melting or out-gassing. Crumpled newspaper, wool, rags, dry grass, sheets of cardboard, etc. can be used to insulate the walls of the cooker. Metal pots and/or bottom trays can be darkened either with flat-black spray paint (one that is non-toxic when warmed), black [[tempera]] paint, or soot from a fire. The solar box cooker typically reaches a temperature of 150&nbsp;\u00b0C (300&nbsp;\u00b0F). This is not as hot as a standard oven, but still hot enough to cook food over a somewhat longer period of time.\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Cardboard Box and Duct Tape Solar Oven.jpeg|thumb|A Solar Oven made of cardboard, newspapers, and reflective tape]]\nPanel solar cookers are inexpensive solar cookers that use reflective panels to direct sunlight to a cooking pot that is enclosed in a clear plastic bag.\n\nSolar Oven science experiments are regularly done as projects in high schools and colleges, such as the \"Solar Oven Throwdown\" at the [[University of Arizona]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/photos/solar-oven-throwdown-heats-ua-mall|title=Solar Oven Throwdown Heats Up UA Mall|website=UANews|date=October 23, 2013}}</ref> These projects prove that it is possible to both achieve high temperatures, as well as predict the high temperatures using mathematical models.\n\n== Parabolic reflectors ==\n{{Main|parabolic reflector}}\nParabolic solar cookers concentrate sunlight to a single point. When this point is focused on the bottom of a pot, it can heat the pot quickly to very high temperatures which can often be comparable with the temperatures achieved in gas and charcoal grills. These types of solar cookers are widely used in several regions of the world, most notably in China and India where hundreds of thousands of families currently use parabolic solar cookers for preparing food and heating water. Some parabolic solar cooker projects in China abate between 1\u20134 tons of carbon dioxide per year and receive carbon credits through the [http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)] and [http://www.goldstandard.org/ Gold Standard].\n\n[[File:Solar tea kettle.JPG|thumb|Solar tea kettle in Tibet]]\nSome parabolic solar cookers incorporate cutting edge materials and designs which lead to solar energy efficiencies >90%.

If the axis of symmetry is aimed at the sun, any object that is located at the focus receives highly concentrated sunlight, and therefore becomes very hot. This is the basis for the use of this kind of reflector for solar cooking.\n\n=== Paraboloidal reflectors ===\n[[File:ALSOL.jpg|thumb|left|A parabolic solar cooker with segmented construction .<ref>[http://www.solarcookingatlas.com/solar-cooking-pictures.php Solar cooker pictures] Solar Cooking Atlas official website</ref>]]\n\n[[Paraboloid]]s are [[wikt:compound curve|compound curves]], which are more difficult to make with simple equipment than [[wikt:single curve|single curves]].

[[Centrifugal force]] causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See [[Liquid-mirror telescope]].) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as [[rotating furnace]]s.\n\nParaboloidal reflectors generate high temperatures and cook quickly, but require frequent adjustment and supervision for safe operation. Several hundred thousand exist, mainly in China.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} They are especially useful for individual household and large-scale institutional cooking.\n\n[[File:Parabole de cuisson solaire Scheffler coccion solar cooking.jpg|thumb|A Scheffler cooker. This reflector has an area of {{convert|16|m2|abbr=on}}, and concentrates 3 kW of heat]]\n\nA Scheffler cooker (named after its inventor, [[Wolfgang Scheffler (inventor)|Wolfgang Scheffler]]) uses a large ideally paraboloidal reflector which is rotated around an axis that is parallel with the earth's using a mechanical mechanism, turning at 15 degrees per hour to compensate for the earth's rotation. The axis passes through the reflector's centre of mass, allowing the reflector to be turned easily. The cooking vessel is located at the focus which is on the axis of rotation, so the mirror concentrates sunlight onto it all day. The mirror has to be occasionally tilted about a perpendicular axis to compensate for the seasonal variation in the sun's [[declination]]. This perpendicular axis does not pass through the cooking vessel. Therefore, if the reflector were a rigid paraboloid, its focus would not remain stationary at the cooking vessel as the reflector tilts. To keep the focus stationary, the reflector's shape has to vary. It remains paraboloidal, but its focal length and other parameters change as it tilts. The Scheffler reflector is therefore flexible, and can be bent to adjust its shape. It is often made up of a large number of small plane sections, such as glass mirrors, joined together by flexible plastic. A framework that supports the reflector includes a mechanism that can be used to tilt it and also bend it appropriately. The mirror is never exactly paraboloidal, but it is always close enough for cooking purposes.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nSometimes the rotating reflector is located outdoors and the reflected sunlight passes through an opening in a wall into an indoor kitchen, often a large communal one, where the cooking is done.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n{{clear}}\n[[File:focus-balanced parabolic reflector.svg|thumb|300px|An [[oblique projection]] of a focus-balanced parabolic reflector]]\nParaboloidal reflectors that have their centres of mass coincident with their focal points are useful. They can be easily turned to follow the sun's motions in the sky, rotating about any axis that passes through the focus. Two perpendicular axes can be used, intersecting at the focus, to allow the paraboloid to follow both the sun's daily motion and its seasonal one. The cooking pot stays stationary at the focus. If the paraboloidal reflector is axially symmetrical and is made of material of uniform thickness, its centre of mass coincides with its focus if the depth of the reflector, measured along its axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim, is 1.8478 times its focal length. The radius of the rim of the reflector is 2.7187 times the focal length. The angular radius of the rim, as seen from the focal point, is 72.68 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Parabolic troughs ===\n[[Parabolic trough]]s are used to concentrate sunlight for solar-energy purposes. Some solar cookers have been built that use them in the same way.<ref>{{cite book|author=Shah, Yatish T. |title=Thermal Energy: Sources, Recovery, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QdArDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT340|date=12 January 2018|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-315-30593-6|pages=340\u2013}}</ref> Generally, the trough is aligned with its focal line horizontal and east-west. The food to be cooked is arranged along this line. The trough is pointed so its axis of symmetry aims at the sun at noon. This requires the trough to be tilted up and down as the seasons progress. At the equinoxes, no movement of the trough is needed during the day to track the sun.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Solar Tracking |author=Prinsloo, GJ |author2=Dobson, RT |last-author-amp=yes |doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.4265.6329/1 |ISBN=978-0-620-61576-1|pages=1 |date=2015}}</ref> At other times of year, there is a period of several hours around noon each day when no tracking is needed. Usually, the cooker is used only during this period, so no automatic sun tracking is incorporated into it. This simplicity makes the design attractive, compared with using a paraboloid. Also, being a [[wikt:single curve|single curve]], the trough reflector is simpler to construct. However, it suffers from lower efficiency.\n\nIt is possible to use two parabolic troughs, curved in perpendicular directions, to bring sunlight to a point focus as does a paraboloidal reflector.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}The incoming light strikes one of the troughs, which sends it toward a line focus. The second trough intercepts the converging light and focuses it to a point.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nCompared with a single paraboloid, using two partial troughs has important advantages. Each trough is a [[wikt:single curve|single curve]], which can be made simply by bending a flat sheet of metal. Also, the light that reaches the targeted cooking pot is directed approximately downward, which reduces the danger of damage to the eyes of anyone nearby. On the other hand, there are disadvantages. More mirror material is needed, increasing the cost, and the light is reflected by two surfaces instead of one, which inevitably increases the amount that is lost.\n\nThe two troughs are held in a fixed orientation relative to each other by being both fixed to a frame.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The whole assembly of frame and troughs has to be moved to track the sun as it moves in the sky. Commercially made cookers that use this method are available.In practical applications (like in car-headlights), concave mirrors are of parabolic shape\n\n=== Spherical reflectors ===\n[[File:Auroville Solar Bowl.JPG|thumb|The Solar Bowl in [[Auroville]]]]\n\nSpherical reflectors operate much like paraboloidal reflectors, such that the axis of symmetry is pointed towards the sun so that light is concentrated to a focus.  However, the focus of a spherical reflector will not be a point focus because it suffers from a phenomenon known as [[spherical aberration]].  Some concentrating dishes (such as satellite dishes) that do not require a precise focus opt for a spherical curvature over a paraboloid. If the radius of the rim of spherical reflector is small compared with the radius of curvature of its surface (the radius of the sphere of which the reflector is a part), the reflector approximates a paraboloidal one with focal length equal to half of the radius of curvature.<ref>See [[Parabola#Focal length and radius of curvature at the vertex]]</ref>\n\n=== Vacuum tube technology ===\n\nEvacuated tube solar cookers are essentially a vacuum sealed between two layers of glass.  The vacuum allows the tube to act both as a \"super\" greenhouse and an insulator. The central cooking tube is made from borosilicate glass, which is resistant to thermal shock, and has a vacuum beneath the surface to insulate the interior. The inside of the tube is lined with copper, stainless steel, and aluminum nitrile to better absorb and conduct heat from the sun's rays. Some vacuum tube solar cookers incorporate lightweight designs which allow great portability (such as the GoSun stove)\n<ref>{{cite news|last=Fincher|first=Johnathan |title=GoSun:Portable solar oven cooks food in as little as 10 minutes |url=https://newatlas.com/gosun-stove-portable-solar-cooker/29072/ |date=September 16, 2013|work=New Atlas}}</ref>\nPortable vacuum tube cookers such as the GoSun allow users to cook freshly caught fish on the beach without needing to light a fire.<ref>{{cite news|last=Twmffat|first=Tecwyn |title=Solar cooked mackerel on the rocks|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Solar-Cooked-Wild-Mackerel-on-the-Rocks/ |accessdate=September 26, 2016|work=instructables.com}}</ref>\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\n\n'''Advantages'''\n* High-performance parabolic solar cookers and vacuum tube cookers can attain temperatures above 290&nbsp;\u00b0C (550&nbsp;\u00b0F). They can be used to grill meats, stir-fry vegetables, make soup, bake bread, and boil water in minutes. Vacuum tube type cookers can heat up even in the clouds and freezing cold.\n* Conventional solar box cookers attain temperatures up to 165&nbsp;\u00b0C (325&nbsp;\u00b0F). They can sterilize water or prepare most foods that can be made in a conventional oven or stove, including bread, vegetables and meat over a period of hours.\n* Solar cookers use no fuel. This saves cost as well as reducing environmental damage caused by fuel use. Since 2.5 billion people cook on open fires using biomass fuels, solar cookers could have large economic and environmental benefits by reducing deforestation.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO: Household Air Pollution and Health|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref>\n* When solar cookers are used outside, they do not contribute inside heat, potentially saving fuel costs for cooling as well. Any type of cooking may evaporate grease, oil, and other material into the air, hence there may be less cleanup.\n*Reduces your carbon footprint by cooking without the use of carbon based fuels or grid electricity from traditional sources.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thetinylife.com/the-complete-solar-oven-guide-best-solar-oven-reviews/|title=The Complete Solar Oven Guide: 6 Best Solar Oven Reviews {{!}} The Tiny Life|work=The Tiny Life|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}</ref>  \n\n'''Disadvantages'''\n* Solar cookers are less useful in cloudy weather and near the poles (where the sun is low in the sky or below the horizon), so an alternative cooking source is still required in these conditions. Solar cooking advocates suggest three devices for an integrated cooking solution: a) a solar cooker; b) a fuel-efficient [[cookstove]]; c) an insulated storage container such as a basket filled with straw to store heated food. Very hot food may continue to cook for hours in a well-insulated container. With this three-part solution, fuel use is minimized while still providing hot meals at any hour, reliably.\n* Some solar cookers, especially solar ovens, take longer to cook food than a conventional stove or oven. Using solar cookers may require food preparation start hours before the meal. However, it requires less hands-on time during the cooking, so this is often considered a reasonable trade-off.\n* Cooks may need to learn special cooking techniques to fry common foods, such as fried eggs or [[flatbread]]s like [[chapati]]s and [[tortilla]]s. It may not be possible to safely or completely cook some thick foods, such as large roasts, loaves of bread, or pots of soup, particularly in small panel cookers; the cook may need to divide these into smaller portions before cooking.\n* Some solar cooker designs are affected by strong winds, which can slow the cooking process, cool the food due to convective losses, and disturb the reflector. It may be necessary to anchor the reflector, such as with string and weighted objects like bricks.\n\n== Projects ==\n[[File:SOLAR COOKER 001.JPG|thumb|Students perform an experiment using a solar cooker built out of an umbrella]]\n\nCardboard, aluminium foil, and plastic bags for well over 10,000 solar cookers have been donated to the Iridimi refugee camp and Touloum refugee camps in [[Chad]] by the combined efforts of the [[Jewish World Watch]], the Dutch foundation [[KoZon]], and [[Solar Cookers International]]. The refugees construct the cookers themselves, using the donated supplies and locally purchased [[Arabic gum]].<ref name=\"CNN\" />  It has also significantly reduced the amount of time women spend tending open fires each day, with the results that they are healthier and they have more time to grow vegetables for their families and make handicrafts for export.<ref name=\"CNN\" /> By 2007, the [[Jewish World Watch]] had trained 4,500 women and had provided 10,000 solar cookers to refugees. The project has also reduced the number of foraging trips by as much as 70 percent, thus reducing the number of attacks.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Heliostat]]\n* [[Kyoto box]]\n* [[Liquid-mirror telescope]]\n* [[List of stoves]]\n* [[Paraboloid#Dimensions of a paraboloidal dish]]\n* [[Solar Cookers International]]\n* [[Solar still]]\n* [[Solar updraft tower]]\n* [[Solar water disinfection]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"CNN\">{{ cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/12/solar.darfur/index.html?iref=mpstoryview | title = Solar lifeline saves Darfur women | accessdate = 2008-03-06 | format = | publisher = CNN | date=2007-09-17}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"isbn0-8117-3402-1\">{{ cite book | author = Yaffe, Linda Frederick | title = Solar Cooking for Home and Camp | publisher = Stackpole Books | location = Mechanicsburg, PA | year = 2007 | pages = 16\u201320 | isbn = 0-8117-3402-1 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"isbn0-9629069-2-1\">{{ cite book |author1=Halacy, D.
