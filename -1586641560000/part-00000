The club was reformed in 2013.  To date the club has an adult mens and ladies team [[gaelic football|football]] along with boys and girls teams at underage at various levels. Dinky came out of retirement and wasn\u2019t great.\n\n==Origins of the club==\n\n'''Shankill Shilmaliers'''\n\nThe earliest known existence of a Shankill team was on November 5, 1911, a Sunday. Very little is known before this date. The club was known as Shankill Shilmaliers. The name Shilmalier taken from the barony of Shilmalier Co.Wexford, a place associated with the 1798 rebellion.\n\nIn July 1910 a newly formed newspaper called the Saturday Dublin Post published Dublin\u2019s first match reports and minutes of County Board Meetings. Dublin GAA and Ireland at the time were in hectic circles. The Post did reporting on behalf of all organisations during a political atmosphere hostile to the fostering of Irish culture.\n\nHere are extracts of the Post involving Shankill Shilmaliers.\n\n'''Sunday November 5, 1911 at the Phoenix Park'''Foxrock Geraldines and Shankill Shilmaliers teams lined out to play their match, and from the start the ball was more often out of play than in. The players kept at it, however, for 40 minutes, but a very heavy shower coming on, their ardour cooled a little, and they sought the shelter of the trees. The Referee deemed it unwise to continue the game. Shilmaliers were leading by 1 goal 1 point to 1 point. About 1 minute before half time a player of the Shankill team named Jas McGarry was seriously injured as a result of accidentally colliding with an opponent. It was decided in full view of the circumstances to refix the match to be played for the full time at Shankill on Sunday. Mr J J Clare to Referee.\n\n'''The Replay Played On Sunday November 12, 1911 at People\u2019s Park, Bray'''\n\nAt the weekly meeting of the football league Mr J J Clare(Referee) reported that junior tie between Shankill Shilmaliers and Foxrock Gerarldines was fixed at the last meeting to be played in Shankill, but as the ground there was not available, both teams travelled on to the People\u2019s Park Bray to play the match. After 40 minutes play the match was abandoned for want of a ball, 2 balls having been burst. The scores at the time: Foxrock 1-1 Shankill 1 point. Mr Clare further reported that a Foxrock player named Joseph Seville retired seriously injured through accidentally colliding with an opponent.\n\n'''2nd Replay On Sunday November 26, 1911 at Kill-O-The -Grange'''\n\nThe much played game between Foxrock Gers and Shankill Shilmaliers was finally decided on Sunday at Kill-O-the-Grange. It will be recollected that the teams met twice before in the Phoenix Park and the People\u2019s Park Bray, when after forty minutes play on each occasion the game had to be abandoned, owing to the storm on the first occasion and in consequence of the ball bursting on the second occasion. Last Sundays match, however, settled the matter, as the Foxrock men won by 2 goals to 1 goal 1 point. During the progress of the game which was a fairly good one C O\u2019Neill (Shankill) retired injured, Rogers taking his place. Mr J J Clare refereed.\n\nThe Teams were:\n\nFoxrock:- M.

After the objection had been read, Mr J J Clare said he was not going to defend it, as the players were illegal. The Committee could give the points to Shankill.

In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''.

These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the northeast and Bank (now Guardswell) to the southeast.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what it was six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield. In 1930 there were only two houses that were occupied.

These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the northeast and Bank (now Guardswell) to the southeast.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what it was six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield. In 1930 there were only two houses that were occupied.

Their Wild Card matchup saw numerous lead changes, and the teams were tied 27\u201327 at the end of regulation time. In overtime, the Seahawks won the coin toss. Seahawks quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] (a former Packer) told the microphoned referee, and thus the crowd and the national television audience, \"We want the ball, and we're gonna score.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000769793/article/remembering-matt-hasselbecks-coinflip-guarantee | title = Remembering Matt Hasselbeck's coin-flip guarantee | first = Dan | last = Hanzus | date = January 4, 2017 | publisher = National Football League | access-date = March 13, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200308012259/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000769793/article/remembering-matt-hasselbecks-coinflip-guarantee | archive-date = March 8, 2020 | url-status = live }}</ref> After each team went three-and-out, [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]] intercepted Hasselbeck's pass and returned it 52 yards for the winning touchdown.\n* On September 24, 2012, the teams played a regular season game at the Seahawks' [[CenturyLink Field]]. It is remembered for the controversial last play, dubbed the \"[[Fail Mary]]\". Replacement officials were being used due to the [[2012 NFL referee lockout]]. With the Packers leading 12\u20137 and only eight seconds left, Seattle quarterback [[Russell Wilson]] threw a desperation [[Hail Mary]] pass into the end zone. Packers [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safety]] [[M. D. Jennings]] and Seahawks [[wide receiver]] [[Golden Tate]] both jumped for the ball, and both maintained some contact with it in the air and upon landing on the ground. The two officials near the play conferred and then simultaneously made separate signals; [[Official (American football)#Side judge|side judge]] Lance Easley raised his arms to signal [[touchdown]], while [[back judge]] Derrick Rhone-Dunn waved his arms to signal stoppage of the clock. Eventually, it was declared a touchdown, with Jennings and Tate ruled to have simultaneous possession (which is decided in favor of the offensive player), giving the Seahawks the win. The play was controversial on two counts. Following the game, the NFL released an official statement that acknowledged that a [[pass interference]] penalty should have been called on Tate. Also, several of the regular NFL officials stated they would have ruled it an interception. This incident helped end the lockout.\n* The teams clashed in the conference finals of the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs]]. Seattle was looking to repeat as Super Bowl champions, having crushed the [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XLVII]] 43\u20138 the year before. However, Russell Wilson started poorly and his team was down 16\u20130 at halftime and 19\u20137 with under three minutes left. Wilson began the rally by first running for a touchdown. Then, after a successful [[onside kick]], [[Marshawn Lynch]] rushed for another touchdown, giving his team its first lead. Ahead 20\u201319, the Seahawks elected to go for a [[two-point conversion]]; Wilson came under intense pressure and was chased out of the pocket, but managed to loft a high, arcing pass to tight end [[Luke Willson]], who took the ball into the end zone. That successful conversion proved to be crucial, as Packers quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] had enough time to drive down the field for a tying field goal. In overtime, Seattle won the coin toss, and Wilson threw a game-winning touchdown pass to [[Jermaine Kearse]] on the first possession.\n\nThe teams have met four times in the playoffs, with the Packers winning three.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/playoffs.htm | title = Seattle Seahawks Playoff History | publisher = Sports Reference LLC | access-date = March 13, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190925204240/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/playoffs.htm | archive-date = September 25, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> In addition to the two meetings cited above, Green Bay won 42\u201320 in [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|2007\u201308]] and 28\u201323 in the [[2019\u201320 NFL playoffs|2019\u201320]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2020/01/13/packers-beat-seahawks-advance-to-nfc-championship |title=Packers Leaving it All on the Field, Win After Win |last=Kahler |first=Kalyn |date=2020-01-13 |website=Sports Illustrated |language=en-us |access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> both in the Divisional round.\n\n==Results==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2020}}\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible\" style=\"width:90%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Oakland Raiders}};\" |  Green Bay Packers vs. Seattle Seahawks Season-by-Season Results\n|- value=\"top\"\n|<div class=\"NavFrame\">\n<div class=\"NavHead\" style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Oakland Raiders}};\">1970s \u2013 1990s (Tied, 4\u20134)</div>\n<div class=\"NavContent\" \nstyle=\"text-align:center; display:none;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

Their Wild Card matchup saw numerous lead changes, and the teams were tied 27\u201327 at the end of regulation time. In overtime, the Seahawks won the coin toss. Seahawks quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] (a former Packer) told the microphoned referee, and thus the crowd and the national television audience, \"We want the ball, and we're gonna score.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000769793/article/remembering-matt-hasselbecks-coinflip-guarantee | title = Remembering Matt Hasselbeck's coin-flip guarantee | first = Dan | last = Hanzus | date = January 4, 2017 | publisher = National Football League | access-date = March 13, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200308012259/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000769793/article/remembering-matt-hasselbecks-coinflip-guarantee | archive-date = March 8, 2020 | url-status = live }}</ref> After each team went three-and-out, [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]] intercepted Hasselbeck's pass and returned it 52 yards for the winning touchdown.\n* On September 24, 2012, the teams played a regular season game at the Seahawks' [[CenturyLink Field]]. It is remembered for the controversial last play, dubbed the \"[[Fail Mary]]\". Replacement officials were being used due to the [[2012 NFL referee lockout]]. With the Packers leading 12\u20137 and only eight seconds left, Seattle quarterback [[Russell Wilson]] threw a desperation [[Hail Mary]] pass into the end zone. Packers [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safety]] [[M. D. Jennings]] and Seahawks [[wide receiver]] [[Golden Tate]] both jumped for the ball, and both maintained some contact with it in the air and upon landing on the ground. The two officials near the play conferred and then simultaneously made separate signals; [[Official (American football)#Side judge|side judge]] Lance Easley raised his arms to signal [[touchdown]], while [[back judge]] Derrick Rhone-Dunn waved his arms to signal stoppage of the clock. Eventually, it was declared a touchdown, with Jennings and Tate ruled to have simultaneous possession (which is decided in favor of the offensive player), giving the Seahawks the win. The play was controversial on two counts. Following the game, the NFL released an official statement that acknowledged that a [[pass interference]] penalty should have been called on Tate. Also, several of the regular NFL officials stated they would have ruled it an interception. This incident helped end the lockout.\n* The teams clashed in the conference finals of the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs]]. Seattle was looking to repeat as Super Bowl champions, having crushed the [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XLVII]] 43\u20138 the year before. However, Russell Wilson started poorly and his team was down 16\u20130 at halftime and 19\u20137 with under three minutes left. Wilson began the rally by first running for a touchdown. Then, after a successful [[onside kick]], [[Marshawn Lynch]] rushed for another touchdown, giving his team its first lead. Ahead 20\u201319, the Seahawks elected to go for a [[two-point conversion]]; Wilson came under intense pressure and was chased out of the pocket, but managed to loft a high, arcing pass to tight end [[Luke Willson]], who took the ball into the end zone. That successful conversion proved to be crucial, as Packers quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] had enough time to drive down the field for a tying field goal. In overtime, Seattle won the coin toss, and Wilson threw a game-winning touchdown pass to [[Jermaine Kearse]] on the first possession.\n\nThe teams have met four times in the playoffs, with the Packers winning three.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/playoffs.htm | title = Seattle Seahawks Playoff History | publisher = Sports Reference LLC | access-date = March 13, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190925204240/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/playoffs.htm | archive-date = September 25, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> In addition to the two meetings cited above, Green Bay won 42\u201320 in [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|2007\u201308]] and 28\u201323 in the [[2019\u201320 NFL playoffs|2019\u201320]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2020/01/13/packers-beat-seahawks-advance-to-nfc-championship |title=Packers Leaving it All on the Field, Win After Win |last=Kahler |first=Kalyn |date=2020-01-13 |website=Sports Illustrated |language=en-us |access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> both in the Divisional round.\n\n==Results==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2020}}\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible\" style=\"width:90%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Oakland Raiders}};\" |  Green Bay Packers vs. Seattle Seahawks Season-by-Season Results\n|- value=\"top\"\n|<div class=\"NavFrame\">\n<div class=\"NavHead\" style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Oakland Raiders}};\">1970s \u2013 1990s (Tied, 4\u20134)</div>\n<div class=\"NavContent\" \nstyle=\"text-align:center; display:none;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

After struggling to break into the starting line-up however, he spent successful stints on loan with Italian clubs [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], where he matured as a player, before earning a move back to Juventus in 2012. Upon his return to the Turin club, he won two consecutive league titles, but once again struggled to maintain a spot in the team's starting eleven. This resulted in a high-profile move to [[Toronto FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] in early [[2015 Major League Soccer season|2015]], in a deal which made him the league's highest paid player.\n\nAfter joining the Canadian club, Giovinco soon established himself as one of the best players in MLS. During his first year with the club, he broke several league records, including the record for most combined goals and assists in a single season, also helping Toronto FC to qualify for the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]] for the first time in the club's history, and winning himself the [[MLS Golden Boot]], the [[MLS Newcomer of the Year Award]], and the [[Landon Donovan MVP Award|MLS MVP Award]]. In 2016, he won his first title with Toronto FC, the [[2016 Canadian Championship]], and became the club's [[List of Toronto FC records and statistics#Goalscorers|all-time top goalscorer]], helping the club to qualify for the Playoffs once again, reaching the [[MLS Cup 2016|MLS Cup Final]]. In 2017, he won his second Canadian Championship, winning the [[George Gross Memorial Trophy]] for the best player of the competition, captured the [[Supporters' Shield]], and also won the [[2017 MLS Cup]] with Toronto FC \u2013 for a [[domestic treble]]. In 2018, Giovinco helped Toronto FC reach the final of the [[2018 CONCACAF Champions League|CONCACAF Champions League]], and was awarded the [[2018 CONCACAF Champions League#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the tournament's best player, also capturing his third consecutive Canadian Championship with the club, although Toronto FC failed to qualify for the Playoffs. In 2019, he joined Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, where he won the [[AFC Champions League]] in his first year with the team.\n\nAt international level, Giovinco has represented Italy at all levels since first being called up by the [[Italy national under-16 football team|under-16 side]] in 2003; at youth level, he took part at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]] with the Italian under-23 side, and later helped the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy under-21]] side to the semi-finals of the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]]. He made his debut with the Italy senior side in 2011, and has since collected over 20 caps; he later also took part at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] (winning a runners-up medal) and at the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] (winning a bronze medal), and scored his first international goal during the latter tournament.\n\n==Early life==\nGiovinco was born in [[Turin]] to a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] father, Giovanni, originally from [[Bisacquino]] in the [[province of Palermo]], and a [[Calabria]]n mother, Elvira, originally from [[Catanzaro]], who moved from [[Mezzogiorno|Southern Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.j1897.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=81175&pid=2972035&st=0&#entry2972035|publisher=J1897.com|accessdate=15 September 2007|title=Sebastian Giovinco Complete Interview|date=1 April 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106230636/http://www.j1897.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=81175&pid=2972035&st=0&#entry2972035|archivedate=6 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He grew up in [[Beinasco]], a ''[[comune]]'' southwest of the city, in a family of [[A.C.

I have done everything to help him but the reality is that he plays in a league [the MLS] that doesn't count for much, and the number of goals he scores is less important because with the quality he has got, he is bound to make a difference in that league. The problem is that if you play in that type of league, and you get used to playing in that type of league, it becomes a problem of mentality.

first team after his success with the club's youth squad; in his first season, he helped the senior side win the title and earn promotion to [[Serie A]], establishing himself as a promising prospect in the number 10 role. After struggling to break into the starting line-up however, he spent successful stints on loan with Italian clubs [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], where he matured as a player, before earning a move back to Juventus in 2012. Upon his return to the Turin club, he won two consecutive league titles, but once again struggled to maintain a spot in the team's starting eleven. This resulted in a high-profile move to [[Toronto FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] in early [[2015 Major League Soccer season|2015]], in a deal which made him the league's highest paid player.\n\nAfter joining the Canadian club, Giovinco soon established himself as one of the best players in MLS. During his first year with the club, he broke several league records, including the record for most combined goals and assists in a single season, also helping Toronto FC to qualify for the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]] for the first time in the club's history, and winning himself the [[MLS Golden Boot]], the [[MLS Newcomer of the Year Award]], and the [[Landon Donovan MVP Award|MLS MVP Award]]. In 2016, he won his first title with Toronto FC, the [[2016 Canadian Championship]], and became the club's [[List of Toronto FC records and statistics#Goalscorers|all-time top goalscorer]], helping the club to qualify for the Playoffs once again, reaching the [[MLS Cup 2016|MLS Cup Final]]. In 2017, he won his second Canadian Championship, winning the [[George Gross Memorial Trophy]] for the best player of the competition, captured the [[Supporters' Shield]], and also won the [[2017 MLS Cup]] with Toronto FC \u2013 for a [[domestic treble]]. In 2018, Giovinco helped Toronto FC reach the final of the [[2018 CONCACAF Champions League|CONCACAF Champions League]], and was awarded the [[2018 CONCACAF Champions League#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the tournament's best player, also capturing his third consecutive Canadian Championship with the club, although Toronto FC failed to qualify for the Playoffs. In 2019, he joined Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, where he won the [[AFC Champions League]] in his first year with the team.\n\nAt international level, Giovinco has represented Italy at all levels since first being called up by the [[Italy national under-16 football team|under-16 side]] in 2003; at youth level, he took part at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]] with the Italian under-23 side, and later helped the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy under-21]] side to the semi-finals of the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]]. He made his debut with the Italy senior side in 2011, and has since collected over 20 caps; he later also took part at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] (winning a runners-up medal) and at the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] (winning a bronze medal), and scored his first international goal during the latter tournament.\n\n==Early life==\nGiovinco was born in [[Turin]] to a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] father, Giovanni, originally from [[Bisacquino]] in the [[province of Palermo]], and a [[Calabria]]n mother, Elvira, originally from [[Catanzaro]], who moved from [[Mezzogiorno|Southern Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.j1897.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=81175&pid=2972035&st=0&#entry2972035|publisher=J1897.com|accessdate=15 September 2007|title=Sebastian Giovinco Complete Interview|date=1 April 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106230636/http://www.j1897.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=81175&pid=2972035&st=0&#entry2972035|archivedate=6 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He grew up in [[Beinasco]], a ''[[comune]]'' southwest of the city, in a family of [[A.C.

I have done everything to help him but the reality is that he plays in a league [the MLS] that doesn't count for much, and the number of goals he scores is less important because with the quality he has got, he is bound to make a difference in that league. The problem is that if you play in that type of league, and you get used to playing in that type of league, it becomes a problem of mentality.
