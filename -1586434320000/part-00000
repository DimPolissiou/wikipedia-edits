Soon after arriving in Mexico, Domingo won a singing contest for boys, and his parents occasionally recruited him and his sister for children's roles in their zarzuela productions.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=10-13}} Domingo studied piano from a young age, at first privately and later at the [[National Conservatory of Music of Mexico|National Conservatory of Music]] in [[Mexico City]], which he entered when he was fourteen. At the conservatory, he also attended conducting classes taught by [[Igor Markevitch]] and studied voice under Carlo Morelli, the brother of [[Renato Zanelli]]. The two brothers were famous practitioners of both baritone and tenor roles.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=14-9}} Domingo's conservatory classes constituted the entirety of his formal vocal instruction; he never studied privately with a singing teacher.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=18}}\n\nIn 1957, at age sixteen, Domingo made his first professional appearance, accompanying his mother on the piano at a concert at [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n]]. The same year he made his major zarzuela debut in [[Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez Caballero]]'s {{Interlanguage link multi|Gigantes y cabezudos (zarzuela)|es|3=Gigantes y cabezudos (zarzuela)|lt=''Gigantes y cabezudos''}}, singing a baritone role.{{sfn|Webber|2003|p=303}} At that time, he was working with his parents' zarzuela company, eventually taking several baritone roles and acting as an accompanist for other singers.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=20}} The following year, the tenor in another company's touring production of ''[[Luisa Fernanda (zarzuela)|Luisa Fernanda]]'' fell ill. In his first performance as a tenor, Domingo replaced the ailing singer, although he feared the part's tessitura was too high for him.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=20}} Later that same year, he sang the tenor role of Rafael in the Spanish opera ''[[El gato mont\u00e9s]]'', illustrating his willingness to assay the tenor range, even as he still considered himself a baritone. On 12 May 1959 at the [[Teatro Degollado]] in [[Guadalajara]], he appeared in the baritone role (sometimes sung by basses) of Pascual in [[Emilio Arrieta]]'s {{Interlanguage link multi|Marina (zarzuela and opera)|es|3=Marina (\u00f3pera)|lt=''Marina''}}. Like ''El gato mont\u00e9s'', ''Marina'' is an opera composed in the zarzuela musical style rather than a zarzuela proper, although both are usually performed by zarzuela companies. In addition to his work with zarzuelas, among his earliest performances was a minor role in the first Latin American production of the musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', in which he was also the assistant conductor and assistant coach.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=20-2}} While he was a member, the company gave 185 performances of the musical in various cities in Mexico.\n\n[[File:Otello_1962.jpg|thumb|left|Domingo made his debut in Verdi's ''Otello'' at Bellas Artes in the comprimario r\u00f4le of Cassio in 1962]]\nIn 1959, Domingo auditioned for the Mexico National Opera at the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Palacio de B\u00e9llas Artes]] as a baritone, but was then asked to sight-read the tenor aria \"Amor ti vieta\" from ''[[Fedora (opera)|Fedora]]''. He was accepted at the National Opera as a tenor comprimario and as a tutor for other singers.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=23}} In what he considered his operatic debut, Domingo sang the minor role of Borsa in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] ''[[Rigoletto]]'' on September 23 at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in a production with veteran American baritone [[Cornell MacNeil]] and bass-baritone [[Norman Treigle]]. He later appeared as the Padre Confessor in ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites]]'', Altoum and Pang in ''[[Turandot]]'', Normanno and Arturo in ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' among other small parts. While at the National Opera, he also appeared in a production of [[Franz Leh\u00e1r|Leh\u00e1r]]'s [[operetta]], ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', in which he alternated as Camille and Danilo (both originally created as tenor roles, although the latter is often sung by baritones). Domingo made his debut in Verdi's ''[[Otello]]'' at B\u00e9llas Artes at age 21 in the summer of 1962 not in the title r\u00f4le for which he has now been internationally famous for decades as one of its greatest interpreters, but in the small comprimario part of Cassio.\n[[File:Bellas Artes 01.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in [[Mexico City]], where Domingo began his operatic career]]\n\nTo supplement his income, the young Domingo played the piano for a ballet company,  as well as for a program on Mexico's newly founded cultural television station. The program consisted of excerpts from zarzuelas, [[operetta]]s, operas, and musical comedies. He acted in a few small parts while at the theater in plays by [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], and [[Anton Chekhov]].{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=25-6}} He also provided song arrangements and backup vocals for ''Los Camisas Negras'' in the late 1950s, a rock-and-roll band led by [[C\u00e9sar Costa]].{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=27}} In his autobiography, Domingo reflected on the benefits of his busy and varied career as a teenager: \"Today, when people ask me how I manage to hold up under my extremely heavy work load, I answer that I became accustomed to intense activity very early in my life and that I love it now as I loved it then.\"{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=28}}\n\n==Career==\n===1960s\u20131980s===\n\n====Establishing a career in opera====\n\nIn 1961, Domingo made his operatic debut in a leading role as Alfredo in ''[[La traviata]]'' at the Teatro Mar\u00eda Teresa Montoya in [[Monterrey]]. Later the same year, he made his debut in the United States with the [[Dallas Opera|Dallas Civic Opera]], where he sang the role of Arturo in ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' opposite [[Joan Sutherland]] in the title role and [[Ettore Bastianini]] as Enrico. In 1962, he returned to Texas to sing the role of Edgardo in the same opera with [[Lily Pons]] at the [[Fort Worth Opera]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/placido-domingo-about-placido-domingo/573/|title=Placido Domingo &#124; About Placido Domingo &#124; American Masters &#124; PBS|date=December 3, 2002|website=American Masters}}</ref> It would be the soprano's final operatic performance. That November Domingo sang the second tenor role of Cassio to [[Mario del Monaco]]'s celebrated [[Otello]] in [[Hartford]], Connecticut. At the end of 1962, he signed a six-month contract with the [[Israel National Opera]] in [[Tel Aviv]], but later extended the contract and stayed for two and a half years, singing 280 performances of 12 different roles.\n\nIn June 1965, after finishing his contract in Tel Aviv, Domingo auditioned at the [[New York City Opera]]. He was hired to make his New York debut as Don Jos\u00e9 in [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' with the company, but his debut came earlier than expected on 17 June 1965 when he filled in for an ailing tenor at the last minute in [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. In February 1966, he sang the title role in the U.S. premiere of [[Alberto Ginastera|Ginastera]]'s ''[[Don Rodrigo]]'' at the New York City Opera, to much acclaim.{{sfn|Snowman|1985|pp=11, 134-5}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' review noted: \"Mr. Domingo was as impressive as ever\u2014a big, burly, large-voiced singer who looks exactly as one would visualize a hero from Gothic Spain.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schonberg|first1=Harold C.|authorlink=Harold C.

Two years before this ''Adriana Lecouvreur'', he had already performed with the Metropolitan Opera at [[Lewisohn Stadium]] in [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and [[Ruggero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]''. Since then, he has opened the season at the Metropolitan Opera 21 times, more than any other singer, surpassing the previous record of [[Enrico Caruso]] by four.{{sfn|Volpe|2006|p=193}} He has appeared with the company every season since 1968\u20131969. He made his debut at the [[Vienna State Opera]] in 1967; at the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] in 1968; at both [[La Scala]] and [[San Francisco Opera]] in 1969; at Arena di Verona on July 16, 1969 as Calaf (his first) in Turandot with [http://www.birgitnilsson.com/ Birgit Nilsson]; at the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]] in 1970; and at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in 1971. In 1975, Domingo debuted at the prestigious [[Salzburg festival]], singing the title role in ''[[Don Carlos|Don Carlo]]'' in an all-star cast with [[Nicolai Ghiaurov]], [[Piero Cappuccilli]], [[Mirella Freni]] and [[Christa Ludwig]] with [[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting. Thereafter Domingo frequently returned to Salzburg for a number of operas, as well as for several concert performances. He has now sung at practically every important [[opera house]] and festival worldwide.\n[[File:Placidodomingo.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Domingo in Argentina (1979)]]\n\nDomingo first sang Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini's ''[[Tosca]]'' in a 1961 performance in Mexico City.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|p=222}} He sang Cavaradossi at the Met in February 15, 1969 with [http://www.birgitnilsson.com/ Birgit Nilsson] (broadcast). 1971 he made his Covent Garden debut in the role. He continued to sing the part for many years, especially at the Met and in Vienna, eventually performing it more than any other of his roles.<ref>[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/domingo_p.html American Masters: Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]</ref> In September 1975, Domingo debuted in the title role of Verdi's ''Otello'' at the [[Hamburg State Opera]]. It soon became his signature role and one of operas he performed most frequently (over 200 times).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gad|first1=Georges|title=Pl\u00e1cido Domingo l'apoth\u00e9ose [French]|journal= [[Le Monde de la Musique]] |date=February 2001}}</ref> He recorded the part three times in the studio and appeared in four officially released filmed versions of the opera. Oscar-winning Shakespearean actor, [[Laurence Olivier]], declared after seeing the tenor in the role: \"Domingo plays Othello as well as I do ''and'' he has that voice.\"{{sfn|Swan|1982}}\n\nDomingo has also conducted operas and occasionally symphony orchestras as well. On 7 October 1973 he conducted his first opera performance, ''La traviata'' starring [[Patricia Brooks]] at the New York City Opera. The same year he released his debut album as a conductor, ''Domingo Conducts Milnes/Milnes Conducts Domingo'', with baritone [[Sherrill Milnes]]. Domingo increasingly began to appear as a conductor at major opera houses around the world. In late 1983, he led a performance of [[Johan Strauss]]'s ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' at Covent Garden, which was televised. Three years later, he made a studio recording of the [[operetta]], in which he both conducted and sang the role of Alfred.\n\n====Growing celebrity====\n\nThe 1980's were a time of growing success and fame for Domingo. In 1981 he gained considerable recognition outside of the opera world when he recorded the song \"[[Perhaps Love (song)|Perhaps Love]]\" as a duet with the American [[Country music|country]]/[[folk music]] singer [[John Denver]]. He followed this success with many more albums of popular and Latin music. Domingo expressed the hope that his popular albums would expand his fan base in a way that would eventually lead more people to discover opera.{{sfn|Snowman|1985|p=49}} These forays outside of the opera world led to numerous television appearances for the tenor, who was no longer known only by classical music lovers. In 1987, he and Denver joined [[Julie Andrews]] for an [[Emmy Award]]-winning holiday television special, ''The Sound of Christmas'', filmed in [[Salzburg]], Austria. He was interviewed on many talk shows and news programs, including ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Johnny Carson]] and ''[[60 minutes]]''. Increasingly substantial numbers of his operatic performances were also shown on television during the 1980s.\n\nAfter gaining experience acting for the cameras in numerous televised operas, Domingo performed in his first cinematically released opera movie, ''[[La Traviata (1983 film)|La Traviata]]'', in 1982. He had worked with the film's director, former Academy Award nominee [[Franco Zeffirelli]], previously in staged opera productions. Even as filming continued in Rome, he commuted back and forth to perform live in Vienna, Buenos Aires, Barcelona, and Madrid.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=175-9}} In 1984, Domingo filmed the role of Don Jos\u00e9 in [[Francesco Rosi]]'s movie version of ''[[Carmen (1984 film)|Carmen]]'' in his native Spain.{{sfn|Snowman|1985|pp=213-5, 222-4}} Zeffirelli reunited with the tenor two years later for another version of an opera, ''[[Otello (1986 film)|Otello]]'', that ran in movie theaters worldwide. Domingo considered ''Carmen'' the best of the three, although he disagreed with the director's \"low conception\" of his character. He found ''La traviata'' to be \"impressive\", but expressed displeasure over cuts to the music in Zeffirelli's ''Otello''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scovell|first1=Jane|title=Domingo: Giving his Best|journal=[[Opera News]]|date=September 1987}}</ref>\n\nEven while diversifying his career, he continued to appear with great frequency in largely well-received operatic performances. By 1982 ''[[Newsweek]]'' declared Domingo \"King Of The Opera\" on its cover. The magazine's featured article, which recounted and analyzed his career, praised the singer for his \"heroic voice, superb musicianship, fine acting skills and dashing Latin good looks\".{{sfn|Swan|1982}} That same year, Domingo appeared at the Metropolitan Opera's opening night performance of [[Vicenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''. It was the first time onstage that the tenor sang the part of Pollione, one of his rare excursions into the [[bel canto]] repertory. He was also set to open the Met's 1983-1984 centennial season debuting as En\u00e9e in a well publicized new production of [[Berlioz]]' ''[[Les Troyens]]'', but a couple months in advance expressed uncertainty whether he could successful sing the role's high tessitura without harming his voice.<ref name=NYT1983>{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Holland|title=Domingo 'Almost' Sure to Open Met|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/20/arts/domingo-almost-sure-to-open-met.html|accessdate=14 August 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 September 1983}}</ref> He asked to be released from his contract, but eventually decided to sing four of the six performances in the run with his friend [[James Levine]] conducting,<ref name=NYT1983 /> including one performance that was telecast.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Almquist|first1=Sharon G.|title=Opera Mediagraphy: Video Recordings and Motion Pictures|date=1993|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0313284903|page=170}}</ref> He never sang the part again.{{sfn|Matheopoulos|Domingo|2003|p=212}}\n\nDuring rehearsals for ''Les Troyens'', Domingo rescued the opening night of the [[San Francisco Opera]]'s season. The tenor scheduled to sing Otello, [[Carlo Cossutta]], cancelled on the day of the performance. The company asked Domingo to replace him at 4 p.m. He quickly flew from New York to San Francisco, rushed to the opera house, and appeared in the role at 10:30 in the evening. A writer for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', among other journalists, reported extensively on the event. He observed the crowds gathering around the stage door for the tenor's arrival and remarked on how most of the waiting audience members \"were breathless over the chance to see Placido Domingo, a star who draws the kind of rapt devotion that [[Mick Jagger]] inspires among rock fans.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hartlaub|first1=Peter|last2=Shilts|first2=Randy|title=Our SF: An inebriated crowd awaits Placido Domingo's arrival|url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Our-SF-An-inebriated-crowd-awaits-Placido-6458546.php|accessdate=2 September 2015|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle|SFGate]]|date=22 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pl\u00e1cido Domingo backstage at the Washington National Opera (November 3, 2002).jpg|upright|thumb|Backstage at the [[Washington National Opera]] after the opening night of ''[[Idomeneo]]'' on 3 November 2002]]\n\nFor the opening night of the following Met season, Domingo returned to the role of Wagner's ''[[Lohengrin]]'', which he had last sung in early 1968. He had originally dropped the role from his repertoire after he felt his voice had been temporarily damaged by learning the challenging opera. ''The New York Times'' noted that the now more mature artist \"lacked the chrome-plated, penetrating quality that one associates with German tenors\", but praised him for bringing \"an unusual [[legato]] grace to a role that is seldom sung so beautifully\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Henahan|first1=Donal|authorlink=Donal Henahan|title=Met opener passes tests|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 September 1984}}</ref> He also performed the role at the Vienna State Opera in 1985 and 1990. A performance during his last run of the opera was televised on 28 january 1990 and later released on VHS and DVD. He had just recovered from the flu at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Norton-Welsh|first1=Christopher|title=Vienna, Lohengrin|magazine=[[Opera (magazine)|Opera]]|date=May 1990|location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 september 1985 the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|biggest earthquake in Mexico's history]] devastated part of the Mexican capital. Domingo's aunt, uncle, nephew and his nephew's young son were killed in the collapse of the Nuevo Le\u00f3n apartment block in the [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] housing complex. Cancelling several performances, Domingo himself labored to rescue survivors. During the next year, he performed [[benefit concert]]s for the victims and released an album of one of the events. Also in 1986 he appeared in a special gala concert for [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and in the world premiere of ''Goya'', an opera that [[Gian Carlo Menotti]] composed specifically for him. Domingo had encouraged Menotti to make the opera about the Spanish painter [[Francisco Goya]], whose life fascinated the singer.\n\n===Since 1990===\n\n====Changing repertoire====\n\n[[File:Opera singer Placido Domingo (left) with opera star Stacey Robinson in 1994.jpg|thumb|right|Domingo with American opera star and activist Stacey Robinson in 1994]]\nSince the 1990's Domingo has continued adding new roles to his growing repertoire, while dropping earlier parts. The 1990's were the start of rapid change in the types of roles the tenor performed. During this decade he sang his last Cavaradossi, Don Carlo, Don Jos\u00e9, [[Un ballo in maschera|Gustavo/Riccardo]], Hoffmann, and [[La forza del destino|Alvaro]], among others, and he began instead to expand the breadth of his roles more substantially beyond the standard Italian and French repertory. In particular, he increased his involvement in [[Wagnerian]] operas. Although he had already sung [[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]] and recorded a few operas by the composer, he did not perform any of Wagner's works frequently onstage until he debuted as [[Parsifal]] in 1991 and [[Die Walk\u00fcre|Siegmund]] in 1992. He continued to sing these roles for almost two decades, including at the [[Bayreuth Festival]].\n[[File:TAMERLANO (Liceu 2010-11) \"Empio, per farti guerra\".webm|thumb|Domingo sings \"Empio, per farti guerra\" from [[George Frideric Handel]]'s ''[[Tamerlano]]'' at the [[Liceu]] in the 2010\u20132011 season]]\n\nFor the first time in over three decades, Domingo debuted in a [[Mozart]] opera, ''[[Idomeneo]]'', in 1994 at the Met. During the nineties, he also appeared in the early Verdi opera, ''[[Stiffelio]]'', the Brazilian ''[[Il Guarany]]'', and the [[Grand opera|French grand operas]], ''[[H\u00e9rodiade]]'' and ''[[Le proph\u00e8te (opera)|Le proph\u00e8te]]'', all of which are rarely performed. Toward the end of the decade, he added his first Russian-language opera, [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (although he had performed ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' in translation while in Israel early in his career).\n\nIn the 2000's, he sang his last performances of some of the most successful operas from early in his career: ''[[Andrea Chenier]]'', ''[[Samson et Dalila]]'', ''Otello'', ''[[La Fanciulla del West]]'', ''[[Fedora]]'', ''[[Pagliacci]]'', and ''Adriana Lecouvreur''. In the twenty-first century, however, he has focused mostly on new roles. Early in the 2000's he sang the role of Arrigo in two concert performances of Verdi's rare ''[[La battaglia di Legnano]]'' and debuted in [[Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari|Wolf-Ferrari]]'s ''[[Sly (opera)|Sly]]'', an opera that his Three Tenors colleague Jos\u00e9 Carreras had recently revived from obscurity. Domingo himself worked to popularize [[Franco Alfano]]'s infrequently performed ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (Alfano)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' a few years later. Shifting musical styles again, he appeared in the eighteenth-century operas ''[[Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride]]'' and ''[[Tamerlano]]'' late in the decade.\n[[File:Placido Domingo, Buenos Aires concert 2011.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Domingo singing at a concert at the [[Obelisco de Buenos Aires|Obelisco]] in [[Buenos Aires]] in 2011]]\n\nAdditionally, Domingo created several new roles in modern operas, such as the title role in [[Tan Dun]]'s 2006 opera ''[[The First Emperor]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], which was broadcast worldwide into movie theaters as part of the [[Metropolitan Opera Live in HD|Met Live in HD]] series.

As a teenager, he first appeared in very small parts on the Spanish-language [[Cast recording|original cast versions]] of the musicals ''My Fair Lady'' (1959) and ''[[Redhead (musical)|Redhead]]'' (1960). In 1968, he released his first solo album, ''Recital of Italian Operatic Arias'' (also known as ''Bel Canto Domingo''). The album, conducted by [[Nello Santi]], received the [[Grand Prix du Disque]]. In 1969,  Domingo recorded his first recital album  and his first complete opera in the studio, ''[[Il trovatore]]'', with [[Leontyne Price]] and [[Sherrill Milnes]], both for [[RCA Red Seal]], which would be his primary record label throughout the entire 1970s; Milnes and Price recorded with Domingo several more times, both in complete operas and recital discs. Domingo followed ''Il trovatore'' with a steady stream of complete recorded operas from the 1970s through the early years of the next century. Starting with ''[[Il tabarro]]'' in 1970 and ending with ''[[Edgar (opera)|Edgar]]'' in 2006, Domingo has recorded all of Puccini's operatic roles for tenor. Among his albums is a box set of every major tenor aria [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] composed, including several obscure and rarely performed versions in languages different from the original operas, and written only for specific performances. He has also recorded the vocal parts in many symphonic works and has conducted on some of his albums.\n[[File:Placido-Domingo-Jr.jpg|thumb|upright|Domingo has recorded many compositions by his singer-songwriter son, [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo Jr.]] (pictured here in a publicity photo)]]\n\nIn August 2005, EMI Classics released a highly anticipated and publicized studio recording of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', in which Domingo and Operalia winner [[Nina Stemme]] sang the title roles. A review, headlined \"Vocal perfections\", in the 8 August 2005 issue of ''[[The Economist]]'' called the recording \"monumental\" and praised it for having \"a musical lyricism and a sexual passion that make the cost and the effort entirely worthwhile\". The review also characterized Domingo's July 2005 performance of Siegmund in Wagner's ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'' at Covent Garden as \"unforgettable\" and \"luminous\".

[[Vienna]] was chosen to host the event due to its reputation as a capital of music and the particular charm of Austria during Christmas time. The [[Wiener Symphoniker]] under the direction of maestro [[Vjekoslav \u0160utej]] provided the orchestral music, and the Gumpoldskirchen Children's Choir provided choral vocals. On 23 December 1992, the first in what would turn out to be a series of ''Christmas in Vienna'' concerts was seen worldwide by several hundred million people. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo returned to Vienna for many more ''Christmas in Vienna'' concerts, performing with stars and friends of both pop and classical music, including [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Charlotte Church]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Riccardo Cocciante]], [[Patricia Kaas]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Tony Bennett]] and others.\n\n==Cultural references==\n\n[[File:Pl\u00e1cido Domingo at the Washington National Opera after Die Walk\u00fcre (April 14, 2007).jpg|right|upright|thumb|At the [[Washington National Opera]] on 14 April 2007 after a performance of ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'', his most frequently performed [[German opera]]]]\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, [[popular culture|popular cultural]] forms, especially television programs, began to reference Domingo, often as a prototypical opera singer or as part of the influential Three Tenors.{{sfn|Am\u00f3n|2011}} In 1987 ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a U.S. children's television show that has been on the air since 1969, introduced a puppet character named after Domingo.

Although not opera related, one of the Three Emperors (a take-off on the Three Tenors) in the original Japanese version of the [[anime]] series, ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' (2008-2011), is also named after the singer.\n\nIn 2007, Domingo had a [[cameo role]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the longest running American scripted prime time television series and winner of over thirty [[Emmy Awards]]. He provided the voice for an animated version of himself in the episode \"[[Homer of Seville]]\", which revolves around [[Homer Simpson]] becoming an opera singer. After an opera performance, Homer chats with Domingo, who tells him to call him \"P. Dingo\" (a play on \"[[P. Diddy]]\") and asks him for singing advice. Although not providing voice-overs, he was also an animated character in a 1995 episode (\"Three Tenors and You're Out\") of the [[Warner Brothers]] children's cartoon, ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and a 1999 episode (\"Censoring Problems: The Three Stooges vs. The Three Tenors\") of [[MTV]]'s violent comedy, ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]''.\n\nDomingo, along with Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras, loosely inspired the 2001 biting English-language film, ''[[Off Key]]'', by Spanish director [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pereira]].<ref name=Variety>{{cite news|last=Jonathan Holland|title=Film Reviews \u2013 ''Off-Key''|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/off-key-1200552294/|accessdate=6 August 2015|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 12, 2001}}</ref><ref name=Vanguardia /> The movie's leading character, Ricardo Palacios (played by [[Joe Mantegna]]), is a Spanish tenor with vague ties to Mexico, who plays the piano, conducts, seeks celebrity outside of the opera world, and is proud of his Otello.

In the book, Meredith's young daughter is an enthusiastic fan of Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and has the detective read to her from an [[unauthorized biography]] of the singer. The real-life Domingo was also mentioned as part of a running gag on the 1996 ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode, \"[[The Doll (Seinfeld)|The Doll]]\". ''Seinfeld'' was the second highest rated series on U.S. television at the time. He was also referenced several times throughout the sitcom series ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' as Raymond's mother, Marie's, favorite opera singer. In addition, the tenor has appeared on the cover of several opera-related books, as a key representative of the musical genre. Such mainstream allusions to Domingo illustrate his atypically widespread fame and cultural influence as an opera singer. His integration both as an actual performer and as an \"image\" into popular as well as [[high culture]] was so significant by 2011, Spanish author Rub\u00e9n Am\u00f3n wrote a book, ''Pl\u00e1cido Domingo: Un coloso en el teatro del mundo'', specifically analyzing the singer as a cultural and sociological phenomenon.{{sfn|Am\u00f3n|2011}}<ref>{{cite web|title=La biograf\u00eda de Pl\u00e1cido Domingo escrita por Rub\u00e9n Am\u00f3n|url=http://www.thecult.es/Musica-clasica/la-biografia-de-placido-domingo-escrita-por-ruben-amon.html|website=The Cult|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=27 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Repertoire==\n{{Main|Repertoire of Pl\u00e1cido Domingo}}\n\nDomingo has sung 151 roles in Italian, French, German, English, Spanish and Russian.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-gato-montes-opera-review-20190506-story.html Review: In his 151st role, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo plays the \u2018wild cat\u2019 as old lion]</ref><ref>[http://operachaser.blogspot.com/2019/05/domingos-151st-role-accompanies.html Domingo's 151st role]</ref> His main repertoire however is Italian (''[[Otello]]''; Cavaradossi in ''[[Tosca]]''; ''[[Don Carlos|Don Carlo]]''; Des Grieux in ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]''; Dick Johnson in ''[[La fanciulla del West]]''; Radames in ''[[Aida]]''); French (Don Jos\u00e9 in ''[[Carmen]]''; Samson in ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]''; Hoffmann in ''[[Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]''); and German (''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', ''[[Parsifal]]'', and Siegmund in ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'').

His parents, both singers, had decided to start a zarzuela company there after a successful tour of Latin America. Soon after arriving in Mexico, Domingo won a singing contest for boys, and his parents occasionally recruited him and his sister for children's roles in their zarzuela productions.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=10-13}} Domingo studied piano from a young age, at first privately and later at the [[National Conservatory of Music of Mexico|National Conservatory of Music]] in [[Mexico City]], which he entered when he was fourteen.

In his first performance as a tenor, Domingo replaced the ailing singer, although he feared the part's tessitura was too high for him.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=20}} Later that same year, he sang the tenor role of Rafael in the Spanish opera ''[[El gato mont\u00e9s]]'', illustrating his willingness to assay the tenor range, even as he still considered himself a baritone. On 12 May 1959 at the [[Teatro Degollado]] in [[Guadalajara]], he appeared in the baritone role (sometimes sung by basses) of Pascual in [[Emilio Arrieta]]'s {{Interlanguage link multi|Marina (zarzuela and opera)|es|3=Marina (\u00f3pera)|lt=''Marina''}}. Like ''El gato mont\u00e9s'', ''Marina'' is an opera composed in the zarzuela musical style rather than a zarzuela proper, although both are usually performed by zarzuela companies. In addition to his work with zarzuelas, among his earliest performances was a minor role in the first Latin American production of the musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', in which he was also the assistant conductor and assistant coach.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=20-2}} While he was a member, the company gave 185 performances of the musical in various cities in Mexico.\n\n[[File:Otello_1962.jpg|thumb|left|Domingo made his debut in Verdi's ''Otello'' at Bellas Artes in the comprimario r\u00f4le of Cassio in 1962]]\nIn 1959, Domingo auditioned for the Mexico National Opera at the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Palacio de B\u00e9llas Artes]] as a baritone, but was then asked to sight-read the tenor aria \"Amor ti vieta\" from ''[[Fedora (opera)|Fedora]]''. He was accepted at the National Opera as a tenor comprimario and as a tutor for other singers.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=23}} In what he considered his operatic debut, Domingo sang the minor role of Borsa in [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] ''[[Rigoletto]]'' on September 23 at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in a production with veteran American baritone [[Cornell MacNeil]] and bass-baritone [[Norman Treigle]]. He later appeared as the Padre Confessor in ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites]]'', Altoum and Pang in ''[[Turandot]]'', Normanno and Arturo in ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' among other small parts. While at the National Opera, he also appeared in a production of [[Franz Leh\u00e1r|Leh\u00e1r]]'s [[operetta]], ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', in which he alternated as Camille and Danilo (both originally created as tenor roles, although the latter is often sung by baritones). Domingo made his debut in Verdi's ''[[Otello]]'' at B\u00e9llas Artes at age 21 in the summer of 1962 not in the title r\u00f4le for which he has now been internationally famous for decades as one of its greatest interpreters, but in the small comprimario part of Cassio.\n[[File:Bellas Artes 01.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in [[Mexico City]], where Domingo began his operatic career]]\n\nTo supplement his income, the young Domingo played the piano for a ballet company,  as well as for a program on Mexico's newly founded cultural television station. The program consisted of excerpts from zarzuelas, [[operetta]]s, operas, and musical comedies. He acted in a few small parts while at the theater in plays by [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], and [[Anton Chekhov]].{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=25-6}} He also provided song arrangements and backup vocals for ''Los Camisas Negras'' in the late 1950s, a rock-and-roll band led by [[C\u00e9sar Costa]].{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=27}} In his autobiography, Domingo reflected on the benefits of his busy and varied career as a teenager: \"Today, when people ask me how I manage to hold up under my extremely heavy work load, I answer that I became accustomed to intense activity very early in my life and that I love it now as I loved it then.\"{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=28}}\n\n==Career==\n===1960s\u20131980s===\n\n====Establishing a career in opera====\n\nIn 1961, Domingo made his operatic debut in a leading role as Alfredo in ''[[La traviata]]'' at the Teatro Mar\u00eda Teresa Montoya in [[Monterrey]].

That November Domingo sang the second tenor role of Cassio to [[Mario del Monaco]]'s celebrated [[Otello]] in [[Hartford]], Connecticut. At the end of 1962, he signed a six-month contract with the [[Israel National Opera]] in [[Tel Aviv]], but later extended the contract and stayed for two and a half years, singing 280 performances of 12 different roles.\n\nIn June 1965, after finishing his contract in Tel Aviv, Domingo auditioned at the [[New York City Opera]]. He was hired to make his New York debut as Don Jos\u00e9 in [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' with the company, but his debut came earlier than expected on 17 June 1965 when he filled in for an ailing tenor at the last minute in [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. In February 1966, he sang the title role in the U.S. premiere of [[Alberto Ginastera|Ginastera]]'s ''[[Don Rodrigo]]'' at the New York City Opera, to much acclaim.{{sfn|Snowman|1985|pp=11, 134-5}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' review noted: \"Mr. Domingo was as impressive as ever\u2014a big, burly, large-voiced singer who looks exactly as one would visualize a hero from Gothic Spain.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Schonberg|first1=Harold C.|authorlink=Harold C.

Two years before this ''Adriana Lecouvreur'', he had already performed with the Metropolitan Opera at [[Lewisohn Stadium]] in [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and [[Ruggero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]''. Since then, he has opened the season at the Metropolitan Opera 21 times, more than any other singer, surpassing the previous record of [[Enrico Caruso]] by four.{{sfn|Volpe|2006|p=193}} He has appeared with the company every season since 1968\u20131969. He made his debut at the [[Vienna State Opera]] in 1967; at the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] in 1968; at both [[La Scala]] and [[San Francisco Opera]] in 1969; at Arena di Verona on July 16, 1969 as Calaf (his first) in Turandot with [http://www.birgitnilsson.com/ Birgit Nilsson]; at the [[Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company]] in 1970; and at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in 1971. In 1975, Domingo debuted at the prestigious [[Salzburg festival]], singing the title role in ''[[Don Carlos|Don Carlo]]'' in an all-star cast with [[Nicolai Ghiaurov]], [[Piero Cappuccilli]], [[Mirella Freni]] and [[Christa Ludwig]] with [[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting. Thereafter Domingo frequently returned to Salzburg for a number of operas, as well as for several concert performances. He has now sung at practically every important [[opera house]] and festival worldwide.\n[[File:Placidodomingo.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Domingo in Argentina (1979)]]\n\nDomingo first sang Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini's ''[[Tosca]]'' in a 1961 performance in Mexico City.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|p=222}} He sang Cavaradossi at the Met in February 15, 1969 with [http://www.birgitnilsson.com/ Birgit Nilsson] (broadcast). 1971 he made his Covent Garden debut in the role.

It soon became his signature role and one of operas he performed most frequently (over 200 times).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gad|first1=Georges|title=Pl\u00e1cido Domingo l'apoth\u00e9ose [French]|journal= [[Le Monde de la Musique]] |date=February 2001}}</ref> He recorded the part three times in the studio and appeared in four officially released filmed versions of the opera. Oscar-winning Shakespearean actor, [[Laurence Olivier]], declared after seeing the tenor in the role: \"Domingo plays Othello as well as I do ''and'' he has that voice.\"{{sfn|Swan|1982}}\n\nDomingo has also conducted operas and occasionally symphony orchestras as well. On 7 October 1973 he conducted his first opera performance, ''La traviata'' starring [[Patricia Brooks]] at the New York City Opera. The same year he released his debut album as a conductor, ''Domingo Conducts Milnes/Milnes Conducts Domingo'', with baritone [[Sherrill Milnes]]. Domingo increasingly began to appear as a conductor at major opera houses around the world. In late 1983, he led a performance of [[Johan Strauss]]'s ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' at Covent Garden, which was televised. Three years later, he made a studio recording of the [[operetta]], in which he both conducted and sang the role of Alfred.\n\n====Growing celebrity====\n\nThe 1980s were a time of growing success and fame for Domingo. In 1981 he gained considerable recognition outside of the opera world when he recorded the song \"[[Perhaps Love (song)|Perhaps Love]]\" as a duet with the American [[Country music|country]]/[[folk music]] singer [[John Denver]]. He followed this success with many more albums of popular and Latin music. Domingo expressed the hope that his popular albums would expand his fan base in a way that would eventually lead more people to discover opera.{{sfn|Snowman|1985|p=49}} These forays outside of the opera world led to numerous television appearances for the tenor, who was no longer known only by classical music lovers. In 1987, he and Denver joined [[Julie Andrews]] for an [[Emmy Award]]-winning holiday television special, ''The Sound of Christmas'', filmed in [[Salzburg]], Austria. He was interviewed on many talk shows and news programs, including ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Johnny Carson]] and ''[[60 minutes]]''. Increasingly substantial numbers of his operatic performances were also shown on television during the 1980s.\n\nAfter gaining experience acting for the cameras in numerous televised operas, Domingo performed in his first cinematically released opera movie, ''[[La Traviata (1983 film)|La Traviata]]'', in 1982. He had worked with the film's director, former Academy Award nominee [[Franco Zeffirelli]], previously in staged opera productions. Even as filming continued in Rome, he commuted back and forth to perform live in Vienna, Buenos Aires, Barcelona, and Madrid.{{sfn|Domingo|1983|pp=175-9}} In 1984, Domingo filmed the role of Don Jos\u00e9 in [[Francesco Rosi]]'s movie version of ''[[Carmen (1984 film)|Carmen]]'' in his native Spain.{{sfn|Snowman|1985|pp=213-5, 222-4}} Zeffirelli reunited with the tenor two years later for another version of an opera, ''[[Otello (1986 film)|Otello]]'', that ran in movie theaters worldwide. Domingo considered ''Carmen'' the best of the three, although he disagreed with the director's \"low conception\" of his character. He found ''La traviata'' to be \"impressive\", but expressed displeasure over cuts to the music in Zeffirelli's ''Otello''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scovell|first1=Jane|title=Domingo: Giving his Best|journal=[[Opera News]]|date=September 1987}}</ref>\n\nEven while diversifying his career, he continued to appear with great frequency in largely well-received operatic performances. By 1982 ''[[Newsweek]]'' declared Domingo \"King Of The Opera\" on its cover. The magazine's featured article, which recounted and analyzed his career, praised the singer for his \"heroic voice, superb musicianship, fine acting skills and dashing Latin good looks\".{{sfn|Swan|1982}} That same year, Domingo appeared at the Metropolitan Opera's opening night performance of [[Vicenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''. It was the first time onstage that the tenor sang the part of Pollione, one of his rare excursions into the [[bel canto]] repertory. He was also set to open the Met's 1983-1984 centennial season debuting as En\u00e9e in a well publicized new production of [[Berlioz]]' ''[[Les Troyens]]'', but a couple months in advance expressed uncertainty whether he could successful sing the role's high tessitura without harming his voice.<ref name=NYT1983>{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Holland|title=Domingo 'Almost' Sure to Open Met|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/20/arts/domingo-almost-sure-to-open-met.html|accessdate=14 August 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 September 1983}}</ref> He asked to be released from his contract, but eventually decided to sing four of the six performances in the run with his friend [[James Levine]] conducting,<ref name=NYT1983 /> including one performance that was telecast.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Almquist|first1=Sharon G.|title=Opera Mediagraphy: Video Recordings and Motion Pictures|date=1993|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0313284903|page=170}}</ref> He never sang the part again.{{sfn|Matheopoulos|Domingo|2003|p=212}}\n\nDuring rehearsals for ''Les Troyens'', Domingo rescued the opening night of the [[San Francisco Opera]]'s season.

The company asked Domingo to replace him at 4 p.m. He quickly flew from New York to San Francisco, rushed to the opera house, and appeared in the role at 10:30 in the evening. A writer for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', among other journalists, reported extensively on the event. He observed the crowds gathering around the stage door for the tenor's arrival and remarked on how most of the waiting audience members \"were breathless over the chance to see Placido Domingo, a star who draws the kind of rapt devotion that [[Mick Jagger]] inspires among rock fans.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hartlaub|first1=Peter|last2=Shilts|first2=Randy|title=Our SF: An inebriated crowd awaits Placido Domingo's arrival|url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Our-SF-An-inebriated-crowd-awaits-Placido-6458546.php|accessdate=2 September 2015|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle|SFGate]]|date=22 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pl\u00e1cido Domingo backstage at the Washington National Opera (November 3, 2002).jpg|upright|thumb|Backstage at the [[Washington National Opera]] after the opening night of ''[[Idomeneo]]'' on 3 November 2002]]\n\nFor the opening night of the following Met season, Domingo returned to the role of Wagner's ''[[Lohengrin]]'', which he had last sung in early 1968. He had originally dropped the role from his repertoire after he felt his voice had been temporarily damaged by learning the challenging opera. ''The New York Times'' noted that the now more mature artist \"lacked the chrome-plated, penetrating quality that one associates with German tenors\", but praised him for bringing \"an unusual [[legato]] grace to a role that is seldom sung so beautifully\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Henahan|first1=Donal|authorlink=Donal Henahan|title=Met opener passes tests|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 September 1984}}</ref> He also performed the role at the Vienna State Opera in 1985 and 1990.

Domingo's aunt, uncle, nephew and his nephew's young son were killed in the collapse of the Nuevo Le\u00f3n apartment block in the [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] housing complex. Cancelling several performances, Domingo himself labored to rescue survivors. During the next year, he performed [[benefit concert]]s for the victims and released an album of one of the events. Also in 1986 he appeared in a special gala concert for [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and in the world premiere of ''Goya'', an opera that [[Gian Carlo Menotti]] composed specifically for him. Domingo had encouraged Menotti to make the opera about the Spanish painter [[Francisco Goya]], whose life fascinated the singer.\n\n===Since 1990===\n\n====Changing repertoire====\n\n[[File:Opera singer Placido Domingo (left) with opera star Stacey Robinson in 1994.jpg|thumb|right|Domingo with American opera star and activist Stacey Robinson in 1994]]\nSince the 1990s Domingo has continued adding new roles to his growing repertoire, while dropping earlier parts. The 1990s were the start of rapid change in the types of roles the tenor performed. During this decade he sang his last Cavaradossi, Don Carlo, Don Jos\u00e9, [[Un ballo in maschera|Gustavo/Riccardo]], Hoffmann, and [[La forza del destino|Alvaro]], among others, and he began instead to expand the breadth of his roles more substantially beyond the standard Italian and French repertory. In particular, he increased his involvement in [[Wagnerian]] operas. Although he had already sung [[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]] and recorded a few operas by the composer, he did not perform any of Wagner's works frequently onstage until he debuted as [[Parsifal]] in 1991 and [[Die Walk\u00fcre|Siegmund]] in 1992. He continued to sing these roles for almost two decades, including at the [[Bayreuth Festival]].\n[[File:TAMERLANO (Liceu 2010-11) \"Empio, per farti guerra\".webm|thumb|Domingo sings \"Empio, per farti guerra\" from [[George Frideric Handel]]'s ''[[Tamerlano]]'' at the [[Liceu]] in the 2010\u20132011 season]]\n\nFor the first time in over three decades, Domingo debuted in a [[Mozart]] opera, ''[[Idomeneo]]'', in 1994 at the Met. During the nineties, he also appeared in the early Verdi opera, ''[[Stiffelio]]'', the Brazilian ''[[Il Guarany]]'', and the [[Grand opera|French grand operas]], ''[[H\u00e9rodiade]]'' and ''[[Le proph\u00e8te (opera)|Le proph\u00e8te]]'', all of which are rarely performed. Toward the end of the decade, he added his first Russian-language opera, [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (although he had performed ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' in translation while in Israel early in his career).\n\nIn the 2000s, he sang his last performances of some of the most successful operas from early in his career: ''[[Andrea Chenier]]'', ''[[Samson et Dalila]]'', ''Otello'', ''[[La Fanciulla del West]]'', ''[[Fedora]]'', ''[[Pagliacci]]'', and ''Adriana Lecouvreur''. In the twenty-first century, however, he has focused mostly on new roles. Early in the 2000s he sang the role of Arrigo in two concert performances of Verdi's rare ''[[La battaglia di Legnano]]'' and debuted in [[Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari|Wolf-Ferrari]]'s ''[[Sly (opera)|Sly]]'', an opera that his Three Tenors colleague Jos\u00e9 Carreras had recently revived from obscurity. Domingo himself worked to popularize [[Franco Alfano]]'s infrequently performed ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (Alfano)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' a few years later. Shifting musical styles again, he appeared in the eighteenth-century operas ''[[Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride]]'' and ''[[Tamerlano]]'' late in the decade.\n[[File:Placido Domingo, Buenos Aires concert 2011.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Domingo singing at a concert at the [[Obelisco de Buenos Aires|Obelisco]] in [[Buenos Aires]] in 2011]]\n\nAdditionally, Domingo created several new roles in modern operas, such as the title role in [[Tan Dun]]'s 2006 opera ''[[The First Emperor]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]], which was broadcast worldwide into movie theaters as part of the [[Metropolitan Opera Live in HD|Met Live in HD]] series.

As a teenager, he first appeared in very small parts on the Spanish-language [[Cast recording|original cast versions]] of the musicals ''My Fair Lady'' (1959) and ''[[Redhead (musical)|Redhead]]'' (1960). In 1968, he released his first solo album, ''Recital of Italian Operatic Arias'' (also known as ''Bel Canto Domingo''). The album, conducted by [[Nello Santi]], received the [[Grand Prix du Disque]]. In 1969,  Domingo recorded his first recital album  and his first complete opera in the studio, ''[[Il trovatore]]'', with [[Leontyne Price]] and [[Sherrill Milnes]], both for [[RCA Red Seal]], which would be his primary record label throughout the entire 1970s; Milnes and Price recorded with Domingo several more times, both in complete operas and recital discs. Domingo followed ''Il trovatore'' with a steady stream of complete recorded operas from the 1970s through the early years of the next century. Starting with ''[[Il tabarro]]'' in 1970 and ending with ''[[Edgar (opera)|Edgar]]'' in 2006, Domingo has recorded all of Puccini's operatic roles for tenor. Among his albums is a box set of every major tenor aria [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] composed, including several obscure and rarely performed versions in languages different from the original operas, and written only for specific performances. He has also recorded the vocal parts in many symphonic works and has conducted on some of his albums.\n[[File:Placido-Domingo-Jr.jpg|thumb|upright|Domingo has recorded many compositions by his singer-songwriter son, [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo Jr.]] (pictured here in a publicity photo)]]\n\nIn August 2005, EMI Classics released a highly anticipated and publicized studio recording of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', in which Domingo and Operalia winner [[Nina Stemme]] sang the title roles. A review, headlined \"Vocal perfections\", in the 8 August 2005 issue of ''[[The Economist]]'' called the recording \"monumental\" and praised it for having \"a musical lyricism and a sexual passion that make the cost and the effort entirely worthwhile\". The review also characterized Domingo's July 2005 performance of Siegmund in Wagner's ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'' at Covent Garden as \"unforgettable\" and \"luminous\".

[[Vienna]] was chosen to host the event due to its reputation as a capital of music and the particular charm of Austria during Christmas time. The [[Wiener Symphoniker]] under the direction of maestro [[Vjekoslav \u0160utej]] provided the orchestral music, and the Gumpoldskirchen Children's Choir provided choral vocals. On 23 December 1992, the first in what would turn out to be a series of ''Christmas in Vienna'' concerts was seen worldwide by several hundred million people. Pl\u00e1cido Domingo returned to Vienna for many more ''Christmas in Vienna'' concerts, performing with stars and friends of both pop and classical music, including [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Charlotte Church]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Riccardo Cocciante]], [[Patricia Kaas]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Tony Bennett]] and others.\n\n==Cultural references==\n\n[[File:Pl\u00e1cido Domingo at the Washington National Opera after Die Walk\u00fcre (April 14, 2007).jpg|right|upright|thumb|At the [[Washington National Opera]] on 14 April 2007 after a performance of ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'', his most frequently performed [[German opera]]]]\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, [[popular culture|popular cultural]] forms, especially television programs, began to reference Domingo, often as a prototypical opera singer or as part of the influential Three Tenors.{{sfn|Am\u00f3n|2011}} In 1987 ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a U.S. children's television show that has been on the air since 1969, introduced a puppet character named after Domingo.

Although not opera related, one of the Three Emperors (a take-off on the Three Tenors) in the original Japanese version of the [[anime]] series, ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'' (2008-2011), is also named after the singer.\n\nIn 2007, Domingo had a [[cameo role]] on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the longest running American scripted prime time television series and winner of over thirty [[Emmy Awards]]. He provided the voice for an animated version of himself in the episode \"[[Homer of Seville]]\", which revolves around [[Homer Simpson]] becoming an opera singer. After an opera performance, Homer chats with Domingo, who tells him to call him \"P. Dingo\" (a play on \"[[P. Diddy]]\") and asks him for singing advice. Although not providing voice-overs, he was also an animated character in a 1995 episode (\"Three Tenors and You're Out\") of the [[Warner Brothers]] children's cartoon, ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and a 1999 episode (\"Censoring Problems: The Three Stooges vs. The Three Tenors\") of [[MTV]]'s violent comedy, ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]''.\n\nDomingo, along with Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras, loosely inspired the 2001 biting English-language film, ''[[Off Key]]'', by Spanish director [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pereira]].<ref name=Variety>{{cite news|last=Jonathan Holland|title=Film Reviews \u2013 ''Off-Key''|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/off-key-1200552294/|accessdate=6 August 2015|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 12, 2001}}</ref><ref name=Vanguardia /> The movie's leading character, Ricardo Palacios (played by [[Joe Mantegna]]), is a Spanish tenor with vague ties to Mexico, who plays the piano, conducts, seeks celebrity outside of the opera world, and is proud of his Otello.

In the book, Meredith's young daughter is an enthusiastic fan of Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and has the detective read to her from an [[unauthorized biography]] of the singer. The real-life Domingo was also mentioned as part of a running gag on the 1996 ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode, \"[[The Doll (Seinfeld)|The Doll]]\". ''Seinfeld'' was the second highest rated series on U.S. television at the time. He was also referenced several times throughout the sitcom series ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' as Raymond's mother, Marie's, favorite opera singer. In addition, the tenor has appeared on the cover of several opera-related books, as a key representative of the musical genre. Such mainstream allusions to Domingo illustrate his atypically widespread fame and cultural influence as an opera singer. His integration both as an actual performer and as an \"image\" into popular as well as [[high culture]] was so significant by 2011, Spanish author Rub\u00e9n Am\u00f3n wrote a book, ''Pl\u00e1cido Domingo: Un coloso en el teatro del mundo'', specifically analyzing the singer as a cultural and sociological phenomenon.{{sfn|Am\u00f3n|2011}}<ref>{{cite web|title=La biograf\u00eda de Pl\u00e1cido Domingo escrita por Rub\u00e9n Am\u00f3n|url=http://www.thecult.es/Musica-clasica/la-biografia-de-placido-domingo-escrita-por-ruben-amon.html|website=The Cult|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=27 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Repertoire==\n{{Main|Repertoire of Pl\u00e1cido Domingo}}\n\nDomingo has sung 151 roles in Italian, French, German, English, Spanish and Russian.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-gato-montes-opera-review-20190506-story.html Review: In his 151st role, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo plays the \u2018wild cat\u2019 as old lion]</ref><ref>[http://operachaser.blogspot.com/2019/05/domingos-151st-role-accompanies.html Domingo's 151st role]</ref> His main repertoire however is Italian (''[[Otello]]''; Cavaradossi in ''[[Tosca]]''; ''[[Don Carlos|Don Carlo]]''; Des Grieux in ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]''; Dick Johnson in ''[[La fanciulla del West]]''; Radames in ''[[Aida]]''); French (Don Jos\u00e9 in ''[[Carmen]]''; Samson in ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]''; Hoffmann in ''[[Les Contes d'Hoffmann]]''); and German (''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', ''[[Parsifal]]'', and Siegmund in ''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]'').

In 1993 he founded [[Operalia, The World Opera Competition]], an international opera competition for talented young singers. The winners get the opportunity to be employed in opera ensembles around the world.<ref>[http://www.operaliacompetition.org/placido Domingo describes his Operalia program]. operaliacompetition.org.

In particular, Domingo has performed frequently with Mexican tenor [[Rolando Villaz\u00f3n]], who won three prizes at the 1999 Operalia competition.\n\nBeyond Operalia, Domingo has been instrumental in giving many young artists encouragement and special attention, as in 2001, when he invited the so-called \"Singing Policeman\", New York tenor [[Daniel Rodr\u00edguez (tenor)|Daniel Rodr\u00edguez]], to attend the Vilar-Domingo Young Artists program to develop his operatic skills.\n\nIn addition to the Vilar-Domingo Young Artists Program in Washington, D.C., Domingo has also started programs to train young opera singers at the Los Angeles Opera and the [[Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia]] in [[Valencia]], Spain.\n\nIn September 2016, he performed at a Los Angeles benefit for the Esperanza Azteca Los Angeles Youth Orchestra supporting young musicians from the Los Angeles area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/los-angeles/article/Plcido-Domingo-Performs-With-Esperanza-Azteca-Youth-Orchestra-20160928|title=Pl\u00e1cido Domingo Performs With Esperanza Azteca Youth Orchestra|last=Desk|first=BWW News|newspaper=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==Writings==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" \n|-\n!Date\n!Title\n!Publisher\n!ISBN\n!Pages\n!Author(s)\n|-\n|September 1983\n|''My First Forty Years''\n|Alfred A.
