It is located along the Owerri-Onitsha Federal Highway (which is identified as Highway A6 by Google map) in Imo State. Approaching from Owerri to Onitsha you will get to Awo-Omanma, Amiri and then Otulu after which you have Mgbidi; while from Onitsha to Owerri you have Otulu after Mgbidi.  \n\n== History ==\n{{Coord missing|Nigeria}}The name Otulu is derived from two Igbo words 'Otu' which means 'One' and 'Olu' which means 'voice' which when put together means 'One Voice'. The father of Otulu is Igbo n'abunkwu. He Originated from Nri in Anambra State. This is the reason why the community is known as Otulu Igbo n'abunkwu. When Igbo n'abunkwu started expanding, he and some other immigrants of his community chose the name Otulu \"One Voice\" which signifies Unity that is 'let us be united'.\n\nAccording to Chief E. Ndubuisi (personal communication, July 29, 2014), Otulu married two wives, the first wife was Lolo Ogueri Ukwu and the second wife was Lolo Oji. The first wife had two children namely Umuhu and Umuezem. The second wife had three children namely Ubahawa, Okponsu and Umuojienwe. Umuhu is the first son of Otulu, Umuezem is the second son, Ubahawa is the third son, Okponsu is the forth son and Umuojienwe is the last son. Umuhu had three children they are Umunkwa, Umudurukwu and Umuofia. Umuhu made the first community, Umuezem also made his own community with his five sons namely Umuochihe, Umuelile, Umunka, Umuaro and Umuaso. Ubahawa made his own community with his six sons they are Umuokwa, Umunabia,Umudikwa, Ubahawa Oji, Umuabuba, Umuosunkita including his two brothers Okponsu and Umuojienwe. These made up the sixteen (16) villages in Otulu. Otulu had initially one autonomous community with the sixteen villages but the recent creation of autonomous community in Imo State in the year 2003 brought about the division of the town Otulu into two different autonomous communities such that each autonomous community is headed by a traditional ruler. This is to say that Umuhu and Umuezem autonomous communities were created from the then Otulu autonomous community with the Imo State of Nigeria official gazette No.4 \u00a0Vol 28 \u00a0of 29th October 2003. The Umuhu and Umuezem autonomous communities are made up of eight (8) villages namely Umuofia, Umunka, Umuelile, Umudurukwu, Umuaro, Umuochihe, and Umuaso. While Otulu autonomous community is left with the remaining (8) villages namely Umuokwa, Ubahawa Oji, Umudikwa, Umuabuba, Umunabia, Umuosonkita, Okposu and Umuojienwe.\n\nOtulu has two Traditional Rulers namely Obi of Otulu in the person of HRH Eze Festus I. Orji and Igwe of Otulu in the person of HRH Eze Sunday B.

There is a huge following of Anglicanism amongst the natives of Ubahawa with the St. Stephen's Anglican Church serving as a local church as well as an archdeaconry. The Anglican church also has some few worshipers from Umuhu and Umuezem, as well as from the non-indigenes. The St. Stephen's Anglican Church, Otulu was originally established in 1914 by the Christian Missionary Society (CMS).\n\nThe Roman Catholic historically has being dominant in Umuhu and Umuezem, although it also has a sizeable following in Ubahawa. St. Christopher's Catholic Church was established in Ubahawa in the 1990s.\n\nBefore the advent of Christianity, Otulu people like many other African communities are deeply involved in their native beliefs and village deities such as Ogwugwu, Obana and Ala Umuhu. Back then, every family compound has a corner set apart for their family deity, and the head (father) of the family would offers sacrifice regularly on behalf of his family and for other needs. The chief priest does the same for the whole community. But with the advent of Christianity, Otulu now have just very few or no families who still retain this practice.\n\n== Education ==\nThere is one Secondary school in Otulu, which is called Otulu Secondary Commercial School. It was built by the people in the early 1980s. There are two government-owned primary schools namely Community Primary School Otulu and Progressive Central School Otulu. \n\n== Economy ==\nOtulu have two market squares called Afor Otulu and Orie Otulu situated at Ubahawa and Umuhu/Umuezem respectively.\n\nThe town benefits hugely from being on the Onitsha-Owerri highway, as such a lot of shops and businesses typically tend to be sited along this highway. There used to be a few manufacturing facilities located in the town in the 1990s and early 2000s, but not any more.\n\n== Tourism ==\nThere are various cultural festivals which the Otulu people are known for, such festivals includes Owu festival, Ogugu festival, which between June and July of every year, Iri-ji ( New yam festival) which is conducted mainly by the Traditional Rulers.\n\nAugust Meeting is a yearly event held by Otulu women in the month of August.\n\nThe Obana (masquerade) festival takes place in October and November every year. \n\nThe Christmas and New Year holidays are big events in Otulu. Indigenous Otuluers, resident in other parts of the world, typically travel back home (i.e. Otulu) with their family to spend time with their other relatives and friends. There are football tournaments and several outdoor parties such as wedding ceremonies and age-grade activities during this festive season.\n\n<br />{{Populated places of Imo State}}\n\n[[Category: Populated places in Imo State]]\n\n\n{{Imo-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "<ref>https://www.citypopulation.de/php/nigeria-admin.php?adm1id=NGA017</ref>{{for|the community in Ahiara|Otulu, Ahiara}}\n{{Unsourced|date=October 2014}}\n\n'''Otulu''' is a town in Oru West local government area of [[Imo State]], [[Nigeria]].

He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Position of the US government ==\nIn the wake of the apartment bombings president [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], secretary of defense [[William Cohen|Cohen]] and secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright|Albright]] have condemned the bombings as acts of terrorism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Statement on the Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-106shrg61866/html/CHRG-106shrg61866.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 17, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Radio Remarks on Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PPP-1999-book2/html/PPP-1999-book2-doc-pg1555.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 18, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffman |first1=David |authorlink1=David E.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Position of the US government ==\nIn the wake of the apartment bombings president [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], secretary of defense [[William Cohen|Cohen]] and secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright|Albright]] have condemned the bombings as acts of terrorism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Statement on the Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-106shrg61866/html/CHRG-106shrg61866.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 17, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Radio Remarks on Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PPP-1999-book2/html/PPP-1999-book2-doc-pg1555.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 18, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffman |first1=David |authorlink1=David E.

Billington]] referred to Prokhanov's novel as a continuation of a downward spiral in the Russian literature of the time. The plot of ''Mr. Hexogen'' has been likened to a nested doll of conspiracies within conspiracies. According to the plot, the apartment bombings have been staged by KGB agents, probably at the behest of the Jewish oligarchs, whose ultimate goal was to take power and move Russians to the Arctic while selling the organs of the healthy to Israel. Billington described the book as a \"merciless, anti-Semitic, surrealistic gloss on Moscow politics in the 1990s\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Billington |first1=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself | authorlink = James H.

The main characters of the story are ''Platon'' ([[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]) and ''Larry'' ([[Badri Patarkatsishvili]]). They struggle against an evil KGB officer, ''Old man'' (apparently inspired by the legendary [[Philipp Bobkov]]), who brings another KGB officer, ''Fedor Fedorovich'' (Vladimir Putin) to power by staging a series of apartment bombings.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.svoboda.org/ll/polit/0205/ll.021905-1.asp \u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u042e\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0414\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u043a \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050221100833/http://svoboda.org/ll/polit/0205/ll.021905-1.asp |date=21 February 2005 }}, [[RFE/RL]], 19-02-05</ref>\n\n== Chronology of events ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n* 5 August 1999: [[Shamil Basayev]] entered western Dagestan from Chechnya starting [[Dagestan war]]\n* 9 August 1999: [[Stepashin]] was dismissed and [[Putin]] became prime minister\n* 22 August 1999: The forces of Shamil Basayev withdrew back into Chechnya\n* 25 August 1999: Russian jets made bombing runs against 16 sites in Chechnya<ref>{{cite news\n| title       = Russia acknowledges bombing raids in Chechnya\n| url         = http://www.cnn.com:80/WORLD/europe/9909/10/russia.explosion.03/\n| publisher   = [[CNN]]\n| date        = 26 August 1999\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20000919000313/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9908/26/russia.chechnya/\n| archivedate = 19 September 2000\n}}</ref>\n* 4 September 1999: Bombing in Buynaksk, 64 people killed, 133 are injured.\n* 9 September 1999: Bombing in Moscow, Pechatniki, 94 people are killed, 249 are injured.\n* 13 September 1999: Bombing in Moscow, Kashirskoye highway, 118 are killed.\n* 13 September 1999: A bomb was defused and a warehouse containing several tons of explosives and six timing devices have been found in Moscow.\n* 13 September 1999: Russian Duma speaker [[Gennadiy Seleznyov]] made an announcement about bombing of an apartment building in the city of [[Volgodonsk]] that took place only three days later, on 16 September.\n* 16 September 1999: Bombing in [[Volgodonsk]], 18 are killed, 288 injured.\n* 23 September 1999: An apartment bomb was found in the city of Ryazan.

On April 26, 1945, a new club named ''Fiskulturno dru\u0161tvo Zadar'' was founded, with departments of football, [[basketball]] and [[sport of athletics|athletics]].

Adriatic coast, best known for playing in the top flight of Croatian football for almost twenty years. They currently play in the [[Croatian Third Football League|Tre\u0107a HNL - Jug]], the Croatian third division.\n\n==History==\nThe first football club in Zadar was established in 1876 and was named [[:it:Associazione Calcio Dalmazia|AC Dalmazia]]. The club played mostly in Italian leagues until the city annexation to [[Yugoslavia]] in 1945.  On April 26, 1945, a new club named ''Fiskulturno dru\u0161tvo Zadar'' was founded, with departments of football, [[basketball]] and [[sport of athletics|athletics]]. On February 9, 1949, the football department was spun off as NK Zadar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nkzadar.hr/CMS/0157/Default.aspx?EID=11099 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724162129/http://www.nkzadar.hr/CMS/0157/Default.aspx?EID=11099 |title=History of the club on the official website |archivedate=24 July 2012 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nZadar played in the [[Yugoslav Second League]] on a number of occasions, most recently in 1986.\n\nIn 1992, as ''Zadarkomerc'' the club was a founding member of the [[Croatian First Football League|Croatian First League]]. Since 2001, the club has officially been called NK Zadar.\n\nThe club's greatest success in the [[Croatian Football Cup]] was achieved in season [[1995\u201396 Croatian Football Cup|1995\u201396]], when they lost in the semi-final against [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Croatia Zagreb]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kroa96.html RSSSF.com]</ref>\n\nNK Zadar played in the top tier from 1992 to 1999, from 2001 to 2005, and from 2007 to 2015. Most recently, the club has been experiencing financial difficulties, and after two seasons spent in the [[Croatian Third Football League|Croatian Third League \u2013 South]] (2016\u201317, 2017\u201318), the club was promoted to the [[Croatian Second Football League|Croatian Second League]].

As of June 2019, the club had hired an attorney to appeal against their relegation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.antenazadar.hr/clanak/2019/06/nk-zadar-angazirao-odvjetnika-i-ulozio-zalbu-na-odluku-hns-a-o-izbacivanju-iz-druge-lige/|title=NK Zadar anga\u017eirao odvjetnika i ulo\u017eio \u017ealbu na odluku HNS-a o izbacivanju iz Druge lige|date=6 June 2019|publisher=Antena Zadar}}</ref>\n\n==Stadium==\nNK Zadar's home stadium is the [[Stadion Stanovi|Stanovi]] with a capacity of 5,500 persons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nkzadar.hr/klub/stadion/|title=Stadion|publisher=NK Zadar}}</ref>\n\n==Supporters==\nThe club's supporters are known as the [[Tornado Zadar]].\n\n==Honours==\n*[[Prva HNL|Prva B HNL]]:\n**Runners-up (1): [[1995\u201396 Prva HNL|1995\u201396]]\n*[[Druga HNL]]:\n**Runners-up (1): [[2006\u201307 Druga HNL|2006\u201307]]\n\n==Current squad==\n{{updated|1 February 2020}}\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=CRO|name=Josip Bender|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat=CRO|name=Antonio Repi\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=3|nat=CRO|name=Matteo Prani\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=CRO|name=Ante Sari\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=5|nat=CRO|name=Josip Ivelji\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=6|nat=CRO|name=Ivan Toki\u0107|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=CRO|name=Karlo Torbarina|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=BIH|name=Tarik Hand\u017ei\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=CRO|name=[[Dragan \u017dupan]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=CRO|name=Josip Maji\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=CRO|name=Jakov Pin\u010di\u0107|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=CRO|name=Mario Pedi\u0161i\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=CRO|name=Josip Ani\u0107|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=CRO|name=Jure Jerbi\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=BIH|name=Zvonimir Begi\u0107|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=CRO|name=Tin Mati\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=CRO|name=Tomislav Reni\u0107|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=CRO|name=Kristijan Juri\u0107|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=CRO|name=Ivan Lepinjica|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=CRO|name=Franko Sura\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=26|nat=CRO|name=Josip Jurjevi\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=CRO|name=Vinko Petkovi\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=28|nat=CRO|name=Vedran Smokrovi\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=99|nat=CRO|name=Vlatko Bla\u017eevi\u0107|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==Seasons==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=9|League\n!rowspan=2 width=\"30\"|[[Croatian Football Cup|Cup]]\n!colspan=2 width=\"200\"|Top goalscorer\n|-\n!Division\n!width=\"25\"|P\n!width=\"25\"|W\n!width=\"25\"|D\n!width=\"25\"|L\n!width=\"25\"|F\n!width=\"25\"|A\n!width=\"25\"|Pts\n!width=\"40\"|Pos\n!Player\n!Goals\n|-\n|1992\n|[[1992 Croatian First Football League|1.
