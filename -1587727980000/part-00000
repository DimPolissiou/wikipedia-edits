George]], a [[furrier]] who raised [[chinchillas]] and supplied furs to the movie studios.\n\nGeorge's first instrument was the [[harmonica]]. At the age of six he appeared on ''[[Original Amateur Hour|Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour]]'' performing a duet with his older brother, Hampton. As a student at [[Hollywood High School]] (where he befriended [[Paul Barrere]] and future wife Elizabeth), he took up the [[flute]] in the school [[marching band]] and orchestra. He had already started to play Hampton's [[acoustic guitar]] at age 11, progressed to the [[electric guitar]] by his high school years, and later learned to play the [[saxophone]], [[shakuhachi]] and [[sitar]]. During this period, George viewed the [[teen idol]]-oriented [[rock and roll]] of the era with contempt, instead favoring [[West Coast jazz]] and the [[soul jazz]] of [[Les McCann]] and [[Mose Allison]]. Following graduation in 1963, he briefly worked at a gas station (an experience that inspired such later songs as \"[[Willin' (Little Feat song)|Willin']]\") to support himself while studying art and [[art history]] at [[Los Angeles Valley College]] for two years.\n\n==Musical career==\n===Early bands===\nInitially funded by the sale of his grandfather's stock, George's first band The Factory formed in 1965 and released at least one single on the [[Uni Records]] label, \"Smile, Let Your Life Begin\" (co-written by George). Members included future Little Feat drummer [[Richie Hayward]] (who replaced [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] in September 1966), Martin Kibbee (a.k.a. Fred Martin) who would later co-write several Little Feat songs with George (including \"Dixie Chicken\" and \"Rock and Roll Doctor\"), and [[Warren Klein]] on guitar. [[Frank Zappa]] produced two tracks for the band, but they were not released until 1993 on the album ''Lightning-Rod Man'', credited to Lowell George and The Factory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/related/Lightning-Rod_Man.html |title=Lowell George & The Factory \u2013 Lightning-Rod Man|publisher=Globalia.net|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> The band made an appearance on the 1960s sitcom ''[[F Troop]]'' as \"The Bedbugs\". They were also featured in an episode of ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', \"Lost, the Colonel's Daughter\" (season 3, episode 27). They appeared in the scene inside the A-Go-Go club, with their music heard playing loudly. They received credits at the end of the episode as \"'The Factory' Lowell-Warren-Martin-Rich, Courtesy of Universal Records\". Following the disbanding of The Factory, George briefly joined [[The Standells]].\n\n===Zappa and The Mothers of Invention===\nIn November 1968, George joined Zappa's [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] as rhythm guitarist and nominal lead vocalist; he can be heard on ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]'', ''[[Burnt Weeny Sandwich]]'', ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1]]'', ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 4]]'' and the first disc of ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 5]]''. During this period, he absorbed Zappa's autocratic leadership style and [[avant garde]]-influenced conceptual/procedural-oriented compositional methods. He earned his first production credit (in conjunction with Zappa and [[Russ Titelman]]) on ''Permanent Damage'', an album recorded by \"[[groupie]] group\" [[The GTOs]]. George later asserted that \"he performed no real function in the band\" and left the group in May 1969 under nebulous circumstances. GTOs member [[Pamela Des Barres]] has claimed that George was fired by Zappa for smoking [[marijuana]], while George claimed at a 1975 Little Feat concert that he was fired because he \"wrote a song [\"Willin'\"] about dope.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/lf1975-10-18.shnf | title=Willin' | date = October 18, 1975 | work = Little Feat Live at Auditorium Theatre | publisher= The Internet Archive | accessdate= December 22, 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, biographer Mark Brend asserts that Zappa liked the song but thought there was no place for it in the Mothers' set; George himself alternatively claimed that \"it was decided that I should leave and form a band\" by mutual agreement. George also claimed to have played uncredited guitar on ''[[Hot Rats]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Electric Don Quixote |author=Neil Slaven |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGs3UTVm1sC |pages=141\u2013144 |date=2003-03-01 |isbn=978-0-7119-9436-2}}</ref>\n\n===Little Feat===\n[[File:Little Feat Lowell George.jpg|thumb|240px|George performing in [[Buffalo, New York]], May 1, 1977]]\nAfter leaving the Mothers of Invention, George invited fellow musicians former Zappa bassist [[Roy Estrada]], keyboardist [[Bill Payne]], and drummer [[Richie Hayward]] to form a new band, which they named [[Little Feat]]. George usually (but not always) played lead guitar and focused on slide guitar, but [[Ry Cooder]] played the slide on \"Willin'\" on the debut Little Feat album after George badly injured his hand while working on a powered model airplane, although George rerecorded some of his material and he played the rest of the slide work on the album. Mark Brend wrote that George's \"use of [[Compression (electric guitar)|compression]] defined his sound and gave him the means to play his extended melodic lines.\"<ref>Rock and Roll Doctor\u2014Lowell George: Guitarist, Songwriter and Founder of Little Feat, by Mark Brend, Backbeat Books, Oct. 2002, p.75,</ref> George began his slide playing using the casing of a [[Sears|Sears, Roebuck and Co.]] 11/16ths [[spark plug]] socket wrench, rather than the traditional glass or steel finger tube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tz_HDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT61|title=Brian Jones|first=Alan|last=Clayson|date=February 2, 2004|publisher=Bobcat Books|accessdate=May 4, 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/06/little-feat-teenage-nervous-breakdown.html|title=Teenage Nervous Breakdown - Little Feat - Feb 14, 1976|publisher=|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nLittle Feat signed to [[Warner Bros.

In addition, Little Feat expanded to a sextet by adding a second guitarist [[Paul Barrere]] and percussionist [[Sam Clayton]], thus cementing the classic line-up, and they took on a [[New Orleans]] funk direction with their next album ''[[Dixie Chicken (album)|Dixie Chicken]]'', the first to be produced by George.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dixie-chicken-mw0000190703|title=Dixie Chicken - Little Feat - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy the spring of 1976, Little Feat were touring North America opening for The Who.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book \n| first= Martin C.\n| last= Strong\n| year= 2000\n| title= The Great Rock Discography\n| edition= 5th\n| publisher= Mojo Books\n| location= Edinburgh\n| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen|filename=On Your Way Down.ogg|title=\"On Your Way Down\"|description=written by [[Allen Toussaint]], from the 1973 [[Little Feat]] album ''[[Dixie Chicken (album)|Dixie Chicken]]''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nLittle Feat released several other  studio albums in the 1970s, including: ''[[Feats Don't Fail Me Now]]'', ''[[The Last Record Album]]'' and ''[[Time Loves a Hero]]''. The group's 1978 live album ''[[Waiting for Columbus]]'' became their best-selling album.\n\nTensions within the group, especially between George, Payne, and, to a lesser extent, Barrere regarding musical direction and leadership, led to Payne and Barrere's departure from the group in 1979 and the group's subsequent disbandment. In an interview with Bill Flanagan conducted 11 days before his death, George stated that he was keen to re-form Little Feat without Payne and Barrere in order to reassert his full control over the group.<ref>'Written in My Soul' by Bill Flanagan {{ISBN|0-7119-2224-1}} pp. 353-63.</ref>\n\n===Record production===\nGeorge was also a producer, and produced the [[Grateful Dead]]'s 1978 album ''[[Shakedown Street]]'', as well as Little Feat's records and his own 1979 solo album ''[[Thanks, I'll Eat It Here]]''; he also co-produced a couple of tracks on [[Valerie Carter]]'s 1977 release ''Just A Stone's Throw Away''. In 1977 he co-produced [[The Seldom Scene|John Starling]]'s debut solo album ''Long Time Gone''.\n\n===Session work===\nWhen not playing with Little Feat, George lent his talents as a [[session musician|session player]] to various artists, most frequently as a slide guitarist.

A year later, Palmer's second album (''[[Pressure Drop (album)|Pressure Drop]]'') was effectively produced by George, and Little Feat served as the core band on the sessions. However, Palmer kept the producer's credit because of a dispute between [[Island Records]] and Warners. Later CDs list Steve Smith as producer.\n\n==Health problems==\nGeorge led an overindulgent lifestyle of [[binge eating]], [[alcoholism]] and [[speedball (drug)|speedballs]] ([[heroin]] and [[cocaine]] mixed together) and he became [[morbidly obese]] in the last years of his life, weighing 308 pounds (140 kg).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/30/artsfeatures |title=The late, great Lowell George|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn June 15, 1979, George began a tour in support of his solo album, ''Thanks I'll Eat it Here''.

[[Frank Zappa]] produced two tracks for the band, but they were not released until 1993 on the album ''Lightning-Rod Man'', credited to Lowell George and The Factory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/related/Lightning-Rod_Man.html |title=Lowell George & The Factory \u2013 Lightning-Rod Man|publisher=Globalia.net|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> The band made an appearance on the 1960s sitcom ''[[F Troop]]'' as \"The Bedbugs\". They were also featured in an episode of ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', \"Lost, the Colonel's Daughter\" (season 3, episode 27). They appeared in the scene inside the A-Go-Go club, with their music heard playing loudly. They received credits at the end of the episode as \"'The Factory' Lowell-Warren-Martin-Rich, Courtesy of Universal Records\". Following the disbanding of The Factory, George briefly joined [[The Standells]].\n\n===Zappa and The Mothers of Invention===\nIn November 1968, George joined Zappa's [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] as rhythm guitarist and nominal lead vocalist; he can be heard on ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]'', ''[[Burnt Weeny Sandwich]]'', ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1]]'', ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 4]]'' and the first disc of ''[[You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 5]]''. During this period, he absorbed Zappa's autocratic leadership style and [[avant garde]]-influenced conceptual/procedural-oriented compositional methods. He earned his first production credit (in conjunction with Zappa and [[Russ Titelman]]) on ''Permanent Damage'', an album recorded by \"[[groupie]] group\" [[The GTOs]]. George later asserted that \"he performed no real function in the band\" and left the group in May 1969 under nebulous circumstances. GTOs member [[Pamela Des Barres]] has claimed that George was fired by Zappa for smoking [[marijuana]], while George claimed at a 1975 Little Feat concert that he was fired because he \"wrote a song [\"Willin'\"] about dope.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/lf1975-10-18.shnf | title=Willin' | date = October 18, 1975 | work = Little Feat Live at Auditorium Theatre | publisher= The Internet Archive | accessdate= December 22, 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, biographer Mark Brend asserts that Zappa liked the song but thought there was no place for it in the Mothers' set; George himself alternatively claimed that \"it was decided that I should leave and form a band\" by mutual agreement. George also claimed to have played uncredited guitar on ''[[Hot Rats]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Electric Don Quixote |author=Neil Slaven |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaGs3UTVm1sC |pages=141\u2013144 |date=2003-03-01 |isbn=978-0-7119-9436-2}}</ref>\n\n===Little Feat===\n[[File:Little Feat Lowell George.jpg|thumb|240px|George performing in [[Buffalo, New York]], May 1, 1977]]\nAfter leaving the Mothers of Invention, George invited fellow musicians former Zappa bassist [[Roy Estrada]], keyboardist [[Bill Payne]], and drummer [[Richie Hayward]] to form a new band, which they named [[Little Feat]]. George usually (but not always) played lead guitar and focused on slide guitar, but [[Ry Cooder]] played the slide on \"Willin'\" on the debut Little Feat album after George badly injured his hand while working on a powered model airplane, although George rerecorded some of his material and he played the rest of the slide work on the album. Mark Brend wrote that George's \"use of [[Compression (electric guitar)|compression]] defined his sound and gave him the means to play his extended melodic lines.\"<ref>Rock and Roll Doctor\u2014Lowell George: Guitarist, Songwriter and Founder of Little Feat, by Mark Brend, Backbeat Books, Oct. 2002, p.75,</ref> George began his slide playing using the casing of a [[Sears|Sears, Roebuck and Co.]] 11/16ths [[spark plug]] socket wrench, rather than the traditional glass or steel finger tube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tz_HDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT61|title=Brian Jones|first=Alan|last=Clayson|date=February 2, 2004|publisher=Bobcat Books|accessdate=May 4, 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/06/little-feat-teenage-nervous-breakdown.html|title=Teenage Nervous Breakdown - Little Feat - Feb 14, 1976|publisher=|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nLittle Feat signed to [[Warner Bros.

In addition, Little Feat expanded to a sextet by adding a second guitarist [[Paul Barrere]] and percussionist [[Sam Clayton]], thus cementing the classic line-up, and they took on a [[New Orleans]] funk direction with their next album ''[[Dixie Chicken (album)|Dixie Chicken]]'', the first to be produced by George.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dixie-chicken-mw0000190703|title=Dixie Chicken - Little Feat - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy the spring of 1976, Little Feat were touring North America opening for The Who.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book \n| first= Martin C.\n| last= Strong\n| year= 2000\n| title= The Great Rock Discography\n| edition= 5th\n| publisher= Mojo Books\n| location= Edinburgh\n| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen|filename=On Your Way Down.ogg|title=\"On Your Way Down\"|description=written by [[Allen Toussaint]], from the 1973 [[Little Feat]] album ''[[Dixie Chicken (album)|Dixie Chicken]]''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nLittle Feat released several other  studio albums in the 1970s, including: ''[[Feats Don't Fail Me Now]]'', ''[[The Last Record Album]]'' and ''[[Time Loves a Hero]]''. The group's 1978 live album ''[[Waiting for Columbus]]'' became their best-selling album.\n\nTensions within the group, especially between George, Payne, and, to a lesser extent, Barrere regarding musical direction and leadership, led to Payne and Barrere's departure from the group in 1979 and the group's subsequent disbandment. In an interview with Bill Flanagan conducted 11 days before his death, George stated that he was keen to re-form Little Feat without Payne and Barrere in order to reassert his full control over the group.<ref>'Written in My Soul' by Bill Flanagan {{ISBN|0-7119-2224-1}} pp. 353-63.</ref>\n\n===Record production===\nGeorge was also a producer, and produced the [[Grateful Dead]]'s 1978 album ''[[Shakedown Street]]'', as well as Little Feat's records and his own 1979 solo album ''[[Thanks, I'll Eat It Here]]''; he also co-produced a couple of tracks on [[Valerie Carter]]'s 1977 release ''Just A Stone's Throw Away''. In 1977 he co-produced [[The Seldom Scene|John Starling]]'s debut solo album ''Long Time Gone''.\n\n===Session work===\nWhen not playing with Little Feat, George lent his talents as a [[session musician|session player]] to various artists, most frequently as a slide guitarist.

A year later, Palmer's second album (''[[Pressure Drop (album)|Pressure Drop]]'') was effectively produced by George, and Little Feat served as the core band on the sessions. However, Palmer kept the producer's credit because of a dispute between [[Island Records]] and Warners. Later CDs list Steve Smith as producer.\n\n==Health problems==\nGeorge led an overindulgent lifestyle of [[binge eating]], [[alcoholism]] and [[speedball (drug)|speedballs]] ([[heroin]] and [[cocaine]] mixed together) and he became [[morbidly obese]] in the last years of his life, weighing 308 pounds (140 kg).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/aug/30/artsfeatures |title=The late, great Lowell George|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn June 15, 1979, George began a tour in support of his solo album, ''Thanks I'll Eat it Here''.

The plot focuses on a wealthy father on his deathbed who invites his four daughters home for Christmas and tells them he suspects his second wife of poisoning him. Shortly after, the girls learn that their stepmother was accused of killing her first husband, and they begin to fall prey to a killer dressed in a yellow rain slicker.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in an enormous house where wealthy Benjamin Morgan is talking to his eldest daughter, Alex. He believes his wife, Elizabeth, is trying to poison him. Alex believes him. Morgan then sends Alex off to pick up her three sisters. While Alex is driving, she stops and asks her father's doctor, Ted Lindsay, for directions. He gives them to her and comments on the fact that the daughters haven't returned home since their mother committed suicide five years earlier.\n\nLater that night, Alex returns with her three sisters, Frederica a.k.a. Freddie, Joanna, and Christine. They park inside the barn. Once inside the house, they meet their stepmother, Elizabeth. Their father then calls them to his room, where he urges the sisters to kill Elizabeth before she kills them. Elizabeth, meanwhile, has gone outside in the rain to get something from the barn. She then comes back to the confused sisters and shows them all their rooms before making dinner. Joanna wants to leave, while Freddie begins drinking and taking [[anti-depressant]]s. Christine goes downstairs to make coffee for Freddie and finds Elizabeth making tea. Christine then notices Elizabeth's yellow rain slicker, gloves, and boots by the door. Christine brings Freddie the coffee, but she doesn't want it, preferring the [[vodka]] and other alcoholic beverages she has brought; she also talks about their mother and how she never should have died. \n\nElizabeth finishes making dinner and calls the girls to come down; but before they can eat, Joanna bombards Elizabeth with questions about her first husband's death, accusing her of murder. Elizabeth silences her and tells Joanna to watch her mouth or something may happen, when suddenly Freddie screams upstairs. The sisters run upstairs and find Freddie in their mother's old room, clutching a glass of vodka, and holding a piece of glass that is cutting into her hand. She is drunk and crying, pointing out a portrait of their mother and blaming their father for her suicide, informing them of his many affairs with different women. As they put Freddie to bed, Alex accuses Elizabeth of unlocking the door to the room on purpose.\n\nLater that night, the storm picks up and Joanna informs Alex that she isn't going to stay, asking for Alex's car keys to drive to the railroad station so she can go home. Alex tries to get her to stay, but she refuses, taking Alex's keys and wishing Christine and Freddie goodbye, telling them to give their father an excuse for her departure. When she goes to her car in the barn, she becomes the victim of a figure in a yellow rain slicker, gloves, and boots; she is stabbed in the back with a [[pitchfork]], falling into the mud. Inside, Elizabeth is making milk and honey for Freddie to help her sleep, when Christine comes into the kitchen, once again refusing the drink. Elizabeth then goes to give Freddie the drink, while Alex watches from their father's room. Freddie won't accept the milk and honey, but keeps drinking alcohol instead, eventually climbing into the bathtub for a bath and passing out. All of a sudden, the same intruder that killed Joanna grabs Freddie's feet and pulls her underwater, where she drowns.\n\nThe next morning, Christmas Day, Dr. Ted Lindsay shows up at the house, informing Christine that the roads are washed out from the storm, and that he will be popping in and out for a couple of days. Christine then finds Freddie's body and screams, bringing the others into the bathroom, where once again Alex accuses Elizabeth of poisoning the drink she brought for Freddie. Elizabeth informs her that Freddie denied it, and that she drank it herself, and tells them that Freddie had some pills out on the dresser. Benjamin calls up to find out what happened, and Elizabeth informs him that Freddie committed suicide or accidentally drowned, while Christine and Alex put Freddie's body in her bed, before calling the police. Christine goes to call the police only to find that the phone is dead, and realizes that Joanna has the car and they're all trapped in the house. She then decides to go out through the woods to a neighbor's house, and informs Alex, telling her not to tell Elizabeth. Upon traveling through the woods to find the house, Christine notices she's being followed, she starts to panic, and begins running. All the while being chased by the murderer in the yellow slicker, gloves, and boots carrying a pitchfork. She becomes lost and manages to hide beneath a log, watching the killer leave, and making a run for it.\n\nNight has now fallen, and the rain is beginning to slow, and Alex is inside Benjamin's room, spotting Elizabeth walking outside with a yellow slicker on. Christine finally makes it to the house covered in mud, and notices that the car is still inside the barn, she goes over to it, and trips over Joanna's dead body half buried in mud. Elizabeth then appears, telling her to come with her, making her scream and run inside the house, where she locks the door, and finding Benjamin's dead body in his bed. Elizabeth then goes to the cellar doors, and crawls inside, going up to the house door, while Christine screams for Alex to come out and escape with her. Elizabeth finally opens the door, and Christine climbs inside a mirrored cabinet, listening as Elizabeth tells her to come out from hiding and leave with her. She then goes outside to find her, and Christine bursts through the front door to get help, running down the road to seek safety. While running from the house, Christine flags down a passing car, occupied by Alex. She tries to tell Alex that everyone is dead and that Elizabeth is the killer, but Alex then informs her that she was actually the killer, and was going to frame Elizabeth. She couldn't deal with the past, so she decided to forget it, by getting rid of her father and sisters, and since Christine was the last one left, she had to die too. She then hits Christine with a tire iron, sending her headfirst down a steep ravine filled with rocks and sticks, looking down and seeing her body crumpled into a heap. Ted then drives by and Alex quickly tells him that Elizabeth went insane and killed everyone, including Christine who went off into the woods. Ted then drives to the house, while Alex drives to the police station, bringing the cops back to the house the next morning. Once she gets there, she tells them where the three bodies are, and goes inside, finding out that they found Christine. She goes into her room, and thinks that Christine is dead, until she opens her eyes, then Alex snaps, laughing hysterically, and is dragged away by the police. All the while Christine watches, crying, from her bedroom, eventually letting Ted take her to the airport, leaving Elizabeth alone to the Morgan farmhouse.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jessica Walter]] as Frederica Morgan\n* [[Sally Field]] as Christine Morgan\n* [[Eleanor Parker]] as Alex Morgan\n* [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] as Elizabeth Hall Morgan\n* [[Walter Brennan]] as Benjamin Morgan\n* [[Jill Haworth]] as Joanna Morgan\n* [[John Fink]] as Dr. Ted Lindsay\n* [[Med Flory]] as Sheriff Nolan\n\n==Release==\nThe film debuted on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] on November 28, 1972 as part of the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' series.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n==Home media==\n{{expand section|date=July 2018}}\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] by [[Echo Bridge Home Entertainment]] on May 7, 2013 as a part of its \"8 Midnight Horror Movies\" pack.

She becomes lost and manages to hide beneath a log, watching the killer leave, and making a run for it.\n\nNight has now fallen, and the rain is beginning to slow, and Alex is inside Benjamin's room, spotting Elizabeth walking outside with a yellow slicker on. Christine finally makes it to the house covered in mud, and notices that the car is still inside the barn, she goes over to it, and trips over Joanna's dead body half buried in mud. Elizabeth then appears, telling her to come with her, making her scream and run inside the house, where she locks the door, and finding Benjamin's dead body in his bed. Elizabeth then goes to the cellar doors, and crawls inside, going up to the house door, while Christine screams for Alex to come out and escape with her. Elizabeth finally opens the door, and Christine climbs inside a mirrored cabinet, listening as Elizabeth tells her to come out from hiding and leave with her. She then goes outside to find her, and Christine bursts through the front door to get help, running down the road to seek safety. While running from the house, Christine flags down a passing car, occupied by Alex. She tries to tell Alex that everyone is dead and that Elizabeth is the killer, but Alex then informs her that she was actually the killer, and was going to frame Elizabeth. She couldn't deal with the past, so she decided to forget it, by getting rid of her father and sisters, and since Christine was the last one left, she had to die too. She then hits Christine with a tire iron, sending her headfirst down a steep ravine filled with rocks and sticks, looking down and seeing her body crumpled into a heap. Ted then drives by and Alex quickly tells him that Elizabeth went insane and killed everyone, including Christine who went off into the woods. Ted then drives to the house, while Alex drives to the police station, bringing the cops back to the house the next morning. Once she gets there, she tells them where the three bodies are, and goes inside, finding out that they found Christine. She goes into her room, and thinks that Christine is dead, until she opens her eyes, then Alex snaps, laughing hysterically, and is dragged away by the police. All the while Christine watches, crying, from her bedroom, eventually letting Ted take her to the airport, leaving Elizabeth alone to the Morgan farmhouse.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jessica Walter]] as Frederica Morgan\n* [[Sally Field]] as Christine Morgan\n* [[Eleanor Parker]] as Alex Morgan\n* [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] as Elizabeth Hall Morgan\n* [[Walter Brennan]] as Benjamin Morgan\n* [[Jill Haworth]] as Joanna Morgan\n* [[John Fink]] as Dr. Ted Lindsay\n* [[Med Flory]] as Sheriff Nolan\n\n==Release==\nThe film debuted on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] on November 28, 1972 as part of the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' series.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n==Home media==\n{{expand section|date=July 2018}}\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] by [[Echo Bridge Home Entertainment]] on May 7, 2013 as a part of its \"8 Midnight Horror Movies\" pack.
