The game was popular across the [[Middle East]] among people of all social strata and boards for playing it have been found at locations as far away from Mesopotamia as [[Crete]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. At the height of its popularity, the game acquired spiritual significance, and events in the game were believed to reflect a player's future and convey messages from deities or other supernatural beings. The Game of Ur remained popular until [[late antiquity]], when it stopped being played, possibly evolving into, or being displaced by, an early form of [[backgammon]]. It was eventually forgotten everywhere except among the [[Cochin Jews|Jewish population]] of the Indian city of [[Kochi]], who continued playing a version of it until the 1950s when they began [[Aliyah|emigrating]] to [[Israel]].\n\nThe Game of Ur received its name because it was first rediscovered by the English archaeologist [[Leonard Woolley|Sir Leonard Woolley]] during his excavations of the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] between 1922 and 1934. Copies of the game have since been found by other archaeologists across the Middle East. The rules of the Game of Ur as it was played in the second century BC have been preserved on a [[Babylonia]]n [[clay tablet]] written by the scribe Itti-Marduk-bal\u0101\u1e6du. Based on this tablet and the shape of the {{boardgloss|gameboard}}, [[British Museum]] curator [[Irving Finkel]] reconstructed the basic rules of how the game might have been played. The object of the game is to run the course of the board and bear all one's pieces off before one's opponent. Like modern backgammon, the game combines elements of both strategy and [[luck]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bm-royalgame.jpg|thumb|A [[Graffito (archaeology)|graffito]] version of the game from the

Game of Ur is a race game<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> and it is probably a direct ancestor of the [[Tables (board game)|tables]], or backgammon, family of games, which are still played today.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The Game of Ur is played using two sets of seven [[Draughts|checker]]-like game pieces.<ref name=\":2\" /> One set of pieces is white with five black dots and the other set is black with five white dots.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The gameboard is composed of two rectangular sets of boxes, one containing three rows of four boxes each and the other containing three rows of two boxes each, joined together by a \"narrow bridge\" of two boxes.<ref name=\":4\" /> The gameplay involves elements of both luck and strategy.<ref name=\":2\" /> Movements are determined by rolling a set of [[Four-sided die|four-sided, tetrahedron-shaped dice]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Two of the four corners of each die are marked and the other two are not, giving each die an equal chance of landing with a marked or unmarked corner facing up.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The number of marked ends facing upwards after a roll of the dice indicates how many spaces a player may move during that turn.<ref name=\":4\" /> A single game can last up to half an hour and can be very intense.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe object of the game is for a player to move all seven of their pieces along the course (''two proposed versions of which are shown at right'') and off the board before their opponent.<ref name=\":2\" /> On all surviving gameboards, the two sides of the board are always identical with each other, indicating that the two sides of the board belong to each player.<ref name=\":0\" /> When a piece is on one of the player's own squares, it is safe from capture,<ref name=\":2\" /> but, when it is on one of the eight squares in the middle of the board, the opponent's pieces may capture it by landing on the same space, sending the piece back off the board so that it must restart the course from the beginning.<ref name=\":2\" /> This means there are six \"safe\" squares and eight \"combat\" squares.<ref name=\":2\" /> There can never be more than one piece on a single square at any given time, so having too many pieces on the board at once can impede a player's mobility.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen a player rolls a number using the dice, they may choose to move any of their pieces on the board or add a new piece to the board if they still have pieces that have not entered the game.<ref name=\":2\" /> A player is not required to capture a piece every time they have the opportunity.<ref name=\":2\" /> Nonetheless, players are required to move a piece whenever possible, even if it results in an unfavorable outcome.<ref name=\":2\" /> All surviving gameboards have a colored rosette in the middle of the center row.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> According to Finkel's reconstruction, if a piece is located on the space with the rosette, it is safe from capture. Finkel also states that when a piece lands on any of the three rosettes, the player gets an extra roll.<ref name=\":4\" /> In order to remove a piece from the board, a player must roll exactly the number of spaces remaining until the end of the course plus one.<ref name=\":2\" /> If the player rolls a number any higher or lower than this number, they may not remove the piece from the board.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Gambling ===\nOne archaeological dig uncovered twenty-one white balls alongside a set of the Game of Ur.<ref name=\":2\" /> It is believed that these balls were probably used [[Gambling|for placing wagers]].<ref name=\":2\" /> According to the tablet of Itti-Marduk-bal\u0101\u1e6du, whenever a player skips one of the boxes marked with a rosette, they must place a token in the pot.<ref name=\":4\" /> If a player lands on a rosette, they may take a token from the pot.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n<references group=\"\" responsive=\"0\"></references>\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Botermans, Jack (1988).

The game was popular across the [[Middle East]] among people of all social strata and boards for playing it have been found at locations as far away from Mesopotamia as [[Crete]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. At the height of its popularity, the game acquired spiritual significance, and events in the game were believed to reflect a player's future and convey messages from deities or other supernatural beings. The Game of Ur remained popular until [[late antiquity]], when it stopped being played, possibly evolving into, or being displaced by, an early form of [[backgammon]]. It was eventually forgotten everywhere except among the [[Cochin Jews|Jewish population]] of the Indian city of [[Kochi]], who continued playing a version of it until the 1950s when they began [[Aliyah|emigrating]] to [[Israel]].\n\nThe Game of Ur received its name because it was first rediscovered by the English archaeologist [[Leonard Woolley|Sir Leonard Woolley]] during his excavations of the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] between 1922 and 1934. Copies of the game have since been found by other archaeologists across the Middle East. The rules of the Game of Ur as it was played in the second century BC have been preserved on a [[Babylonia]]n [[clay tablet]] written by the scribe Itti-Marduk-bal\u0101\u1e6du. Based on this tablet and the shape of the {{boardgloss|gameboard}}, [[British Museum]] curator [[Irving Finkel]] reconstructed the basic rules of how the game might have been played. The object of the game is to run the course of the board and bear all one's pieces off before one's opponent. Like modern backgammon, the game combines elements of both strategy and [[luck]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bm-royalgame.jpg|thumb|A [[Graffito (archaeology)|graffito]] version of the game from the

When the single reached number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] chart, JoJo became, at age 13, the youngest female solo artist to have a number-one single in the United States.\n\nJoJo has expressed her displeasure with the song, and most of her self-titled album, for its overall pop sound. However, she is grateful that it put her on the musical map. When she performed the song at her most recent concerts, she would arrange it to the point of being almost unrecognizable, adding jazzier instrumentation to the verses and heavier guitars to the bridge.<ref>{{YouTube|avlM-1i7EKE|JoJo - Leave (Get Out) (Live In Brazil - Pop Rock 2007- BH)}}.</ref> The song appears in the 2004 [[PlayStation 2]] karaoke game ''[[Karaoke Revolution|Karaoke Revolution Volume 3]]'' and ''Singstar Pop Hits''.

The song was recorded at Soulpower Studios and Westlake Studios in Los Angeles, California. Soulshock also mixed the song at Soulpower Studios and provided all the instruments with Karlin. The guitars, however, were performed by Eric Jackson and Sean Hurley. \"Leave (Get Out)\" was released as JoJo's debut single on February 24, 2004, through [[Blackground Records]], via [[Music download|digital download]] and [[CD single|physical single]].

Produced by Danish production duo [[Soulshock & Karlin]], the song became a commercial success, reaching number 12 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number two in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and on the [[European Hot 100 Singles]]. It also reached the top five in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The single was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on October 25, 2004. When the single reached number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] chart, JoJo became, at age 13, the youngest female solo artist to have a number-one single in the United States.\n\nJoJo has expressed her displeasure with the song, and most of her self-titled album, for its overall pop sound. However, she is grateful that it put her on the musical map. When she performed the song at her most recent concerts, she would arrange it to the point of being almost unrecognizable, adding jazzier instrumentation to the verses and heavier guitars to the bridge.<ref>{{YouTube|avlM-1i7EKE|JoJo - Leave (Get Out) (Live In Brazil - Pop Rock 2007- BH)}}.</ref> The song appears in the 2004 [[PlayStation 2]] karaoke game ''[[Karaoke Revolution|Karaoke Revolution Volume 3]]'' and ''Singstar Pop Hits''.

The guitars, however, were performed by Eric Jackson and Sean Hurley. \"Leave (Get Out)\" was released as JoJo's debut single on February 24, 2004, through [[Blackground Records]], via [[Music download|digital download]] and [[CD single|physical single]].

The battle was fought on Phou Pha Thi mountain in [[Houaphanh Province]], [[Laos]], on 10&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, and derives its name from the mountaintop where it was fought or from the designation of a {{convert|700|ft|sp=us}} landing strip in the valley below, and was the largest single ground combat loss of United States Air Force members during the Vietnam War.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Laotian Civil War]], Phou Pha Thi mountain was an important strategic outpost which had served both sides at various stages of the conflict. In 1966, United States Ambassador to Laos [[William H. Sullivan]] approved a plan by the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) to construct a [[TACAN]] site atop Phou Pha Thi; at the time they lacked a navigation site with sufficient range to guide US bomber aircraft to their targets in North Vietnam. In 1967 the site was upgraded with the air-transportable all-weather [[Reeves AN/MSQ-77 Bomb Directing Central|AN/TSQ-81]] radar bombing control system. This enabled American aircraft to bomb North Vietnam and Laos at night, and in all types of weather, an operation code-named [[1st Combat Evaluation Group#Laos|Commando Club]]. Despite US efforts to maintain the secrecy of the installation, which included \"sheep-dipping\" of the airmen involved, US operations at the facility did not escape the attention of the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces.\n\nToward the end of 1967, North Vietnamese units increased the tempo of their operations around Phou Pha Thi, and by 1968 several attacks were launched against Lima Site 85. In the final assault on 10&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, elements of the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion attacked the facility, with support from the VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion. The Hmong and Thai forces defending the facility were overwhelmed by the combined North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also| Lima Site 85}}\n\nPhou Pha Thi is a remote mountain in [[Houaphanh Province]], northeastern [[Laos]]. The mountain, which is about {{convert|1,700|m|sp=us}} high, is located within the former [[Royal Lao Army]]'s Military Region 2, and about {{convert|24|km|sp=us}} from the border of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and {{convert|48|km|sp=us}} away from [[Sam Neua]], the Pathet Lao capital. For the local [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and [[Yao people|Yao]] tribes that lived in the area, Phou Pha Thi was a place of religious significance. They believed it was inhabited by spirits possessing supernatural powers to exercise control over their lives. The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) saw Phou Pha Thi as an ideal location for installing a radar navigation system to assist US pilots in their [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing campaigns]] in North Vietnam, and along the [[Operation Barrel Roll|Ho Chi Minh Trail]] inside Laos.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 22\">Chauhan, p. 22</ref>\n\nLaos was a neutral country according to the [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos]] signed on 23&nbsp;July&nbsp;1962. Therefore, the US was prohibited from openly conducting military operations in the kingdom. Activities undertaken by the USAF in Laos had to be approved by the US Ambassador to Laos [[William H. Sullivan]]. When the plan to install a navigation system on Phou Pha Thi Mountain was proposed, Sullivan initially opposed it as he thought that [[Prime Minister of Laos|Laotian Prime Minister]] Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]] would not allow his country to be involved in an aerial offensive against North Vietnam. Souvanna Phouma did permit the installation, on the condition that it not be manned by US military personnel.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\">Thompson, p. 102</ref>\n\n[[File:Phou Pha Thi.gif|thumb|Phou Pha Thi, in northeastern [[Laos]], the site of a U.S. TACAN facility known as Lima Site 85.]]\n\nIn August 1966, the USAF installed a [[TACAN]] System, an autonomous radio transmitter that provided pilots and navigators with distance and bearing relative to the station on Phou Pha Thi. In 1967, under the code name Heavy Green, the facility was upgraded with the TSQ-81<!-- when using AN/ nomenclature, it is common practice to use AN/ initially, then drop it until encounter a different AN/ item-->, which could direct and control attacking jet fighters and bombers to their targets and provide them with precise bomb release points. It began operating in late November 1967 as Operation Commando Club.<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\">{{cite web|url=http://combat-skyspot.tripod.com/commandoclub.htm |title=Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85 |author=Edward Vallentiny |date=9 August 1968 |publisher=HQ PACAF Directorate, Tactical Evaluation CHECO Division |accessdate=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717102828/http://combat-skyspot.tripod.com/commandoclub.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}</ref> To operate the equipment within the limitations imposed by the Laotian Prime Minister, USAF personnel assigned to work at the installation had to sign paperwork that temporarily released them from military service, and to work in the guise of civilian technicians from [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]]<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\"/>&nbsp;\u2014 a process euphemistically called \"sheep-dipping.\" In reality, they operated as members of the USAF Circuit Rider teams from the [[1st Combat Communications Squadron|1st Mobile Communications Group]] based at [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]] who rotated to the site every seven days.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\">Chauhan, p. 23</ref>\n\nPersonnel working at the TACAN site were supplied by weekly flights of the [[20th Special Operations Squadron]], based at Udorn RTAFB in northeastern Thailand operating under the code name [[Operation Pony Express]], using Lima Site 85, the {{convert|700|m|sp=us}} airstrip constructed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in the valley below. Hmong General [[Vang Pao]], who spearheaded the allied war effort against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces in Military Region 2, was entrusted with the task of guarding the facility using the Hmong Clandestine Army alongside CIA-funded Thai [[Border Patrol Police#Border Patrol Police Aerial Resupply Unit|Border Patrol Police]] forces.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\"/> Though substantial resources were invested to maintain the facility, the USAF command doubted Vang Pao's ability to defend the installation. Accordingly, all equipment had explosives attached so that if the site was overrun, it could be quickly destroyed.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\"/> By late 1967, Lima Site 85's radar directed 55% of all bombing operations against North Vietnam.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nAs USAF ground controllers were able to guide attacking aircraft against North Vietnamese targets in all types of weather, installation of the TSQ-81 radar system on Phou Pha Thi was considered to have been extremely successful during the final months of 1967. Yet a formerly top-secret after-action report credited Commando Club with guiding the following sorties:<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\"/>\n::\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Major [[Richard Secord]], who was responsible for the security of Lima Site 85, was concerned about the safety of the unarmed USAF technicians working there dressed as civilians. He requested [[Green Berets]] be assigned as on-site security. Ambassador Sullivan turned down the request. Sullivan repeatedly insisted the \"civilian personnel\" at Lima Site 85 should not be armed, but Secord decided to equip the technicians with weapons. [[M16 rifle|M-16]] assault rifles, fragmentation grenades, concussion grenades, and other [[small arms]] were then brought in.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178</ref> Secord said that given the site's meager defenses, he felt the site could not be held against a serious assault.<ref>Secord, Wurts, pp. 75\u201377</ref>\n\nSecord's fears were justified, as USAF reconnaissance aircraft regularly flying over northeastern Laos in 1967 revealed that the paved roads constructed by the North Vietnamese were obviously approaching Phou Pha Thi. Road construction activities were observed along Routes 6 and 19, which connected [[Dien Bien Phu]] in North Vietnam with Phou Pha Thi and Nam Bac in Laos.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\"/>\n\nRealizing the North Vietnamese would try to destroy the installation, Secord advised the US Embassy in [[Vientiane]] to evacuate all US personnel. However, high-ranking US officials insisted that Lima Site 85 should operate as long as possible, as it helped save the lives of US pilots every day it remained operational.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\"/> In December 1967, a communist military offensive in the region was signalled by a series of skirmishes. On 15&nbsp;December, CIA-led Hmong reconnaissance patrols detected both North Vietnamese and [[Pathet Lao]] battalions moving against Nam Bac, at the time the stronghold of the [[Royal Lao Army]].<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\">Chauhan, p. 24</ref>\n\nOn 16&nbsp;December, two Pathet Lao companies overran Phou Den Din, only {{convert|12|km|sp=us}} east of Lima Site 85. Shortly afterwards, Hmong units recaptured the village.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\"/> Toward the end of 1967, US controllers at Lima Site 85 directed [[F-4 Phantom|F-4]], [[F-105 Thunderchief|F-105]] and [[A-1 Skyraider|A-1]] fighter-bombers based in Thailand and South Vietnam in air strikes against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao formations that were massing around the US facility at Phou Pha Thi. [[A-26 Invader]]s were called in for night missions, targeting movements of the enemy ground troops on Route 6 and Route 19. On 14&nbsp;January&nbsp;1968, the situation in northeastern Laos continued to worsen, as an estimated four North Vietnamese infantry battalions captured the Laotian government's stronghold at Nam Bac. Despite the growing threat from North Vietnamese forces, the US military was still not permitted to reinforce the installation on Phou Pha Thi Mountain due to political sensitivities.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\"/>\n\n[[Image:Painting lima85.jpg|thumb|\"An Air Combat First\"&nbsp;\u2013 CIA painting of Air America helicopter engaging 2 VPAF An-2 biplanes]]\n\nThe defense of Lima Site 85 was assigned to two CIA paramilitary officers who led about 1,000 Hmong soldiers, with 200 men guarding the ridge line and the remaining 800 in the valley below. They were reinforced by a Thai Border Patrol Police battalion of 300 men.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 25\">Chauhan, p. 25</ref> In the first week of 1968, the combined North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces probed Royal Laos Army positions in the area by launching several artillery attacks. On 10&nbsp;January, a Pathet Lao patrol was driven from the area by the Hmong soldiers. Fearing the explosives attached to their equipment could be detonated by incoming artillery rounds, US technicians dismantled the charges and threw them over the cliff.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\"/>\n\nOn 12&nbsp;January, CIA spotters reported a four-aircraft formation flying in the direction of Lima Site 85. They were Soviet-made [[Antonov An-2]] biplanes. Two aircraft continued towards Lima Site 85, while the others turned away.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 25\"/> The [[Vietnam People's Air Force]], in one of its few air attacks during the conflict, tried to destroy the radar at Lima Site 85. The An-2s flew over Phou Pha Thi, and their crewmen dropped 120&nbsp;mm mortar shells through the aircraft's floor and then strafed their targets with 57&nbsp;mm rockets mounted on the wing pods.<ref>Hamilton-Merritt, p.180</ref> As they repeatedly attacked the facility, ground fire heavily damaged one AN-2, and it crashed into a mountainside. By now, CIA officers and US controllers at Lima Site 85 had managed to contact an [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] helicopter, which was faster than the Soviet-made biplanes. The Huey pilot Captain Ted Moore sighted the remaining An-2, and promptly gave chase. As he pulled alongside, flight mechanic Glenn Woods armed with an [[AK-47]] assault rifle opened fire and caused the biplane to crash into a ridge.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol52no2/iac/an-air-combat-first.html|title=An Air Combat First \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining An-2s had observed the attack from a distance and managed to escape without damage. Four Hmongs, two men and two women, had been killed by the communist attack. The TSQ-81 radar and associated equipment were undamaged.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181\"/> Shortly afterwards, what remained of one of the An-2 biplanes was put on display in front of the [[That Luang]] Monument, Vientiane's most important Buddhist shrine, as proof of North Vietnamese military activities in the kingdom.<ref>Goldstein, p. 310</ref> Despite the attack, the US Embassy in Vientiane and the USAF refused to alter their strategy for defending Lima Site 85. [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] Clarence F. Blanton, commander of USAF personnel at the facility, was given no authority to supervise his own perimeter or to order a retreat if they again came under attack. Throughout January and February, intelligence collected by the Hmongs confirmed that a major assault on Lima Site 85 was being prepared, but Sullivan and the US military took no steps to strengthen the defenses.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 26\">Chauhan, p. 26</ref> In late February, a [[Combat Controller]], [[Technical Sergeant]] James Gary, arrived to augment the defenses by directing air strikes.<ref>Castle, pp. 94\u201395</ref> He was replaced in this duty by Sergeant Roger D. Huffman on about 4 March.<ref>Castle, pp. 100\u2013101, 286\u2013287</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===North Vietnamese plan and preparations===\nOn 18&nbsp;February&nbsp;1968, a North Vietnamese artillery survey team was ambushed near Lima Site 85 by Hmong reconnaissance teams, killing a North Vietnamese officer in the process. The dead officer, who was a major, carried a notebook which revealed a plan to attack Phou Pha Thi by using three North Vietnamese battalions and one Pathet Lao battalion.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 26\"/> Consequently, US personnel at Lima Site 85 directed 342 air strikes within {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} of their own facility to disrupt their opponent's build-up during 20\u201329 February.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182\"/> Unknown to the USAF, the [[Vietnam People's Army]] had also drawn up their plan to capture Lima Site 85 by deploying a [[Special Forces]] unit. The task of capturing the US facility was entrusted to a [[platoon]] from the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion, led by First Lieutenant Truong Muc. The platoon numbered 33 soldiers, and they were reinforced by a nine-man sapper squad and a communications and cryptography squad.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\">Do, p. 185</ref>\n\nPrior to the mission, Muc's soldiers had undergone nine months of special training, mainly focused on mountain fighting techniques and jungle operations. They also conducted physical conditioning, to improve their physical fitness and stamina to undertake operations in the most extreme conditions in Laotian territory. On 18&nbsp;December&nbsp;1967, following their intensive training, soldiers of the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion launched the first phase of their operation by conducting terrain reconnaissance and watching activities on Lima Site 85 to learn their opponent's routines. As part of the second phase, commenced on 22 January 1968, six North Vietnamese sappers were sent out to climb Phou Pha Thi Mountain, to pinpoint opposing positions in and around Lima Site 85, as well as routes of withdrawal.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\"/> On 28&nbsp;February&nbsp;1968, the North Vietnamese Special Forces completed their preparations, and they began marching towards their assembly point on 1&nbsp;March.<ref name=\"Do, p. 186\">Do, p. 186</ref>\n\nTo maintain secrecy and surprise, Muc was ordered to avoid contact with local civilians and opposing military forces. In the event they were engaged by opposing forces, the North Vietnamese would deploy a small force to deal with the situation while the main formation would continue moving to their objective on Phou Pha Thi. Once the North Vietnamese formation had arrived at their assembly area, they were to be divided into two assault groups. The first assault group, under Muc's direct command, was divided into five \"cells\" to attack key targets at Lima Site 85. Cells 1 and 2 were given the mission of capturing the communications center, with the latter given the secondary role of supporting Cell 3, which was given the main mission of seizing the TACAN site and eliminating all US personnel. Cell 4 was to capture the airstrip, and Cell 5 was placed in reserve. Second Lieutenant Nguyen Viet Hung was given responsibility to lead the second assault group with the mission of neutralizing the Thai positions. The attack would commence during the early hours of 9&nbsp;or&nbsp;10&nbsp;March.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\">Do, p. 187</ref>\n\nTo capture Lima Site 85, the North Vietnamese Special Forces were equipped with three Chinese-made [[K-54]] pistols, 23 [[AK-47]] assault rifles, four 7.62mm carbines and three [[RPG-7]] rocket propelled grenade launchers.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/> They carried 200 rounds of ammunition for each AK-47 rifle, six rounds for each RPG, {{convert|400|g|sp=us}} of explosives, and six hand grenades. The weapons load, in addition to 15 days of rations and other personal items, required each North Vietnamese Special Force soldier to pack between {{convert|42|kg|sp=us}} to {{convert|45|kg|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\"/> Shortly after the North Vietnamese Special Forces arrived at the assembly point, they moved off to an undisclosed location for two days to test-fire all their weapons, and to ensure their explosives were in working order. Then, in an attempt to fool Hmong and US intelligence, the North Vietnamese made diversionary movements against Muong Son to cover their main assault. On 9 March, elements of the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion arrived in the vicinity of Phou Pha Thi, where they made final preparations for their assault.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/>\n\n===Fall of Lima Site 85===\nBy 9&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, the US facility atop Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao units. The VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite the gravity of the situation, Sullivan did not issue an order for the evacuation of US personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10&nbsp;March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 27\">Chauhan, p. 27</ref><ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183</ref> Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the North Vietnamese Special Forces sent a small team up the mountain to defuse mines and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/> Inside the facility, US technicians grabbed their weapons and ran into trenches and bunkers, abandoning the equipment which could enable them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the US technicians returned to their positions.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/>\n\nThe TSQ-81 antenna received minor damage during the attack, and the US suffered no casualties. The only 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, which was operated by the Hmongs, received a direct hit, and was rendered ineffective.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/> At around 20:20, Sullivan gave the US commander at Lima Site 85 the authority to direct air strikes against targets on the lower slopes of the mountain, on the basis that the situation had become critical.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 27\"/> About 20 minutes later, the 33-man North Vietnamese platoon began climbing towards the US facility at Lima Site 85.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\">Do, p. 188</ref> At 21:15 Sullivan considered evacuating all US personnel from the facility at first light. However, officers of the [[Seventh Air Force]] contacted the US Embassy in Laos and indicated that evacuation should only occur as the last resort, when the situation on top of Phou Pha Thi was no longer under their control.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\">Chauhan, p. 28</ref>\n\n[[File:LimaSite85-descriptions.jpg|thumb|The configuration of Lima Site 85.]]\n\nAt 21:21 the North Vietnamese resumed their artillery attack on Phou Pha Thi, followed by several infantry assaults by the VPA 766th Regiment, which prompted Sullivan to order the evacuation of six technicians by 08:15 the next morning, from a contingent of 19 US personnel.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\"/> Starting at 01:00 on 11&nbsp;March, the North Vietnamese moved into their assigned positions to launch their attack.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/> About 02:00, a US adviser at the airstrip reported to Secord and CIA officers at Udorn that he heard gunfire on top of Phou Pha Thi, and communication with US technicians at Lima Site 85 was cut off.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/> Afterwards, Secord briefed US A-1 Skyraider pilots in Thailand on the situation at Lima Site 85, to familiarize them with friendly positions around the facility, so they could cover the evacuation of US personnel and support the Hmong counterattack.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184</ref>\n\nAbout 03:00 Cell 1 moved to within {{convert|150|m|sp=us}} of their objective, with Cell 5 positioned behind them. At the same time, the commander of Cell 4 decided to maneuver his unit to the west side of the airstrip instead of the east side as originally planned, because the terrain on the east side was higher and was covered by buildings. Precisely at 03:45, Cell 1 moved to within {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} of the communications center, when they bumped into a Hmong outpost. Both sides exchanged fire, and the outpost was destroyed by a grenade while the Hmong soldier guarding the post retreated. Shortly after, a soldier from Cell 1 fired an RPG-7 grenade which destroyed the TACAN antenna. Within 15 minutes, Cells 1 and 2 had secured the communications site. Signaled by the explosion of Cell 1's RPG-7 round, Cell 3 immediately attacked the TACAN installation by firing one of their own RPG-7s, which destroyed the electric generators.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/>\n\nUpon hearing the noise of explosions, the on-duty US technicians rushed out the front door of their operations building where they were met by North Vietnamese gunfire. Blanton, the US commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other US technicians. Those who were not killed retreated to the west side of the mountain, where they hid on the edge of the cliff. From their hideout, the US technicians fired on the North Vietnamese with their M-16 rifles and hand grenades.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\"/> At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the US technicians, Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the TACAN installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/> Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were blocked by a Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\">Do, p. 189</ref>\n\n[[Raven Forward Air Controllers]] at [[Lima Site 20A]], being the nearest available American support, were awakened by a radio call about 04:00. They flew in the dark to Lima Strip 36 at Na Khang to position themselves at the airstrip closest to LS85. The Ravens took up station over LS85 at dawn.<ref>Robbins, p. 57</ref> At 05:15 Sullivan, from the US Embassy in Vientiane, decided to evacuate Lima Site 85. He gave a signal to US pilots at Udorn to begin the operation, which was due to start at 07:15. Sullivan did not realize that US technicians were no longer in control of their TSQ-81 equipment.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184\"/> Starting around 06:00, Pao's Hmong soldiers launched a counterattack against North Vietnamese positions at the communication center, which was guarded by Cells 1 and 2, but their attacks were repelled and the North Vietnamese held their positions. With the final Hmong counterattack on the communication site defeated at 06:25, Cell 2 was ordered to support Cells 3 and 5 in their fight at the main TACAN installation. By 06:35, the North Vietnamese fully controlled the TACAN site. At the airstrip, Cell 4 was encircled by an estimated two Hmong platoons, but Chom and his unit were able to fight their way out by taking full advantage of rough terrain which favored them. Later, Cell 4 linked up with other units at the TACAN site.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/>\n\nAt first light [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] helicopters hovered over Lima Site 85 to start the evacuation, which was covered by USAF A-1 Skyraiders. Immediately, Hmong soldiers and their CIA commanders rushed the TACAN site and shouted to the US technicians that help was coming.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185</ref> In response, the North Vietnamese Special Forces organized a defense around the TACAN site, and hid their dead and wounded comrades under the large rocks which dotted Phou Pha Thi.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/> While US fighter-bombers strafed the TACAN site, the Air America helicopter landed on the airstrip and they picked up two CIA officers, one forward air-controller, and five technicians who hid during the firefight.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185\"/> Later in the day, Air America was able to recover or account for eight of the dead US personnel on Lima Site 85, along with a number of wounded Hmong soldiers.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\">Chauhan, p. 29</ref> By midday, Lima Site 85 was fully controlled by the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion, and they held the facility until 14&nbsp;March when they withdrew from the area.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nJust before midday on 11&nbsp;March, the USAF turned their attention (recon) from looking for their missing personnel to that of destroying the captured radar, along with all the documentation and operation information left behind at Lima Site 85. Between 12\u201318&nbsp;March, the USAF conducted a total of 95 strike sorties against the radar site, and on 19&nbsp;March an A-1 fighter-bomber destroyed every building at the facility. In addition to the destruction of their radar equipment, the USAF bombing of Lima Site 85 may also have had the effect of obliterating the bodies of US personnel left behind at the site (2 remains found in 2013). In the days following the loss of Phou Pha Thi, Sullivan reflected on the disaster at Lima Site 85 and commented that US technicians operating there should have been evacuated on 10&nbsp;March, when it became amply clear the North Vietnamese were preparing to launch an assault.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\"/>\n\nFor the USAF, the loss at Phou Pha Thi was not a result of intelligence failure, because it had been provided with accurate information from the very start. Instead, it was clearly a failure of command and control, as the US personnel and their Hmong allies were not permitted to freely organize their own defense to hold the radar facility.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\"/> The Battle of Lima Site 85 resulted in the largest single ground combat loss of USAF personnel during the Vietnam War.<ref>Marrett, p. 26</ref> A total of 12 US personnel went missing or were killed in the fighting on Phou Pha Thi; 11 were killed or missing on the ground and one was shot dead during the evacuation.<ref>Chauhan, pp. 28\u201329</ref><ref>The single fatality occurring during the evacuation was  1043 Radar Evaluation  Squadron member Air Force [[Chief Master Sergeant]] [[Richard Etchberger]] who was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously in September 2010 for his role in helping four injured airmen into the evacuation helicopter lift sling.}</ref><ref name=Warner233>Warner, pp 233\u2013235</ref> In addition a USAF officer searching for survivors was shot down and killed.\n\nThe total casualty figures for North Vietnamese, Pathet Lao, Hmong, and Thai units are unknown. According to official Vietnamese history, the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion lost one soldier killed and two wounded in their fight for Lima Site 85. Against those losses, the Vietnamese claimed a total of 42 Hmong and Thai soldiers were killed, and a number of others were wounded. A large number of weapons were captured by the NVA, including one 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, one 85&nbsp;mm artillery piece, four recoilless rifles, four heavy mortars, nine heavy machine guns, and vast amounts of ammunition.<ref name=\"Do, p. 201\">Do, p. 201</ref> The North Vietnamese victory proved to be a significant one, as they had succeeded in knocking out a major asset of the USAF, which had inflicted heavy damage to North Vietnam's limited industrial infrastructure.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 30\">Chauhan, p. 30</ref>\n\nThe fight at Phou Pha Thi, which was part of a larger military campaign waged by the North Vietnamese and their Pathet Lao allies, marked the beginning of the Communist dry-season offensive against Laotian Government forces in northeastern Laos. By September 1968, the strength of North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces in the Sam Neua area were estimated to have numbered more than 20 battalions.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 30\"/> Against such heavy odds, General Vang Pao insisted on recapturing Phou Pha Thi, which the US Embassy believed unnecessary. On 1&nbsp;November&nbsp;1968, Pao launched [[Operation Pigfat]] in attempt to retake Phou Pha Thi, but the operation quickly turned into a rout of the Royal Laos Army and the Hmong guerrillas and Phou Pha Thi was never retaken.<ref>Robbins, p. 105</ref>\n\nAlthough airpower was to be a major factor in the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without limitations and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]] was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at [[Khe Sanh]] was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to about a quarter of the USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November&nbsp;1967 to 11&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\"/>\n\n[[File:1st mob patch.gif|thumb|The patch of the 1st AACS Mobile Communications Group present at Lima Site 85.]]\nEleven of the twelve USAF personnel lost on the day of the battle were listed first as [[missing in action]] (MIA), then later as [[killed in action|KIA]]/body not recovered.<ref>Hamilton-Merritt, p. 186</ref> Between 1994 and 2004, 11 investigations were conducted by both [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command]] (JPAC) and unilaterally by Lao and Vietnamese investigators on both sides of the border.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/news/news_releases/2004/documents/AFMIA10705.pdf|title= Air Force Sergeant MIA from the Vietnam War is identified|date= 7 December 2005|publisher=Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office|accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref> In 2002 two of the former VPA soldiers who had taken part in the attack told investigators that they threw the bodies of the Americans off the mountain after the attack as they were unable to bury them on the rocky surface.<ref name=\"The Fall of Lima Site 85\">{{cite web |url= http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2006/April%202006/0406lima.aspx|title= The Fall of Lima Site 85|author= John T.

The battle was fought on Phou Pha Thi mountain in [[Houaphanh Province]], [[Laos]], on 10&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, and derives its name from the mountaintop where it was fought or from the designation of a {{convert|700|ft|sp=us}} landing strip in the valley below, and was the largest single ground combat loss of United States Air Force members during the Vietnam War.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Laotian Civil War]], Phou Pha Thi mountain was an important strategic outpost which had served both sides at various stages of the conflict. In 1966, United States Ambassador to Laos [[William H. Sullivan]] approved a plan by the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) to construct a [[TACAN]] site atop Phou Pha Thi; at the time they lacked a navigation site with sufficient range to guide US bomber aircraft to their targets in North Vietnam. In 1967 the site was upgraded with the air-transportable all-weather [[Reeves AN/MSQ-77 Bomb Directing Central|AN/TSQ-81]] radar bombing control system. This enabled American aircraft to bomb North Vietnam and Laos at night, and in all types of weather, an operation code-named [[1st Combat Evaluation Group#Laos|Commando Club]]. Despite US efforts to maintain the secrecy of the installation, which included \"sheep-dipping\" of the airmen involved, US operations at the facility did not escape the attention of the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces.\n\nToward the end of 1967, North Vietnamese units increased the tempo of their operations around Phou Pha Thi, and by 1968 several attacks were launched against Lima Site 85. In the final assault on 10&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, elements of the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion attacked the facility, with support from the VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion. The Hmong and Thai forces defending the facility were overwhelmed by the combined North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also| Lima Site 85}}\n\nPhou Pha Thi is a remote mountain in [[Houaphanh Province]], northeastern [[Laos]]. The mountain, which is about {{convert|1,700|m|sp=us}} high, is located within the former [[Royal Lao Army]]'s Military Region 2, and about {{convert|24|km|sp=us}} from the border of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and {{convert|48|km|sp=us}} away from [[Sam Neua]], the Pathet Lao capital. For the local [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and Yeo tribes that lived in the area, Phou Pha Thi was a place of religious significance. They believed it was inhabited by spirits possessing supernatural powers to exercise control over their lives. The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) saw Phou Pha Thi as an ideal location for installing a radar navigation system to assist US pilots in their [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing campaigns]] in North Vietnam, and along the [[Operation Barrel Roll|Ho Chi Minh Trail]] inside Laos.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 22\">Chauhan, p. 22</ref>\n\nLaos was a neutral country according to the [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos]] signed on 23&nbsp;July&nbsp;1962. Therefore, the US was prohibited from openly conducting military operations in the kingdom. Activities undertaken by the USAF in Laos had to be approved by the US Ambassador to Laos [[William H. Sullivan]]. When the plan to install a navigation system on Phou Pha Thi Mountain was proposed, Sullivan initially opposed it as he thought that [[Prime Minister of Laos|Laotian Prime Minister]] Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]] would not allow his country to be involved in an aerial offensive against North Vietnam. Souvanna Phouma did permit the installation, on the condition that it not be manned by US military personnel.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\">Thompson, p. 102</ref>\n\n[[File:Phou Pha Thi.gif|thumb|Phou Pha Thi, in northeastern [[Laos]], the site of a U.S. TACAN facility known as Lima Site 85.]]\n\nIn August 1966, the USAF installed a [[TACAN]] System, an autonomous radio transmitter that provided pilots and navigators with distance and bearing relative to the station on Phou Pha Thi. In 1967, under the code name Heavy Green, the facility was upgraded with the TSQ-81<!-- when using AN/ nomenclature, it is common practice to use AN/ initially, then drop it until encounter a different AN/ item-->, which could direct and control attacking jet fighters and bombers to their targets and provide them with precise bomb release points. It began operating in late November 1967 as Operation Commando Club.<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\">{{cite web|url=http://combat-skyspot.tripod.com/commandoclub.htm |title=Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85 |author=Edward Vallentiny |date=9 August 1968 |publisher=HQ PACAF Directorate, Tactical Evaluation CHECO Division |accessdate=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717102828/http://combat-skyspot.tripod.com/commandoclub.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}</ref> To operate the equipment within the limitations imposed by the Laotian Prime Minister, USAF personnel assigned to work at the installation had to sign paperwork that temporarily released them from military service, and to work in the guise of civilian technicians from [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]]<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\"/>&nbsp;\u2014 a process euphemistically called \"sheep-dipping.\" In reality, they operated as members of the USAF Circuit Rider teams from the [[1st Combat Communications Squadron|1st Mobile Communications Group]] based at [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]] who rotated to the site every seven days.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\">Chauhan, p. 23</ref>\n\nPersonnel working at the TACAN site were supplied by weekly flights of the [[20th Special Operations Squadron]], based at Udorn RTAFB in northeastern Thailand operating under the code name [[Operation Pony Express]], using Lima Site 85, the {{convert|700|m|sp=us}} airstrip constructed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in the valley below. Hmong General [[Vang Pao]], who spearheaded the allied war effort against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces in Military Region 2, was entrusted with the task of guarding the facility using the Hmong Clandestine Army alongside CIA-funded Thai [[Border Patrol Police#Border Patrol Police Aerial Resupply Unit|Border Patrol Police]] forces.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\"/> Though substantial resources were invested to maintain the facility, the USAF command doubted Vang Pao's ability to defend the installation. Accordingly, all equipment had explosives attached so that if the site was overrun, it could be quickly destroyed.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\"/> By late 1967, Lima Site 85's radar directed 55% of all bombing operations against North Vietnam.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nAs USAF ground controllers were able to guide attacking aircraft against North Vietnamese targets in all types of weather, installation of the TSQ-81 radar system on Phou Pha Thi was considered to have been extremely successful during the final months of 1967. Yet a formerly top-secret after-action report credited Commando Club with guiding the following sorties:<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\"/>\n::\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Major [[Richard Secord]], who was responsible for the security of Lima Site 85, was concerned about the safety of the unarmed USAF technicians working there dressed as civilians. He requested [[Green Berets]] be assigned as on-site security. Ambassador Sullivan turned down the request. Sullivan repeatedly insisted the \"civilian personnel\" at Lima Site 85 should not be armed, but Secord decided to equip the technicians with weapons. [[M16 rifle|M-16]] assault rifles, fragmentation grenades, concussion grenades, and other [[small arms]] were then brought in.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178</ref> Secord said that given the site's meager defenses, he felt the site could not be held against a serious assault.<ref>Secord, Wurts, pp. 75\u201377</ref>\n\nSecord's fears were justified, as USAF reconnaissance aircraft regularly flying over northeastern Laos in 1967 revealed that the paved roads constructed by the North Vietnamese were obviously approaching Phou Pha Thi. Road construction activities were observed along Routes 6 and 19, which connected [[Dien Bien Phu]] in North Vietnam with Phou Pha Thi and Nam Bac in Laos.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\"/>\n\nRealizing the North Vietnamese would try to destroy the installation, Secord advised the US Embassy in [[Vientiane]] to evacuate all US personnel. However, high-ranking US officials insisted that Lima Site 85 should operate as long as possible, as it helped save the lives of US pilots every day it remained operational.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\"/> In December 1967, a communist military offensive in the region was signalled by a series of skirmishes. On 15&nbsp;December, CIA-led Hmong reconnaissance patrols detected both North Vietnamese and [[Pathet Lao]] battalions moving against Nam Bac, at the time the stronghold of the [[Royal Lao Army]].<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\">Chauhan, p. 24</ref>\n\nOn 16&nbsp;December, two Pathet Lao companies overran Phou Den Din, only {{convert|12|km|sp=us}} east of Lima Site 85. Shortly afterwards, Hmong units recaptured the village.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\"/> Toward the end of 1967, US controllers at Lima Site 85 directed [[F-4 Phantom|F-4]], [[F-105 Thunderchief|F-105]] and [[A-1 Skyraider|A-1]] fighter-bombers based in Thailand and South Vietnam in air strikes against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao formations that were massing around the US facility at Phou Pha Thi. [[A-26 Invader]]s were called in for night missions, targeting movements of the enemy ground troops on Route 6 and Route 19. On 14&nbsp;January&nbsp;1968, the situation in northeastern Laos continued to worsen, as an estimated four North Vietnamese infantry battalions captured the Laotian government's stronghold at Nam Bac. Despite the growing threat from North Vietnamese forces, the US military was still not permitted to reinforce the installation on Phou Pha Thi Mountain due to political sensitivities.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\"/>\n\n[[Image:Painting lima85.jpg|thumb|\"An Air Combat First\"&nbsp;\u2013 CIA painting of Air America helicopter engaging 2 VPAF An-2 biplanes]]\n\nThe defense of Lima Site 85 was assigned to two CIA paramilitary officers who led about 1,000 Hmong soldiers, with 200 men guarding the ridge line and the remaining 800 in the valley below. They were reinforced by a Thai Border Patrol Police battalion of 300 men.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 25\">Chauhan, p. 25</ref> In the first week of 1968, the combined North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces probed Royal Laos Army positions in the area by launching several artillery attacks. On 10&nbsp;January, a Pathet Lao patrol was driven from the area by the Hmong soldiers. Fearing the explosives attached to their equipment could be detonated by incoming artillery rounds, US technicians dismantled the charges and threw them over the cliff.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\"/>\n\nOn 12&nbsp;January, CIA spotters reported a four-aircraft formation flying in the direction of Lima Site 85. They were Soviet-made [[Antonov An-2]] biplanes. Two aircraft continued towards Lima Site 85, while the others turned away.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 25\"/> The [[Vietnam People's Air Force]], in one of its few air attacks during the conflict, tried to destroy the radar at Lima Site 85. The An-2s flew over Phou Pha Thi, and their crewmen dropped 120&nbsp;mm mortar shells through the aircraft's floor and then strafed their targets with 57&nbsp;mm rockets mounted on the wing pods.<ref>Hamilton-Merritt, p.180</ref> As they repeatedly attacked the facility, ground fire heavily damaged one AN-2, and it crashed into a mountainside. By now, CIA officers and US controllers at Lima Site 85 had managed to contact an [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] helicopter, which was faster than the Soviet-made biplanes. The Huey pilot Captain Ted Moore sighted the remaining An-2, and promptly gave chase. As he pulled alongside, flight mechanic Glenn Woods armed with an [[AK-47]] assault rifle opened fire and caused the biplane to crash into a ridge.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol52no2/iac/an-air-combat-first.html|title=An Air Combat First \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining An-2s had observed the attack from a distance and managed to escape without damage. Four Hmongs, two men and two women, had been killed by the communist attack. The TSQ-81 radar and associated equipment were undamaged.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181\"/> Shortly afterwards, what remained of one of the An-2 biplanes was put on display in front of the [[That Luang]] Monument, Vientiane's most important Buddhist shrine, as proof of North Vietnamese military activities in the kingdom.<ref>Goldstein, p. 310</ref> Despite the attack, the US Embassy in Vientiane and the USAF refused to alter their strategy for defending Lima Site 85. [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] Clarence F. Blanton, commander of USAF personnel at the facility, was given no authority to supervise his own perimeter or to order a retreat if they again came under attack. Throughout January and February, intelligence collected by the Hmongs confirmed that a major assault on Lima Site 85 was being prepared, but Sullivan and the US military took no steps to strengthen the defenses.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 26\">Chauhan, p. 26</ref> In late February, a [[Combat Controller]], [[Technical Sergeant]] James Gary, arrived to augment the defenses by directing air strikes.<ref>Castle, pp. 94\u201395</ref> He was replaced in this duty by Sergeant Roger D. Huffman on about 4 March.<ref>Castle, pp. 100\u2013101, 286\u2013287</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===North Vietnamese plan and preparations===\nOn 18&nbsp;February&nbsp;1968, a North Vietnamese artillery survey team was ambushed near Lima Site 85 by Hmong reconnaissance teams, killing a North Vietnamese officer in the process. The dead officer, who was a major, carried a notebook which revealed a plan to attack Phou Pha Thi by using three North Vietnamese battalions and one Pathet Lao battalion.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 26\"/> Consequently, US personnel at Lima Site 85 directed 342 air strikes within {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} of their own facility to disrupt their opponent's build-up during 20\u201329 February.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182\"/> Unknown to the USAF, the [[Vietnam People's Army]] had also drawn up their plan to capture Lima Site 85 by deploying a [[Special Forces]] unit. The task of capturing the US facility was entrusted to a [[platoon]] from the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion, led by First Lieutenant Truong Muc. The platoon numbered 33 soldiers, and they were reinforced by a nine-man sapper squad and a communications and cryptography squad.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\">Do, p. 185</ref>\n\nPrior to the mission, Muc's soldiers had undergone nine months of special training, mainly focused on mountain fighting techniques and jungle operations. They also conducted physical conditioning, to improve their physical fitness and stamina to undertake operations in the most extreme conditions in Laotian territory. On 18&nbsp;December&nbsp;1967, following their intensive training, soldiers of the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion launched the first phase of their operation by conducting terrain reconnaissance and watching activities on Lima Site 85 to learn their opponent's routines. As part of the second phase, commenced on 22 January 1968, six North Vietnamese sappers were sent out to climb Phou Pha Thi Mountain, to pinpoint opposing positions in and around Lima Site 85, as well as routes of withdrawal.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\"/> On 28&nbsp;February&nbsp;1968, the North Vietnamese Special Forces completed their preparations, and they began marching towards their assembly point on 1&nbsp;March.<ref name=\"Do, p. 186\">Do, p. 186</ref>\n\nTo maintain secrecy and surprise, Muc was ordered to avoid contact with local civilians and opposing military forces. In the event they were engaged by opposing forces, the North Vietnamese would deploy a small force to deal with the situation while the main formation would continue moving to their objective on Phou Pha Thi. Once the North Vietnamese formation had arrived at their assembly area, they were to be divided into two assault groups. The first assault group, under Muc's direct command, was divided into five \"cells\" to attack key targets at Lima Site 85. Cells 1 and 2 were given the mission of capturing the communications center, with the latter given the secondary role of supporting Cell 3, which was given the main mission of seizing the TACAN site and eliminating all US personnel. Cell 4 was to capture the airstrip, and Cell 5 was placed in reserve. Second Lieutenant Nguyen Viet Hung was given responsibility to lead the second assault group with the mission of neutralizing the Thai positions. The attack would commence during the early hours of 9&nbsp;or&nbsp;10&nbsp;March.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\">Do, p. 187</ref>\n\nTo capture Lima Site 85, the North Vietnamese Special Forces were equipped with three Chinese-made [[K-54]] pistols, 23 [[AK-47]] assault rifles, four 7.62mm carbines and three [[RPG-7]] rocket propelled grenade launchers.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/> They carried 200 rounds of ammunition for each AK-47 rifle, six rounds for each RPG, {{convert|400|g|sp=us}} of explosives, and six hand grenades. The weapons load, in addition to 15 days of rations and other personal items, required each North Vietnamese Special Force soldier to pack between {{convert|42|kg|sp=us}} to {{convert|45|kg|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\"/> Shortly after the North Vietnamese Special Forces arrived at the assembly point, they moved off to an undisclosed location for two days to test-fire all their weapons, and to ensure their explosives were in working order. Then, in an attempt to fool Hmong and US intelligence, the North Vietnamese made diversionary movements against Muong Son to cover their main assault. On 9 March, elements of the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion arrived in the vicinity of Phou Pha Thi, where they made final preparations for their assault.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/>\n\n===Fall of Lima Site 85===\nBy 9&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, the US facility atop Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao units. The VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite the gravity of the situation, Sullivan did not issue an order for the evacuation of US personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10&nbsp;March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 27\">Chauhan, p. 27</ref><ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183</ref> Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the North Vietnamese Special Forces sent a small team up the mountain to defuse mines and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/> Inside the facility, US technicians grabbed their weapons and ran into trenches and bunkers, abandoning the equipment which could enable them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the US technicians returned to their positions.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/>\n\nThe TSQ-81 antenna received minor damage during the attack, and the US suffered no casualties. The only 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, which was operated by the Hmongs, received a direct hit, and was rendered ineffective.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/> At around 20:20, Sullivan gave the US commander at Lima Site 85 the authority to direct air strikes against targets on the lower slopes of the mountain, on the basis that the situation had become critical.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 27\"/> About 20 minutes later, the 33-man North Vietnamese platoon began climbing towards the US facility at Lima Site 85.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\">Do, p. 188</ref> At 21:15 Sullivan considered evacuating all US personnel from the facility at first light. However, officers of the [[Seventh Air Force]] contacted the US Embassy in Laos and indicated that evacuation should only occur as the last resort, when the situation on top of Phou Pha Thi was no longer under their control.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\">Chauhan, p. 28</ref>\n\n[[File:LimaSite85-descriptions.jpg|thumb|The configuration of Lima Site 85.]]\n\nAt 21:21 the North Vietnamese resumed their artillery attack on Phou Pha Thi, followed by several infantry assaults by the VPA 766th Regiment, which prompted Sullivan to order the evacuation of six technicians by 08:15 the next morning, from a contingent of 19 US personnel.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\"/> Starting at 01:00 on 11&nbsp;March, the North Vietnamese moved into their assigned positions to launch their attack.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/> About 02:00, a US adviser at the airstrip reported to Secord and CIA officers at Udorn that he heard gunfire on top of Phou Pha Thi, and communication with US technicians at Lima Site 85 was cut off.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/> Afterwards, Secord briefed US A-1 Skyraider pilots in Thailand on the situation at Lima Site 85, to familiarize them with friendly positions around the facility, so they could cover the evacuation of US personnel and support the Hmong counterattack.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184</ref>\n\nAbout 03:00 Cell 1 moved to within {{convert|150|m|sp=us}} of their objective, with Cell 5 positioned behind them. At the same time, the commander of Cell 4 decided to maneuver his unit to the west side of the airstrip instead of the east side as originally planned, because the terrain on the east side was higher and was covered by buildings. Precisely at 03:45, Cell 1 moved to within {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} of the communications center, when they bumped into a Hmong outpost. Both sides exchanged fire, and the outpost was destroyed by a grenade while the Hmong soldier guarding the post retreated. Shortly after, a soldier from Cell 1 fired an RPG-7 grenade which destroyed the TACAN antenna. Within 15 minutes, Cells 1 and 2 had secured the communications site. Signaled by the explosion of Cell 1's RPG-7 round, Cell 3 immediately attacked the TACAN installation by firing one of their own RPG-7s, which destroyed the electric generators.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/>\n\nUpon hearing the noise of explosions, the on-duty US technicians rushed out the front door of their operations building where they were met by North Vietnamese gunfire. Blanton, the US commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other US technicians. Those who were not killed retreated to the west side of the mountain, where they hid on the edge of the cliff. From their hideout, the US technicians fired on the North Vietnamese with their M-16 rifles and hand grenades.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\"/> At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the US technicians, Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the TACAN installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/> Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were blocked by a Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\">Do, p. 189</ref>\n\n[[Raven Forward Air Controllers]] at [[Lima Site 20A]], being the nearest available American support, were awakened by a radio call about 04:00. They flew in the dark to Lima Strip 36 at Na Khang to position themselves at the airstrip closest to LS85. The Ravens took up station over LS85 at dawn.<ref>Robbins, p. 57</ref> At 05:15 Sullivan, from the US Embassy in Vientiane, decided to evacuate Lima Site 85. He gave a signal to US pilots at Udorn to begin the operation, which was due to start at 07:15. Sullivan did not realize that US technicians were no longer in control of their TSQ-81 equipment.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184\"/> Starting around 06:00, Pao's Hmong soldiers launched a counterattack against North Vietnamese positions at the communication center, which was guarded by Cells 1 and 2, but their attacks were repelled and the North Vietnamese held their positions. With the final Hmong counterattack on the communication site defeated at 06:25, Cell 2 was ordered to support Cells 3 and 5 in their fight at the main TACAN installation. By 06:35, the North Vietnamese fully controlled the TACAN site. At the airstrip, Cell 4 was encircled by an estimated two Hmong platoons, but Chom and his unit were able to fight their way out by taking full advantage of rough terrain which favored them. Later, Cell 4 linked up with other units at the TACAN site.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/>\n\nAt first light [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] helicopters hovered over Lima Site 85 to start the evacuation, which was covered by USAF A-1 Skyraiders. Immediately, Hmong soldiers and their CIA commanders rushed the TACAN site and shouted to the US technicians that help was coming.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185</ref> In response, the North Vietnamese Special Forces organized a defense around the TACAN site, and hid their dead and wounded comrades under the large rocks which dotted Phou Pha Thi.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/> While US fighter-bombers strafed the TACAN site, the Air America helicopter landed on the airstrip and they picked up two CIA officers, one forward air-controller, and five technicians who hid during the firefight.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185\"/> Later in the day, Air America was able to recover or account for eight of the dead US personnel on Lima Site 85, along with a number of wounded Hmong soldiers.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\">Chauhan, p. 29</ref> By midday, Lima Site 85 was fully controlled by the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion, and they held the facility until 14&nbsp;March when they withdrew from the area.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nJust before midday on 11&nbsp;March, the USAF turned their attention (recon) from looking for their missing personnel to that of destroying the captured radar, along with all the documentation and operation information left behind at Lima Site 85. Between 12\u201318&nbsp;March, the USAF conducted a total of 95 strike sorties against the radar site, and on 19&nbsp;March an A-1 fighter-bomber destroyed every building at the facility. In addition to the destruction of their radar equipment, the USAF bombing of Lima Site 85 may also have had the effect of obliterating the bodies of US personnel left behind at the site (2 remains found in 2013). In the days following the loss of Phou Pha Thi, Sullivan reflected on the disaster at Lima Site 85 and commented that US technicians operating there should have been evacuated on 10&nbsp;March, when it became amply clear the North Vietnamese were preparing to launch an assault.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\"/>\n\nFor the USAF, the loss at Phou Pha Thi was not a result of intelligence failure, because it had been provided with accurate information from the very start. Instead, it was clearly a failure of command and control, as the US personnel and their Hmong allies were not permitted to freely organize their own defense to hold the radar facility.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\"/> The Battle of Lima Site 85 resulted in the largest single ground combat loss of USAF personnel during the Vietnam War.<ref>Marrett, p. 26</ref> A total of 12 US personnel went missing or were killed in the fighting on Phou Pha Thi; 11 were killed or missing on the ground and one was shot dead during the evacuation.<ref>Chauhan, pp. 28\u201329</ref><ref>The single fatality occurring during the evacuation was  1043 Radar Evaluation  Squadron member Air Force [[Chief Master Sergeant]] [[Richard Etchberger]] who was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously in September 2010 for his role in helping four injured airmen into the evacuation helicopter lift sling.}</ref><ref name=Warner233>Warner, pp 233\u2013235</ref> In addition a USAF officer searching for survivors was shot down and killed.\n\nThe total casualty figures for North Vietnamese, Pathet Lao, Hmong, and Thai units are unknown. According to official Vietnamese history, the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion lost one soldier killed and two wounded in their fight for Lima Site 85. Against those losses, the Vietnamese claimed a total of 42 Hmong and Thai soldiers were killed, and a number of others were wounded. A large number of weapons were captured by the NVA, including one 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, one 85&nbsp;mm artillery piece, four recoilless rifles, four heavy mortars, nine heavy machine guns, and vast amounts of ammunition.<ref name=\"Do, p. 201\">Do, p. 201</ref> The North Vietnamese victory proved to be a significant one, as they had succeeded in knocking out a major asset of the USAF, which had inflicted heavy damage to North Vietnam's limited industrial infrastructure.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 30\">Chauhan, p. 30</ref>\n\nThe fight at Phou Pha Thi, which was part of a larger military campaign waged by the North Vietnamese and their Pathet Lao allies, marked the beginning of the Communist dry-season offensive against Laotian Government forces in northeastern Laos. By September 1968, the strength of North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces in the Sam Neua area were estimated to have numbered more than 20 battalions.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 30\"/> Against such heavy odds, General Vang Pao insisted on recapturing Phou Pha Thi, which the US Embassy believed unnecessary. On 1&nbsp;November&nbsp;1968, Pao launched [[Operation Pigfat]] in attempt to retake Phou Pha Thi, but the operation quickly turned into a rout of the Royal Laos Army and the Hmong guerrillas and Phou Pha Thi was never retaken.<ref>Robbins, p. 105</ref>\n\nAlthough airpower was to be a major factor in the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without limitations and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]] was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at [[Khe Sanh]] was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to about a quarter of the USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November&nbsp;1967 to 11&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\"/>\n\n[[File:1st mob patch.gif|thumb|The patch of the 1st AACS Mobile Communications Group present at Lima Site 85.]]\nEleven of the twelve USAF personnel lost on the day of the battle were listed first as [[missing in action]] (MIA), then later as [[killed in action|KIA]]/body not recovered.<ref>Hamilton-Merritt, p. 186</ref> Between 1994 and 2004, 11 investigations were conducted by both [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command]] (JPAC) and unilaterally by Lao and Vietnamese investigators on both sides of the border.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/news/news_releases/2004/documents/AFMIA10705.pdf|title= Air Force Sergeant MIA from the Vietnam War is identified|date= 7 December 2005|publisher=Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office|accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref> In 2002 two of the former VPA soldiers who had taken part in the attack told investigators that they threw the bodies of the Americans off the mountain after the attack as they were unable to bury them on the rocky surface.<ref name=\"The Fall of Lima Site 85\">{{cite web |url= http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2006/April%202006/0406lima.aspx|title= The Fall of Lima Site 85|author= John T.

It was also a continuation of the broader trend of Islamic revival in India in the wake of the collapse of [[Mughal Empire|Muslim political hegemony]] to the [[Maratha Empire]] and the subsequent consolidation of the [[British raj]].\n\nThe emergence of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided closely with the rise of various Hindu revivalist movements such as ''[[Shuddhi]]'' (purification) and ''Sanghatan'' (consolidation) launched in the early twentieth century to reconvert Hindus who had converted to Islam and Christianity.<ref name=\"Ballard 1994 64\">{{harvnb|Ballard|1994|p=64}}</ref>\n\n===Origin===\nMuhammad Ilyas, the founder of Tablighi Jamaat, wanted to create a movement that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the [[Quran]] decreed,<ref name=\"Quran\">{{cite quran|3|104 |s=ns}}</ref><ref name=p65/> as his teacher [[Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi]] dreamed of doing.<ref>{{harvnb|Masud|2000|p=xiii}}</ref> The inspiration for this came during his second [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] in 1926.<ref name='Agwani'>{{Cite book |last=Agwani |first=Mohammad Shafi |year=1986 |title=Islamic Fundamentalism in India |publisher=Twenty First Century Indian Society |page=41 |ref=harv }}</ref> What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal.<ref name=AMFO1994:513>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=513}}</ref> He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the [[Mewati]] Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices.

However they also engage in proselytizing activities, discussing among themselves in small groups the basics of Tabligh and traveling with their husbands (or another ''[[mahram]]'') on proselytizing trips.<ref name=defeo-12-10-09>{{cite web |last1=De F\u00e9o |first1=Agn\u00e8s |title=Behind the Veil, In the Ranks of the Tablighi Jamaat |url=http://www.world-religion-watch.org/index.php/about-us-researchers-and-fellows-at-world-religion-watch/research-publications-and-working-papers/284-veil-tabligh-jamaat |publisher=World Religion Watch |accessdate=23 January 2016 |date=12 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128094407/http://www.world-religion-watch.org/index.php/about-us-researchers-and-fellows-at-world-religion-watch/research-publications-and-working-papers/284-veil-tabligh-jamaat |archive-date=28 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tabligh inculcates in them that dawah is also important alongside taking care of their spouses or taking care of their children.<ref name=defeo-12-10-09/>\n\nAccording to a 1996 study by Barbara Metcalf,<ref name=womenbm/> the Tablighi Jamaat has encouraged to participate since the beginning of the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>  Tablighi Jamaat has been banned in some Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan, where its puritanical preachings are viewed as extremist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-who-are-the-tablighi-jamaat-the-organisation-at-the-epicentre-of-coronavirus-outbreak-in-india/article31238915.ece|title=Explained  Who are the Tablighi Jamaat?}}</ref>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=517}}</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals.
