Darko]]'', a sequel to the 2001 cult-hit horror ''[[Donnie Darko]]'', was released. Evigan played Samantha Darko's best friend, Corey. The film stars [[James Lafferty]] and [[Ed Westwick]]. A theatrical release was scrapped and was released Straight-to-DVD on May 12, 2009. Unlike Donnie Darko, the film received negative reviews.\n\nIn August 2008, [[Summit Entertainment]] announced Evigan has signed on to portray the central character Cassidy Tappan in the remake of the low-budget horror film ''[[Sorority Row]]''. The screenplay was written by ''[[Good Luck Chuck]]'' writer [[Josh Stolberg]] and directed by [[Stewart Hendler]]. The film was budgeted at $12,500,000. Evigan stars alongside [[Audrina Patridge]], [[Rumer Willis]] and [[Jamie Chung]]. ''[[Sorority Row]]'' was released on September 11, 2009 and debuted at No. 6 at the box office and earned worldwide $26,735,797. Critical reception was mixed to negative. Evigan's performance was well received by critics. The leading female cast members earned a [[ShoWest]] Award for \"Female Stars of Tomorrow\" in April 2009. The DVD release was February 23, 2010.\n\nIn February 2009, Evigan announced in an interview she has signed on for another remake. The film will be a remake of the cult slasher horror film ''[[Mother's Day (2010 film)|Mother's Day]]'' and will be directed by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], best known for his work with previous [[Lionsgate]] films such as the Saw trilogy. Bousman previously directed Evigan in an episode of ''[[Fear Itself (TV series)|Fear Itself]]'' in 2008. The film will co-star [[A. J. Cook]] and [[Jaime King]]. The film has suffered numerous push backs, and was finally released on May 8, 2012 on DVD and Blu-ray. The film was also part of the 2010 [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nIn January 2009, Evigan was confirmed by [[Lionsgate]] to star in ''[[Burning Bright (film)|Burning Bright]]''. She plays the lead female role, Kelly Taylor. In the film, \"A young woman and her autistic brother find themselves trapped in their house with a ravenous tiger during a hurricane\". Critical reception was extremely positive. Despite this, the film was announced to be released Straight-to-DVD on August 17, 2010.<ref>{{cite web  |author=Michael Allen |url=http://www.28dayslateranalysis.com/2010/08/tiger-is-burning-bright-on-dvd-august.html |title=A Tiger is Burning Bright on DVD August 17th |work=28dayslateranalysis.com |date=August 15, 2010 |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nEvigan played the central character in the indie drama romance film ''[[Subject: I Love You]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Flisha|title=\"Subject: I Love You\" Stars Jericho Rosales and Briana Evigan|url=http://www.randomdetox.com/2011/04/subject-i-love-you-stars-jericho-rosales-and-briana-evigan/|website=randomdetox.com|publisher=randomdetox.com|accessdate=July 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715054917/http://www.randomdetox.com/2011/04/subject-i-love-you-stars-jericho-rosales-and-briana-evigan/#|archive-date=July 15, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[File:10.12.12BrianaEviganByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|left|Evigan at the [[New York Comic Con]], 2012]]\nShe stars in ''[[Devil's Carnival (2012 film)|The Devil's Carnival]]'', a short film that got a 30 city world tour that began in April 15, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darren Bousman Opens The Devil's Carnival|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/49534/darren-bousman-opens-devils-carnival|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref> Evigan later confirmed that she had reprised her role in its sequel, ''[[The Devil's Carnival: Alleluia!]]'', which was released in late 2015.\n\nOn 2011, during a UStream, Evigan announced that she was working in a TV series with her family, though nothing has been confirmed yet.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders.

Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations.

The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>{{harvnb|Ahmed|1994|p=517}}</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

The agency headquarters were in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n==Functions==\nThe primary role of the CAB was to regulate scheduled commercial [[airline]] operations in the United States.  The CAB strictly controlled all U.S. certificated airlines (\"scheduled carriers\") -- deciding which routes would be serviced by which airlines, and setting minimum limits on passenger fares (comparable to the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]) -- effectively managing competition between airlines, and ensuring certain levels of service to communities throughout the United States.<ref name=\"non_skeds_winter_2019_aahs_journal /><ref name=\"jimmy_carter_2014_summer_independent_org\">Brown, John Howard (assoc. prof., Dept of Finance & Economics, [[Georgia Southern University]]) (with credit to [[Alfred Kahn]], last CAB Chairman) [https://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_19_01_06_brown.pdf \"Jimmy Carter, Alfred Kahn, and Airline Deregulation: Anatomy of a Policy Success,\"] Summer 2014, ''[[The Independent Review]],'' vol. 19, no. 1, ISSN 1086\u20131653, pp. 85\u201399</ref>\n\nWhile the CAB regulation suppressed free competition, it provided security for the existing airlines, avoided gluts and shortages of passengers on certain routes, and (partly by allowing airlines to carry air mail) secured airline service for communities that would have otherwise been served less, or not have been served at all (due to low passenger traffic or other reasons).<ref name=\"non_skeds_winter_2019_aahs_journal /><ref name=\"jimmy_carter_2014_summer_independent_org\" />\n\nTo achieve its goals, the CAB was empowered to provide and administer subsidies to airlines. Further, the CAB regulated airline industry mergers and intercompany contracting -- but shielded the airlines from [[antitrust]] regulation. Additionally, within the airline industry, the CAB was assigned to prevent deceptive trade practices and unfair competition methods (similar to the role of the [[Federal Trade Commission]]).<ref name=\"jimmy_carter_2014_summer_independent_org\" />\n\n==History==\nThe Civil Aeronautics Authority Act of 1938 formed the Civil Aeronautics Authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/75/publaw-706.pdf |title=Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 ~ P.L. 75-706 |date=June 23, 1938 |series=52 Stat. 973 ~ Senate Bill 3845 |publisher= Legis\u2605Works}}</ref> The agency was renamed in 1940,<ref name=USGManual>''The United States Government Manual 2009-2010''.

{"title_page": "John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton", "text_new": "{{redirect|John Berkeley}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:1stLordBerkeley.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lord Berkeley of Stratton]]\n==Early life==\nBerkeley was the second son of Sir Maurice Berkeley and his wife Elizabeth Killigrew, daughter of Sir Henry Killigrew of Hanworth. His elder brother was [[Charles Berkeley, 2nd Viscount Fitzhardinge]]; his younger brother, [[William Berkeley (governor)|Sir William Berkeley]], served as royal governor of the colony of Virginia from 1642 to 1652 and again from 1660 to 1677. John Berkeley was accredited ambassador from [[Charles I of England]] to [[Christina of Sweden]], in January 1637, to propose a joint effort by the two sovereigns for the reinstatement of the [[elector palatine]] in his dominions; probably the employment of Berkeley in this by his cousin, [[Sir Thomas Roe]], who had conducted negotiations between Gustavus Adolphus and the king of Poland. Berkeley returned from Sweden in July 1637. He had a commission in the army against the Scots in 1638 and was knighted at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in that year. In 1640 he was returned to parliament for both Heytesbury and Reading, electing to retain his seat for the former place. Next year he was accused in parliament of complicity in the Army Plots, expelled from the house, and committed to the [[Tower of London]]; he was subsequently bailed by [[Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset]] and [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford]] in the sum of \u00a310,000, but the outbreak of hostilities prevented any further steps being taken.<ref name = DNB>{{DNB|wstitle=Berkeley, John, first Baron Berkeley of Stratton}}</ref>\n\n==First English Civil War==\nBerkeley took a conspicuous part in the [[First English Civil War]], supporting the royal cause. He became governor of [[Exeter]], and General of the royalist forces in [[Devon]].\n\nIn 1642 he joined the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]] at [[Sherborne]], and was sent into Cornwall with the rank of commissary-general to act under [[Sir Ralph Hopton]] as lieutenant-general. The royalist forces defeated, in May 1643, the Earl of Stamford at the [[battle of Stratton]], with great loss of baggage and artillery, and pursued him as far as [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]]. In this affair, Sir John distinguished himself and was now made commander-in-chief of all the royalist forces in Devon. He sat down before Exeter, into which the Earl of Stamford had withdrawn, and which was further defended by the fleet under [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick]]. Berkeley succeeded in maintaining a blockade, beating off the Earl of Warwick with a loss of three ships, and on 4 September 1643 the Earl of Stamford was compelled to surrender.<ref name = DNB/> In 1644 Berkeley was present at the baptism of [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|Henrietta Maria]], the king's daughter, who was born at Exeter. The same year Hopton and Berkeley joined their forces to oppose [[Sir William Waller]]'s westward advance, but were badly beaten at the [[Battle of Cheriton]] near [[Old Alresford|Alresford]] in [[Hampshire]] on 29 March. In April 1645 he superseded [[Sir Richard Grenville, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Grenville]], being made colonel-general of the counties of Devon and Cornwall, took Wellington House, near [[Taunton]], by assault, and then proceeded to invest Taunton. The advance of [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]] westward in the autumn of the year changed the aspect of affairs. In January 1646 Fairfax was able to concentrate on Exeter, which Berkeley was forced (13 April) to surrender, on honorable terms.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==Involvement in the Hampton Court escape==\n\nAfter the surrender of the royalist forces, Berkeley joined his kinsman, [[Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans|Lord Jermyn]], in attendance upon Queen [[Henrietta Maria]]. Having persuaded the queen that he possessed influence with some of the principal officers in the army, he obtained from her a letter of recommendation to the king. Having gained access to the king, he set about using his influence with [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]], and others, with a view to mediating between them and the captive king; he was supported by [[John Ashburnham (MP)|John Ashburnham]]. The result was that a set of propositions emanating from the chiefs of the army were submitted to the king as a basis of reconciliation in July 1647. These the king scornfully rejected.<ref name = DNB/>\n\nBerkeley received the king's commands to attend him in his flight from [[Hampton Court]] on the night of 10 November 1647. The party pushed on towards Hampshire, and ultimately reached [[Lymington]]. Berkeley crossed the [[Solent]] and opened the matter to [[Robert Hammond (Governor)|Robert Hammond]], parliamentary governor of the [[Isle of Wight]] which was the king's goal; Hammond was non-committal. The envoys then conducted Hammond to the king at Lymington, an act later much criticized. Charles felt he had no choice but saw nothing for it but to accompany Hammond to [[Carisbrooke Castle]].<ref name = DNB/>\n\nAfter this exploit Berkeley returned to London, still bent upon using his influence with the army. Being badly received by the officers, and arraigned by the parliament as a [[delinquent (royalist)|delinquent]], he returned to Paris.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==In exile==\n\nIn Paris, during the absence of [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron]] in England, he obtained, through the influence, as it would seem, of [[Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans]], the post of temporary governor to the Duke of York (1648), and on the death of Byron (1652) took over the position. He acquired the control of the Duke's finances and endeavored to bring about a match between the Duke and [[Marie d'Orleans-Longueville, Duchess de Nemours|Marie de Longueville]], but the French court refused approval. Berkeley himself paid court to [[Anne Villiers, Countess of Morton]], widowed in 1651; she turned him down, perhaps on advice from [[Sir Edward Hyde]]. Berkeley and Hyde became enemies.<ref name = DNB/>\n\nBetween 1652 and 1655 Berkeley served under [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] in the campaigns against [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]], and the Spaniards in Flanders, accompanying the Duke of York as a volunteer. When the Duke placed his sword at the disposal of Spain and crossed over into the Netherlands early in 1656, he was still accompanied by Berkeley. In the spring of the next year he made a tour with the Duke through some of the principal cities of the Netherlands, took part in the campaigns of that and the following year, and at the request of the duke was raised to the peerage as Baron Berkeley of Stratton, in Cornwall, by a patent dated at Brussels 19 May 1658.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==After the Restoration==\n[[File:Twickenham Park House.jpg|thumb|Twickenham Park House]]\nOn the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] Berkeley was put on the staff of the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]]. In 1661 he was appointed [[Lord President of Connaught]] for life, a deputy being appointed to do the work of the office in Ireland. In 1663 (17 June) Berkeley was sworn a member of the [[Privy Council]], and in the following year was made one of the Masters of Ordinance. In January 1665 Berkeley was placed on the Committee of [[Tangier]].<ref name = DNB/>\n\nIn the same year, he began building Berkeley House, a palace in the Italian style, near [[Piccadilly]]. It cost nearly \u00a330,000 and was completed about 1673, upon Berkeley's return from Ireland. Renamed [[Devonshire House]] after its purchase by [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire]], in 1697, the house burned down in 1733 and was replaced by a second Devonshire House.\n\nIn 1668 Berkeley bought [[Twickenham Park]]. In 1670 he went to Ireland as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], holding the office for two years, with a few months' leaves of absence. He was considered pro-Catholic, and to favor Archbishop [[Peter Talbot (archbishop)|Peter Talbot]] to the extent of allowing him to use a silver plate to add to the magnificence of a religious celebration, and expressing a desire to see a high mass at Christ Church. In December 1675 Berkeley was appointed, with [[Sir William Temple]] and [[Sir Leoline Jenkyns]], ambassador extraordinary on the part of England at the [[Congress of Nijmegen]] then about to assemble, but bad health both delayed his departure for Nijmegen, which he finally reached in November 1676, and caused him to return the following May, before the conference finished.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==New Jersey interests==\n\nBerkeley's personal relationships with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the Duke of York led to his receiving an interest in New Jersey, in addition to that in [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] previously received. Berkeley was co-proprietor of New Jersey from 1664 to 1674. In 1665, Berkeley and [[Sir George Carteret]] drafted the [[Concession and Agreement]], a proclamation for the structure of the government for the Province of New Jersey. The document also provided [[freedom of religion]] in the colony. Berkeley sold his share to a group of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] because of the political difficulties between [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Richard Nicolls]], Carteret, and himself. This effectively split New Jersey into two colonies: [[East Jersey]], belonging to Carteret, and [[West Jersey]]. The division remained until 1702 when West Jersey went bankrupt; the [[The Crown|Crown]] then took back and subsequently re-unified the colony.\n\n==Death and legacy==\nOn 26 August 1678 John Berkeley died, aged seventy-two years.

From 1648 he was closely associated with [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], and rose to prominence, fortune, and fame. He and [[George Carteret|Sir George Carteret]] were the founders of the [[Province of New Jersey]], a British colony in North America that would eventually become the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]].\n\n==Early life==\nBerkeley was the second son of Sir Maurice Berkeley and his wife Elizabeth Killigrew, daughter of Sir Henry Killigrew of Hanworth. His elder brother was [[Charles Berkeley, 2nd Viscount Fitzhardinge]]; his younger brother, [[William Berkeley (governor)|Sir William Berkeley]], served as royal governor of the colony of Virginia from 1642 to 1652 and again from 1660 to 1677. John Berkeley was accredited ambassador from [[Charles I of England]] to [[Christina of Sweden]], in January 1637, to propose a joint effort by the two sovereigns for the reinstatement of the [[elector palatine]] in his dominions; probably the employment of Berkeley in this by his cousin, [[Sir Thomas Roe]], who had conducted negotiations between Gustavus Adolphus and the king of Poland. Berkeley returned from Sweden in July 1637. He had a commission in the army against the Scots in 1638 and was knighted at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in that year. In 1640 he was returned to parliament for both Heytesbury and Reading, electing to retain his seat for the former place. Next year he was accused in parliament of complicity in the Army Plots, expelled from the house, and committed to the [[Tower of London]]; he was subsequently bailed by [[Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset]] and [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford]] in the sum of \u00a310,000, but the outbreak of hostilities prevented any further steps being taken.<ref name = DNB>{{DNB|wstitle=Berkeley, John, first Baron Berkeley of Stratton}}</ref>\n\n==First English Civil War==\nBerkeley took a conspicuous part in the [[First English Civil War]], supporting the royal cause. He became governor of [[Exeter]], and General of the royalist forces in [[Devon]].\n\nIn 1642 he joined the [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Marquess of Hertford]] at [[Sherborne]], and was sent into Cornwall with the rank of commissary-general to act under [[Sir Ralph Hopton]] as lieutenant-general. The royalist forces defeated, in May 1643, the Earl of Stamford at the [[battle of Stratton]], with great loss of baggage and artillery, and pursued him as far as [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]]. In this affair, Sir John distinguished himself and was now made commander-in-chief of all the royalist forces in Devon. He sat down before Exeter, into which the Earl of Stamford had withdrawn, and which was further defended by the fleet under [[Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick]]. Berkeley succeeded in maintaining a blockade, beating off the Earl of Warwick with a loss of three ships, and on 4 September 1643 the Earl of Stamford was compelled to surrender.<ref name = DNB/> In 1644 Berkeley was present at the baptism of [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|Henrietta Maria]], the king's daughter, who was born at Exeter. The same year Hopton and Berkeley joined their forces to oppose [[Sir William Waller]]'s westward advance, but were badly beaten at the [[Battle of Cheriton]] near [[Old Alresford|Alresford]] in [[Hampshire]] on 29 March. In April 1645 he superseded [[Sir Richard Grenville, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Grenville]], being made colonel-general of the counties of Devon and Cornwall, took Wellington House, near [[Taunton]], by assault, and then proceeded to invest Taunton. The advance of [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]] westward in the autumn of the year changed the aspect of affairs. In January 1646 Fairfax was able to concentrate on Exeter, which Berkeley was forced (13 April) to surrender, on honorable terms.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==Involvement in the Hampton Court escape==\n\nAfter the surrender of the royalist forces, Berkeley joined his kinsman, [[Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans|Lord Jermyn]], in attendance upon Queen [[Henrietta Maria]]. Having persuaded the queen that he possessed influence with some of the principal officers in the army, he obtained from her a letter of recommendation to the king. Having gained access to the king, he set about using his influence with [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]], and others, with a view to mediating between them and the captive king; he was supported by [[John Ashburnham (MP)|John Ashburnham]]. The result was that a set of propositions emanating from the chiefs of the army were submitted to the king as a basis of reconciliation in July 1647. These the king scornfully rejected.<ref name = DNB/>\n\nBerkeley received the king's commands to attend him in his flight from [[Hampton Court]] on the night of 10 November 1647. The party pushed on towards Hampshire, and ultimately reached [[Lymington]]. Berkeley crossed the [[Solent]] and opened the matter to [[Robert Hammond (Governor)|Robert Hammond]], parliamentary governor of the [[Isle of Wight]] which was the king's goal; Hammond was non-committal. The envoys then conducted Hammond to the king at Lymington, an act later much criticized. Charles felt he had no choice but saw nothing for it but to accompany Hammond to [[Carisbrooke Castle]].<ref name = DNB/>\n\nAfter this exploit Berkeley returned to London, still bent upon using his influence with the army. Being badly received by the officers, and arraigned by the parliament as a [[delinquent (royalist)|delinquent]], he returned to Paris.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==In exile==\n\nIn Paris, during the absence of [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron]] in England, he obtained, through the influence, as it would seem, of [[Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans]], the post of temporary governor to the Duke of York (1648), and on the death of Byron (1652) took over the position. He acquired the control of the Duke's finances and endeavored to bring about a match between the Duke and [[Marie d'Orleans-Longueville, Duchess de Nemours|Marie de Longueville]], but the French court refused approval. Berkeley himself paid court to [[Anne Villiers, Countess of Morton]], widowed in 1651; she turned him down, perhaps on advice from [[Sir Edward Hyde]]. Berkeley and Hyde became enemies.<ref name = DNB/>\n\nBetween 1652 and 1655 Berkeley served under [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] in the campaigns against [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]], and the Spaniards in Flanders, accompanying the Duke of York as a volunteer. When the Duke placed his sword at the disposal of Spain and crossed over into the Netherlands early in 1656, he was still accompanied by Berkeley. In the spring of the next year he made a tour with the Duke through some of the principal cities of the Netherlands, took part in the campaigns of that and the following year, and at the request of the duke was raised to the peerage as Baron Berkeley of Stratton, in Cornwall, by a patent dated at Brussels 19 May 1658.<ref name = DNB/>\n\n==After the Restoration==\n[[File:Twickenham Park House.jpg|thumb|Twickenham Park House]]\nOn the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] Berkeley was put on the staff of the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]].
