Bush]] was the catalyst for his political intrigue, this link between political thought and music became much more evident upon the 2018 release of The Voidz\u2019 album, ''Virtue,'' through which he more explicitly expresses politically-charged ideas.<ref name=\":3\" /> Doing so, Casablancas explains, is using his music as a \u201cmeans to an end to make the world a better place.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> The music industry, according to Casablancas, operates quite similarly to the political world, where \u201cwhoever\u2019s propaganda\u2019s the loudest\u201d is what is popular, regardless of its quality.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2016 Casablancas interviewed [[Henry Giroux]], during which they discuss the idea of whether or not the average American identifies that there are still existing struggles and conflicts that need to be addressed within the country.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rolling Stone|title=Julian Casablancas Interviews Henry Giroux|date=2016-09-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLRWPsIzSOo&list=RD94hM2wkA1mw&index=3|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> Amongst various other issues impending on society today, Casablancas is most concerned with the idea that institutions have become more powerful than democratic government.<ref name=\":3\" /> He proposes that there is a perpetual conflict between those who understand that the democratic nature of the U.S. is lost and those who seek to keep it that way.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is in this way that the music industry reflects the nature of politics- quality and integrity is compromised under the control of capitalist greed.\n\nCasablancas cites some of his most politically influential figures as [[Oliver Stone]], [[Chris Hedges]], [[Jesse Ventura]], and [[Howard Zinn]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He notes [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] as his favorite philosopher, whose work, Casablancas claims, held truth as an important standard value.<ref name=\":3\" /> He recognizes [[Paul Robeson]] as someone who used his musical platform to help further his serious political intrigue and as someone who, therefore, serves as a role model for politically engaged musicians.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCasablancas has been a guest on ''[[Redacted Tonight]]'', as well as included its host, Lee Camp, as an opener for a Voidz show in Houston, Texas in October 2018.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCasablancas endorsed Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], and performed with his band at a rally in the [[University of New Hampshire]] the night before the New Hampshire primary.<ref> {{url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/the-strokes-bernie-sanders-rally-in-new-hampshire/}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\n[[Courtney Love]]'s song \"But Julian, I'm a Little Bit Older Than You\", from her debut solo album ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'' (2004), was written

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
