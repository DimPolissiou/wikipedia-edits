From 2000\u20132010, the country saw over five thousand murders of women and girls.<ref name=Carey /> Femicide to an extent is a function of a historical gendered violence that the state and society permitted legally and socially throughout the 20th century. Most femicides go unsolved, showing the continuation of civil war societal features like impunity and the normalization of violence against women.<ref name=Carey /> Common crime violence has exacerbated the situation for women, creating a dual upsurge in both of gender-based violence and femicide in Guatemala. According to the UN, two women are murdered on average each day in Guatemala.<ref name=Menjivar /> As shown by high rates of [[domestic abuse]], females also face more vulnerabilities of private violence while young males are threatened more by public gang violence.<ref name=Winton /> In just the first month of 2005, Guatemala City alone received 13,700 reports of family violence.<ref name=Fregoso /> Furthermore, many women Guatemalan immigrants to the U.S. will still face threatening situations if they are deported to their home country.<ref name=Menjivar />\n\n===Street gangs===\nYoung males ages 15 to 24 characterize the typical perpetrators of street crime, which is often committed against individuals of the same age group.<ref name=Bruneau /> Like most post-war societies, Guatemala features a very young population and higher propensity for youth violence. Youth transitions in a post-war context often become harder due to lack of funding for public education, and in the case of Guatemala, the civil war not only transferred public education funds to military expenditures, but schools and students were specifically targeted by military forces.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kurtenbach|first1=Sabine|title=Postwar Violence in Guatemala: A Mirror of the Relationship between Youth and Adult Society|journal=International Journal of Conflict and Violence|date=2014|volume=8|issue=1|pages=119\u2013133}}</ref> Two key youth street gangs that operate in Guatemala and other Central American countries are the [[Mara Salvatrucha]] and [[18th Street gang]].<ref name=Bruneau /> Many other gangs exist however, and in 1997 the ''[[Prensa Libre (Guatemala)|Prensa Libre]]'' reported the presence of 53 known gangs operating just within the capitol, Guatemala City.<ref name=Winton /> The recent proliferation of such gangs began with the mass deportations of Los Angeles criminals to Central America, particularly El Salvador, in the mid-1990s.<ref name=Bruneau /> In 2011, [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]] reported that Guatemala had the highest number of gang members in Central America with 32,000.<ref name=Bruneau />\nms13\nThe economic struggles of the country fuel participation in street violence as well. UN reports have found that in Guatemala and the other northern nations of Central America, \"stark wealth disparities provide criminals with both a justification and an opportunity for their activities.\"<ref name=Bruneau /> In addition to poverty, [[youth in Guatemala]]  are compelled to join gangs by fierce peer pressure, reasons of support for those with broken families, and the allure of an illicit lifestyle.<ref name=Bruneau /> The cultural difference between gangs and the rest of society and the overall intimidation of the gang image offers them considerable power. Therefore, individual gang members receive increased [[social capital]].<ref name=Winton /> Guatemalan society has come to see violence as normal and inevitably linked with youth, which may prolong the passivity towards violence by leaving young people with an approach that embodies an acceptance of short-term lives.<ref name=Winton /> With youth largely correlated with public violence, trust and communication among community members and young people suffers. Therefore, communities leave youth socially excluded, and gangs may seemingly offer inclusion.<ref name=Winton /> Members of street gangs still do not constitute organized crime, but the mass incarcerations of youth gang members in Guatemala puts them in direct contact with leaders of organized crime networks who direct from prison, who assist street gangs organize and institutionalize themselves.<ref name=Bruneau />\n\n===Mob violence===\n[[Lynching]]s and other acts of [[vigilante justice]] are widespread throughout Guatemala, particularly in rural regions.

From 2000\u20132010, the country saw over five thousand murders of women and girls.<ref name=Carey /> Femicide to an extent is a function of a historical gendered violence that the state and society permitted legally and socially throughout the 20th century. Most femicides go unsolved, showing the continuation of civil war societal features like impunity and the normalization of violence against women.<ref name=Carey /> Common crime violence has exacerbated the situation for women, creating a dual upsurge in both of gender-based violence and femicide in Guatemala. According to the UN, two women are murdered on average each day in Guatemala.<ref name=Menjivar /> As shown by high rates of [[domestic abuse]], females also face more vulnerabilities of private violence while young males are threatened more by public gang violence.<ref name=Winton /> In just the first month of 2005, Guatemala City alone received 13,700 reports of family violence.<ref name=Fregoso /> Furthermore, many women Guatemalan immigrants to the U.S. will still face threatening situations if they are deported to their home country.<ref name=Menjivar />\n\n===Street gangs===\nYoung males ages 15 to 24 characterize the typical perpetrators of street crime, which is often committed against individuals of the same age group.<ref name=Bruneau /> Like most post-war societies, Guatemala features a very young population and higher propensity for youth violence. Youth transitions in a post-war context often become harder due to lack of funding for public education, and in the case of Guatemala, the civil war not only transferred public education funds to military expenditures, but schools and students were specifically targeted by military forces.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kurtenbach|first1=Sabine|title=Postwar Violence in Guatemala: A Mirror of the Relationship between Youth and Adult Society|journal=International Journal of Conflict and Violence|date=2014|volume=8|issue=1|pages=119\u2013133}}</ref> Two key youth street gangs that operate in Guatemala and other Central American countries are the [[Mara Salvatrucha]] and [[18th Street gang]].<ref name=Bruneau /> Many other gangs exist however, and in 1997 the ''[[Prensa Libre (Guatemala)|Prensa Libre]]'' reported the presence of 53 known gangs operating just within the capitol, Guatemala City.<ref name=Winton /> The recent proliferation of such gangs began with the mass deportations of Los Angeles criminals to Central America, particularly El Salvador, in the mid-1990s.<ref name=Bruneau /> In 2011, [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]] reported that Guatemala had the highest number of gang members in Central America with 32,000.<ref name=Bruneau />\n\nThe economic struggles of the country fuel participation in street violence as well. UN reports have found that in Guatemala and the other northern nations of Central America, \"stark wealth disparities provide criminals with both a justification and an opportunity for their activities.\"<ref name=Bruneau /> In addition to poverty, [[youth in Guatemala]]  are compelled to join gangs by fierce peer pressure, reasons of support for those with broken families, and the allure of an illicit lifestyle.<ref name=Bruneau /> The cultural difference between gangs and the rest of society and the overall intimidation of the gang image offers them considerable power. Therefore, individual gang members receive increased [[social capital]].<ref name=Winton /> Guatemalan society has come to see violence as normal and inevitably linked with youth, which may prolong the passivity towards violence by leaving young people with an approach that embodies an acceptance of short-term lives.<ref name=Winton /> With youth largely correlated with public violence, trust and communication among community members and young people suffers. Therefore, communities leave youth socially excluded, and gangs may seemingly offer inclusion.<ref name=Winton /> Members of street gangs still do not constitute organized crime, but the mass incarcerations of youth gang members in Guatemala puts them in direct contact with leaders of organized crime networks who direct from prison, who assist street gangs organize and institutionalize themselves.<ref name=Bruneau />\n\n===Mob violence===\n[[Lynching]]s and other acts of [[vigilante justice]] are widespread throughout Guatemala, particularly in rural regions.

In October 1971, [[Resolution 2758]] was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], expelling  \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\" and transferring China's seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] to the PRC.

President [[Chen Shui-bian]] argued that Resolution 2758, replacing the ROC with the PRC in 1971, only addressed the question of who should have China's seat in the UN, rather than whether an additional seat for the [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]] could be created to represent the 23 million people residing in the Taiwanese mainland and [[list of islands of Taiwan|other islands]].

In the [[Northern Expedition]], the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] defeated the warlords of the [[Beiyang clique]] and established a unified government for China in Nanjing.

After Japan's defeat in 1945, Taiwan was placed under the temporary administration of the ROC to handle the surrender of Japanese administration. The [[Chinese Civil War]] broke out again between the Nationalists and the Communists. The Communists gained control of the [[mainland China|mainland]] in 1949 and proclaimed the People's Republic of China (PRC), while the Nationalists fled to Taiwan, taking the ROC government with them. In 1952, Japan renounced Taiwan in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] without specifying to whom Taiwan is ceded.\n\nIn 1916, A. P.

The government position that both Taiwan and mainland China are parts of the same state is not universally accepted among the people of Taiwan. In particular, the pro-independence [[Pan-Green Coalition]] considers Taiwan and China to be different countries. By contrast, the [[Chinese reunification|pro-reunification]] [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] take the view that both Taiwan and mainland China are parts of the ROC. Former president [[Lee Tung-hui]] described these relations as \"[[Special state-to-state relations]]\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150904023430/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_/ai_62170616Taiwan \"Taiwan won't broach state-to-state concept again\"]. \"The press reports quoted Taiwan's incoming top China policy-maker Tsai Ing-wen as saying Thursday that the special state-to-state label was an adequate description of Taiwan's current ties with China.\"  \"'The two-states theory is a good thing.

Former President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] returned to the government position of the early 1990s, calling relations with Beijing [[special non-state-to-state relations|special relations between two areas within one state]].

The constitutional position of Taipei is that the territory of the ROC is divided into the \"Mainland Area\" and the \"[[free area of the republic of china|Free Area]]\" (also known as \"Taiwan Area\"). Administratively, cross-strait relations are not conducted by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Republic of China)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] of Taiwan, but by the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], an instrument of the [[Executive Yuan]]. The relations with Hong Kong and [[Macau]] are also conducted by the Mainland Affairs Council, although not all regulations applicable to mainland China automatically apply to those territories.\n\nTaiwanese and Chinese governments do not directly interact. Talks are conducted by China's [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] (ARATS) and Taiwan's [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF), privately constituted bodies that are controlled and directly answerable to the executive branches of their respective governments.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, Hong Kong and Macau were [[British Hong Kong|British]] and [[Portuguese Macau|Portuguese]] colonies respectively. They provided neutral detour points for people and goods crossing the strait. They and Singapore served as venues for talks between the two sides at that time. One ''[[modus vivendi]]'' outcome of such talks was the [[1992 Consensus]], arising from a 1992 meeting in Hong Kong. Under this consensus, the two sides agree that both Taiwan and mainland China are under the same single sovereignty of China, but the two sides agree to disagree on which side is the legitimate representative of that sovereignty. Setting aside that disagreement, the two sides agreed to co-operate on practical matters, such as recognising certifications authenticated by the other side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=113&anum=9607 |title=Kuomintang News Network |publisher=Kmt.org.tw |accessdate=25 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419103952/http://www.kmt.org.tw/english/page.aspx?type=article&mnum=113&anum=9607 |archivedate=19 April 2012  }}</ref>\n\nRelations between Taipei and Beijing warmed during the Ma government with the promotion of cross-strait links and increased economic and social interchanges between the two sides, but the [[2014 Taiwan local elections|2014 local elections]] cooled them again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Staff%20Report_Taiwan%27s%20Local%20Elections--Implications%20for%20Cross-Strait%20Relations%20_12%2030%202014.pdf |title=Taiwan's 2014 Local Elections: Implications for Cross-Strait Relations |website=Origin.www.uscc.gov |accessdate=22 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224103514/http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/Staff%20Report_Taiwan%27s%20Local%20Elections--Implications%20for%20Cross-Strait%20Relations%20_12%2030%202014.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2016  }}</ref> A [[2014 Wang-Zhang Meeting|high-level meeting]] was held on 11 February 2014 in [[Nanjing]] that marked the first time China recognised Taiwan's top government officials on matters across the Taiwan Strait.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303874504579375943230344648?KEYWORDS=taiwan&mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303874504579375943230344648.html%3FKEYWORDS%3Dtaiwan|title=Taiwan, China Talks End Cordially|author=Jenny W.

Panamanians studying in Taiwan were given the choice of returning to Panama within 30 days or continuing their studies in China. Panama was motivated by promises of multibillion-dollar investments.  It all began with a letter sent in 2015 to the Chinese government that, according to Isabel Saint Malo, Panama's vice president, was titled \"Panama wants to make ties with China\". The contents of the letter are kept confidential, as well as the reasons of why it was sent. It has also been kept confidential who delivered the letter and assisted in the switchover process, which is only described as \"a distinguished member of the Chinese community living in Panama\". The exembassador of the US to Panama, [[John Feeley]], said that he had asked [[List of heads of state of Panama|Panamanian President]] [[Juan Carlos Varela]] about the switchover in 2016 but Varela lied to him, saying that there were no plans to make the switchover. He also said that Varela didn't tell him the truth until 1 hour before the nationwide announcement. Others questioned why the Panamanian government continues to use equipment donated by Taiwan. The Panamanian government initially gave no reason, later saying that one reason was because \"China is the second largest user of the Panama Canal\" and President Varela said it was because he \"couldn't accept it anymore\" and \"that's what every responsible leader would do\". The Panamanian government officially said that Taiwan was an inalienable part of China and that the switchover was to comply with the one-China policy. The ROC government said that Panama was its \"number one ally\" and that it would not participate in Beijing's checkbook diplomacy. The Taiwanese government complained that Panama maliciously hid the switchover process until the last moment. In the first year of diplomatic relations, 19 treaties were signed, including a Free Trade Treaty. Varela said that its main purpose was to allow Chinese nationals to easily invest in Panama. Controversies over the sudden switchover, included lack of due process, unusually high levels of confidentiality, and the fact that a few weeks before the switchover, Taiwan had donated medical equipment to Panama. In 2018, the first flight from Beijing To Panama by Air China landed in [[Tocumen International Airport]], with a technical stop in Houston. Varela called it a milestone in Panamanian aviation. Due to this new route, the Panamanian ministry of tourism expected at least 40,000 Chinese tourist visits per year. \"History and socioeconomic reality\" were cited as reasons. Varela said that the move was backed by diplomatic relationships dating from 1912 and that the move strengthened the existing relationships, despite the fact that those relationships were with the ROC, not the PRC. As a result, Panama City was almost immediately added to China's list of officially approved tourist destinations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prensa.com/economia/Aterriza-primer-Air-China-Panama_0_5001249854.html|title=Aterriza el primer vuelo de Air China en Panam\u00e1 &#124; La Prensa Panam\u00e1|date=5 April 2018|website=www.prensa.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laestrella.com.pa/nacional/180323/air-china-vuelo-beijing-inaugura|title=Air China inaugura vuelo Beijing-Houston-Panam\u00e1|first=GESE-La Estrella de|last=Panam\u00e1|website=La Estrella de Panam\u00e1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40256499|title=Panama cuts ties with Taiwan in favour of China|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Conoce-posible-ruta-estaciones-Panama-Chiriqui_0_4966003387.html|title=Conoce la posible ruta y estaciones del tren Panam\u00e1-Chiriqu\u00ed|date=17 February 2018|website=TVN}}</ref>\nThe [[Chinese Communist Party]] government has offered the [[Paname\u00f1ista Party]]-led government a free feasibility study for the planned 4th set of locks in the Panama Canal to gain a competitive advantage in bids for choosing the company to build the 4th set of locks, not to mention plans for a 1200 hectare industrial park on the Pacific coast and a 4 hectare campus in Amador near the Biomuseo to house the PRC embassy in Panama. There are also fears that Panama could turn into a conflict zone between the US and the PRC, due to Panama's strategic location. A Panamanian government agency later said that the switchover was because of Taiwanese president [[Tsai Ing-wen]]'s violations and lack of regard to the 1992 consensus regarding China, Taiwan and the One-china policy. Panamanian newspaper La Estrella questioned the reasons Varela initially gave for the switchover, like \"China is the world's largest population and the 2nd largest economy and user of the Panama Canal\", calling Varela's actions contradictory and saying that the reasons Varela gave were the reality Panama has lived under for decades, so those couldn't be regarded as valid reasons for the switchover. The same newspaper also says that China's plans in Latin America convince Latin American nations easily, with apparent benefits in the short term but with dependency in China in the long term and that China is silently invading other countries and Latin America in general.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laestrella.com.pa/internacional/america/180718/china-panama-franquicia|title=Panam\u00e1, \u00bfuna franquicia china?|first=GESE-La Estrella de|last=Panam\u00e1|website=La Estrella de Panam\u00e1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elsiglo.com.pa/panama/panama-espera-jugosas-inversiones-china/24016355|title=Panam\u00e1 espera jugosas inversiones de China|website=El Siglo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://m.prensa.com/opinion/China-agenda-ambiciosa_0_4812268806.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824034511/https://m.prensa.com/opinion/China-agenda-ambiciosa_0_4812268806.html |archive-date=24 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> There are also concerns that, in the long term, Chinese investments may control the Panamanian economy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Conoce-inversiones-China-planea-Panama_0_4897010348.html|title=Conoce las inversiones que China planea hacer en Panam\u00e1|date=17 November 2017|website=TVN}}</ref>\n\n===Paraguay===\n{{Main|Paraguay\u2013Taiwan relations}}\n[[File:2016\u5e745\u670820\u65e5\u7e3d\u7d71\u5c31\u8077 09.jpg|thumb|Paraguay President [[Horacio Cartes]] and President [[Tsai Ing-wen]] in Taiwan.]]\nParaguayan leader General [[Alfredo Stroessner]] was a partner of Generalissimo Chiang.

Both offices were established in 1975 and were organized as non-profit corporations. The Philippines is the focal country for the ROC's 2016\u20132020 Southbound Policy, where the ROC plans to push for greater ties. The push was initially welcomed by the [[Benigno Aquino III|Aquino]] Administration, however, the [[Rodrigo Duterte|Duterte]] Administration was elected in May 2016, complicating the issue as President Duterte was seen as 'pro-China', and thus would prefer better ties with the mainland over Taiwan. Political analysts during a forum in Manila said that ties between the Philippines and the ROC would have been the best coalition in the Far East, if the South China Sea territorial disputes between the two nations did not exist.

However, in 1995 CAL dropped the [[national colours]] from its [[Aircraft livery|livery]], and now flies to international destinations under its own name. Many countries' national airlines similarly set up special subsidiaries to operate services to Taipei, with a different name, and livery omitting national symbols. For example, [[British Airways]]' now defunct subsidiary, [[British Asia Airways]], operated flights to London, [[KLM]]'s subsidiary, [[KLM Asia]], operated flights to [[Amsterdam]], and [[Swissair]]'s subsidiary, [[Swissair#Swissair Asia|Swissair Asia]], operated flights to [[Zurich]], [[Air France#Air France Asie and Air France Cargo Asie|Air France Asie]] operated flights to Paris while [[Qantas]] had a subsidiary called [[Australia Asia Airlines]], which operated flights to Sydney. Other countries' flag carriers, such as Germany's [[Lufthansa]], operated flights to Taipei using an existing subsidiary (in Lufthansa's case, [[Condor Airlines|Condor]]).\n\n[[Japan Air Lines]] established a subsidiary called [[Japan Asia Airways]] to operate flights to Tokyo. Before the completion of the second runway at New Tokyo International Airport (now [[Narita International Airport]]) near Tokyo, Japan, airlines from Taiwan were required to fly to [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]] (commonly known as Haneda Airport) in order not to offend the airlines from the PRC that flew to Narita. [[All Nippon Airways]], however, used an existing subsidiary, [[Air Nippon]].

In October 1971, [[Resolution 2758]] was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], expelling  \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\" and transferring China's seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] to the PRC. The resolution declared that \"the representatives of the Government of the PRC are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations.\" However, the ''[[eo ipso]]'' nature of [[Taiwan and weapons of mass destruction]] remained a contentious issue.{{clarify|date=May 2018}}\n\nMany attempts by the ROC to rejoin the UN have not made it past committee, under fierce PRC opposition and threatened vetoes. President [[Chen Shui-bian]] argued that Resolution 2758, replacing the ROC with the PRC in 1971, only addressed the question of who should have China's seat in the UN, rather than whether an additional seat for the [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]] could be created to represent the 23 million people residing in the Taiwanese mainland and [[list of islands of Taiwan|other islands]]. The argument, however, has not been accepted by the UN, because the issue of [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwan independence]] was not raised in the UN.\n\nSince the 1970s, the PRC and ROC have competed for diplomatic recognition from nations across the world, often by offering financial aid to poorer countries as an inducement.<ref>{{cite journal | surname = Hu | given = Shaohua | title = Small State Foreign Policy: The Diplomatic Recognition of Taiwan | journal = China: An International Journal | volume = 13 | number = 2 | year = 2015 | pages = 1\u201323 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | surname = Rich | given = Timothy S. | title = Status for Sale: Taiwan and the Competition for Diplomatic Recognition | journal = Issues & Studies | volume = 45 | number = 4 | year = 2009 | pages = 159\u2013188 | url = http://www.timothysrich.com/documents/Status_for_Sale_Taiwan_Recognition.pdf | access-date = 17 January 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220100047/http://www.timothysrich.com/documents/Status_for_Sale_Taiwan_Recognition.pdf | archive-date = 20 December 2016 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> As a precondition for diplomatic relations, the PRC requires that the other country renounce any recognition of the ROC.

After Japan's defeat in 1945, Taiwan was placed under the temporary administration of the ROC to handle the surrender of Japanese administration. The [[Chinese Civil War]] broke out again between the Nationalists and the Communists. The Communists gained control of the [[mainland China|mainland]] in 1949 and proclaimed the People's Republic of China (PRC), while the Nationalists fled to Taiwan, taking the ROC government with them. In 1952, Japan renounced Taiwan in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] without specifying to whom Taiwan is ceded.\n\nIn 1916, A. P.

The government position that both Taiwan and mainland China are parts of the same state is not universally accepted among the people of Taiwan. In particular, the pro-independence [[Pan-Green Coalition]] considers Taiwan and China to be different countries. By contrast, the [[Chinese reunification|pro-reunification]] [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] take the view that both Taiwan and mainland China are parts of the ROC. Former president [[Lee Tung-hui]] described these relations as \"[[Special state-to-state relations]]\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150904023430/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_/ai_62170616Taiwan \"Taiwan won't broach state-to-state concept again\"]. \"The press reports quoted Taiwan's incoming top China policy-maker Tsai Ing-wen as saying Thursday that the special state-to-state label was an adequate description of Taiwan's current ties with China.\"  \"'The two-states theory is a good thing.

'We can refrain from using it as a description, although we cannot deny the existence of the situation described by it,' Tsai said on local television.\"</ref> The Chen administrations described Taiwan and China by saying \"[[one country on each side|...with Taiwan and China on each side of the Taiwan Strait, each side is a country.]]\". Former President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] returned to the government position of the early 1990s, calling relations with Beijing [[special non-state-to-state relations|special relations between two areas within one state]].

The constitutional position of Taipei is that the territory of the ROC is divided into the \"Mainland Area\" and the \"[[free area of the republic of china|Free Area]]\" (also known as \"Taiwan Area\"). Administratively, cross-strait relations are not conducted by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Republic of China)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] of Taiwan, but by the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], an instrument of the [[Executive Yuan]]. The relations with Hong Kong and [[Macau]] are also conducted by the Mainland Affairs Council, although not all regulations applicable to mainland China automatically apply to those territories.\n\nTaiwanese and Chinese governments do not directly interact. Talks are conducted by China's [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] (ARATS) and Taiwan's [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF), privately constituted bodies that are controlled and directly answerable to the executive branches of their respective governments.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, Hong Kong and [[Macau]] were [[British Hong Kong|British]] and [[Portuguese Macau|Portuguese]] colonies respectively. They provided neutral detour points for people and goods crossing the strait. They and Singapore served as venues for talks between the two sides at that time. One ''[[modus vivendi]]'' outcome of such talks was the [[1992 Consensus]], arising from a 1992 meeting in Hong Kong. Under this consensus, the two sides agree that both Taiwan and mainland China are under the same single sovereignty of China, but the two sides agree to disagree on which side is the legitimate representative of that sovereignty.

Panamanians studying in Taiwan were given the choice of returning to Panama within 30 days or continuing their studies in China. Panama was motivated by promises of multibillion-dollar investments.  It all began with a letter sent in 2015 to the Chinese government that, according to Isabel Saint Malo, Panama's vice president, was titled \"Panama wants to make ties with China\". The contents of the letter are kept confidential, as well as the reasons of why it was sent. It has also been kept confidential who delivered the letter and assisted in the switchover process, which is only described as \"a distinguished member of the Chinese community living in Panama\". The exembassador of the US to Panama, [[John Feeley]], said that he had asked [[List of heads of state of Panama|Panamanian President]] [[Juan Carlos Varela]] about the switchover in 2016 but Varela lied to him, saying that there were no plans to make the switchover. He also said that Varela didn't tell him the truth until 1 hour before the nationwide announcement. Others questioned why the Panamanian government continues to use equipment donated by Taiwan. The Panamanian government initially gave no reason, later saying that one reason was because \"China is the second largest user of the Panama Canal\" and President Varela said it was because he \"couldn't accept it anymore\" and \"that's what every responsible leader would do\". The Panamanian government officially said that Taiwan was an inalienable part of China and that the switchover was to comply with the one-China policy. The ROC government said that Panama was its \"number one ally\" and that it would not participate in Beijing's checkbook diplomacy. The Taiwanese government complained that Panama maliciously hid the switchover process until the last moment. In the first year of diplomatic relations, 19 treaties were signed, including a Free Trade Treaty. Varela said that its main purpose was to allow Chinese nationals to easily invest in Panama. Controversies over the sudden switchover, included lack of due process, unusually high levels of confidentiality, and the fact that a few weeks before the switchover, Taiwan had donated medical equipment to Panama. In 2018, the first flight from Beijing To Panama by Air China landed in [[Tocumen International Airport]], with a technical stop in Houston. Varela called it a milestone in Panamanian aviation. Due to this new route, the Panamanian ministry of tourism expected at least 40,000 Chinese tourist visits per year. \"History and socioeconomic reality\" were cited as reasons. Varela said that the move was backed by diplomatic relationships dating from 1912 and that the move strengthened the existing relationships, despite the fact that those relationships were with the ROC, not the PRC. As a result, Panama City was almost immediately added to China's list of officially approved tourist destinations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prensa.com/economia/Aterriza-primer-Air-China-Panama_0_5001249854.html|title=Aterriza el primer vuelo de Air China en Panam\u00e1 &#124; La Prensa Panam\u00e1|date=5 April 2018|website=www.prensa.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laestrella.com.pa/nacional/180323/air-china-vuelo-beijing-inaugura|title=Air China inaugura vuelo Beijing-Houston-Panam\u00e1|first=GESE-La Estrella de|last=Panam\u00e1|website=La Estrella de Panam\u00e1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40256499|title=Panama cuts ties with Taiwan in favour of China|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Conoce-posible-ruta-estaciones-Panama-Chiriqui_0_4966003387.html|title=Conoce la posible ruta y estaciones del tren Panam\u00e1-Chiriqu\u00ed|date=17 February 2018|website=TVN}}</ref>\nThe [[Chinese Communist Party]] government has offered the [[Paname\u00f1ista Party]]-led government a free feasibility study for the planned 4th set of locks in the Panama Canal to gain a competitive advantage in bids for choosing the company to build the 4th set of locks, not to mention plans for a 1200 hectare industrial park on the Pacific coast and a 4 hectare campus in Amador near the Biomuseo to house the PRC embassy in Panama. There are also fears that Panama could turn into a conflict zone between the US and the PRC, due to Panama's strategic location. A Panamanian government agency later said that the switchover was because of Taiwanese president [[Tsai Ing-wen]]'s violations and lack of regard to the 1992 consensus regarding China, Taiwan and the One-china policy. Panamanian newspaper La Estrella questioned the reasons Varela initially gave for the switchover, like \"China is the world's largest population and the 2nd largest economy and user of the Panama Canal\", calling Varela's actions contradictory and saying that the reasons Varela gave were the reality Panama has lived under for decades, so those couldn't be regarded as valid reasons for the switchover.

However, in 1995 CAL dropped the [[national colours]] from its [[Aircraft livery|livery]], and now flies to international destinations under its own name. Many countries' national airlines similarly set up special subsidiaries to operate services to Taipei, with a different name, and livery omitting national symbols. For example, [[British Airways]]' now defunct subsidiary, [[British Asia Airways]], operated flights to London, [[KLM]]'s subsidiary, [[KLM Asia]], operated flights to [[Amsterdam]], and [[Swissair]]'s subsidiary, [[Swissair#Swissair Asia|Swissair Asia]], operated flights to [[Zurich]], [[Air France#Air France Asie and Air France Cargo Asie|Air France Asie]] operated flights to Paris while [[Qantas]] had a subsidiary called [[Australia Asia Airlines]], which operated flights to Sydney. Other countries' flag carriers, such as Germany's [[Lufthansa]], operated flights to Taipei using an existing subsidiary (in Lufthansa's case, [[Condor Airlines|Condor]]).\n\n[[Japan Air Lines]] established a subsidiary called [[Japan Asia Airways]] to operate flights to Tokyo. Before the completion of the second runway at New Tokyo International Airport (now [[Narita International Airport]]) near Tokyo, Japan, airlines from Taiwan were required to fly to [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]] (commonly known as ''Haneda Airport'') in [[Ota, Tokyo]] in order not to offend the airlines from the PRC that flew to Narita. [[All Nippon Airways]], however, used an existing subsidiary, [[Air Nippon]]. With the implementation of a new Japan-Taiwan air agreement, [[Japan Air Lines|JAL]] and [[Air Nippon|ANA]] took over flight operations between Japan and Taiwan in April 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jal.com/en/history/history/jal/age_04-10.html|title=History of JAL \u2013 History of JAL|website=jal.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ana.co.jp/eng/aboutana/press/2007/080123.html|title=Press Release|website=ana.co.jp}}</ref>\n\nBeginning July 2008, charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan, which were traditionally only allowed on special holidays such as Chinese New Year, were expanded greatly.\n\n===Telecommunications===\n[[List of country calling codes|International dialing code]]s are assigned by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) to its member states and their dependencies.
