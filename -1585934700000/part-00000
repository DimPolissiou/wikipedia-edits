The ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' names them the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles. They were the first act to have three [[single (music)|singles]] enter the charts at number one; all six of the band's [[record chart|chart-toppers]] were [[songwriter|penned]] by [[Noddy Holder]] and [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]]. As of 2006, total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best-selling single, \"[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]\", has sold in excess of one million copies.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=506}} According to the 1999 BBC documentary ''It's Slade'', the band have sold over 50 million records worldwide.(Slade is also very tall,about 16 feet and has quick change in behavior sometimes)<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pf7kr |title=BBC Four - It's Slade |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=12 April 2014 |accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing an unsuccessful move to the U.S. in 1975, Slade's popularity waned but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last-minute replacements for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Rock Festival]]. The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career. The original line-up split in 1992, but reformed later in the year as Slade II. The band have continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day. They have also shortened the group name back to Slade.\n\nA number of artists from diverse genres have cited Slade as an influence, including [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Ramones]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Undertones]], [[The Runaways]], [[The Clash]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Cheap Trick]], and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]. ''The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Music'' tells of Holder's powerful vocals, guitarist [[Dave Hill]]'s equally arresting dress sense, and the [[Sensational spelling|deliberate misspelling]] of their song titles (such as \"[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]\" and \"[[Mama Weer All Crazee Now]]\") for which they became well known.{{sfn|Du Noyer|2003|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n==Overview==\nAll members of Slade grew up in the [[Black Country]]. Drummer [[Don Powell]] bassist [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]] were born and raised in [[Wolverhampton]], lead vocalist [[Noddy Holder]] was born and raised in nearby [[Caldmore]], and lead guitarist [[Dave Hill]] moved to Wolverhampton from [[Holbeton]] as a child. Slade have released over 30 albums, three of which reached No. 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=506}} Their releases have spent 315 weeks in the UK charts and they have earned 24 top 30 UK hits {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.<ref name=UKCharts>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/30945/slade/ |title=Slade - Official Uk Charts |publisher=www.officialcharts.com |accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nSlade dominated the UK singles charts during the early 1970s, outperforming chart rivals such as [[Wizzard]], [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[T.

Slade's career was unexpectedly revived when the band were asked to perform at the 1980 Reading Festival when [[Ozzy Osbourne]] pulled out at the last minute. For the next two years, the band produced material tailored towards the heavy metal scene and by 1984, they finally cracked the American market with the hits \"Run Runaway\" and \"My Oh My.\" This new-found success did not last long, however, and despite a top 25 UK hit in the early '90s the band split shortly after in 1992.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years (1966\u20131970)===\n[[File:SladeSkinheads1969.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Slade in their skinhead phase in 1969<br/>from left: Powell, Lea, Holder, Hill.]]\n\nIn 1964, drummer [[Don Powell]] and guitarist [[Dave Hill]] were part of a Midland-based group called the Vendors.

Powell and Hill asked Holder if he would be interested in joining The 'N Betweens, but Holder declined. Later, back in their home town of [[Wolverhampton]], the musicians met again and this time Holder agreed to join the group. [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]], whose musical background and strong bass guitar skills were considered an asset, had already been recruited.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> Lea, who also played the piano and violin, had been in the Staffordshire Youth Orchestra and had gained first class honours in a London music-school practical exam.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\">{{cite book |title=Slade, Feel the Noize!: an illustrated biography |last=Charlesworth |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Charlesworth |year=1984 |publisher=[[Music Sales Group|Omnibus Press]] |location=London |isbn=0-7119-0538-X |page= |pages= |url= }}</ref>\n\nBy 1966, this new version of the 'N Betweens had recorded a promo single of the [[Otis Redding]] track \"Security\" and a self-penned song, \"Evil Witchman\", released on [[Highland Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/artist/the-n-betweens/uk |title=The N' Betweens Discography \u2013 UK |publisher=45cat |date=2 December 1966 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> A further single, \"You Better Run\" was released on Columbia Records and produced by [[Kim Fowley]].<ref name=autogenerated12 /><ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\">{{cite book | first= Jo | last= Rice | year= 1982 | title= The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits | edition= 1st | publisher= Guinness Superlatives Ltd | location= Enfield, Middlesex | page= 141 | isbn= 978-0-85112-250-2}}</ref> This last single was reported by Powell to have topped the regional midland charts although it failed to make any national impact.<ref>It's Slade 1999 Documentary</ref> Between 1966 and 1967, the band's performance centred on the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Tamla Motown]] styles, while Noddy's flair for showmanship began to give the band a focus. During 1967, the band recorded the track \"Delighted to See You\" which remained unreleased until 1994, where it featured on the various artists compilation ''Psychedelia at Abbey Road''. Although the group did not record again for roughly two years, they built up a respectable reputation on the live circuit.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\nA local promoter, Roger Allen spotted the group in 1969 and alerted the head of [[A&R]] at [[Philips Records]], Jack Baverstock. The group spent a week in the Philips studio at Stanhope Place recording an album, after which Baverstock offered to sign the group to [[Fontana Records]] if they changed their name and obtained London-based management. The band were initially hesitant because of the reputation gained as the 'N Betweens' but eventually agreed to Ambrose Slade, a name inspired by Baverstock's secretary, who had named her handbag Ambrose and her shoes Slade.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"Holder\">{{cite book|title=Who's Crazee Now? |last=Holder |first=Noddy |authorlink=Noddy Holder|author2=Verrico, Lisa  |year=2000 |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-187503-X |page= |pages= |url= }}</ref> Baverstock also found the group an agent, John Gunnel, who had previously worked with the entertainment entrepreneur [[Robert Stigwood]].\n\nThe band's debut album ''[[Beginnings (Ambrose Slade album)|Beginnings]]'', released in mid-1969, was a commercial failure, as was the instrumental single \"Genesis\" and the follow-up single \"[[Wild Winds Are Blowing]]\".<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref>Beginnings remastered album booklet</ref> While the album was being recorded, the band were visited by Gunnel and his business partner, [[The Animals|Animals']] bassist [[Chas Chandler]]. Chandler was impressed with what he heard in the studio, and after seeing the band live the following day, offered to manage them. As Chandler had previous managerial experience with [[Jimi Hendrix]], the band accepted.<ref name=\"Holder\"/>\n\nChandler was not pleased with the debut album and thought the band would benefit from writing their own material and a change of image.

In 1970, the band shortened their name to Slade and released a new single, a cover of \"[[Shape of Things to Come (song)|Shape of Things to Come]]\" which, despite a performance on United Kingdom music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', failed to chart.<ref name=\"autogenerated17\">{{discogs artist}}</ref>\n\nChandler moved Slade to [[Polydor Records]], believing a higher-profile label would boost sales.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> Lyrics were added to the instrumental \"Genesis\" from the band's debut album, the result being released as \"[[Know Who You Are]]\", but again, the single failed to make any impression on the UK chart as did the album ''[[Play It Loud]]'', released in late 1970 and produced by Chandler himself.

Feeling that they were becoming stale and had achieved all they could in Europe, Slade decided to a make a permanent move to the States and try to build a solid reputation from live performances; just as they had previously done in the UK. According to the Slade Fan Club newsletter of August and September 1975, the band took twelve tons of equipment, worth approximately \u00a345,000 at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/1507704_orig.jpg |title=Thanks for the Memory |publisher=Sladefanclub.com |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref><ref>Slade Fan Club Newsletter August \u2013 September 1975</ref> Throughout the remainder of 1975 and 1976, Slade toured the US, often with other bands such as [[Aerosmith]], [[ZZ Top]] and [[Black Sabbath]], only returning to the UK for TV performances of new singles.\n\nBetween tours Holder and Lea began writing for a new album which was heavily influenced by the US and aimed at an American audience.

Released in April, it failed to chart at all, the first to do so since the band's rise to fame in 1971.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> Fans within the UK accused the band of 'selling out' and forgetting about their fan base at home.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\n===Wilderness years (1977\u20131980)===\n[[File:Slade 18041977 01 400.jpg|thumb|Slade performing in Norway in 1977.]]\nOverall, Slade's American venture was seen as a failure, although the band felt improved and rejuvenated.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> The live success in many cities such as St. Louis, Philadelphia, and New York was not translated into US airplay, however, and the band returned to the UK at the beginning of 1977 to find that [[punk rock]] was the new popular style of rock and that they were largely forgotten and out of fashion.<ref>Slade's remastered album Nobody's Fools booklet</ref> Chandler decided not to renew the band's contract with [[Polydor Records]], instead signing them to his own record label, [[Barn Records]].<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\nThe band's first release with Barn Records was the single \"[[Gypsy Roadhog]]\", in January 1977.

The single proved to be a moderate success, peaking at number 32 in the UK.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> Slade was unable to keep momentum for the next single, \"[[Give Us a Goal]]\", released in March 1978. Based on English [[football chant]]s, it was intended to appeal to fans of the sport but failed to make any impact whatsoever,<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> other than making the airplay-based charts of Radio Luxembourg and Manchester's Piccadilly Radio. It has however been used in successful advertising campaigns in recent years.\n\nIn August 1978, Noddy Holder was reportedly involved in a brawl with a bouncer (Desmond Brothers) backstage at The Stoneleigh Club in [[Porthcawl]], [[South Wales]]. The bouncer was later jailed for three months for instigating the attack on Holder, after he had told the club bouncers to stop hurting the kids in the crowd who were pushed up against the stage, during the show. Holder showed his mettle by performing the next night as planned, although he had a broken nose, at a club in [[Cleethorpes]], Lincolnshire. The story of the attack would later be written into the 1981 single \"Knuckle Sandwich Nancy\", which Holder insisted would be released as a single. The band said in contemporary interviews that RCA and Chas Chandler objected to the single's release, so it came out on the [[Cheapskate Records|Cheapskate]] label, rather than on RCA, the label that they were contracted to.\n\nIn late 1978, the band released \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Bolero]]\", which was another commercial failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/2014127be |title=Slade - Rock 'n' Roll Bolero / It's Alright Buy Me - Barn - Belgium - 2014 127 |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref> As the band were still a respected live act, and because the 1972 album ''Slade Alive!'' had been so successful, the group decided to release another live album. ''[[Slade Alive, Vol. 2]]'' consisted of performances recorded during the 1976 Autumn tour of America and the 1977 Spring tour of the UK.\n\nIn 1979, the band released a further three singles: \"[[Ginny, Ginny]]\", \"[[Sign of the Times (Slade song)|Sign of the Times]]\" and a cover of the party track \"[[Hokey Cokey|Okey Cokey]]\". All failed to chart.

In late 1979, Lea formed [[The Dummies]] as a side project, with his brother Frank. They released three singles, which received plenty of radio airplay but sales suffered from distribution problems.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> In February 1980, Holder was briefly considered as a replacement for [[Bon Scott]], the recently deceased singer of [[AC/DC]]. Holder was said to have turned the position down, despite Slade's current situation, because of his loyalty to the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |title=noddy holder interview \u2013 at |publisher=Soundchecks.co.uk |accessdate=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405014451/http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |archivedate=5 April 2005  }}</ref> In mid-1980, Slade released their first [[extended play]] titled \"[[Six of the Best (EP)|Six of the Best]]\" which featured three tracks from the ''Return to Base'' album and three brand new rock tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/ep/slade/six_of_the_best/ |title=Six of the Best by Slade : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Even though it was being sold for a lower than usual price of \u00a31.49, it still failed to sell enough to make a chart appearance. As a result, the band stopped working together and Hill started driving couples to their weddings in his own [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]], to earn money. The business never really took off, as Hill only drove one couple (a pair of fans).<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\n===Comeback and heavy metal following (1980\u20131982)===\n[[File:Slade at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|Slade performing at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff in December 1981.]]\n[[Ozzy Osbourne]] was due to play the Reading Festival in August 1980, during his [[Blizzard of Ozz]] tour, but cancelled at short notice as his band was not ready, leaving the organisers searching for a last-minute replacement. Slade were suggested, but Hill, still demoralised, had effectively left the band and initially refused to take part when asked by the other band members. Eventually, Chandler went to his home and convinced Hill to play what should have been a farewell performance in front of 65,000 rock fans, instead of Slade's disbanding and disappearing without a trace. To Hill's astonishment, the band stole the show and quickly became the darlings of the music press and radio. Highlights of their performance were broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Friday Rock Show]] Reading special. Afterwards, the band signed to Cheapskate Records, owned by Chandler, Lea and his brother Frank, which gave the band more control of their material and products.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"Holder\" />\n\nThe band's new-found success led to a hurriedly released extended play, ''[[Alive at Reading]]'', which reached number 44, the band's first chart action in the UK since 1977. Another extended play followed in November, titled \"[[Xmas Ear Bender (EP)|Xmas Ear Bender]]\" which peaked at number 70.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/cheap11 |title=Various Artists \u2013 Xmas Ear Bender \u2013 Cheapskate \u2013 CHEAP 11 |publisher=45cat |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Polydor Records also saw an opportunity to capitalise on the band's new success and released the compilation ''[[Slade Smashes!]]'' at the beginning of November.

The idea for the new track came after a performance in [[Amsterdam]] at the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] Club. An enthusiastic audience who would not go home were overheard chanting by Lea, who was downstairs in the dressing room. Realising the potential of the chant, the song \"[[We'll Bring the House Down (song)|We'll Bring the House Down]]\" was written and released in January 1981. Aimed at the new audience which consisted of mainly [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans, it showed Slade's heavier rock sound.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated18\">Greatest Hits compilation booklet</ref> The single hit the number 10 spot in the UK, becoming Slade's first top ten hit since 1976.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> In March, an album consisting of four new tracks and six tracks from the previous album ''Return to Base'' was released.

The band refused to return so soon, and opted to play the Castle Donnington Heavy Rock Festival instead.\n\nIn May, the band released \"[[Knuckle Sandwich Nancy (song)|Knuckle Sandwich Nancy]]\" which featured lyrics commenting on the assault on Holder in the Welsh nightclub. Although eagerly wanted as a single by the band, Chandler was not entirely convinced and thus it was half-heartedly released and failed to chart. The band blamed Chandler for losing interest, and began to manage themselves. Chandler sold his share of Cheapskate Records and negotiated a favourable deal for the band with [[RCA Records]]<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated15\">Till Deaf Do Us Part remaster booklet</ref> The new deal meant that Slade's records would get worldwide release except in the US and Canada.

The band came back with two possible singles, \"[[My Oh My (Slade song)|My Oh My]]\" and \"[[Run Runaway]]\". A raw demo of Holder singing \"My Oh My\" over Lea's piano, was received with particular enthusiasm by RCA. The label was delighted with both the tracks and hired outside producer [[John Punter]] to work with the band to record them. This was the first time the band had another producer since Chandler. Punter's methods differed to those Slade were used to, in that the band recorded all their parts separately. This method eventually met with the band's approval, except for Holder, who believed this method was ruining their unique chemistry and was losing their rock n roll edge.<ref>The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome remastered album</ref> The power ballad \"My Oh My\" was released in November 1983, where it slowly climbed the charts and by December, Slade found themselves competing for the Christmas number-one spot.

However, by the end of the month, Holder had decided to finally leave the band. He had become weary of the constant arguing and discontent within the band, and effectively managing their day-to-day affairs. He left after 26 years with the band to explore other career paths. Believing Holder to be an integral member of Slade, Lea also effectively retired from the band, preferring to work alone in the studio, rather than continue without Holder. Powell briefly became a bartender in a hotel his wife managed, but would soon re-join Hill to form Slade II later in the year.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3jj_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT335&dq=%22walk+this+way%22+don+powell#v=onepage&q=%22walk+this+way%22+don+powell&f=false|title=Look Wot I Dun: Don Powell of Slade|first1=Don|last1=Powell|first2=Lise Lyng|last2=Falkenberg|date=11 October 2013|publisher=Omnibus Press|accessdate=28 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781783230006}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath and recent years (1993\u20132019)===\n[[File:Don Powell Book Signing.jpg|thumb|[[Don Powell]] signing copies of his biography ''Look Wot I Dun \u2013 My Life in Slade'' at [[Liverpool One]]'s [[Waterstones]] in 2014]]\n\nSlade II was formed in 1992 by Hill with Powell and three other musicians - Craig Fenney (bass), Steve Makin (guitar) and Steve Whalley (Lead vocals and guitar).

The ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' names them the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles. They were the first act to have three [[single (music)|singles]] enter the charts at number one; all six of the band's [[record chart|chart-toppers]] were [[songwriter|penned]] by [[Noddy Holder]] and [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]]. As of 2006, total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best-selling single, \"[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]\", has sold in excess of one million copies.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=506}} According to the 1999 BBC documentary ''It's Slade'', the band have sold over 50 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pf7kr |title=BBC Four - It's Slade |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=12 April 2014 |accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing an unsuccessful move to the U.S. in 1975, Slade's popularity waned but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last-minute replacements for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Rock Festival]]. The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career. The original line-up split in 1992, but reformed later in the year as Slade II. The band have continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day. They have also shortened the group name back to Slade.\n\nA number of artists from diverse genres have cited Slade as an influence, including [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Ramones]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Undertones]], [[The Runaways]], [[The Clash]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Cheap Trick]], and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]. ''The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Music'' tells of Holder's powerful vocals, guitarist [[Dave Hill]]'s equally arresting dress sense, and the [[Sensational spelling|deliberate misspelling]] of their song titles (such as \"[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]\" and \"[[Mama Weer All Crazee Now]]\") for which they became well known.{{sfn|Du Noyer|2003|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n==Overview==\nAll members of Slade grew up in the [[Black Country]]. Drummer [[Don Powell]] bassist [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]] were born and raised in [[Wolverhampton]], lead vocalist [[Noddy Holder]] was born and raised in nearby [[Caldmore]], and lead guitarist [[Dave Hill]] moved to Wolverhampton from [[Holbeton]] as a child. Slade have released over 30 albums, three of which reached No. 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=506}} Their releases have spent 315 weeks in the UK charts and they have earned 24 top 30 UK hits {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.<ref name=UKCharts>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/30945/slade/ |title=Slade - Official Uk Charts |publisher=www.officialcharts.com |accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nSlade dominated the UK singles charts during the early 1970s, outperforming chart rivals such as [[Wizzard]], [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[T.

Slade sold more singles in the UK than any other group of the 1970s. In 1973 alone, \"[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]\" sold over one million copies globally, obtaining [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] status.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/336 336] |isbn=978-0-214-20512-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/336 }}</ref> They toured Europe in 1973 and the US in 1974.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/>\n\nSlade moved to the US in the mid-1970s, in an attempt to break into the American market and although this was largely unsuccessful, they left their mark on a number of US bands who have since cited Slade as an influence.<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\"/> During the late 1970s, the band returned to the UK following years of commercial failure both at home and abroad. Slade's career was unexpectedly revived when the band were asked to perform at the 1980 Reading Festival when [[Ozzy Osbourne]] pulled out at the last minute. For the next two years, the band produced material tailored towards the heavy metal scene and by 1984, they finally cracked the American market with the hits \"Run Runaway\" and \"My Oh My.\" This new-found success did not last long, however, and despite a top 25 UK hit in the early '90s the band split shortly after in 1992.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years (1966\u20131970)===\n[[File:SladeSkinheads1969.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Slade in their skinhead phase in 1969<br/>from left: Powell, Lea, Holder, Hill.]]\n\nIn 1964, drummer [[Don Powell]] and guitarist [[Dave Hill]] were part of a Midland-based group called the Vendors.

Signed to Columbia Records, the band released three singles in 1965.<ref name=\"autogenerated12\">The Genesis of Slade compilation booklet</ref> After listening to American blues artists such as [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]], [[John Lee Hooker]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]], the Vendors decided on a change of direction and name:<ref name=\"autogenerated12\"/> As the ''N Betweens'' they gained greater recognition and began to get supporting gigs with acts such as [[the Hollies]], [[the Yardbirds]], [[Georgie Fame]] and [[Spencer Davis]].<ref name=\"Guinness Rockopedia\">{{cite book |first=David |last=Roberts |year=1998 |title=Guinness Rockopedia |edition=1st |publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd. |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/395 395] |isbn=978-0-85112-072-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/395 }}</ref>\n\nThe Mavericks and the 'N Betweens were on their way to separate gigs in Germany when they met on a ferry in 1965. Powell and Hill asked Holder if he would be interested in joining The 'N Betweens, but Holder declined. Later, back in their home town of [[Wolverhampton]], the musicians met again and this time Holder agreed to join the group. [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]], whose musical background and strong bass guitar skills were considered an asset, had already been recruited.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> Lea, who also played the piano and violin, had been in the Staffordshire Youth Orchestra and had gained first class honours in a London music-school practical exam.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\">{{cite book |title=Slade, Feel the Noize!: an illustrated biography |last=Charlesworth |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Charlesworth |year=1984 |publisher=[[Music Sales Group|Omnibus Press]] |location=London |isbn=0-7119-0538-X |page= |pages= |url= }}</ref>\n\nBy 1966, this new version of the 'N Betweens had recorded a promo single of the [[Otis Redding]] track \"Security\" and a self-penned song, \"Evil Witchman\", released on [[Highland Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/artist/the-n-betweens/uk |title=The N' Betweens Discography \u2013 UK |publisher=45cat |date=2 December 1966 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> A further single, \"You Better Run\" was released on Columbia Records and produced by [[Kim Fowley]].<ref name=autogenerated12 /><ref name=\"500 Number One Hits\">{{cite book | first= Jo | last= Rice | year= 1982 | title= The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits | edition= 1st | publisher= Guinness Superlatives Ltd | location= Enfield, Middlesex | page= 141 | isbn= 978-0-85112-250-2}}</ref> This last single was reported by Powell to have topped the regional midland charts although it failed to make any national impact.<ref>It's Slade 1999 Documentary</ref> Between 1966 and 1967, the band's performance centred on the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Tamla Motown]] styles, while Noddy's flair for showmanship began to give the band a focus. During 1967, the band recorded the track \"Delighted to See You\" which remained unreleased until 1994, where it featured on the various artists compilation ''Psychedelia at Abbey Road''. Although the group did not record again for roughly two years, they built up a respectable reputation on the live circuit.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\nA local promoter, Roger Allen spotted the group in 1969 and alerted the head of [[A&R]] at [[Philips Records]], Jack Baverstock. The group spent a week in the Philips studio at Stanhope Place recording an album, after which Baverstock offered to sign the group to [[Fontana Records]] if they changed their name and obtained London-based management. The band were initially hesitant because of the reputation gained as the 'N Betweens' but eventually agreed to Ambrose Slade, a name inspired by Baverstock's secretary, who had named her handbag Ambrose and her shoes Slade.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"Holder\">{{cite book|title=Who's Crazee Now? |last=Holder |first=Noddy |authorlink=Noddy Holder|author2=Verrico, Lisa  |year=2000 |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-187503-X |page= |pages= |url= }}</ref> Baverstock also found the group an agent, John Gunnel, who had previously worked with the entertainment entrepreneur [[Robert Stigwood]].\n\nThe band's debut album ''[[Beginnings (Ambrose Slade album)|Beginnings]]'', released in mid-1969, was a commercial failure, as was the instrumental single \"Genesis\" and the follow-up single \"[[Wild Winds Are Blowing]]\".<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref>Beginnings remastered album booklet</ref> While the album was being recorded, the band were visited by Gunnel and his business partner, [[The Animals|Animals']] bassist [[Chas Chandler]]. Chandler was impressed with what he heard in the studio, and after seeing the band live the following day, offered to manage them. As Chandler had previous managerial experience with [[Jimi Hendrix]], the band accepted.<ref name=\"Holder\"/>\n\nChandler was not pleased with the debut album and thought the band would benefit from writing their own material and a change of image. The band adopted a [[skinhead]] look as an attempt to gain publicity from what was a newsworthy youth fashion trend, but this also added an unwelcome association with [[football hooliganism]].<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> Noddy Holder and Don Powell were particularly tough-looking individuals already, and the skinhead look exacerbated the disturbing effect of having \"toughs\" in the band. In 1970, the band shortened their name to Slade and released a new single, a cover of \"[[Shape of Things to Come (song)|Shape of Things to Come]]\" which, despite a performance on United Kingdom music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', failed to chart.<ref name=\"autogenerated17\">{{discogs artist}}</ref>\n\nChandler moved Slade to [[Polydor Records]], believing a higher-profile label would boost sales.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> Lyrics were added to the instrumental \"Genesis\" from the band's debut album, the result being released as \"[[Know Who You Are]]\", but again, the single failed to make any impression on the UK chart as did the album ''[[Play It Loud]]'', released in late 1970 and produced by Chandler himself. Later the album was retrospectively well received by fans and critics, and earned a silver disc for sales.<ref>{{cite web |last=Viglione |first=Joe |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r18182 |title=Play It Loud \u2013 Slade |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref><ref>Play It Loud remastered booklet</ref>\n\n===Glam rock, success and peak (1971\u20131974)===\n[[File:Noddy Holder - Slade - 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Noddy Holder]] (right) and [[Dave Hill]] (left), near the height of their fame in 1973, showing some of their more extreme [[glam rock]] fashions.]]\n\nChandler had been managing the band for almost two years without success when he suggested releasing a version of the [[Bobby Marchan]] song \"[[Get Down and Get With It]]\", originally performed by [[Little Richard]]. Slade still enjoyed a good reputation as a live act and the song had been used in their performances for many years. Always popular, the song's lyrics demanded audience participation and it was hoped that the feeling of a live gig would be projected into the studio recording.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"Holder\"/> The song was released in mid-1971, and by August it entered the top 20 in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 16.<ref name=UKCharts/>\n\nThe band members grew their hair long and allied themselves to the [[glam rock]] movement of the early 1970s. Hill's stage costumes also became notable during this period.<ref name=\"allmusic5449\">{{cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p5449/biography |title=Slade |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Chandler now demanded the band write a follow-up single themselves which led to Lea and Holder writing \"[[Coz I Luv You]]\". The song was written in half an hour and started a writing partnership which would continue throughout Slade's career. Upon hearing the track played to him acoustically, a pleased Chandler predicted the song would make number one.

Feeling that they were becoming stale and had achieved all they could in Europe, Slade decided to a make a permanent move to the States and try to build a solid reputation from live performances; just as they had previously done in the UK. According to the Slade Fan Club newsletter of August and September 1975, the band took twelve tons of equipment, worth approximately \u00a345,000 at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/1507704_orig.jpg |title=Thanks for the Memory |publisher=Sladefanclub.com |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref><ref>Slade Fan Club Newsletter August \u2013 September 1975</ref> Throughout the remainder of 1975 and 1976, Slade toured the US, often with other bands such as [[Aerosmith]], [[ZZ Top]] and [[Black Sabbath]], only returning to the UK for TV performances of new singles.\n\nBetween tours Holder and Lea began writing for a new album which was heavily influenced by the US and aimed at an American audience. The group booked themselves into New York's [[Record Plant Studios]] in mid-1975 to record the album ''[[Nobody's Fools (album)|Nobody's Fools]]''.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref>Nobody's Fools remastered booklet</ref> Featuring backing vocals from [[Tasha Thomas]], it contained elements of [[soul music|soul]], [[country music|country]] and [[funk]] music.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\nThe first two singles from the new album, \"[[In For a Penny]]\" and \"[[Let's Call It Quits (song)|Let's Call It Quits]]\"  were released in November 1975 and January 1976 respectively, both made number 11 in the UK charts although the latter made no impression outside of the UK.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/><ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> The album, released in March 1976, failed to make any impact in America and was also a disappointment in the UK where it peaked at number 14 and dropped out of the charts completely after only 4 weeks.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> The final track from the album was the title track \"[[Nobody's Fool (Slade song)|Nobody's Fool]]\". Released in April, it failed to chart at all, the first to do so since the band's rise to fame in 1971.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> Fans within the UK accused the band of 'selling out' and forgetting about their fan base at home.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\n===Wilderness years (1977\u20131980)===\n[[File:Slade 18041977 01 400.jpg|thumb|Slade performing in Norway in 1977.]]\nOverall, Slade's American venture was seen as a failure, although the band felt improved and rejuvenated.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> The live success in many cities such as St. Louis, Philadelphia, and New York was not translated into US airplay, however, and the band returned to the UK at the beginning of 1977 to find that [[punk rock]] was the new popular style of rock and that they were largely forgotten and out of fashion.<ref>Slade's remastered album Nobody's Fools booklet</ref> Chandler decided not to renew the band's contract with [[Polydor Records]], instead signing them to his own record label, [[Barn Records]].<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\nThe band's first release with Barn Records was the single \"[[Gypsy Roadhog]]\", in January 1977. The track was performed on the children's show ''[[Blue Peter]]'', but complaints arose due to supposed drug references and the record was subsequently banned by the [[BBC]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">Whatever Happened to Slade remastered booklet</ref> This in turn led to the single's stalling at number 48 in the charts.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> The title of the subsequent album was taken from a piece of graffiti seen in London, and made reference to the band's current position in the public eye: ''[[Whatever Happened to Slade]]'' was released in March and failed to make any chart appearance in the UK.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> Chandler was reportedly disappointed in the material that Holder and Lea were writing, claiming that the album was not commercial enough, but despite its lack of mainstream success, the album was met with critical praise and support from the English punk movement of the time.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/> Since their return to the UK, the band continued to tour but mainly in smaller venues such as universities and clubs.\n\n\"Burning in the Heat of Love\", released a month later, also failed to chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/2014106 |title=Slade - Burning In The Heat Of Love / Ready Steady Kids - Barn - UK - 2014 106 |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref> In October, the band released an amalgamation of two Arthur Crudup songs, entitled \"[[My Baby Left Me|My Baby Left Me But That's Alright Mama]]\" as a tribute to the recent death of [[Elvis Presley]]. The single proved to be a moderate success, peaking at number 32 in the UK.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> Slade was unable to keep momentum for the next single, \"[[Give Us a Goal]]\", released in March 1978. Based on English [[football chant]]s, it was intended to appeal to fans of the sport but failed to make any impact whatsoever,<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> other than making the airplay-based charts of Radio Luxembourg and Manchester's Piccadilly Radio. It has however been used in successful advertising campaigns in recent years.\n\nIn August 1978, Noddy Holder was reportedly involved in a brawl with a bouncer (Desmond Brothers) backstage at The Stoneleigh Club in [[Porthcawl]], [[South Wales]]. The bouncer was later jailed for three months for instigating the attack on Holder, after he had told the club bouncers to stop hurting the kids in the crowd who were pushed up against the stage, during the show. Holder showed his mettle by performing the next night as planned, although he had a broken nose, at a club in [[Cleethorpes]], Lincolnshire. The story of the attack would later be written into the 1981 single \"Knuckle Sandwich Nancy\", which Holder insisted would be released as a single. The band said in contemporary interviews that RCA and Chas Chandler objected to the single's release, so it came out on the [[Cheapskate Records|Cheapskate]] label, rather than on RCA, the label that they were contracted to.\n\nIn late 1978, the band released \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Bolero]]\", which was another commercial failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/2014127be |title=Slade - Rock 'n' Roll Bolero / It's Alright Buy Me - Barn - Belgium - 2014 127 |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref> As the band were still a respected live act, and because the 1972 album ''Slade Alive!'' had been so successful, the group decided to release another live album. ''[[Slade Alive, Vol. 2]]'' consisted of performances recorded during the 1976 Autumn tour of America and the 1977 Spring tour of the UK.\n\nIn 1979, the band released a further three singles: \"[[Ginny, Ginny]]\", \"[[Sign of the Times (Slade song)|Sign of the Times]]\" and a cover of the party track \"[[Hokey Cokey|Okey Cokey]]\". All failed to chart. The Slade newsletter of the time announced that \"Ginny, Ginny\" had made the top 200 in the UK but not the official top 100.<ref>{{cite web |title=From Roots To Boots!: Slade News Issue 4 |date=10 September 1950}}</ref> In October 1979, the band released a new studio album ''[[Return to Base]]'', the first album not to have Chandler as producer.<ref>{{cite book |title=Slade, Feel the Noize!: an illustrated biography |last=Charlesworth |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Charlesworth |year=1984 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=London |isbn=0-7119-0538-X |pages=89\u201390 |url= }}</ref> Disagreements between Lea and Chandler, centring on business problems and Lea's desire to produce Slade's material, had been brewing since the recording of ''Whatever Happened to Slade'' in 1977.

Slade, not wishing to be rid of Chandler entirely, asked him to stay on for the time being as their manager, which Chandler agreed to do.<ref>We'll Bring the House Down remastered booklet</ref> The album was a failure in the UK but the following year it topped both the Telemoustique chart and the official album chart in Belgium.{{who|date=November 2011}} Released exclusively in Belgium, the album's version of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"I'm a Rocker\" also made number 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/6602796_orig.jpg|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120720214503/http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/6602796_orig.jpg|url-status=dead|title=6602796_orig.jpg (562x800 pixels)|archive-date=20 July 2012|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref><ref>Supporters Club Newsletter September \u2013 October 1981</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sladefanclub.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/3275309_orig.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 October 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120715021744/http://sladefanclub.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/3275309_orig.jpg |archivedate=15 July 2012  }}</ref>\n\nSlade's failures and lack of airplay led Lea to wonder if their material would be better received if recorded by another band. In late 1979, Lea formed [[The Dummies]] as a side project, with his brother Frank. They released three singles, which received plenty of radio airplay but sales suffered from distribution problems.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> In February 1980, Holder was briefly considered as a replacement for [[Bon Scott]], the recently deceased singer of [[AC/DC]]. Holder was said to have turned the position down, despite Slade's current situation, because of his loyalty to the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |title=noddy holder interview \u2013 at |publisher=Soundchecks.co.uk |accessdate=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405014451/http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |archivedate=5 April 2005  }}</ref> In mid-1980, Slade released their first [[extended play]] titled \"[[Six of the Best (EP)|Six of the Best]]\" which featured three tracks from the ''Return to Base'' album and three brand new rock tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/ep/slade/six_of_the_best/ |title=Six of the Best by Slade : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Even though it was being sold for a lower than usual price of \u00a31.49, it still failed to sell enough to make a chart appearance. As a result, the band stopped working together and Hill started driving couples to their weddings in his own [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]], to earn money. The business never really took off, as Hill only drove one couple (a pair of fans).<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\n===Comeback and heavy metal following (1980\u20131982)===\n[[File:Slade at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|Slade performing at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff in December 1981.]]\n[[Ozzy Osbourne]] was due to play the Reading Festival in August 1980, during his [[Blizzard of Ozz]] tour, but cancelled at short notice as his band was not ready, leaving the organisers searching for a last-minute replacement. Slade were suggested, but Hill, still demoralised, had effectively left the band and initially refused to take part when asked by the other band members. Eventually, Chandler went to his home and convinced Hill to play what should have been a farewell performance in front of 65,000 rock fans, instead of Slade's disbanding and disappearing without a trace. To Hill's astonishment, the band stole the show and quickly became the darlings of the music press and radio. Highlights of their performance were broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Friday Rock Show]] Reading special. Afterwards, the band signed to Cheapskate Records, owned by Chandler, Lea and his brother Frank, which gave the band more control of their material and products.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"Holder\" />\n\nThe band's new-found success led to a hurriedly released extended play, ''[[Alive at Reading]]'', which reached number 44, the band's first chart action in the UK since 1977. Another extended play followed in November, titled \"[[Xmas Ear Bender (EP)|Xmas Ear Bender]]\" which peaked at number 70.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/cheap11 |title=Various Artists \u2013 Xmas Ear Bender \u2013 Cheapskate \u2013 CHEAP 11 |publisher=45cat |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Polydor Records also saw an opportunity to capitalise on the band's new success and released the compilation ''[[Slade Smashes!]]'' at the beginning of November. The album was given plenty of promotion and spent 15 weeks in the UK charts, peaking at number 21.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> The album was certified UK Gold in December, having by then sold over 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"autogenerated11\">We'll Bring the House Down remaster booklet</ref>\n\nKeen to keep momentum with their new fans, the band set out to write a song with hit potential. The idea for the new track came after a performance in [[Amsterdam]] at the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] Club. An enthusiastic audience who would not go home were overheard chanting by Lea, who was downstairs in the dressing room. Realising the potential of the chant, the song \"[[We'll Bring the House Down (song)|We'll Bring the House Down]]\" was written and released in January 1981. Aimed at the new audience which consisted of mainly [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans, it showed Slade's heavier rock sound.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated18\">Greatest Hits compilation booklet</ref> The single hit the number 10 spot in the UK, becoming Slade's first top ten hit since 1976.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> In March, an album consisting of four new tracks and six tracks from the previous album ''Return to Base'' was released. Also called ''[[We'll Bring the House Down]]'' it peaked at number 25.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/><ref name=autogenerated11 />\n\n\"[[Wheels Ain't Coming Down]]\", which originally appeared as the opening track on the album ''Return to Base'', was released in March 1981 and reached number 60 in the UK. Although not a hit, it served to keep Slade in the public eye while they were writing new material and planning a European tour.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> Slade's success at the 1980 Reading festival was helping them fill large venues<ref name=autogenerated15 /> and led to their being asked about a return in 1981. The band refused to return so soon, and opted to play the Castle Donnington Heavy Rock Festival instead.\n\nIn May, the band released \"[[Knuckle Sandwich Nancy (song)|Knuckle Sandwich Nancy]]\" which featured lyrics commenting on the assault on Holder in the Welsh nightclub. Although eagerly wanted as a single by the band, Chandler was not entirely convinced and thus it was half-heartedly released and failed to chart. The band blamed Chandler for losing interest, and began to manage themselves. Chandler sold his share of Cheapskate Records and negotiated a favourable deal for the band with [[RCA Records]]<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated15\">Till Deaf Do Us Part remaster booklet</ref> The new deal meant that Slade's records would get worldwide release except in the US and Canada.

The band came back with two possible singles, \"[[My Oh My (Slade song)|My Oh My]]\" and \"[[Run Runaway]]\". A raw demo of Holder singing \"My Oh My\" over Lea's piano, was received with particular enthusiasm by RCA. The label was delighted with both the tracks and hired outside producer [[John Punter]] to work with the band to record them. This was the first time the band had another producer since Chandler. Punter's methods differed to those Slade were used to, in that the band recorded all their parts separately. This method eventually met with the band's approval, except for Holder, who believed this method was ruining their unique chemistry and was losing their rock n roll edge.<ref>The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome remastered album</ref> The power ballad \"My Oh My\" was released in November 1983, where it slowly climbed the charts and by December, Slade found themselves competing for the Christmas number-one spot.

As a child, Marina took dancing, singing and ballet lessons.\n\nIn 1986, she graduated from [[Russian Academy of Theatre Arts|GITIS]] (course of [[Oleg Tabakov]] and Avangard Leontiev).<ref name=\"ria\"/>\n\n===Career===\nImmediately after GITIS, she was admitted to the Theater studio of Oleg Tabakov. Some of the plays she performed were \"Ordinary Story\" (Elizaveta Alexandrovna), \"Nord Ost\" (Olga), \"Overstuffed Bochotara\" (Sylvia), \"Matrosskaya Tishina\" (Tanya), \"The Myth of Don Juan\" (Elmira) , \"Mechanical piano\" (Sofya Egorovna), \"Last\" (Love) and \"Farewell ... and applaud!\" (Madalena).<ref name=\"ria\"/>\n\nZudina began to act in cinema as a student. One of her first roles - Valentina in [[Georgy Natanson|Georgy Natanson's]] melodrama ''Valentin and Valentina'' (1985) based on the play by Mikhail Roshchina - she played while in her third year of studies. Then, there were the films ''Personal Case of Judge Ivanova'' (1985), ''[[After the Rain, on Thursday]]'' (1985), ''[[Through Main Street with an Orchestra]]'' (1986).<ref name=\"ria\"/>\n\nIn 1987, the drama of Yevgeny Gerasimov's ''Fun of the Young'' was released, where Zudina played a different role from her previous ones. Her character is an arrogant student of the technical school, who decides to make the teacher of physical education fall in love with her, so that she and her friends can get good grades.<ref name=\"ria\"/>\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Zudina often played the roles of girls who came to conquer Moscow. In the drama ''Life by the Limit'' (1989) Alexei Rudakova, she plays Limitchitsa Masha; in the comedy Andrei Razumovsky ''Mordashka'' (1990) - a hairdresser who came to conquer Moscow; in the detective Boris Grigoriev's ''Confession of the Keepers'' (1992) - a business and energetic girl who came to Moscow to go to VGIK.<ref name=\"ria\"/>\n\nAmong the latest works of the actress are the television series ''Behind the Scenes'' (2002), ''[[Yesenin (TV series)|Yesenin]]'' (2005), ''[[Adjutants of Love]]'' (2006), films ''Jubilee'' (2007) and ''The Non-lonely Ones'' (2009).<ref name=\"ria\"/>\n\nZudina continues to act in the Theatre Studio, some of the performances are \"Mad Day, or The Marriage of Figaro\" (Rosina), \"Uncle Vanya\" (Elena Andreevna), \"Idiot\" (Nastasya Filippovna), \"Every Sage is quite simple\" (Mamaeva) , \"Sublimation of Love\" (Paola).<ref name=\"ria\"/>\n\nIn the [[Moscow Art Theatre]], she performed in the plays Antigone (Antigone), Duck Hunt (Galina), The Last Victim by A.

Clothing is typically made of fabrics or [[textile]]s but over time has included garments made from [[animal skin]] or other thin sheets of materials put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to [[human being]]s and is a feature of all human [[societies]]. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social, and geographic considerations.\n\nClothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the [[weather|elements]], rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, [[Insect bites and stings|insect bites]], [[splinter]]s, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns and prickles]] by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a [[hygienic]] barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]].\n\nWearing clothes is also a [[Dress code|social norm]], and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]]. In most parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that [[Sex organ#Mammals|genitals]], [[breast]]s or [[buttocks]] are visible could be considered [[indecent exposure]].\n\n== Origin of clothing ==\n{{see also|Evolution of hair|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThere is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed. Estimates by various experts have ranged from 40,000 to 3 million years ago. Some more recent studies involving the evolution of body lice have implied a more recent development with some indicating a development of around 170,000 years ago and others indicating as little as 40,000. No single estimate is widely accepted.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser & Mark Stoneking |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=13 |pages=1414\u20131417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325 |issue=16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120019/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"Stoneking\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024|title=Molecular Evolution of Pediculus humanus and the Origin of Clothing|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=24|page=2309|year=2004|last1=Kittler|first1=Ralf|last2=Kayser|first2=Manfred|last3=Stoneking|first3=Mark}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toups |first1=Melissa A. |display-authors=et al |title=Origin of Clothing Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use by Anatomically Modern Humans in Africa |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq234 |pmid=20823373 |pmc=3002236 |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=January 2011 |pages=29\u201332}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Reed\n|first=David\n|display-authors=et al.\n|title=Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: The evolutionary history of Anthropoid primate lice\n|journal=BMC Biology\n|year=2007\n|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-7\n|pmid=17343749\n|volume=5 |issue=7\n|pages=7\n|pmc=1828715\n}}</ref>\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Well-clothed baby.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|A [[Infant|baby]] wearing many items of [[winter]] clothing: [[headband]], [[cap]], fur-lined [[Coat (clothing)|coat]], [[scarf]] and [[sweater]].]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200\n| image1 = Black Boater Hat, Floral Print Dress, and Bronze Sandals (17250719875) (cropped).jpg\n| image2 = Polka Dot Sleeveless Top, Maroon H&M Skater Skirt, Cutout Ankle Boots, and a Black Lace Purse (22061303870).jpg\n| image3 = Strapless Polka Dot Peplum Romper, White Sandals, and a Tan Straw Hat (19335873624).jpg\n| image4 = Green Scalloped Shorts, Baby Blue Top, and White Sandals (17396821965) (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Four types of women's clothing which end above the knees: (clockwise from top) [[minidress]], [[miniskirt]], [[shorts]] and [[romper]], all worn by the same model.\n}}\nThe most obvious function of clothing is to protect the wearer from the elements. In hot weather, clothing provides protection from [[sunburn]] or [[wind]] damage. In the cold it offers [[thermal insulation]]. Shelter can reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm place. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones.\n\nClothing performs a range of social and [[culture|cultural]] functions, such as individual, occupational and gender differentiation, and social status.<ref name=\"Flugel1930\">{{citation |date=1976|origyear= 1930 |author=Flugel, John Carl |title=The Psychology of Clothes |series=International Psycho-analytical Library |volume=No.18 |publisher=New York: AMS Press. First published by Hogarth Press, London | isbn = 0-404-14721-6 }} Alternative {{ISBN|978-0-404-14721-1}} (This work is one of the earliest attempts at an overview of the psycho-social and practical functions of clothing)</ref> In many societies, norms about clothing reflect standards of [[modesty]], [[religion]], [[gender]], and [[social status]]. Clothing may also function as adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.\n\nClothing has been made from a very wide variety of materials, ranging from leather and [[fur]]s to woven fabrics to elaborate and exotic natural and [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic fabrics]]. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as [[Handbag|purses]]), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ([[scarves]]), worn purely for adornment ([[jewelry]]), or those that serve a function other than protection ([[eyeglasses]]), are normally considered [[fashion accessory|accessories]] rather than clothing.\n\nClothing protects against many things that might injure or irritate the uncovered human body, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. Garments that are too sheer, thin, small or tight offer less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as [[insect]]s, noxious chemicals, weather, [[weapons]], and contact with abrasive substances.\n\nHumans have devised clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as [[space suits]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suits]], [[swimsuits]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper gear]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and other pieces of [[protective clothing]]. The distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut, since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider [[fashion]] in their design. The choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure reasonable clothing due to poverty or affordability, or simply lack of inclination, is sometimes said to be scruffy, ragged, or shabby.<ref>Baradel, Lacey. \"Geographic Mobility and Domesticity in Eastman Johnson\u2019s The Tramp.\" American Art 28.2 (2014): 26\u201349</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\nSerious books on clothing and its functions appear from the 19th century as imperialists dealt with new environments such as India and the tropics.<ref name=\"Jeffreys1858\">e.g. {{citation |year=1858 |author=Jeffreys, Julius |title=The British Army in India: Its Preservation by an appropriate Clothing, Housing, Locating, Recreative Employment, and Hopeful Encouragement of the Troops |place=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans & Roberts |url=https://archive.org/stream/britisharmyinin01jeffgoog#page/n7/mode/1up |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> Some scientific research into the multiple functions of clothing  in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as [[J.C.

The man is in [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] and the woman is wearing a [[gown]].\n</gallery>\n\nIn most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, fabrics, and types.\n\nIn Western societies, [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], and [[high-heeled shoe]]s are usually seen as women's clothing, while [[necktie]]s are usually seen as men's clothing. [[Trousers]] were once seen as exclusively men's clothing, but can nowadays be worn by both genders. Men's clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for women. Men are typically allowed to [[bare chested|bare their chests]] in a greater variety of public places. It is generally common for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual.\n\nIn some cultures, [[sumptuary law]]s regulate what men and women are required to wear. [[Islam]] requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually [[hijab]]. What qualifies as \"modest\" varies in different Muslim societies; however, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the [[headscarf|head-scarf]] to the [[burqa]].\n\nMen may sometimes choose to wear [[men's skirts]] such as [[togas]] or [[kilt]]s in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.\n\nClothing designed to be worn by either sex is called [[unisex clothing]]. Unisex clothes, such as T-shirts, tend to be cut straighter to fit a wider variety of bodies. The majority of unisex clothing styles have started out as menswear, but some articles, like the [[fedora]], were originally worn by women.\n\n===Social status===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nRajput Sherwani 2014-04-23 04-27.JPG|''[[Achkan]]'' [[sherwani]] and ''[[churidar]]'' (lower body) worn by [[Arvind Singh Mewar]] and his kin during a [[Hindu wedding]] in [[Rajasthan, India]].

In [[ancient Rome]], for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]. In traditional [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and palaoa, or carved [[whale]] teeth. In China, before establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear [[yellow]]. History provides many examples of elaborate [[sumptuary law]]s that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, [[peer pressure]] influences clothing choice.\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Category:Religious clothing}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes.

Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn every day as a marker for special religious status.\n\nFor example, [[Jain]]s and Muslim men wear unstitched [[cloth]] pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.\n\nThe cleanliness of religious dresses in some religions such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Jainism]] is of paramount importance since it indicates purity.\n\nClothing appears in numerous contexts in the [[Bible]]; the most prominent passages are: the story of [[Adam and Eve]] who made coverings for themselves out of [[fig leaf|fig leaves]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s [[Coat of many colors|cloak]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]]. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.\n\nThe Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: \"...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them\" (chapter 2:187).\n\nJewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. {{Explain|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Clergy#Christianity|Christian clergy]] members wear religious [[vestments]] during [[liturgy|liturgical]] services and may wear specific [[clerical clothing|non-liturgical clothing]] at other times.\n\n==Origin and history==\n{{Main|History of clothing}}\n{{See also|History of Western fashion|Category:History of clothing}}\n\n===Early use===\nAccording to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of [[fur]], [[leather]], leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early [[sewing needle]]s of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near [[Kostenki]], [[Russia]] in 1988.<ref>Hoffecker, J., Scott, J., ''Excavations In Eastern Europe Reveal Ancient Human Lifestyles'', University of Colorado at Boulder News Archive, March 21, 2002, [http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html colorado.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175257/http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html |date=2011-07-19 }}</ref> Dyed [[flax]] fibers that could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] that date back to 34,000 BC.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Balter M | year = 2009 | title = Clothes Make the (Hu) Man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1329 | doi = 10.1126/science.325_1329a | pmid = 19745126 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kvavadze E, Bar-Yosef O, Belfer-Cohen A, Boaretto E, Jakeli N, Matskevich Z, Meshveliani T| year = 2009 | title = 30,000-Year-Old Wild Flax Fibers | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4270521| journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1359 | doi = 10.1126/science.1175404 | pmid = 19745144 }} [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/325/5946/1359/DC1/1 Supporting Online Material]</ref>\n\nScientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]], have conducted a genetic analysis of human [[body lice]] that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' away from the warm [[climate]] of [[Africa]], thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reed |display-authors=et al | year = 2004 | title =  Genetic Analysis of Lice Supports Direct Contact between Modern and Archaic Humans| journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e340 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020340 | pmid=15502871 | pmc=521174}}</ref> For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.\n\n===Making clothing===\n{{See also|Garment industry||knitting|weaving}}\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Lady Going for Pooja.jpg|alt=Sari|thumb|[[Hindu]] Indian lady wearing [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]. One of the most ancient and popular pieces of clothing in the [[Indian subcontinent]].]]\nSome human cultures, such as the various peoples of the [[Arctic Circle]], traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[silk]], hemp, and [[ramie]].\n\nAlthough modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The [[textile]] industry was the first to be mechanized&nbsp;\u2013 with the [[power loom|powered loom]]&nbsp;\u2013 during the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nDifferent cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the [[dhoti]] for men and the [[sari]] for women in the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Scottish [[kilt]] and the [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[sarong]]. The clothes may simply be tied up (dhoti and sari); or pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various [[Clothing sizes|sizes]] can wear the garment.\n\nAnother approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a [[sewing machine]]. Clothing can be cut from a [[sewing pattern]] and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or [[dress form]] is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as [[gusset]]s. Traditional European patterns for men's [[shirt]]s and women's [[chemise]]s take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts.\n\nModern European [[fashion]] treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into [[quilt]]s.\n\nIn the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, [[photo]]s, [[painting]]s, [[mosaic]]s, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current [[fashion designer]]s, as well as costumiers for [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[film]]s, [[television]], and [[historical reenactment]].\n\n==Contemporary clothing==\n{{POV section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Western dress codes}}\n\n=== Western dress code ===\n{{main|Western dress code}}\nThe Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years.  The mechanization of the [[textile industry]] made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices.  Styles have changed, and the availability of [[synthetic fabric]]s has changed the definition of \"stylish\".  In the latter half of the 20th century, [[jeans|blue jeans]] became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire.  [[Activewear]] has also become a large and growing market.\n\nJeans in the Western dress code are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found which include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.\n\nThe licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the [[fashion industry]] from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Gucci]], named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.\n\n=== Spread of western styles ===\n[[File:Move In Day 2011 (6099706937) (cropped).jpg|thumb|University students in [[casual clothes]] in the US.]]\n\nBy the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European [[colonialism]]. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. [[Fast fashion]] clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated [[used good|used]] clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.\n\n=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===\nPeople may wear ethnic or [[national costume|national dress]] on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional [[hanbok]]s on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used [[T-shirt]] with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or [[tupenu]].\n\n===Sport and activity===\n{{Main|Activewear|Sportswear (fashion)}}\n\nMost sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] garments include [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, and [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[salopettes]] (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Also, [[spandex]] materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, [[track & field]], dance, gymnastics and swimming.\n[[File:E1275480 (4315537281).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Fashion show]]s are often the source of the latest trends in clothing [[fashion]]s.

Women wore dresses all day, everyday. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired.  Jewelry was less conspicuous.<ref>Simon Bliss, \"'L\u2019intelligence de la parure': Notes on Jewelry Wearing in the 1920s.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 20.1 (2016): 5\u201326.</ref>  Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.<ref>Steven Zdatny,  \"The Boyish Look and the Liberated Woman: The Politics and Aesthetics of Women's Hairstyles.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 1.4 (1997): 367\u2013397.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century a diverse range of styles exist in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive [[haute couture]] to traditional garb, to [[thrift store]] [[grunge]].  [[Fashion show]]s are events for designers to show off new and often extravagant designs.\n\n==Political issues==\n\n===Working conditions in the garments industry===\n{{further|Garment industry}}\n[[File:Garments Factory in Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|Garments factory in [[Bangladesh]].]]\n[[File:Safety garb for women workers.

[[Mass-produced]] clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be [[sweatshops]], typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in [[developing countries]], clothes made in [[industrialized nation]]s may also be manufactured similarly.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nCoalitions of [[NGO]]s, designers (including Katharine Hamnett, [[American Apparel]], [[Veja Sneakers|Veja]], [[Quiksilver]], eVocal, and Edun) and campaign groups like the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] (CCC) and the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] as well as [[textile and clothing trade unions]] have sought to improve these conditions as much as possible by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the workers.\n\n[[Outsourcing]] production to low wage countries like [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]] became possible when the [[Multi Fibre Agreement]] (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a [[protectionist]] measure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Although many countries recognize treaties like the [[International Labour Organization]], which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them. India for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nDespite the strong reactions that \"sweatshops\" evoked among [[Anti-globalization movement|critics of globalization]]{{which|date=March 2020}}, the [[textile industry|production of textiles]] has functioned as a consistent industry for developing nations, providing work and wages, whether construed as exploitative or not, to millions of people.<ref>European Parliamentary Research Service. \u201cWorkers' Conditions in the Textile and Clothing Sector: Just an Asian Affair?\u201d ''European Parliment'', Aug. 2014.

It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]], along with other [[animal rights]] and [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] groups have called attention to [[fur farming]] and other practices they consider cruel.\n\n==Life cycle==\n\n===Clothing maintenance===\nClothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, becomes outworn, and loses functionality (as when [[button (clothing)|buttons]] fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and [[zipper]]s fail).\n\nOften, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials like these inevitably age.\n\nHowever, most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be [[laundry|laundered]] and mended (patching, [[darning]], but compare [[felt]]).\n\n=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===\nHumans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic [[washing machine]]s and [[dry cleaning]] (dissolving dirt in [[solvents]] other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] fabrics for [[hygiene]] purposes.\n\nMany kinds of clothing are designed to be [[Ironing|ironed]] before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, [[dress shirt]]s and [[suit (clothing)|suits]]). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is [[permanent press]], having been treated with a coating (such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.\n\nOnce clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on [[clothes hanger]]s or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.\n\nCertain types of insects and larvae feed on clothing and textiles, such as the [[Black carpet beetle]] and [[Clothing Moth|Clothing moths]]. To deter such pests, clothes may be stored in cedar-lined closets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cedar-closets/|title=Cedar Closets 101|date=2017-09-08|website=Bob Vila|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> or chests, or placed in drawers or containers with materials having pest repellent properties, such as [[Lavandula#Other uses|Lavender]] or [[mothball]]s. Airtight containers (such as sealed, heavy-duty plastic bags) may also deter insect pest damage to clothing materials.\n\n===Non-iron===\n{{main|Permanent press}}\nA resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.</ref> In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.<ref>[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php Changes of Free Formaldehyde Quantity in Non-iron Shirts by Washing and Storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124023/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php |date=2011-07-22 }}. ''Journal of Health Science''.</ref>\n\n===Mending===\n{{see also|Darning}}\nWhen the raw material&nbsp;\u2013 cloth&nbsp;\u2013 was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous [[tailor]] or [[seamstress]] could mend rips with thread raveled from [[hem]]s and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace [[zipper]]s and [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] and sew up ripped hems.\n\n===Recycling===\nUsed, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for [[quilt]]s, [[:wikt:rag|rags]], [[Carpet|rugs]], [[bandage]]s, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into [[paper]]. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a [[clothing bin]]). It is also sold to [[consignment shop]]s, dress agencies, [[flea market]]s, and in [[online auction]]s. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.  Globally, used clothes are worth $4 billion<ref>{{cite news|last1=Minter|first1=Adam|title=No One Wants Your Used Clothes Anymore|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-15/no-one-wants-your-used-clothes-anymore|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=[[Bloomberg News#Bloomberg View|Bloomberg View]]|date=15 January 2018}}</ref> with the US as the leading exporter at $575 million.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Banigan|first1=Melissa|title=East Africa Doesn't Want Your Hand-Me-Downs|url=https://www.racked.com/2018/1/25/16923226/east-africa-used-clothing-ban|accessdate=26 January 2018|work=Racked|publisher=[[Vox Media#Racked|Vox Media]]|date=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are many concerns about the life cycle of synthetics, which come primarily from petrochemicals.{{Weasel inline|date=September 2009}} Unlike natural fibers, their source is not renewable and they are not biodegradable.<ref>[http://sweatshirtstation.com/articles/the-textile-materials-eco-battle-between-natural-and-synthetic-fabrics/ The Textile Materials Eco Battle Between Natural and Synthetic Fabrics] \"Steven E.

Clothing is typically made of fabrics or [[textile]]s but over time has included garments made from [[animal skin]] or other thin sheets of materials put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to [[human being]]s and is a feature of all human [[societies]]. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social, and geographic considerations.\n\nClothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the [[weather|elements]], rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, [[Insect bites and stings|insect bites]], [[splinter]]s, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns and prickles]] by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a [[hygienic]] barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]].\n\nWearing clothes is also a [[Dress code|social norm]], and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]]. In most parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that [[Sex organ#Mammals|genitals]], [[breast]]s or [[buttocks]] are visible could be considered [[indecent exposure]].\n\n== Origin of clothing ==\n{{see also|Evolution of hair|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThere is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed. Estimates by various experts have ranged from 40,000 to 3 million years ago. Some more recent studies involving the evolution of body lice have implied a more recent development with some indicating a development of around 170,000 years ago and others indicating as little as 40,000. No single estimate is widely accepted.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser & Mark Stoneking |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=13 |pages=1414\u20131417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325 |issue=16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120019/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"Stoneking\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024|title=Molecular Evolution of Pediculus humanus and the Origin of Clothing|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=24|page=2309|year=2004|last1=Kittler|first1=Ralf|last2=Kayser|first2=Manfred|last3=Stoneking|first3=Mark}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toups |first1=Melissa A. |display-authors=et al |title=Origin of Clothing Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use by Anatomically Modern Humans in Africa |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq234 |pmid=20823373 |pmc=3002236 |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=January 2011 |pages=29\u201332}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Reed\n|first=David\n|display-authors=et al.\n|title=Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: The evolutionary history of Anthropoid primate lice\n|journal=BMC Biology\n|year=2007\n|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-7\n|pmid=17343749\n|volume=5 |issue=7\n|pages=7\n|pmc=1828715\n}}</ref>\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Well-clothed baby.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|A [[Infant|baby]] wearing many items of [[winter]] clothing: [[headband]], [[cap]], fur-lined [[Coat (clothing)|coat]], [[scarf]] and [[sweater]].]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200\n| image1 = Black Boater Hat, Floral Print Dress, and Bronze Sandals (17250719875) (cropped).jpg\n| image2 = Polka Dot Sleeveless Top, Maroon H&M Skater Skirt, Cutout Ankle Boots, and a Black Lace Purse (22061303870).jpg\n| image3 = Strapless Polka Dot Peplum Romper, White Sandals, and a Tan Straw Hat (19335873624).jpg\n| image4 = Green Scalloped Shorts, Baby Blue Top, and White Sandals (17396821965) (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Four types of women's clothing which end above the knees: (clockwise from top) [[minidress]], [[miniskirt]], [[shorts]] and [[romper]], all worn by the same model.\n}}\nThe most obvious function of clothing is to protect the wearer from the elements. In hot weather, clothing provides protection from [[sunburn]] or [[wind]] damage. In the cold it offers [[thermal insulation]]. Shelter can reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm place. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones.\n\nClothing performs a range of social and [[culture|cultural]] functions, such as individual, occupational and gender differentiation, and social status.<ref name=\"Flugel1930\">{{citation |date=1976|origyear= 1930 |author=Flugel, John Carl |title=The Psychology of Clothes |series=International Psycho-analytical Library |volume=No.18 |publisher=New York: AMS Press. First published by Hogarth Press, London | isbn = 0-404-14721-6 }} Alternative {{ISBN|978-0-404-14721-1}} (This work is one of the earliest attempts at an overview of the psycho-social and practical functions of clothing)</ref> In many societies, norms about clothing reflect standards of [[modesty]], [[religion]], [[gender]], and [[social status]]. Clothing may also function as adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.\n\nClothing has been made from a very wide variety of materials, ranging from leather and [[fur]]s to woven fabrics to elaborate and exotic natural and [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic fabrics]]. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as [[Handbag|purses]]), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ([[scarves]]), worn purely for adornment ([[jewelry]]), or those that serve a function other than protection ([[eyeglasses]]), are normally considered [[fashion accessory|accessories]] rather than clothing.\n\nClothing protects against many things that might injure or irritate the uncovered human body, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. Garments that are too sheer, thin, small or tight offer less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as [[insect]]s, noxious chemicals, weather, [[weapons]], and contact with abrasive substances.\n\nHumans have devised clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as [[space suits]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suits]], [[swimsuits]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper gear]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and other pieces of [[protective clothing]]. The distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut, since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider [[fashion]] in their design. The choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure reasonable clothing due to poverty or affordability, or simply lack of inclination, is sometimes said to be scruffy, ragged, or shabby.<ref>Baradel, Lacey. \"Geographic Mobility and Domesticity in Eastman Johnson\u2019s The Tramp.\" American Art 28.2 (2014): 26\u201349</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\nSerious books on clothing and its functions appear from the 19th century as imperialists dealt with new environments such as India and the tropics.<ref name=\"Jeffreys1858\">e.g. {{citation |year=1858 |author=Jeffreys, Julius |title=The British Army in India: Its Preservation by an appropriate Clothing, Housing, Locating, Recreative Employment, and Hopeful Encouragement of the Troops |place=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans & Roberts |url=https://archive.org/stream/britisharmyinin01jeffgoog#page/n7/mode/1up |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> Some scientific research into the multiple functions of clothing  in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as [[J.C.

The man is in [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] and the woman is wearing a [[gown]].\n</gallery>\n\nIn most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, fabrics, and types.\n\nIn Western societies, [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], and [[high-heeled shoe]]s are usually seen as women's clothing, while [[necktie]]s are usually seen as men's clothing. [[Trousers]] were once seen as exclusively men's clothing, but can nowadays be worn by both genders. Men's clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for women. Men are typically allowed to [[bare chested|bare their chests]] in a greater variety of public places. It is generally common for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual.\n\nIn some cultures, [[sumptuary law]]s regulate what men and women are required to wear. [[Islam]] requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually [[hijab]]. What qualifies as \"modest\" varies in different Muslim societies; however, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the [[headscarf|head-scarf]] to the [[burqa]].\n\nMen may sometimes choose to wear [[men's skirts]] such as [[togas]] or [[kilt]]s in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.\n\nClothing designed to be worn by either sex is called [[unisex clothing]]. Unisex clothes, such as T-shirts, tend to be cut straighter to fit a wider variety of bodies. The majority of unisex clothing styles have started out as menswear, but some articles, like the [[fedora]], were originally worn by women.\n\n===Social status===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nRajput Sherwani 2014-04-23 04-27.JPG|''[[Achkan]]'' [[sherwani]] and ''[[churidar]]'' (lower body) worn by [[Arvind Singh Mewar]] and his kin during a [[Hindu wedding]] in [[Rajasthan, India]].

In [[ancient Rome]], for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]. In traditional [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and palaoa, or carved [[whale]] teeth. In China, before establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear [[yellow]]. History provides many examples of elaborate [[sumptuary law]]s that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, [[peer pressure]] influences clothing choice.\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Category:Religious clothing}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes.

Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn every day as a marker for special religious status.\n\nFor example, [[Jain]]s and Muslim men wear unstitched [[cloth]] pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.\n\nThe cleanliness of religious dresses in some religions such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Jainism]] is of paramount importance since it indicates purity.\n\nClothing appears in numerous contexts in the [[Bible]]; the most prominent passages are: the story of [[Adam and Eve]] who made coverings for themselves out of [[fig leaf|fig leaves]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s [[Coat of many colors|cloak]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]]. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.\n\nThe Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: \"...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them\" (chapter 2:187).\n\nJewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. {{Explain|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Clergy#Christianity|Christian clergy]] members wear religious [[vestments]] during [[liturgy|liturgical]] services and may wear specific [[clerical clothing|non-liturgical clothing]] at other times.\n\n==Origin and history==\n{{Main|History of clothing}}\n{{See also|History of Western fashion|Category:History of clothing}}\n\n===Early use===\nAccording to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of [[fur]], [[leather]], leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early [[sewing needle]]s of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near [[Kostenki]], [[Russia]] in 1988.<ref>Hoffecker, J., Scott, J., ''Excavations In Eastern Europe Reveal Ancient Human Lifestyles'', University of Colorado at Boulder News Archive, March 21, 2002, [http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html colorado.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175257/http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html |date=2011-07-19 }}</ref> Dyed [[flax]] fibers that could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] that date back to 34,000 BC.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Balter M | year = 2009 | title = Clothes Make the (Hu) Man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1329 | doi = 10.1126/science.325_1329a | pmid = 19745126 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kvavadze E, Bar-Yosef O, Belfer-Cohen A, Boaretto E, Jakeli N, Matskevich Z, Meshveliani T| year = 2009 | title = 30,000-Year-Old Wild Flax Fibers | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4270521| journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1359 | doi = 10.1126/science.1175404 | pmid = 19745144 }} [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/325/5946/1359/DC1/1 Supporting Online Material]</ref>\n\nScientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]], have conducted a genetic analysis of human [[body lice]] that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' away from the warm [[climate]] of [[Africa]], thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reed |display-authors=et al | year = 2004 | title =  Genetic Analysis of Lice Supports Direct Contact between Modern and Archaic Humans| journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e340 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020340 | pmid=15502871 | pmc=521174}}</ref> For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.\n\n===Making clothing===\n{{See also|Garment industry||knitting|weaving}}\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Lady Going for Pooja.jpg|alt=Sari|thumb|[[Hindu]] Indian lady wearing [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]. One of the most ancient and popular pieces of clothing in the [[Indian subcontinent]].]]\nSome human cultures, such as the various peoples of the [[Arctic Circle]], traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[silk]], hemp, and [[ramie]].\n\nAlthough modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The [[textile]] industry was the first to be mechanized&nbsp;\u2013 with the [[power loom|powered loom]]&nbsp;\u2013 during the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nDifferent cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the [[dhoti]] for men and the [[sari]] for women in the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Scottish [[kilt]] and the [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[sarong]]. The clothes may simply be tied up (dhoti and sari); or pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various [[Clothing sizes|sizes]] can wear the garment.\n\nAnother approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a [[sewing machine]]. Clothing can be cut from a [[sewing pattern]] and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or [[dress form]] is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as [[gusset]]s. Traditional European patterns for men's [[shirt]]s and women's [[chemise]]s take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts.\n\nModern European [[fashion]] treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into [[quilt]]s.\n\nIn the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, [[photo]]s, [[painting]]s, [[mosaic]]s, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current [[fashion designer]]s, as well as costumiers for [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[film]]s, [[television]], and [[historical reenactment]].\n\n==Contemporary clothing==\n{{POV section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Western dress codes}}\n\n=== Western dress code ===\n{{main|Western dress code}}\nThe Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years.  The mechanization of the [[textile industry]] made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices.  Styles have changed, and the availability of [[synthetic fabric]]s has changed the definition of \"stylish\".  In the latter half of the 20th century, [[jeans|blue jeans]] became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire.  [[Activewear]] has also become a large and growing market.\n\nJeans in the Western dress code are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found which include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.\n\nThe licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the [[fashion industry]] from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Gucci]], named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.\n\n=== Spread of western styles ===\n[[File:Move In Day 2011 (6099706937) (cropped).jpg|thumb|University students in [[casual clothes]] in the US.]]\n\nBy the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European [[colonialism]]. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. [[Fast fashion]] clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated [[used good|used]] clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.\n\n=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===\nPeople may wear ethnic or [[national costume|national dress]] on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional [[hanbok]]s on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used [[T-shirt]] with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or [[tupenu]].\n\n===Sport and activity===\n{{Main|Activewear|Sportswear (fashion)}}\n\nMost sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] garments include [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, and [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[salopettes]] (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Also, [[spandex]] materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, [[track & field]], dance, gymnastics and swimming.\n[[File:E1275480 (4315537281).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Fashion show]]s are often the source of the latest trends in clothing [[fashion]]s.

Women wore dresses all day, everyday. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired.  Jewelry was less conspicuous.<ref>Simon Bliss, \"'L\u2019intelligence de la parure': Notes on Jewelry Wearing in the 1920s.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 20.1 (2016): 5\u201326.</ref>  Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.<ref>Steven Zdatny,  \"The Boyish Look and the Liberated Woman: The Politics and Aesthetics of Women's Hairstyles.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 1.4 (1997): 367\u2013397.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century a diverse range of styles exist in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive [[haute couture]] to traditional garb, to [[thrift store]] [[grunge]].  [[Fashion show]]s are events for designers to show off new and often extravagant designs.\n\n==Political issues==\n\n===Working conditions in the garments industry===\n{{further|Garment industry}}\n[[File:Garments Factory in Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|Garments factory in [[Bangladesh]].]]\n[[File:Safety garb for women workers. The uniform at the left, complete with the plastic \"bra\" on the right, will prevent... - NARA - 522882.jpg|thumb|upright|Safety garb for women workers in [[Los Angeles]], c. 1943, was designed to prevent occupational accidents among female war workers.]]\n\nAlthough [[mechanization]] transformed most aspects of human industry by the mid-20th century, [[garment]] workers have continued to labor under challenging conditions that demand repetitive manual labor. [[Mass-produced]] clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be [[sweatshops]], typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in [[developing countries]], clothes made in [[industrialized nation]]s may also be manufactured similarly.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nCoalitions of [[NGO]]s, designers (including Katharine Hamnett, [[American Apparel]], [[Veja Sneakers|Veja]], [[Quiksilver]], eVocal, and Edun) and campaign groups like the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] (CCC) and the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] as well as [[textile and clothing trade unions]] have sought to improve these conditions as much as possible by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the workers.\n\n[[Outsourcing]] production to low wage countries like [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]] became possible when the [[Multi Fibre Agreement]] (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a [[protectionist]] measure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Although many countries recognize treaties like the [[International Labour Organization]], which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them. India for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nDespite the strong reactions that \"sweatshops\" evoked among [[Anti-globalization movement|critics of globalization]]{{which|date=March 2020}}, the [[textile industry|production of textiles]] has functioned as a consistent industry for developing nations providing work and wages, whether construed as exploitative or not, to many thousands of people.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Fur===\n{{Main|Fur clothing}}\nThe use of animal fur in clothing dates to prehistoric times. It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]], along with other [[animal rights]] and [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] groups have called attention to [[fur farming]] and other practices they consider cruel.\n\n==Life cycle==\n\n===Clothing maintenance===\nClothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, becomes outworn, and loses functionality (as when [[button (clothing)|buttons]] fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and [[zipper]]s fail).\n\nOften, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials like these inevitably age.\n\nHowever, most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be [[laundry|laundered]] and mended (patching, [[darning]], but compare [[felt]]).\n\n=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===\nHumans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic [[washing machine]]s and [[dry cleaning]] (dissolving dirt in [[solvents]] other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] fabrics for [[hygiene]] purposes.\n\nMany kinds of clothing are designed to be [[Ironing|ironed]] before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, [[dress shirt]]s and [[suit (clothing)|suits]]). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is [[permanent press]], having been treated with a coating (such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.\n\nOnce clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on [[clothes hanger]]s or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.\n\nCertain types of insects and larvae feed on clothing and textiles, such as the [[Black carpet beetle]] and [[Clothing Moth|Clothing moths]]. To deter such pests, clothes may be stored in cedar-lined closets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cedar-closets/|title=Cedar Closets 101|date=2017-09-08|website=Bob Vila|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> or chests, or placed in drawers or containers with materials having pest repellent properties, such as [[Lavandula#Other uses|Lavender]] or [[mothball]]s. Airtight containers (such as sealed, heavy-duty plastic bags) may also deter insect pest damage to clothing materials.\n\n===Non-iron===\n{{main|Permanent press}}\nA resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.</ref> In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.<ref>[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php Changes of Free Formaldehyde Quantity in Non-iron Shirts by Washing and Storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124023/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php |date=2011-07-22 }}. ''Journal of Health Science''.</ref>\n\n===Mending===\n{{see also|Darning}}\nWhen the raw material&nbsp;\u2013 cloth&nbsp;\u2013 was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous [[tailor]] or [[seamstress]] could mend rips with thread raveled from [[hem]]s and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace [[zipper]]s and [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] and sew up ripped hems.\n\n===Recycling===\nUsed, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for [[quilt]]s, [[:wikt:rag|rags]], [[Carpet|rugs]], [[bandage]]s, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into [[paper]]. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a [[clothing bin]]). It is also sold to [[consignment shop]]s, dress agencies, [[flea market]]s, and in [[online auction]]s. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.  Globally, used clothes are worth $4 billion<ref>{{cite news|last1=Minter|first1=Adam|title=No One Wants Your Used Clothes Anymore|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-15/no-one-wants-your-used-clothes-anymore|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=[[Bloomberg News#Bloomberg View|Bloomberg View]]|date=15 January 2018}}</ref> with the US as the leading exporter at $575 million.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Banigan|first1=Melissa|title=East Africa Doesn't Want Your Hand-Me-Downs|url=https://www.racked.com/2018/1/25/16923226/east-africa-used-clothing-ban|accessdate=26 January 2018|work=Racked|publisher=[[Vox Media#Racked|Vox Media]]|date=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are many concerns about the life cycle of synthetics, which come primarily from petrochemicals.{{Weasel inline|date=September 2009}} Unlike natural fibers, their source is not renewable and they are not biodegradable.<ref>[http://sweatshirtstation.com/articles/the-textile-materials-eco-battle-between-natural-and-synthetic-fabrics/ The Textile Materials Eco Battle Between Natural and Synthetic Fabrics] \"Steven E.

Though the details of some of the schemes' legal arguments vary, one goes so far as to state that although the [[Outer Space Treaty]], which entered force in 1967, forbids countries from claiming celestial bodies, there is no such provision forbidding private individuals from doing so. However, Article VI of this treaty states \"The activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty.\" Thus, while it does not explicitly prohibit such schemes, the treaty does require they be authorized by the schemers' government.\n\nThe [[short story]] ''[[The Man Who Sold the Moon]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], which was written in 1949, offers a portrayal regarding such plans or schemes, and created the concept of a Lunar Republic.

However, Article VI of this treaty states \"The activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty.\" Thus, while it does not explicitly prohibit such schemes, the treaty does require they be authorized by the schemers' government.\n\nThe [[short story]] ''[[The Man Who Sold the Moon]]'' by [[Robert A.
