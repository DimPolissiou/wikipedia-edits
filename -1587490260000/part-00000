Eventually cornering him in an alley, Bosch shoots the suspect when he reaches in his pocket. The incident is shown later in the episode in two separate flashbacks. When seen from Bosch's point of view, it appears that there is something in the suspect's hand that falls in a puddle. When the incident is recounted by the plaintiff's lawyer during a wrongful death suit, there is clearly nothing in the suspect's hand and Bosch is shown planting a gun. Whatever really happened, Bosch is cleared by the department. The show fast-forwards to two years later when Bosch is being sued by the suspect's family in a wrongful death civil suit.\n\nRestless because he has been on restricted duty during the trial and anxious to do more active detective work, Bosch convinces two other detectives to trade shifts with him so he can work their weekend shift, much to the chagrin of his partner. On Saturday, Bosch is called out on a case which turns out to be a suicide, and a second case wherein a doctor reports his dog found a human bone in the woods.\n\nThe latter investigation turns up more bones and the coroner determines the skeleton is that of a small boy who was horribly abused and beaten, then buried in the woods. The boy has been dead since at least 1989 and could have been anywhere from 10 to 12 when he died, but because severe abuse stunts children's growth, the victim's exact age is uncertain. The details of the boy's mistreatment - more than 40 broken bones, some healed and others relatively recent - and death are so grisly that Bosch has to step away from the coroner's recitation to into the restroom to splash water on his face and sit down on a commode for a moment to regain his composure.\n\nThe second episode introduces Raynard Waits, a serial killer who confesses to the murder in the bones case and has a strange fascination with Bosch. After Waits escapes custody he begins to taunt Bosch as Bosch aims to both catch Waits and prove he had nothing to do with the murder of the boy.\n\n===Season 2===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on ''[[The Last Coyote]]'' (Book 4) and ''[[Trunk Music (novel)|Trunk Music]]'' (Book 5)\n|-\n|}\nPicking up six months after the events in Season 1, Bosch returns from a suspension. He investigates the murder of a Hollywood producer who appears to have mob connections. His investigation of the producer sends him to Las Vegas, where he also finds out that all is not well with his teenage daughter and ex-wife. Bosch's investigation almost threatens the life of his family as he is also brought into another case that leads to a ring of dirty cops. New evidence appears on the death of his mother, which causes him to investigate the circumstances leading to her murder.\n\n===Season 3===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on [[The Black Echo|The Black Echo (Book 1)]] and [[A Darkness More Than Night|A Darkness More Than Night (Book 7)]]. Death of Ed Gunn based on [[The Drop (Connelly novel)|The Drop (Book 15)]]\n|-\n|}\nBosch is haunted with new leads to pursue on his mother's murder case. The season opens with a graffiti-tagging street urchin being in the vicinity where a homeless veteran, Billy Meadows, is murdered. Bosch also finds himself a suspect in the murder of Ed Gunn (a person who fits the MO of his mother's killer), doggedly pursued by veteran Detective Jimmy Robertson. Concurrently, Bosch is monitoring an ongoing criminal trial involving a powerful Hollywood movie mogul who is under [[house arrest]]. Under the director's employ is a former 20+ year police detective who proves to be a meddlesome and worthy adversary against Bosch and LAPD. Also, Bosch's personal life takes on new challenges with his daughter, Maddie, living in LA with him, along with a budding romantic relationship with the Deputy DA. Adding to the complexity is the introduction of a serial murderer, known as the Koreatown Killer (KTK).\n\n===Season 4===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on [[Angels Flight (novel)|Angels Flight (Book 6)]]\n|-\n|}\nCivil rights attorney Howard Elias is representing a black man who is accusing LAPD of police brutality, but Elias is murdered. Elias had a history of representing citizens who sue the LAPD, and the case produces racial strife in LA and elevated tension between the LAPD and citizens. Police Chief Irving assigns Bosch to head the task force to get to the bottom of the Elias murder and assigns pair of IA investigators to watch Bosch's team, which includes Edgar, Robertson, and Robertson's detective trainee. Bosch's ex-wife is pursuing a gang of Chinese nationals, one of whom is under an FBI investigation. The investigation leads to her being murdered in a drive-by shooting seconds after lunch with Harry. Bosch gains a vital clue into his mother's murder after the long-retired detective of his mother's case is killed.\n\n===Season 5===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on Two Kinds of Truth (Book 20)\n|-\n|}\nA murder conviction is brought into question from an old case Bosch worked, possibly affecting other past convictions and endangering his career. An embittered former girlfriend accuses Bosch of planting evidence and believes a claim of new DNA evidence purporting to tie another criminal to the crime. Bosch hires Honey Chandler to represent him for his battle against freeing the murderer. Concurrently, Bosch and Jerry try to expose an opioid ring implicated in the murder of a struggling pharmacist and his compromised son. Bosch's daughter Maddie is interning in the office of the district attorney and becomes anxious about the investigation into her father's old case and the coming anniversary of her mother's murder. Chief Irving, meanwhile, ponders running for mayor.\n\n===Season 6===\nThe sixth season of Bosch premiered on April 16, 2020.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1239952134491312128|title=With Detective Harry Bosch, there\u2019s never a dull moment.

Eventually cornering him in an alley, Bosch shoots the suspect when he reaches in his pocket. The incident is shown later in the episode in two separate flashbacks. When seen from Bosch's point of view, it appears that there is something in the suspect's hand that falls in a puddle. When the incident is recounted by the plaintiff's lawyer during a wrongful death suit, there is clearly nothing in the suspect's hand and Bosch is shown planting a gun. Whatever really happened, Bosch is cleared by the department. The show fast-forwards to two years later when Bosch is being sued by the suspect's family in a wrongful death civil suit.\n\nRestless because he has been on restricted duty during the trial and anxious to do more active detective work, Bosch convinces two other detectives to trade shifts with him so he can work their weekend shift, much to the chagrin of his partner. On Saturday, Bosch is called out on a case which turns out to be a suicide, and a second case wherein a doctor reports his dog found a human bone in the woods.\n\nThe latter investigation turns up more bones and the coroner determines the skeleton is that of a small boy who was horribly abused and beaten, then buried in the woods. The boy has been dead since at least 1989 and could have been anywhere from 10 to 12 when he died, but because severe abuse stunts children's growth, the victim's exact age is uncertain. The details of the boy's mistreatment - more than 40 broken bones, some healed and others relatively recent - and death are so grisly that Bosch has to step away from the coroner's recitation to into the restroom to splash water on his face and sit down on a commode for a moment to regain his composure.\n\nThe second episode introduces Raynard Waits, a serial killer who confesses to the murder in the bones case and has a strange fascination with Bosch. After Waits escapes custody he begins to taunt Bosch as Bosch aims to both catch Waits and prove he had nothing to do with the murder of the boy.\n\n===Season 2===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on ''[[The Last Coyote]]'' (Book 4) and ''[[Trunk Music (novel)|Trunk Music]]'' (Book 5)\n|-\n|}\nPicking up six months after the events in Season 1, Bosch returns from a suspension. He investigates the murder of a Hollywood producer who appears to have mob connections. His investigation of the producer sends him to Las Vegas, where he also finds out that all is not well with his teenage daughter and ex-wife. Bosch's investigation almost threatens the life of his family as he is also brought into another case that leads to a ring of dirty cops. New evidence appears on the death of his mother, which causes him to investigate the circumstances leading to her murder.\n\n===Season 3===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on [[The Black Echo|The Black Echo (Book 1)]] and [[A Darkness More Than Night|A Darkness More Than Night (Book 7)]]. Death of Ed Gunn based on [[The Drop (Connelly novel)|The Drop (Book 15)]]\n|-\n|}\nBosch is haunted with new leads to pursue on his mother's murder case. The season opens with a graffiti-tagging street urchin being in the vicinity where a homeless veteran, Billy Meadows, is murdered. Bosch also finds himself a suspect in the murder of Ed Gunn (a person who fits the MO of his mother's killer), doggedly pursued by veteran Detective Jimmy Robertson. Concurrently, Bosch is monitoring an ongoing criminal trial involving a powerful Hollywood movie mogul who is under [[house arrest]]. Under the director's employ is a former 20+ year police detective who proves to be a meddlesome and worthy adversary against Bosch and LAPD. Also, Bosch's personal life takes on new challenges with his daughter, Maddie, living in LA with him, along with a budding romantic relationship with the Deputy DA. Adding to the complexity is the introduction of a serial murderer, known as the Koreatown Killer (KTK).\n\n===Season 4===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on [[Angels Flight (novel)|Angels Flight (Book 6)]]\n|-\n|}\nCivil rights attorney Howard Elias is representing a black man who is accusing LAPD of police brutality, but Elias is murdered. Elias had a history of representing citizens who sue the LAPD, and the case produces racial strife in LA and elevated tension between the LAPD and citizens. Police Chief Irving assigns Bosch to head the task force to get to the bottom of the Elias murder and assigns pair of IA investigators to watch Bosch's team, which includes Edgar, Robertson, and Robertson's detective trainee. Bosch's ex-wife is pursuing a gang of Chinese nationals, one of whom is under an FBI investigation. The investigation leads to her being murdered in a drive-by shooting seconds after lunch with Harry. Bosch gains a vital clue into his mother's murder after the long-retired detective of his mother's case is killed.\n\n===Season 5===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on Two Kinds of Truth (Book 20)\n|-\n|}\nA murder conviction is brought into question from an old case Bosch worked, possibly affecting other past convictions and endangering his career. An embittered former girlfriend accuses Bosch of planting evidence and believes a claim of new DNA evidence purporting to tie another criminal to the crime. Bosch hires Honey Chandler to represent him for his battle against freeing the murderer. Concurrently, Bosch and Jerry try to expose an opioid ring implicated in the murder of a struggling pharmacist and his compromised son. Bosch's daughter Maddie is interning in the office of the district attorney and becomes anxious about the investigation into her father's old case and the coming anniversary of her mother's murder. Chief Irving, meanwhile, ponders running for mayor.\n\n===Season 6===\nThe sixth season of Bosch premiered on April 16, 2020.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1239952134491312128|title=With Detective Harry Bosch, there\u2019s never a dull moment.
