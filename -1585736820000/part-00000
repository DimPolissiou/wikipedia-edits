{"title_page": "Electrical ballast", "text_new": "{{other uses|Ballast (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Fulham Workhorse 4 ballast.jpg|thumb|350px|A modern ballast for powering four F32T8 office lamps.]]\n\nAn '''electrical ballast''' is a device placed in series with a load to limit the amount of [[Electric current|current]] in an  [[Electrical network|electrical circuit]]. \n\nA familiar and widely used example is the inductive ballast used in [[fluorescent lamp]]s to limit the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to a destructive level due to the [[negative resistance|negative differential resistance]] of the tube's voltage-current characteristic.\n\nBallasts vary greatly in complexity. They may be as simple as a [[resistor]], [[inductor]], or [[capacitor]] (or a combination of these) wired in series with the lamp; or as complex as the electronic ballasts used in [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s and [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s.\n\n== Current limiting ==\n[[Image:Tanning-chokeballast.jpg|thumbnail|upright|250px|A ''choke ballast'' (inductor) used in older lighting. This example is from a tanning bed. It requires a starter switch (below).]] \n[[Image:Tanning-starter.jpg|thumbnail|250px|A [[Fluorescent lamp#Starting|lamp starter]], required with some inductor type ballasts.  It connects the two ends of the lamp to preheat them for one second before lighting.]]\n\nAn electrical ballast is a device that limits the current through an [[electrical load]]. These are most often used when a load (such as an arc discharge) has its terminal voltage decline when current through the load increases.  If such a device were connected to a constant-voltage power supply, it would draw an increasing amount of current until it is destroyed or causes the power supply to fail. To prevent this, a ballast provides a positive [[electrical resistance|resistance]] or [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]] that limits the current. The ballast provides for the proper operation of the negative-resistance device by limiting current.\n\nBallasts can also be used simply to limit the current in an ordinary, positive-resistance circuit. Prior to the advent of solid-state ignition, automobile [[ignition system]]s commonly included a ballast resistor to regulate the voltage applied to the ignition system.\n\nSeries resistors are used as ballasts to control the current through LEDs.\n\n== Resistors ==\n\n=== Fixed resistors ===\nFor simple, low-powered loads such as a neon lamp or a [[LED lamp]], a fixed resistor is commonly used. Because the resistance of the ballast resistor is large it determines the current in the circuit, even in the face of [[negative resistance]] introduced by the neon lamp.\n\nBallast was also a component used in early model [[automobile]] [[Internal combustion engine|engines]]  that lowered the supply [[voltage]] to the [[ignition system]] after the engine had been started. Starting the engine requires a significant amount of electrical current from the [[battery (electricity)|battery]], resulting in an equally significant voltage drop. To allow the engine to start, the ignition system was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once the vehicle was started and the starter disengaged, the normal operating voltage was too high for the ignition system. To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the ignition system, resulting in two different operating voltages for the starting and ignition systems.\n\nOccasionally, this ballast resistor would fail and the classic symptom of this failure was that the engine ran while being cranked (while the resistor was bypassed) but stalled immediately when cranking ceased (and the resistor was reconnected in the circuit via the ignition switch). Modern electronic ignition systems (those used since the 1980s or late '70s) do not require a ballast resistor as they are flexible enough to operate on the lower cranking voltage or the normal operating voltage.\n\nAnother common use of a ballast resistor in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10&nbsp;A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.\n\nIn some consumer electronic equipment, notably in television sets in the era of valves (vacuum tubes), but also in some low-cost record players, the [[vacuum tube]] heaters were connected in series. Since the voltage drop across all the heaters in series was usually less than the full mains voltage, it was necessary to provide a ballast to drop the excess voltage. A resistor was often used for this purpose, as it was cheap and worked with both AC and DC.\n\n=== Self-variable resistors ===\nSome ballast resistors have the property of increasing in [[electrical resistance|resistance]] as current through them increases, and decreasing in resistance as current decreases. Physically, some such devices are often built quite like [[incandescent lamp]]s. Like the [[tungsten]] filament of an ordinary incandescent lamp, if [[electric current|current]] increases, the ballast resistor gets hotter, its resistance goes up, and its voltage drop increases. If [[electric current|current]] decreases, the ballast resistor gets colder, its resistance drops, and the [[voltage drop]] decreases. Therefore, the ballast resistor reduces variations in current, despite variations in applied voltage or changes in the rest of an electric circuit. These devices are sometimes called \"[[Iron-hydrogen resistor|barretters]]\" and were used in the series heating circuits of 1930s to 1960s [[AC/DC receiver design#Series tube heaters|AC/DC]] [[All American Five|radio]] and TV home receivers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThis property can lead to more precise current control than merely choosing an appropriate fixed resistor. The power lost in the resistive ballast is also reduced because a smaller portion of the overall power is dropped in the ballast compared to what might be required with a fixed resistor.\n\nEarlier{{When|date=March 2019}}, household [[clothes dryer]]s sometimes incorporated a [[germicidal lamp]] in series with an ordinary incandescent lamp; the incandescent lamp operated as the ballast for the germicidal lamp. A commonly used light in the home in the 1960s in 220\u2013240&nbsp;V countries was a circular tube ballasted by an under-run regular mains filament lamp. Self ballasted [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s incorporate ordinary tungsten filaments within the overall envelope of the lamp to act as the ballast, and it supplements the otherwise lacking red area of the light spectrum produced.\n\n== Reactive ballasts ==\n[[File:Fluorescent light strip 2 tube.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|A [[fluorescent lamp]], a device with negative differential resistance.<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite book\n  | last = Sinclair\n  | first = Ian Robertson\n  | title = Sensors and transducers, 3rd Ed.\n  | publisher = Newnes\n  | date = 2001\n  | location =\n  | pages = 69\u201370\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s_WIb91uKK8C&pg=PA69&dq=%22gas+discharge%22+%22negative+resistance\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0750649322}}</ref><ref name=\"Kularatna\">{{cite book\n  | last = Kularatna\n  | first = Nihal\n  | title = Power Electronics Design Handbook\n  | publisher = Newnes\n  | date = 1998\n  | location =\n  | pages = 232\u2013233\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IBx801tIgjYC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22negative+resistance\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0750670739}}</ref> In operation, an increase in current through the fluorescent tube causes a drop in voltage across it.

The top is a high-power factor rapid start series ballast for two 30\u201340&nbsp;W lamps. The middle is a low power factor preheat ballast for a single 30\u201340&nbsp;W lamp while the bottom ballast is a simple inductor used with a 15&nbsp;W preheat lamp.|alt=]]\n\n[[image:Sign ballast.jpg|thumb|A magnetic sign ballast in an aluminum sign frame. Sign ballasts are heavier duty than other ballasts because the cooler outdoor temperatures increase the energy required to start a fluorescent tube. They are sized based on how many feet of tube is used.]]\n\nBecause of the power that would be lost, resistors are not used as ballasts for lamps of more than about two watts. Instead, a [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]] is used. Losses in the ballast due to its resistance and losses in its magnetic core may be significant, on the order of 5 to 25% of the lamp input electric power. Practical lighting design calculations must allow for ballast loss in estimating the running cost of a lighting installation.\n\nAn [[inductor]] is very common in line-frequency ballasts to provide the proper starting and operating electrical condition to power a [[fluorescent lamp]], [[neon lamp]], or [[high-intensity discharge lamp|high intensity discharge (HID) lamp]]. (Because of the use of the inductor, such ballasts are usually called ''magnetic ballasts''.) The inductor has two benefits:\n# Its reactance limits the power available to the lamp with only minimal power losses in the inductor\n# The [[voltage spike]] produced when current through the inductor is rapidly interrupted is used in some circuits to first strike the arc in the lamp.\n\nA disadvantage of the inductor is that current is shifted out of phase with the voltage, producing a poor [[power factor]]. In more expensive ballasts, a [[capacitor]] is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called ''lead-lag'' ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.\n\nIn Europe, and most 220-240&nbsp;V territories, the line voltage is sufficient to start lamps over 20W with a series inductor. In North America and Japan however, the line voltage (120&nbsp;V or 100&nbsp;V respectively) may not be sufficient to start lamps over 20&nbsp;W with a series inductor, so an [[autotransformer]] winding is included in the ballast to step up the voltage. The autotransformer is designed with enough [[leakage inductance]] ([[short-circuit inductance]]) so that the current is appropriately limited.\n\nBecause of the large inductors and capacitors that must be used, reactive ballasts operated at line frequency tend to be large and heavy. They commonly also produce acoustic [[noise]] (line-frequency [[mains hum|hum]]).\n\nPrior to 1980 in the United States, [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-based oils were used as an insulating oil in many ballasts to provide cooling and electrical isolation (see [[transformer oil]]).\n\n==Electronic ballasts{{anchor|Electronic_ballasts}}==\n{{see also|Fluorescent lamp#Electronic ballasts}}\nAn electronic ballast uses [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] [[electronic circuit]]ry to provide the proper starting and operating electrical conditions to power discharge lamps. An electronic ballast can be smaller and lighter than a comparably-rated magnetic one. An electronic ballast is usually quieter than a magnetic one, which produces a line-frequency hum by vibration of the transformer laminations.<ref>{{cite web\n | title=Understanding Transformer Noise\n | url=http://federalpacific.com/literature/dry-type-literature/10transformernoise.pdf\n | website=federalpacific.com\n | publisher=Federal Pacific\n | accessdate=8 August 2015\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315002829/http://federalpacific.com/literature/dry-type-literature/10transformernoise.pdf\n | archive-date=15 March 2015\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nElectronic ballasts are often based on [[switched-mode power supply|SMPS]] topology, first rectifying the input power and then chopping it at a high frequency. Advanced electronic ballasts may allow dimming via [[pulse-width modulation]] or via changing the frequency to a higher value. Ballasts incorporating a [[microcontroller]] (digital ballasts) may offer remote control and monitoring via networks such as [[LonWorks]], [[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface|DALI]], [[DMX512]], [[Digital Signal Interface|DSI]] or simple analog control using a [[0-10 V lighting control|0-10&nbsp;V]] [[Direct current|DC]] brightness control signal.

The flicker index, used for measuring perceptible light modulation, has a range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0 indicating the lowest possibility of flickering and 1 indicating the highest.

The ballast initially works as a starter for the arc, supplying a high-voltage impulse and, later, it works as a limiter/regulator of the electric flow inside the circuit. Electronic ballasts also run much cooler and are lighter than their magnetic counterparts.<ref name=\"nlpip\" />\n\n==Fluorescent lamp ballasts==\n{{Main article|Fluorescent lamp}}\n\n===Preheating===\nThis technique uses a combination [[Electrical filament|filament]]\u2013[[cathode]] at each end of the lamp in conjunction with a mechanical or automatic (bi-metallic or electronic) switch that initially connect the filaments in series with the ballast to preheat them. When filaments are disconnected, an inductive pulse from the ballast starts the lamp. This system is described as \"Preheat\" in North America and \"Switch Start\" in the UK, and have no specific name in the rest part of the world. This systems is common in 200\u2013240 V countries (and for 100\u2013120 V lamps up to about 30 watts).\n\nAlthough an inductive pulse makes it more likely that the lamp will start when the starter switch opens, it is not actually necessary. The ballast in such systems can equally be a resistor. A number of fluorescent lamp fittings used a filament lamp as the ballast in the late 1950s through to the 1960s.  Special lamps were manufactured that were rated at 170&nbsp;volts and 120&nbsp;watts.  The lamp had a thermal starter built into the 4 pin base. The power requirements were much larger than using an inductive ballast (though the consumed current was the same), but the warmer light from the lamp type of ballast was often preferred by users particularly in a domestic environment.\n\nResistive ballasts were the only type that was usable when the only supply available to power the fluorescent lamp was DC. Such fittings used the thermal type of starter (mostly because they had gone out of use long before the [[Glow switch starter|glow starter]] was invented), but it was possible to include a choke in the circuit whose sole purpose was to provide a pulse on opening of the starter switch to improve starting. DC fittings were complicated by the need to reverse the polarity of the supply to the tube each time it started. Failure to do so vastly shortened the life of the tube.\n\n===Instant start===\nAn instant start ballast does not preheat the electrodes, instead using a relatively high voltage (~600&nbsp;V) to initiate the discharge arc. It is the most energy efficient type, but yields the fewest lamp-start cycles, as material is blasted from the surface of the cold electrodes each time the lamp is turned on. Instant-start ballasts are best suited to applications with long duty cycles, where the lamps are not frequently turned on and off. Although these were mostly used in countries with 100-120&nbsp;volt mains supplies (for lamps of 40&nbsp;W or above), they were briefly popular in other countries because the lamp started without the flicker of switch start systems. The popularity was short lived because of the short lamp life.\n\n===Rapid start===\nA rapid start ballast applies voltage and heats the cathodes simultaneously. It provides superior lamp life and more cycle life, but uses slightly more energy as the electrodes in each end of the lamp continue to consume heating power as the lamp operates. Again, although popular in 100-120&nbsp;volt countries for lamps of 40&nbsp;W and above, rapid start is sometimes used in other countries particularly where the flicker of switch start systems is undesirable. This ballast is incompatible with the European energy saver T8 fluorescent lamps, that retrofits the older T12 lamps, since these lamps have much higher starting voltage than the [[open-circuit voltage]] of rapid start ballasts.\n\n===Dimmable ballast===\nA dimmable ballast is very similar to a rapid start ballast, but usually has a capacitor incorporated to give a [[power factor]] nearer to unity than a standard rapid start ballast.  A [[quadrac]] type light dimmer can be used with a dimming ballast, which maintains the heating current while allowing lamp current to be controlled.  A resistor of about 10&nbsp;k\u03a9 is required to be connected in parallel with the fluorescent tube to allow reliable firing of the quadrac at low light levels.\n\n===Programmed start===\nUsed in high end electronic fluorescent ballasts. This ballast applies power to the filaments first, it allows the cathodes to preheat and then applies voltage to the lamps to strike an arc. Lamp life typically operates up to 100,000 on/off cycles when using programmed start ballasts.  Once started, filament voltage is reduced to increase operating efficiency.\n\n<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title = What Are Fluorescent Ballast Starting Methods?\n | website = \n | publisher = Bulbsdepot.com\n | date = 2014-02-14\n | url = http://www.bulbsdepot.com/blog/what-are-fluorescent-ballast-starting-methods.html\n | doi =\n | accessdate = 2014-03-11\n}}</ref> This ballast gives the best life and most starts from lamps, and so is preferred for applications with very frequent power cycling such as vision examination rooms and restrooms with a motion detector switch.\n\n===Emergency===\nAn electronic ballast with an integrated battery is designed to provide emergency egress lighting in the event of a power failure (typically less than 2 hours). These can be used as an alternative to egress lighting powered by a back-up electrical generator. However, emergency ballasts require regular testing and have a useful life of 10-12 years.\n\n===Hybrid===\nA hybrid ballast has a magnetic core-and-coil [[transformer]] and an electronic switch for the [[electrode]]-heating circuit. Like a magnetic ballast, a hybrid unit operates at line power frequency\u201450&nbsp;Hz in Europe, for example. These types of ballasts, which are also referred to as ''[[cathode]]-disconnect ballasts'', disconnect the [[electrode]]-heating [[Electrical circuit|circuit]] after they start the lamps.\n\n==ANSI Ballast factor==\nFor a lighting ballast, the ANSI  ''ballast factor'' is used in North America to compare the light output (in [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]]) of a lamp operated on a ballast compared to the lamp operating on an ANSI reference ballast. Reference ballast operates the lamp at its ANSI specified nominal power rating.<ref>IEEE Std. 100 \"Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Standard 100\" , {{ISBN|0-7381-2601-2}}, page 83</ref><ref>ANSI standard C82.13-2002 ''Definitions for Flurorescent Lamp Ballasts\", page 1</ref>  The ballast factor of practical ballasts must be considered in [[Architectural lighting design|lighting design]]; a low ballast factor may save energy, but will produce less light.

They may be as simple as a [[resistor]], [[inductor]], or [[capacitor]] (or a combination of these) wired in series with the lamp; or as complex as the electronic ballasts used in [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s and [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s.\n\n== Current limiting ==\n[[Image:Tanning-chokeballast.jpg|thumbnail|upright|250px|A ''choke ballast'' (inductor) used in older lighting. This example is from a tanning bed. It requires a starter switch (below).]] \n[[Image:Tanning-starter.jpg|thumbnail|250px|A [[Fluorescent lamp#Starting|lamp starter]], required with some inductor type ballasts.  It connects the two ends of the lamp to preheat them for one second before lighting.]]\n\nAn electrical ballast is a device that limits the current through an [[electrical load]]. These are most often used when a load (such as an arc discharge) has its terminal voltage decline when current through the load increases.  If such a device were connected to a constant-voltage power supply, it would draw an increasing amount of current until it is destroyed or causes the power supply to fail. To prevent this, a ballast provides a positive [[electrical resistance|resistance]] or [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]] that limits the current. The ballast provides for the proper operation of the negative-resistance device by limiting current.\n\nBallasts can also be used simply to limit the current in an ordinary, positive-resistance circuit. Prior to the advent of solid-state ignition, automobile [[ignition system]]s commonly included a ballast resistor to regulate the voltage applied to the ignition system.\n\nSeries resistors are used as ballasts to control the current through LEDs.\n\n== Resistors ==\n\n=== Fixed resistors ===\nFor simple, low-powered loads such as a neon lamp or a [[LED lamp]], a fixed resistor is commonly used. Because the resistance of the ballast resistor is large it determines the current in the circuit, even in the face of [[negative resistance]] introduced by the neon lamp.\n\nBallast was also a component used in early model [[automobile]] [[Internal combustion engine|engines]]  that lowered the supply [[voltage]] to the [[ignition system]] after the engine had been started. Starting the engine requires a significant amount of electrical current from the [[battery (electricity)|battery]], resulting in an equally significant voltage drop. To allow the engine to start, the ignition system was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once the vehicle was started and the starter disengaged, the normal operating voltage was too high for the ignition system. To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the ignition system, resulting in two different operating voltages for the starting and ignition systems.\n\nOccasionally, this ballast resistor would fail and the classic symptom of this failure was that the engine ran while being cranked (while the resistor was bypassed) but stalled immediately when cranking ceased (and the resistor was reconnected in the circuit via the ignition switch). Modern electronic ignition systems (those used since the 1980s or late '70s) do not require a ballast resistor as they are flexible enough to operate on the lower cranking voltage or the normal operating voltage.\n\nAnother common use of a ballast resistor in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10&nbsp;A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.\n\nIn some consumer electronic equipment, notably in television sets in the era of valves (vacuum tubes), but also in some low-cost record players, the [[vacuum tube]] heaters were connected in series. Since the voltage drop across all the heaters in series was usually less than the full mains voltage, it was necessary to provide a ballast to drop the excess voltage. A resistor was often used for this purpose, as it was cheap and worked with both AC and DC.\n\n=== Self-variable resistors ===\nSome ballast resistors have the property of increasing in [[electrical resistance|resistance]] as current through them increases, and decreasing in resistance as current decreases. Physically, some such devices are often built quite like [[incandescent lamp]]s. Like the [[tungsten]] filament of an ordinary incandescent lamp, if [[electric current|current]] increases, the ballast resistor gets hotter, its resistance goes up, and its voltage drop increases. If [[electric current|current]] decreases, the ballast resistor gets colder, its resistance drops, and the [[voltage drop]] decreases. Therefore, the ballast resistor reduces variations in current, despite variations in applied voltage or changes in the rest of an electric circuit. These devices are sometimes called \"[[Iron-hydrogen resistor|barretters]]\" and were used in the series heating circuits of 1930s to 1960s [[AC/DC receiver design#Series tube heaters|AC/DC]] [[All American Five|radio]] and TV home receivers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThis property can lead to more precise current control than merely choosing an appropriate fixed resistor. The power lost in the resistive ballast is also reduced because a smaller portion of the overall power is dropped in the ballast compared to what might be required with a fixed resistor.\n\nEarlier{{When|date=March 2019}}, household [[clothes dryer]]s sometimes incorporated a [[germicidal lamp]] in series with an ordinary incandescent lamp; the incandescent lamp operated as the ballast for the germicidal lamp. A commonly used light in the home in the 1960s in 220\u2013240&nbsp;V countries was a circular tube ballasted by an under-run regular mains filament lamp. Self ballasted [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s incorporate ordinary tungsten filaments within the overall envelope of the lamp to act as the ballast, and it supplements the otherwise lacking red area of the light spectrum produced.\n\n== Reactive ballasts ==\n[[File:Fluorescent light strip 2 tube.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|A [[fluorescent lamp]], a device with negative differential resistance.<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite book\n  | last = Sinclair\n  | first = Ian Robertson\n  | title = Sensors and transducers, 3rd Ed.\n  | publisher = Newnes\n  | date = 2001\n  | location =\n  | pages = 69\u201370\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s_WIb91uKK8C&pg=PA69&dq=%22gas+discharge%22+%22negative+resistance\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0750649322}}</ref><ref name=\"Kularatna\">{{cite book\n  | last = Kularatna\n  | first = Nihal\n  | title = Power Electronics Design Handbook\n  | publisher = Newnes\n  | date = 1998\n  | location =\n  | pages = 232\u2013233\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IBx801tIgjYC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22negative+resistance\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 978-0750670739}}</ref> In operation, an increase in current through the fluorescent tube causes a drop in voltage across it.

Sign ballasts are heavier duty than other ballasts because the cooler outdoor temperatures increase the energy required to start a fluorescent tube. They are sized based on how many feet of tube is used.]]\n\nBecause of the power that would be lost, resistors are not used as ballasts for lamps of more than about two watts. Instead, a [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]] is used. Losses in the ballast due to its resistance and losses in its magnetic core may be significant, on the order of 5 to 25% of the lamp input electric power. Practical lighting design calculations must allow for ballast loss in estimating the running cost of a lighting installation.\n\nAn [[inductor]] is very common in line-frequency ballasts to provide the proper starting and operating electrical condition to power a [[fluorescent lamp]], [[neon lamp]], or [[high-intensity discharge lamp|high intensity discharge (HID) lamp]]. (Because of the use of the inductor, such ballasts are usually called ''magnetic ballasts''.) The inductor has two benefits:\n# Its reactance limits the power available to the lamp with only minimal power losses in the inductor\n# The [[voltage spike]] produced when current through the inductor is rapidly interrupted is used in some circuits to first strike the arc in the lamp.\n\nA disadvantage of the inductor is that current is shifted out of phase with the voltage, producing a poor [[power factor]]. In more expensive ballasts, a [[capacitor]] is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called ''lead-lag'' ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.\n\nIn Europe, and most 220-240&nbsp;V territories, the line voltage is sufficient to start lamps over 20W with a series inductor. In North America and Japan however, the line voltage (120&nbsp;V or 100&nbsp;V respectively) may not be sufficient to start lamps over 20&nbsp;W with a series inductor, so an [[autotransformer]] winding is included in the ballast to step up the voltage. The autotransformer is designed with enough [[leakage inductance]] ([[short-circuit inductance]]) so that the current is appropriately limited.\n\nBecause of the large inductors and capacitors that must be used, reactive ballasts operated at line frequency tend to be large and heavy. They commonly also produce acoustic [[noise]] (line-frequency [[mains hum|hum]]).\n\nPrior to 1980 in the United States, [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-based oils were used as an insulating oil in many ballasts to provide cooling and electrical isolation (see [[transformer oil]]).\n\n==Electronic ballasts{{anchor|Electronic_ballasts}}==\n{{see also|Fluorescent_lamp#Electronic_ballasts}}\nAn electronic ballast uses [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] [[electronic circuit]]ry to provide the proper starting and operating electrical conditions to power discharge lamps.

This ballast is incompatible with the European energy saver T8 fluorescent lamps, that retrofits the older T12 lamps, since these lamps have much higher starting voltage than the [[open-circuit voltage]] of rapid start ballasts.\n\n===Dimmable ballast===\nA dimmable ballast is very similar to a rapid start ballast, but usually has a capacitor incorporated to give a [[power factor]] nearer to unity than a standard rapid start ballast.  A [[quadrac]] type light dimmer can be used with a dimming ballast, which maintains the heating current while allowing lamp current to be controlled.  A resistor of about 10&nbsp;k\u03a9 is required to be connected in parallel with the fluorescent tube to allow reliable firing of the quadrac at low light levels.\n\n===Programmed start===\nUsed in high end electronic fluorescent ballasts. This ballast applies power to the filaments first, it allows the cathodes to preheat and then applies voltage to the lamps to strike an arc. Lamp life typically operates up to 100,000 on/off cycles when using programmed start ballasts.  Once started, filament voltage is reduced to increase operating efficiency.\n\n<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title = What Are Fluorescent Ballast Starting Methods?\n | website = \n | publisher = Bulbsdepot.com\n | date = 2014-02-14\n | url = http://www.bulbsdepot.com/blog/what-are-fluorescent-ballast-starting-methods.html\n | doi =\n | accessdate = 2014-03-11\n}}</ref> This ballast gives the best life and most starts from lamps, and so is preferred for applications with very frequent power cycling such as vision examination rooms and restrooms with a motion detector switch.\n\n===Emergency===\nAn electronic ballast with an integrated battery is designed to provide emergency egress lighting in the event of a power failure (typically less than 2 hours). These can be used as an alternative to egress lighting powered by a back-up electrical generator. However, emergency ballasts require regular testing and have a useful life of 10-12 years.\n\n===Hybrid===\nA hybrid ballast has a magnetic core-and-coil [[transformer]] and an electronic switch for the [[electrode]]-heating circuit. Like a magnetic ballast, a hybrid unit operates at line power frequency\u201450&nbsp;Hz in Europe, for example. These types of ballasts, which are also referred to as ''[[cathode]]-disconnect ballasts'', disconnect the [[electrode]]-heating [[Electrical circuit|circuit]] after they start the lamps.\n\n==ANSI Ballast factor==\nFor a lighting ballast, the ANSI  ''ballast factor'' is used in North America to compare the light output (in [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]]) of a lamp operated on a ballast compared to the lamp operating on an ANSI reference ballast. Reference ballast operates the lamp at its ANSI specified nominal power rating.<ref>IEEE Std. 100 \"Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Standard 100\" , {{ISBN|0-7381-2601-2}}, page 83</ref><ref>ANSI standard C82.13-2002 ''Definitions for Flurorescent Lamp Ballasts\", page 1</ref>  The ballast factor of practical ballasts must be considered in [[Architectural lighting design|lighting design]]; a low ballast factor may save energy, but will produce less light.  With fluorescent lamps, ballast factor can vary from the reference value of 1.0.<ref name=\"LBL\">{{cite web |url=http://ateam.lbl.gov/Design-Guide/DGHtm/ballastfactor.htm |title=Ballast factor |accessdate=April 12, 2013 |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319012221/http://ateam.lbl.gov/Design-Guide/DGHtm/ballastfactor.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Ballast triode==\nEarly tube-based [[TV set|color TV sets]] used a ballast [[triode]], such as the PD500, as a parallel shunt stabilizer for the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] acceleration voltage, to keep the CRT's deflection factor constant.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Compact fluorescent lamp]] (CFL)\n*[[Fluorescent lamp]]\n*[[High-intensity discharge lamp]] (HID)\n*[[Iron-hydrogen resistor]]\n*[[Mercury-vapor lamp]]\n*[[Neon lamp]]\n*[[Sodium lamp]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Electrical ballasts}}\n{{Commons category|Starters (fluorescent lamp)|Starters}}\n{{Commons category|Fluorescent lamp power supplies|Fluorescent lamp power supplies (includes electronic ballasts)}}\n* [http://www.nema.org NEMA - National Electrical Manufacturers Association]\n\n{{Automotive engine |collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electrical Ballast}}\n[[Category:Gas discharge lamps]]\n[[Category:Analog circuits]]\n[[Category:Resistive components]]\n[[Category:Electrical power control]]\n[[Category:Electric power systems components]]\n", "name_user": "Widefox", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eElectronic ballasts{{anchor|Electronic_ballasts}}:fix hatnote", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_ballast"}

The plane is forced to land at [[Wichita, Kansas]] and the President is flown to his original destination on a back-up plane. Trapp visited Air Force One only because [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] Major Timothy Kerry was sick with the flu. NCIS arrive to investigate the death, but meet some jurisdictional problems with both the [[FBI]] and [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] who each want to take the lead. With Secret Service agent [[Caitlin Todd]] grudgingly agreeing to help, NCIS Special Agents [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs]] and [[Anthony DiNozzo|Tony DiNozzo]], and NCIS Medical Examiner [[List of NCIS characters#Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard|Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard]] examine the body. The local coroner, a friend of Ducky's, manages to stall the FBI long enough for NCIS to begin preliminary investigations. On Gibbs' orders, Tony shuts the door with the FBI agents still outside and has the pilot immediately fly the plane back to Washington after receiving authorization from Agent Todd.\n\nBack at the NCIS headquarters, Ducky is autopsying the body of Commander Trapp, only to find he suffered a cerebral embolism, which is considered a natural cause of death. Gibbs wants the team to keep looking while he joins Agent Todd aboard Air Force One. Later, another senior officer revealed to be Marine [[Major (United States)|Major]] Timothy Kerry, is found dead in his car in [[Georgetown, Virginia|Georgetown]] with similar symptoms to those of Commander Trapp. NCIS Forensic Specialist [[Abby Sciuto]] is able to find [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] and snake venom from an Australian [[Coastal taipan|Taipan]] on both Commander Trapp and Major Kerry's uniforms, which could explain why they died. DiNozzo investigates both of them, finding out that Trapp and Kerry used the same [[dry cleaning|dry cleaner]].\n\nAboard Air Force One, Agent Todd tells Gibbs about her relationship with Major Kerry, resulting in an interrogation concerning her motive for his death. Todd's reaction makes Gibbs believe that she is innocent. Todd explains the differences between the backup plane and the main plane. Gibbs focuses on the [[Armory (military)|armory]], which has locks instead of digital keypads. If terrorists are planning an attack, they must have copied the keys.\n\nAware about the threat, Gibbs checks the armory while Todd protects the President. The armory is open, and a journalist is trying to get to the President's quarters in an attempt to kill him. Gibbs confronts the journalist, who attacks, but is killed before any damage is done.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Agent Todd resigns from the Secret Service for breaking [[fraternization]] rules.

It was the [[Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery|first secular nursing school in the world]], and is now part of [[King's College London]]. In recognition of her pioneering work in nursing, the [[Nightingale Pledge]] taken by new nurses, and the [[Florence Nightingale Medal]], the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve, were named in her honour, and the annual [[International Nurses Day]] is celebrated on her birthday. Her social reforms included improving healthcare for all sections of British society, advocating better hunger relief in India, helping to [[abolitionism (prostitution)|abolish prostitution laws]] that were harsh for women, and expanding the acceptable forms of female participation in the [[workforce]].\n\nNightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer. In her lifetime, much of her published work was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her tracts were written in [[plain English|simple English]] so that they could easily be understood by those with poor literary skills.

She said that if given the choice between being a woman or a galley slave, then she would choose the freedom of the galleys. She generally rejected female company and spent her time with male intellectuals. Clarkey made an exception, however, in the case of the Nightingale family and Florence in particular.

Despite the intense anger and distress of her mother and sister, she rebelled against the expected role for a woman of her status to become a wife and mother.

This experience influenced her later career, when she advocated sanitary living conditions as of great importance. Consequently, she reduced peacetime deaths in the army and turned her attention to the sanitary design of hospitals and the introduction of sanitation in working-class homes (see Statistics and Sanitary Reform, below).\n\nAccording to some secondary sources, Nightingale had a frosty relationship with her fellow-nurse [[Mary Seacole]], who ran a hotel/hospital for officers. Seacole\u2019s own memoir, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands''\u00b8 records only one, friendly, meeting with her, when she asked her for a bed for the night, and got it; Seacole was in Scutari en route to the Crimea to join her business partner and start their business. However, Seacole pointed out that when she tried to join Nightingale's group, one of Nightingale's colleagues rebuffed her, and Seacole implied that racism was at the root of that rebuttal.<ref>Mary Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands'', Chapter VIII (London: James Blackwood, 1857), pp. 73-81</ref> Nightingale told her brother-in-law, in a private letter, that she was worried about contact between her work and Seacole\u2019s business, claiming that while \u201cshe was very kind to the men and, what is more, to the Officers \u2013 and did some good (she) made many drunk\u201d.<ref>letter 4&nbsp;August 1870, Wellcome Ms 9004/59).</ref> Nightingale reportedly wrote, \"I had the greatest difficulty in repelling Mrs Seacole's advances, and in preventing association between her and my nurses (absolutely out of the question!)...Anyone who employs Mrs Seacole will introduce much kindness - also much drunkenness and improper conduct\".<ref>Tan-Feng Chang, CREOLIZING THE WHITE WOMAN\u2019S BURDEN: MARY SEACOLE PLAYING \u201cMOTHER\u201d AT THE COLONIAL CROSSROADS BETWEEN PANAMA AND CRIMEA, (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), p. 526.</ref>\n\n=== The Lady with the Lamp ===\n[[File:Florence Nightingale.

There was an outpouring of generous donations. Sidney Herbert served as honorary secretary of the fund and the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] was chairman. Nightingale was considered a pioneer in the concept of ''[[medical tourism]]'' as well, based on her 1856 letters describing spas in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. She detailed the health conditions, physical descriptions, dietary information, and other vital details of patients whom she directed there. The treatment there was significantly less expensive than in Switzerland.\n[[File:Florence Nightingale by Goodman, 1858.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nightingale, c.&nbsp;1858, by Goodman]]\n\nNightingale had \u00a345,000 at her disposal from the Nightingale Fund to set up the Nightingale Training School at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] on 9&nbsp;July 1860. The first trained Nightingale nurses began work on 16&nbsp;May 1865 at the Liverpool Workhouse Infirmary. Now called the [[Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery]], the school is part of [[King's College London]]. She also campaigned and raised funds for the [[Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital]] in [[Aylesbury]] near her sister's home, [[Claydon House]].\n\nNightingale wrote ''[[Notes on Nursing]]'' (1859). The book served as the cornerstone of the curriculum at the Nightingale School and other nursing schools, though it was written specifically for the education of those nursing at home. Nightingale wrote, \"Every day sanitary knowledge, or the knowledge of nursing, or in other words, of how to put the constitution in such a state as that it will have no disease, or that it can recover from disease, takes a higher place. It is recognised as the knowledge which every one ought to have \u2013 distinct from medical knowledge, which only a profession can have\".<ref name=\"FlorenceNightingale\">{{cite book |title=Notes on Nursing: What it is and what it is not |last=Nightingale |first=Florence |chapter=Preface |year=1974 |orig-year=1859 |publisher=Blackie & Son Ltd. |location= Glasgow and London  |isbn=978-0-216-89974-2}}</ref> \n\n''Notes on Nursing'' also sold well to the general reading public and is considered a classic introduction to nursing. Nightingale spent the rest of her life promoting and organising the nursing profession. In the introduction to the 1974 edition, Joan Quixley of the Nightingale School of Nursing wrote: \"The book was the first of its kind ever to be written. It appeared at a time when the simple rules of health were only beginning to be known, when its topics were of vital importance not only for the well-being and recovery of patients, when hospitals were riddled with infection, when nurses were still mainly regarded as ignorant, uneducated persons.

Nurse Sarah Gamp (left) became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of Nightingale]]\nAs [[Mark Bostridge]] has demonstrated, one of Nightingale's signal achievements was the introduction of trained nurses into the [[workhouse]] system in Britain from the 1860s onwards.<ref name=\"Bostridge\"/> This meant that sick paupers were no longer being cared for by other, able-bodied paupers, but by properly trained nursing staff. In the first half of the 19th century, nurses were usually former servants or widows who found no other job and therefore were forced to earn their living by this work. [[Charles Dickens]] caricatured the standard of care in his 1842\u20131843 published novel ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' in the figure of [[Sarah Gamp]] as being incompetent, negligent, alcoholic and corrupt. According to Caroline Worthington, director of the [[Florence Nightingale Museum]], \"When she [Nightingale] started out there was no such thing as nursing. The Dickens character Sarah Gamp, who was more interested in drinking gin than looking after her patients, was only a mild exaggeration. Hospitals were places of last resort where the floors were laid with straw to soak up the blood. Florence transformed nursing when she got back [from Crimea]. She had access to people in high places and she used it to get things done. Florence was stubborn, opinionated and forthright but she had to be those things in order to achieve all that she did.\"<ref name=\"Express\"/>\n\nThough Nightingale is sometimes said to have denied the theory of infection for her entire life, a 2008 biography disagrees,<ref name=\"Bostridge\">''Florence Nightingale, the Woman and her Legend'', by Mark Bostridge (Viking, 2008)</ref> saying that she was simply opposed to a precursor of germ theory known as [[Contingent contagionism|contagionism]]. This theory held that diseases could only be transmitted by touch. Before the experiments of the mid-1860s by [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]] and [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lister]], hardly anyone took germ theory seriously; even afterwards, many medical practitioners were unconvinced. Bostridge points out that in the early 1880s Nightingale wrote an article for a textbook in which she advocated strict precautions designed, she said, to kill germs. Nightingale's work served as an inspiration for nurses in the [[American Civil War]]. The [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] government approached her for advice in organising field medicine. Her ideas inspired the volunteer body of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]].\n[[File:Florence nightingale at st thomas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Florence Nightingale (middle) in 1886 with her graduating [[Florence nightingale school of nursing and midwifery|class of nurses]] from [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas']] outside [[Claydon House]], Buckinghamshire]]\nIn the 1870s, Nightingale mentored [[Linda Richards]], \"America's first trained nurse\", and enabled her to return to the United States with adequate training and knowledge to establish high-quality nursing schools.<ref>{{cite book |title=Role Development for Doctoral Advanced Nursing Practice |date=15 December 2010 |publisher=Springer Publishing Company |page=325}}</ref> Richards went on to become a nursing pioneer in the US and Japan.<ref>Linda Richards (1915) [https://archive.org/details/reminiscencesli02richgoog ''Reminiscences of Linda Richards''], Whitcomb & Barrows, Boston {{oclc|1350705}}</ref>\n\nBy 1882, several Nightingale nurses had become matrons at several leading hospitals, including, in London ([[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St Mary's Hospital]], Westminster Hospital, St&nbsp;Marylebone Workhouse Infirmary and the [[Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability|Hospital for Incurables]] at [[Putney]]) and throughout Britain ([[Netley Hospital|Royal Victoria Hospital]], [[Netley]]; [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh|Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]; Cumberland Infirmary and Liverpool Royal Infirmary), as well as at [[Sydney Hospital]] in [[New South Wales]], Australia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bicentenary of a hospital built from a rum deal |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/bicentenary-of-a-hospital-built-from-a-rum-deal-20111028-1moaj.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=26 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1883, Nightingale became the first recipient of the [[Royal Red Cross]].

In 1858 and 1859, she successfully lobbied for the establishment of a Royal Commission into the Indian situation.

Her father, William Edward Nightingale, was an extremely wealthy landowner, and the family moved in the highest circles of English society. In those days, women of Nightingale's class did not attend universities and did not pursue professional careers; their purpose in life was to marry and bear children. Nightingale was fortunate. Her father believed women should be educated, and he personally taught her Italian, Latin, Greek, philosophy, history and \u2013 most unusual of all for women of the time \u2013 writing and mathematics.<ref name=Cohen1984/>{{rp|page=98}} }} [[Lytton Strachey]] was famous for his book debunking 19th century heroes, ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'' (1918).

Strachey included it in ''The Cause'', a history of the women's movement. Apparently, the writing served its original purpose of sorting out thoughts; Nightingale left soon after to train at the Institute for deaconesses at [[Kaiserswerth]].\n\n\"Cassandra\" protests the over-feminisation of women into near helplessness, such as Nightingale saw in her mother's and older sister's lethargic lifestyle, despite their education. She rejected their life of thoughtless comfort for the world of social service. The work also reflects her fear of her ideas being ineffective, as were [[Cassandra]]'s. Cassandra was a princess of [[Troy]] who served as a priestess in the temple of [[Apollo]] during the [[Trojan War]]. The god gave her the gift of [[prophecy]]; when she refused his advances, he cursed her so that her prophetic warnings would go unheeded.

Influenced from an early age by the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan tradition]],{{efn|Her parents took their daughters to both Church of England and Methodist churches.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} }} Nightingale felt that genuine religion should manifest in active care and love for others.{{efn|Nightingale's rare references to Unitarianism are mildly negative, and while her religious views were heterodox, she remained in the Church of England throughout her life. Her biblical annotations, private journal notes and translations of the mystics give quite a different impression of her beliefs, and these do have a bearing on her work with nurses, and not only at Edinburgh, but neither [Cecil Woodham-]Smith nor his [sic \u2014 [[Cecil Woodham-Smith|C.W.-S.]] was a woman] followers consulted their sources.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Lynn |last=McDonald |title=Florence Nightingale: Extending nursing |page=11}}{{full citation|date=January 2020}}</ref>}} She wrote a work of theology: ''Suggestions for Thought'', her own [[theodicy]], which develops her heterodox ideas. Nightingale questioned the goodness of a God who would condemn souls to hell, and was a believer in [[universal reconciliation]] \u2013 the concept that even those who die without being saved will eventually make it to Heaven.{{efn|While this has changed by the 21st&nbsp;century, ''[[universal reconciliation]]'' was very far from being mainstream in the [[Church of England]] at the time.}} She would sometimes comfort those in her care with this view. For example, a dying young prostitute being tended by Nightingale was concerned she was going to hell, and said to her \"Pray God, that you may never be in the despair I am in at this time\". The nurse replied \"Oh, my girl, are you not now more merciful than the God you think you are going to?

She was a strong opponent of discrimination both against Christians of different denominations, and against those of non-Christian religions.\nNightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work, and would ensure the nurses in her care attended religious services. However she was often critical of organised religion. She disliked the role the 19th century Church of England would sometimes play in worsening the oppression of the poor. Nightingale argued that secular hospitals usually provided better care than their religious counterparts. While she held that the ideal health professional should be inspired by a religious as well as professional motive, she said that in practice many religiously motivated health workers were concerned chiefly in securing their own salvation, and that this motivation was inferior to the professional desire to deliver the best possible care.<ref name=\"NightingaleonMysticism\" /><ref name=\"NightingaleonWomen\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Nursing ===\n[[File:Nightingaleplaque.JPG|thumb|left|210px|[[Blue plaque]] for Nightingale in [[South Street, Mayfair|South Street]], [[Mayfair]], London]]\nNightingale's lasting contribution has been her role in founding the modern nursing profession.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/1362704X.2016.1203090 |title=The Nurse's Uniform as Ethopoietic Fashion |journal=Fashion Theory |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=523\u2013552 |year=2017 |last1=Hardy |first1=Susan |last2=Corones |first2=Anthony}}</ref> She set an example of compassion, commitment to patient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration.

She later transferred to a mule cart and was reported to have escaped serious injury when the cart was toppled in an accident.

The carriage was returned to England by [[Alexis Soyer]] after the war and subsequently given to the Nightingale training school. The carriage was damaged when the hospital was bombed during the Second World War.

In 2008, [[Mark Bostridge]] published a major new life of Nightingale, almost exclusively based on unpublished material from the Verney Collections at Claydon and from archival documents from about 200 archives around the world, some of which had been published by Lynn McDonald in her projected sixteen-volume edition of the ''Collected Works of Florence Nightingale'' (2001 to date).<ref name=\"BBC 2017\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\n[[File:KLM MD 11 AMS.jpg|thumbnail|left|alt=A three-engine wide-body jet airliner in blue and gray livery|[[KLM]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]], registration PH-KCD, ''Florence Nightingale'']]\nIn 2002, Nightingale was ranked number&nbsp;52 in the [[BBC]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]] following a UK-wide vote.

It was the [[Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery|first secular nursing school in the world]], and is now part of [[King's College London]]. In recognition of her pioneering work in nursing, the [[Nightingale Pledge]] taken by new nurses, and the [[Florence Nightingale Medal]], the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve, were named in her honour, and the annual [[International Nurses Day]] is celebrated on her birthday. Her social reforms included improving healthcare for all sections of British society, advocating better hunger relief in India, helping to [[abolitionism (prostitution)|abolish prostitution laws]] that were harsh for women, and expanding the acceptable forms of female participation in the [[workforce]].\n\nNightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer. In her lifetime, much of her published work was concerned with spreading medical knowledge. Some of her tracts were written in [[plain English|simple English]] so that they could easily be understood by those with poor literary skills. She was also a pioneer in [[data visualization]] with the use of [[infographic]]s, effectively using graphical presentations of [[statistics|statistical]] [[data]].<ref name=\"BBC 2017\"/> Much of her writing, including her extensive work on religion and [[mysticism]], has only been published posthumously.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Embley Park.jpg|thumb|[[Embley Park]] in Hampshire, now a school, was one of the family homes of [[William Nightingale]].]]\nFlorence Nightingale was born on 12&nbsp;May 1820 into a wealthy and well-connected British family at the ''Villa Colombaia'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countryjoe.com/nightingale/house.htm |title=The true Florence: Exploring the Italian birthplace of Florence Nightingale |date=1 December 2007 |first=Joy|last=Shiller |accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref><ref>https://jmvh.org/article/florence-nightingale/</ref> in [[Florence]], [[Tuscany]], Italy, and was named after the city of her birth. Florence's older sister [[Frances Parthenope Verney|Frances Parthenope]] had similarly been named after her place of birth, ''[[History of Naples|Parthenope]]'', a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] settlement now part of the city of [[Naples]].

William's mother Mary ''n\u00e9e'' Evans was the niece of Peter Nightingale, under the terms of whose will William inherited his estate at Lea Hurst, and assumed the name and arms of Nightingale.

She recorded that \"Clarkey\" was a stimulating hostess who did not care for her appearance, and while her ideas did not always agree with those of her guests, \"she was incapable of boring anyone.\" Her behaviour was said to be exasperating and eccentric and she had no respect for upper-class British women, whom she regarded generally as inconsequential. She said that if given the choice between being a woman or a galley slave, then she would choose the freedom of the galleys. She generally rejected female company and spent her time with male intellectuals. Clarkey made an exception, however, in the case of the Nightingale family and Florence in particular. She and Florence were to remain close friends for 40&nbsp;years despite their 27&nbsp;year age difference. Clarke demonstrated that women could be equals to men, an idea that Florence had not obtained from her mother.<ref name=cromwell>{{cite book |last1=Cromwell |first1=Judith Lissauer |title=Florence Nightingale, feminist |year=2013 |publisher=McFarland et Company |location=Jefferson, NC [u.a.] |isbn=978-0-7864-7092-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/florencenighting0000crom/page/28 28] |url=https://archive.org/details/florencenighting0000crom/page/28 }}</ref>\n\nNightingale underwent the first of several experiences that she believed were calls from God in February&nbsp;1837 while at [[Embley Park]], prompting a strong desire to devote her life to the service of others. In her youth she was respectful of her family's opposition to her working as a nurse, only announcing her decision to enter the field in 1844. Despite the intense anger and distress of her mother and sister, she rebelled against the expected role for a woman of her status to become a wife and mother. Nightingale worked hard to educate herself in the art and science of nursing, in the face of opposition from her family and the restrictive social code for affluent young English women.<ref name=\"Small's bio\">{{cite book |last1=Small |first1=Hugh |title=Florence Nightingale: Avenging Angel |year=1998 |publisher=St.&nbsp;Martin's Press |location=New York |pages=1\u201319}}</ref>\n[[File:Florence Nightingale by Augustus Egg.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting of Nightingale by [[Augustus Egg]], c.&nbsp;1840s]]\nAs a young woman, Nightingale was described as attractive, slender and graceful. While her demeanour was often severe, she was said to be very charming and to possess a radiant smile. Her most persistent suitor was the politician and poet [[Richard Monckton Milnes]], but after a nine-year courtship she rejected him, convinced that marriage would interfere with her ability to follow her calling to nursing.<ref name=\"Small's bio\"/>\n\nIn Rome in 1847, she met [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]], a politician who had been [[Secretary at War]] (1845\u20131846) who was on his honeymoon. He and Nightingale became lifelong close friends. Herbert would be Secretary of War again during the [[Crimean War]], when he and his wife would be instrumental in facilitating Nightingale's nursing work in the Crimea. She became Herbert's key adviser throughout his political career, though she was accused by some of having hastened Herbert's death from [[Bright's Disease]] in 1861 because of the pressure her programme of reform placed on him. Nightingale also much later had strong relations with academic [[Benjamin Jowett]], who may have wanted to marry her.<ref>Bostridge, Mark (2008). Florence Nightingale. p. 8. London</ref>\n\n[[File:Florence Nightingale by Kilburn c1854.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nightingale c.&nbsp;1854]]\nNightingale continued her travels (now with Charles and [[Selina Bracebridge]]) as far as Greece and Egypt. While in Athens, Greece, Nightingale rescued a juvenile [[little owl]] from a group of children who were tormenting it, and she named the owl Athena. Nightingale often carried the owl in her pocket, until the pet died (soon before Nightingale left for Crimea).<ref>{{cite web |title=Life and death of Florence Nightingale's beloved pet |url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/news/nightingales-owl-in-the-wren/ |website=Trinity College, Cambridge |accessdate=3 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer writings on Egypt in particular are testimony to her learning, literary skill, and philosophy of life. Sailing up the Nile as far as Abu Simbel in January&nbsp;1850, she wrote of the [[Abu Simbel temples]], \"Sublime in the highest style of intellectual beauty, intellect without effort, without suffering ... not a feature is correct \u2014 but the whole effect is more expressive of spiritual grandeur than anything I could have imagined.

This experience influenced her later career, when she advocated sanitary living conditions as of great importance. Consequently, she reduced peacetime deaths in the army and turned her attention to the sanitary design of hospitals and the introduction of sanitation in working-class homes (see Statistics and Sanitary Reform, below).\n\nAccording to some secondary sources, Nightingale had a frosty relationship with her fellow-nurse [[Mary Seacole]], who ran a hotel/hospital for officers. Seacole\u2019s own memoir, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands''\u00b8 records only one, friendly, meeting with her, when she asked her for a bed for the night, and got it; Seacole was in Scutari en route to the Crimea to join her business partner and start their business. However, Seacole pointed out that when she tried to join Nightingale's group, one of Nightingale's colleagues rebuffed her, and Seacole implied that racism was at the root of that rebuttal.<ref>Mary Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands'', Chapter VIII (London: James Blackwood, 1857), pp. 73-81</ref> Nightingale told her brother-in-law, in a private letter, that she was worried about contact between her work and Seacole\u2019s business, claiming that while \u201cshe was very kind to the men and, what is more, to the Officers \u2013 and did some good (she) made many drunk\u201d.<ref>letter 4&nbsp;August 1870, Wellcome Ms 9004/59).</ref> Nightingale reportedly wrote, \"I had the greatest difficulty in repelling Mrs Seacole's advances, and in preventing association between her and my nurses (absolutely out of the question!)...Anyone who employs Mrs Seacole will introduce much kindness - also much drunkenness and improper conduct\".<ref>Tan-Feng Chang, CREOLIZING THE WHITE WOMAN\u2019S BURDEN: MARY SEACOLE PLAYING \u201cMOTHER\u201d AT THE COLONIAL CROSSROADS BETWEEN PANAMA AND CRIMEA, (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), p. 526.</ref>\n\n=== The Lady with the Lamp ===\n[[File:Florence Nightingale.

There was an outpouring of generous donations. Sidney Herbert served as honorary secretary of the fund and the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] was chairman. Nightingale was considered a pioneer in the concept of ''[[medical tourism]]'' as well, based on her 1856 letters describing spas in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. She detailed the health conditions, physical descriptions, dietary information, and other vital details of patients whom she directed there. The treatment there was significantly less expensive than in Switzerland.\n[[File:Florence Nightingale by Goodman, 1858.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nightingale, c.&nbsp;1858, by Goodman]]\n\nNightingale had \u00a345,000 at her disposal from the Nightingale Fund to set up the Nightingale Training School at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] on 9&nbsp;July 1860. The first trained Nightingale nurses began work on 16&nbsp;May 1865 at the Liverpool Workhouse Infirmary. Now called the [[Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery]], the school is part of [[King's College London]]. She also campaigned and raised funds for the [[Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital]] in [[Aylesbury]] near her sister's home, [[Claydon House]].\n\nNightingale wrote ''[[Notes on Nursing]]'' (1859). The book served as the cornerstone of the curriculum at the Nightingale School and other nursing schools, though it was written specifically for the education of those nursing at home. Nightingale wrote, \"Every day sanitary knowledge, or the knowledge of nursing, or in other words, of how to put the constitution in such a state as that it will have no disease, or that it can recover from disease, takes a higher place. It is recognised as the knowledge which every one ought to have \u2013 distinct from medical knowledge, which only a profession can have\".<ref name=\"FlorenceNightingale\">{{cite book |title=Notes on Nursing: What it is and what it is not |last=Nightingale |first=Florence |chapter=Preface |year=1974 |orig-year=1859 |publisher=Blackie & Son Ltd. |location= Glasgow and London  |isbn=978-0-216-89974-2}}</ref> \n\n''Notes on Nursing'' also sold well to the general reading public and is considered a classic introduction to nursing. Nightingale spent the rest of her life promoting and organising the nursing profession. In the introduction to the 1974 edition, Joan Quixley of the Nightingale School of Nursing wrote: \"The book was the first of its kind ever to be written. It appeared at a time when the simple rules of health were only beginning to be known, when its topics were of vital importance not only for the well-being and recovery of patients, when hospitals were riddled with infection, when nurses were still mainly regarded as ignorant, uneducated persons.

Nurse Sarah Gamp (left) became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of Nightingale]]\nAs [[Mark Bostridge]] has demonstrated, one of Nightingale's signal achievements was the introduction of trained nurses into the [[workhouse]] system in Britain from the 1860s onwards.<ref name=\"Bostridge\"/> This meant that sick paupers were no longer being cared for by other, able-bodied paupers, but by properly trained nursing staff. In the first half of the 19th century, nurses were usually former servants or widows who found no other job and therefore were forced to earn their living by this work. [[Charles Dickens]] caricatured the standard of care in his 1842\u20131843 published novel ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' in the figure of [[Sarah Gamp]] as being incompetent, negligent, alcoholic and corrupt. According to Caroline Worthington, director of the [[Florence Nightingale Museum]], \"When she [Nightingale] started out there was no such thing as nursing. The Dickens character Sarah Gamp, who was more interested in drinking gin than looking after her patients, was only a mild exaggeration. Hospitals were places of last resort where the floors were laid with straw to soak up the blood. Florence transformed nursing when she got back [from Crimea]. She had access to people in high places and she used it to get things done. Florence was stubborn, opinionated and forthright but she had to be those things in order to achieve all that she did.\"<ref name=\"Express\"/>\n\nThough Nightingale is sometimes said to have denied the theory of infection for her entire life, a 2008 biography disagrees,<ref name=\"Bostridge\">''Florence Nightingale, the Woman and her Legend'', by Mark Bostridge (Viking, 2008)</ref> saying that she was simply opposed to a precursor of germ theory known as [[Contingent contagionism|contagionism]]. This theory held that diseases could only be transmitted by touch. Before the experiments of the mid-1860s by [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]] and [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lister]], hardly anyone took germ theory seriously; even afterwards, many medical practitioners were unconvinced. Bostridge points out that in the early 1880s Nightingale wrote an article for a textbook in which she advocated strict precautions designed, she said, to kill germs. Nightingale's work served as an inspiration for nurses in the [[American Civil War]]. The [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] government approached her for advice in organising field medicine. Her ideas inspired the volunteer body of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]].\n[[File:Florence nightingale at st thomas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Florence Nightingale (middle) in 1886 with her graduating [[Florence nightingale school of nursing and midwifery|class of nurses]] from [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas']] outside [[Claydon House]], Buckinghamshire]]\nIn the 1870s, Nightingale mentored [[Linda Richards]], \"America's first trained nurse\", and enabled her to return to the United States with adequate training and knowledge to establish high-quality nursing schools.<ref>{{cite book |title=Role Development for Doctoral Advanced Nursing Practice |date=15 December 2010 |publisher=Springer Publishing Company |page=325}}</ref> Richards went on to become a nursing pioneer in the US and Japan.<ref>Linda Richards (1915) [https://archive.org/details/reminiscencesli02richgoog ''Reminiscences of Linda Richards''], Whitcomb & Barrows, Boston {{oclc|1350705}}</ref>\n\nBy 1882, several Nightingale nurses had become matrons at several leading hospitals, including, in London ([[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St Mary's Hospital]], Westminster Hospital, St&nbsp;Marylebone Workhouse Infirmary and the [[Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability|Hospital for Incurables]] at [[Putney]]) and throughout Britain ([[Netley Hospital|Royal Victoria Hospital]], [[Netley]]; [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh|Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]; Cumberland Infirmary and Liverpool Royal Infirmary), as well as at [[Sydney Hospital]] in [[New South Wales]], Australia.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bicentenary of a hospital built from a rum deal |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/bicentenary-of-a-hospital-built-from-a-rum-deal-20111028-1moaj.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=26 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1883, Nightingale became the first recipient of the [[Royal Red Cross]].

Despite her symptoms, she remained phenomenally productive in social reform. During her bedridden years, she also did pioneering work in the field of hospital planning, and her work propagated quickly across Britain and the world.

In 1858 and 1859, she successfully lobbied for the establishment of a Royal Commission into the Indian situation. Two years later, she provided a report to the commission, which completed its own study in 1863. \"After 10&nbsp;years of sanitary reform, in 1873, Nightingale reported that mortality among the soldiers in India had declined from 69 to 18 per&nbsp;1,000\".<ref name=Cohen1984/>{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Royal Sanitary Commission of 1868\u20131869 presented Nightingale with an opportunity to press for compulsory sanitation in private houses.

Bernard Cohen]] argues:\n{{cquote| Nightingale's achievements are all the more impressive when they are considered against the background of social restraints on women in Victorian England. Her father, William Edward Nightingale, was an extremely wealthy landowner, and the family moved in the highest circles of English society. In those days, women of Nightingale's class did not attend universities and did not pursue professional careers; their purpose in life was to marry and bear children. Nightingale was fortunate. Her father believed women should be educated, and he personally taught her Italian, Latin, Greek, philosophy, history and \u2013 most unusual of all for women of the time \u2013 writing and mathematics.<ref name=Cohen1984/>{{rp|page=98}} }} [[Lytton Strachey]] was famous for his book debunking 19th century heroes, ''[[Eminent Victorians]]'' (1918). Nightingale gets a full chapter, but instead of debunking her, Strachey praised her in a way that raised her national reputation and made her an icon for English feminists of the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>James Southern, \"A Lady 'in Proper Proportions'?

She wrote some 200&nbsp;books, pamphlets and articles throughout her life.<ref name=\"Express\"/> During 1850 and 1852, she was struggling with her self-definition and the expectations of an upper-class marriage from her family. As she sorted out her thoughts, she wrote ''Suggestions for Thought to Searchers after Religious Truth''. This was an 829&nbsp;page, three-volume work, which Nightingale had printed privately in 1860, but which until recently was never published in its entirety.<ref name=Calabria&Macrae1994>{{cite book |year=1994 |author=Nightingale, Florence |editor1=Calabria, Michael D. |editor2=MacRae, Janet A. |title=Suggestions for Thought: Selections and Commentaries |isbn=978-0-8122-1501-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CHcm-2Zm5DQC&dq=%22suggestions+for+thought%22&printsec=frontcover&q |accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref> An effort to correct this was made with a 2008 publication by [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], as volume&nbsp;11<ref name=McDonald2008>{{cite book |year=2008 |editor=McDonald, Lynn |title=Florence Nightingale's ''Suggestions for Thought'' |series=Collected Works of Florence Nighingale |volume=11 |place=Ontario, Canada |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |isbn=978-0-88920-465-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Mle5Sjixa0cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=McDonald++%22suggestions+for+thought%22&q |accessdate=6 July 2010}} Privately printed by Nightingale in 1860.</ref> of a 16&nbsp;volume project, the ''Collected Works of Florence Nightingale''.<ref name=WLUPress>{{cite journal |title=Collected Works of Florence Nightingale |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |url=http://www.wlupress.wlu.ca/Series/CWFN.shtml |accessdate=6 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927174908/http://www.wlupress.wlu.ca/Series/CWFN.shtml |archivedate=27 September 2011}}</ref> The best known of these essays, called \"Cassandra\", was previously published by [[Ray Strachey]] in 1928. Strachey included it in ''The Cause'', a history of the women's movement. Apparently, the writing served its original purpose of sorting out thoughts; Nightingale left soon after to train at the Institute for deaconesses at [[Kaiserswerth]].\n\n\"Cassandra\" protests the over-feminisation of women into near helplessness, such as Nightingale saw in her mother's and older sister's lethargic lifestyle, despite their education. She rejected their life of thoughtless comfort for the world of social service. The work also reflects her fear of her ideas being ineffective, as were [[Cassandra]]'s. Cassandra was a princess of [[Troy]] who served as a priestess in the temple of [[Apollo]] during the [[Trojan War]]. The god gave her the gift of [[prophecy]]; when she refused his advances, he cursed her so that her prophetic warnings would go unheeded. [[Elaine Showalter]] called Nightingale's writing \"a major text of English feminism, a link between [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]] and [[Virginia Woolf|Woolf]].\"<ref>Gilbert, Sandra M., and Susan Gubar. \"Florence Nightingale.\" ''The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women: The Traditions in English''.

She remained in the [[Church of England]] throughout her life, albeit with unorthodox views. Influenced from an early age by the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan tradition]],{{efn|Her parents took their daughters to both Church of England and Methodist churches.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} }} Nightingale felt that genuine religion should manifest in active care and love for others.{{efn|Nightingale's rare references to Unitarianism are mildly negative, and while her religious views were heterodox, she remained in the Church of England throughout her life. Her biblical annotations, private journal notes and translations of the mystics give quite a different impression of her beliefs, and these do have a bearing on her work with nurses, and not only at Edinburgh, but neither [Cecil Woodham-]Smith nor his [sic \u2014 [[Cecil Woodham-Smith|C.W.-S.]] was a woman] followers consulted their sources.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Lynn |last=McDonald |title=Florence Nightingale: Extending nursing |page=11}}{{full citation|date=January 2020}}</ref>}} She wrote a work of theology: ''Suggestions for Thought'', her own [[theodicy]], which develops her heterodox ideas. Nightingale questioned the goodness of a God who would condemn souls to hell, and was a believer in [[universal reconciliation]] \u2013 the concept that even those who die without being saved will eventually make it to Heaven.{{efn|While this has changed by the 21st&nbsp;century, ''[[universal reconciliation]]'' was very far from being mainstream in the [[Church of England]] at the time.}} She would sometimes comfort those in her care with this view. For example, a dying young prostitute being tended by Nightingale was concerned she was going to hell, and said to her \"Pray God, that you may never be in the despair I am in at this time\". The nurse replied \"Oh, my girl, are you not now more merciful than the God you think you are going to?

She was a strong opponent of discrimination both against Christians of different denominations, and against those of non-Christian religions.\nNightingale believed religion helped provide people with the fortitude for arduous good work, and would ensure the nurses in her care attended religious services. However she was often critical of organised religion. She disliked the role the 19th century Church of England would sometimes play in worsening the oppression of the poor. Nightingale argued that secular hospitals usually provided better care than their religious counterparts. While she held that the ideal health professional should be inspired by a religious as well as professional motive, she said that in practice many religiously motivated health workers were concerned chiefly in securing their own salvation, and that this motivation was inferior to the professional desire to deliver the best possible care.<ref name=\"NightingaleonMysticism\" /><ref name=\"NightingaleonWomen\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Nursing ===\n[[File:Nightingaleplaque.JPG|thumb|left|210px|[[Blue plaque]] for Nightingale in [[South Street, Mayfair|South Street]], [[Mayfair]], London]]\nNightingale's lasting contribution has been her role in founding the modern nursing profession.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/1362704X.2016.1203090 |title=The Nurse's Uniform as Ethopoietic Fashion |journal=Fashion Theory |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=523\u2013552 |year=2017 |last1=Hardy |first1=Susan |last2=Corones |first2=Anthony}}</ref> She set an example of compassion, commitment to patient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration.

The recording, made in aid of the [[Charge of the Light Brigade|Light Brigade Relief Fund]] and available to hear online, says:\n\n<blockquote>When I am no longer even a memory, just a name, I hope my voice may perpetuate the great work of my life.

It did not portray her as an entirely sympathetic character and draws much characterisation from [[Lytton Strachey]]'s biography of her in ''[[Eminent Victorians]]''.<ref>Mark Bostridge, ''Florence Nightingale \u2013 The Woman and Her Legend''</ref> It was adapted as a film of the same name in 1951. In 2009, a stage musical play representation of Nightingale entitled ''The Voyage of the Lass'' was produced by the Association of Nursing Service Administrators of the [[Philippines]].\n\n=== Film ===\nIn 1912, a biographical silent film titled ''The Victoria Cross'', starring [[Julia Swayne Gordon]] as Nightingale, was released, followed in 1915 by another silent film, ''[[Florence Nightingale (1915 film)|Florence Nightingale]]'', featuring [[Elisabeth Risdon]]. In 1936, [[Kay Francis]] played Nightingale in the film titled ''[[The White Angel (1936 film)|The White Angel]]''.

In 1911, [[Edward Tyas Cook]] was authorised by Nightingale's executors to write the official life, published in two volumes in 1913. Nightingale was also the subject of one of [[Lytton Strachey]]'s four mercilessly provocative biographical essays, ''[[Eminent Victorians]]''. Strachey regarded Nightingale as an intense, driven woman who was both personally intolerable and admirable in her achievements.<ref>Florence Nightingale, Monica E. Baly and H. C. G. Matthew, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', 2015.</ref>\n\n[[Cecil Woodham-Smith]], like Strachey, relied heavily on Cook's ''Life'' in her 1950 biography, though she did have access to new family material preserved at Claydon. In 2008, [[Mark Bostridge]] published a major new life of Nightingale, almost exclusively based on unpublished material from the Verney Collections at Claydon and from archival documents from about 200 archives around the world, some of which had been published by Lynn McDonald in her projected sixteen-volume edition of the ''Collected Works of Florence Nightingale'' (2001 to date).<ref name=\"BBC 2017\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\n[[File:KLM MD 11 AMS.jpg|thumbnail|left|alt=A three-engine wide-body jet airliner in blue and gray livery|[[KLM]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]], registration PH-KCD, ''Florence Nightingale'']]\nIn 2002, Nightingale was ranked number&nbsp;52 in the [[BBC]]'s list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]] following a UK-wide vote.

With successive groups of consumers adopting the new technology (shown in blue), its market share (yellow) will eventually reach the saturation level.|thumb|Representation of diffusion of innovations model by Rogers. (illustrated).|302x302px]]\n<blockquote>\"Adopters of any new [[innovation]] or idea can be categorized as innovators (2.5%), [[early adopter]]s (13.5%), early majority (34%), late majority (34%) and laggards (16%), based on the mathematically based [[Gaussian function|Bell curve]]. When graphed, the rate of adoption formed what came to typify the Diffusion of Innovations model, a [[Logistic function|logistic curve]]. The graph shows a cumulative percentage of adopters over time\u2013slow at the start, more rapid as adoption increases, then levelling off until only a small percentage of laggards have not adopted.\"<ref>Everett M. Rogers, ''Diffusion of Innovation'' (3rd Ed.), New York, NY: Free Press, 1983.</ref></blockquote>Singhal defines ''diffusion'' as \"the process by which an innovation is filtered through certain channels over time among the members of a social system.\" and ''innovation'' as \"an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|title=Diffusion of Innovations|date=2008|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Political Communication|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412953993.n156|isbn=978-1-4129-1799-5|last2=Quinlan|first2=Margaret M.}}</ref> Collectively he treats ''diffusion of innovations'' as a communications process as no diffusion is possible without dissemination of information amongst the individuals.<ref>{{Citation|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|chapter=Diffusion of Innovations|date=2009|chapter-url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/communicationtheory/n113.xml|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Communication Theory|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412959384.n113|isbn=978-1-4129-5937-7|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> He argued that while the theory was not an ideology, it was construed ideologically analogous to the \"[[trickle-down economics|trickle-down]]\" approach in economics. The theory in Singhal's opinion does not want one \"to wait\" for diffusion of a new innovation to reach the poorest of the poor (often regarded as late adopters), and believes that the rate of adoption by any segment can be accelerated using communication and outreach strategies. He also argues for '<nowiki/>''decentralized diffusion''' (a process where diffusion of any product or practice is propagated by multiple actors) as one of the strategies to achieve this end.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Positive deviance (PD) approach ===\nSinghal's main contribution lies in the adoption of [[positive deviance]] (or PD) approach to research. He argues that solutions to complex social problems exist in the communities as some type of tacit knowledge but are hidden from plain view, and PD approach comes in handy in identifying the tacit knowledge and expanding its prevalence within the community.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Slettli|first=Victoria Konovalenko|last2=Singhal|first2=Arvind|date=2016|title=Amplification of tacit knowledge through the positive deviance approach|url=https://brage.inn.no/inn-xmlui/handle/11250/2432992|journal=814-820}}</ref> The PD approach identifies individuals within communities and groups whose uncommon behaviours and strategies enable them find better solutions to the problems experienced by the community, considering that these individuals ought to have the same resources as their peers. These individuals are identified as ''<nowiki/>'positive outliers' or '''<nowiki/>'<nowiki/>'''positive deviants''<nowiki/>' when their traits are unusually better compared to their peers in the same group characterized by similar socio-economic parameters. ''For instance'', a particular child recorded an unusually good body-mass index in a community of malnourished children where all of them live in similar socio-economic conditions and the child in question has no identifiable privileges than distinguishes the child from others in its category.<ref>Arvind Singhal, Prucia Buscell, and Curt Lindberg (2014). ''Inspiring Change and Saving Lives: The Positive Deviance Way.'' Bordentown, NJ: PlexusPress. {{ISBN|0692271651}}, {{ISBN|9780692271650}}</ref><ref>Singhal, A., Sternin, J. and Dura, L. (2009) ''Combating malnutrition: Positive deviance grows roots in Vietnam in the land of a thousand rice fields.'' Positive deviance wisdom series, 1, pp. 1-8.</ref>\n\nSinghal explains that PD approach consists of four stages:<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n# ''Awareness and breakout of the community \"mental prisons\". '''Mental prisons' are preconceived notions, biases and even practices that prevent the researchers and the communities from identifying solutions that might in plain sight.\n# ''Identifying the positive deviants - the carriers of the authentic experience and valuable tacit knowledge''. Some members of the community are able to exhibit superior traits than their peers even when they are subject to the same socio-economic conditions. The researchers ought to identify what these positive deviants are doing differently with their resources that make them exhibit traits that are uncommon for their group.\n# ''Creation of particular methods to facilitate the \"paradigm shift\"''. Once the practices of positive deviants are identified, their methods ought to be disseminated to the rest of the community to allow for a 'paradigm shift' for the community and for adoption of the said practices in their daily lives.\n# ''Community members embrace the new practice, spurred by the self-discovery and social proof.'' The community adopts the practices of the positive deviants and their traits improve reasonably. The researchers measure the impact of the adopted practices.\n\nMany of Singhal's written works advocate for expansion of PD approach in addressing issues of public health, malnutrition, social behaviours and education. Singhal notes that PD has been used to address issues such as malnutrition, eradication of female genital mutilation, human trafficking, increasing school retention rates, and promoting use of condoms among commercial sex workers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|date=2010-08-31|title=Communicating What Works!

Classrooms that incorporate the model allow for equitable student participation, peer-learning, and building of connections, trust, and immediacy. The teacher in such a classroom only assumes the role of facilitator instead of a lecturer and helps the group in exploring solutions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|last2=Perez|first2=Lauren E.|last3=Stevik|first3=Kristin|last4=M\u00f8nness|first4=Erik|last5=Svenkerud|first5=Peer Jacob|date=2019-12-16|title=Liberating Structures as Pedagogical Innovation for Inclusive Learning: A Pilot Study in a Norwegian University|journal=Journal of Creative Communications|pages=097325861987560|doi=10.1177/0973258619875600|issn=0973-2586}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberatingstructures.com/education|title=Liberating Structures - Education|last=Lipmanowicz|first=Keith McCandless, Henri|website=www.liberatingstructures.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> Although, liberating structures are not limited to classroom settings.

Over his career, Singhal also took upon many projects as consultant for international organizations such as [[UNICEF]], [[World Bank]], several national and regional governments and private corporations.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Major contributions ==\n\n=== Diffusion of innovations ===\nDuring his years at Annenberg School of Communication at University of Southern California, Singhal worked extensively with the communication theorist [[Everett Rogers]], who was also his mentor.<ref name=\":3\">{{Citation|last=Dearing|first=James W.|title=Revisiting Diffusion Theory|date=2006|work=Communication of Innovations: A Journey with Ev Rogers|pages=29\u201360|publisher=SAGE Publications India Pvt Ltd|doi=10.4135/9788132113775.n2|isbn=978-0-7619-3477-6|last2=Meyer|first2=Gary}}</ref> Rogers was renowned for his work on the theory of [[diffusion of innovations]], which dictated that: \n[[File:Diffusion of ideas.svg|alt=The diffusion of innovations according to Rogers (1962). With successive groups of consumers adopting the new technology (shown in blue), its market share (yellow) will eventually reach the saturation level.|thumb|Representation of diffusion of innovations model by Rogers. (illustrated).|302x302px]]\n<blockquote>\"Adopters of any new [[innovation]] or idea can be categorized as innovators (2.5%), [[Early adopter|early adopters]] (13.5%), early majority (34%), late majority (34%) and laggards (16%), based on the mathematically based [[Gaussian function|Bell curve]]. When graphed, the rate of adoption formed what came to typify the Diffusion of Innovations model, a [[Logistic function|logistic curve]]. The graph shows a cumulative percentage of adopters over time\u2013slow at the start, more rapid as adoption increases, then levelling off until only a small percentage of laggards have not adopted.\"<ref>Everett M. Rogers, ''Diffusion of Innovation'' (3rd Ed.), New York, NY: Free Press, 1983.</ref></blockquote>Singhal defines ''diffusion'' as \"the process by which an innovation is filtered through certain channels over time among the members of a social system.\" and ''innovation'' as \"an idea, practice, or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|title=Diffusion of Innovations|date=2008|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Political Communication|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412953993.n156|isbn=978-1-4129-1799-5|last2=Quinlan|first2=Margaret M.}}</ref> Collectively he treats ''diffusion of innovations'' as a communications process as no diffusion is possible without dissemination of information amongst the indivuals.<ref>{{Citation|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|chapter=Diffusion of Innovations|date=2009|chapter-url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/communicationtheory/n113.xml|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Communication Theory|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412959384.n113|isbn=978-1-4129-5937-7|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> He argued that while the theory was not an ideology, it was construed ideologically analogous to the \"[[trickle-down economics|trickle-down]]\" approach in economics. The theory in Singhal's opinion does not want one \"to wait\" for diffusion of a new innovation to reach the poorest of the poor (often regarded as late adopters), and believes that the rate of adoption by any segment can be accelerated using communication and outreach strategies. He also argues for '<nowiki/>''decentralized diffusion''' (a process where diffusion of any product or practice is propagated by multiple actors) as one of the strategies to achieve this end.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n=== Positive deviance (PD) approach ===\nSinghal's main contribution lies in the adoption of [[positive deviance]] (or PD) approach to research. He argues that solutions to complex social problems exist in the communities as some type of tacit knowledge but are hidden from plain view, and PD approach comes in handy in identifying the tacit knowledge and expanding its prevalence within the community.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Slettli|first=Victoria Konovalenko|last2=Singhal|first2=Arvind|date=2016|title=Amplification of tacit knowledge through the positive deviance approach|url=https://brage.inn.no/inn-xmlui/handle/11250/2432992|journal=814-820}}</ref> The PD approach identifies individuals within communities and groups whose uncommon behaviours and strategies enable them find better solutions to the problems experienced by the community, considering that these individuals ought to have the same resources as their peers. These individuals are identified as ''<nowiki/>'positive outliers' or '''<nowiki/>'<nowiki/>'''positive deviants''<nowiki/>' when their traits are unusually better compared to their peers in the same group characterized by similar socio-economic parameters. ''For instance'', a particular child recorded an unusually good body-mass index in a community of malnourished children where all of them live in similar socio-economic conditions and the child in question has no identifiable privileges than distinguishes the child from others in its category.<ref>Arvind Singhal, Prucia Buscell, and Curt Lindberg (2014). ''Inspiring Change and Saving Lives: The Positive Deviance Way.'' Bordentown, NJ: PlexusPress. {{ISBN|0692271651}}, {{ISBN|9780692271650}}</ref><ref>Singhal, A., Sternin, J. and Dura, L. (2009) ''Combating malnutrition: Positive deviance grows roots in Vietnam in the land of a thousand rice fields.'' Positive deviance wisdom series, 1, pp. 1-8.</ref>\n\nSinghal explains that PD approach consists of four stages:<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n# ''Awareness and breakout of the community \"mental prisons\". '''Mental prisons' are preconceived notions, biases and even practices that prevent the researchers and the communities from identifying solutions that might in plain sight.\n# ''Identifying the positive deviants - the carriers of the authentic experience and valuable tacit knowledge''. Some members of the community are able to exhibit superior traits than their peers even when they are subject to the same socio-economic conditions. The researchers ought to identify what these positive deviants are doing differently with their resources that make them exhibit traits that are uncommon for their group.\n# ''Creation of particular methods to facilitate the \"paradigm shift\"''. Once the practices of positive deviants are identified, their methods ought to be disseminated to the rest of the community to allow for a 'paradigm shift' for the community and for adoption of the said practices in their daily lives.\n# ''Community members embrace the new practice, spurred by the self-discovery and social proof.'' The community adopts the practices of the positive deviants and their traits improve reasonably. The researchers measure the impact of the adopted practices.\n\nMany of Singhal's written works advocate for expansion of PD approach in addressing issues of public health, malnutrition, social behaviours and education. Singhal notes that PD has been used to address issues such as malnutrition, eradication of female genital mutilation, human trafficking, increasing school retention rates, and promoting use of condoms among commercial sex workers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|date=2010-08-31|title=Communicating What Works!

Classrooms that incorporate the model allow for equitable student participation, peer-learning, and building of connections, trust, and immediacy. The teacher in such a classroom only assumes the role of facilitator instead of a lecturer and helps the group in exploring solutions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|last2=Perez|first2=Lauren E.|last3=Stevik|first3=Kristin|last4=M\u00f8nness|first4=Erik|last5=Svenkerud|first5=Peer Jacob|date=2019-12-16|title=Liberating Structures as Pedagogical Innovation for Inclusive Learning: A Pilot Study in a Norwegian University|journal=Journal of Creative Communications|pages=097325861987560|doi=10.1177/0973258619875600|issn=0973-2586}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberatingstructures.com/education|title=Liberating Structures - Education|last=Lipmanowicz|first=Keith McCandless, Henri|website=www.liberatingstructures.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> Although, liberating structures are not limited to classroom settings.

Since 2016, [[Lodewijk Asscher]] has been [[Leader of the Labour Party (Netherlands)|Leader of the Labour Party]]. The party fell to only nine seats in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] at the [[2017 Dutch general election|2017 general election]], making it only the seventh-largest faction in the chamber\u2013its worst showing ever. However, the PvdA rebounded with a first-place finish in the [[2019 European Parliament election in the Netherlands]], winning 6 of 26 seats with 19% of the vote.\n\nThe Labour Party is a member of the European [[Party of European Socialists]] and the global [[Progressive Alliance]]. In the [[European Parliament]], where the Labour Party has 6 seats, it is part of the parliamentary group [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\n===1946\u20131965===\n[[File:Willem Drees 1958.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Willem Drees]], co-Founder and Leader from 1946 until 1958, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1948 until 1958]]\n\nDuring the [[Netherlands in World War II|German Occupation of the Netherlands]] in the [[Second World War]] a group of prominent Dutchmen of all democratic political ideologies were interned as hostages in [[Gymnasium Beekvliet|St. Michielsgestel]] by the German occupation authorities. They came to the consensus that the pre-war fragmentation of Dutch political life, known as \"[[Pillarization]],\" should be overcome after the war in a so-called [[Breakthrough (Dutch political history)|''doorbraak'']]. These people formed the [[Nederlandse Volksbeweging|Dutch People's Movement]] (NVB) immediately after the war ended in 1945. The new movement promoted the foundation of the Labour Party (''Partij van de Arbeid \u2013 PvdA'')) on 9 February 1946, through a merger of three pre-war parties: the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (SDAP), the social liberal [[Free-thinking Democratic League]] (VDB) and progressive-Protestant [[Christian Democratic Union (Netherlands)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU).<ref name=\"Moldenhauer2001\">{{cite book|author=Gebhard Moldenhauer|title=Die Niederlande und Deutschland: einander kennen und verstehen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vm_h-NPz1T8C&pg=PA113|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|isbn=978-3-89325-747-8|page=113}}</ref> They were joined by individuals from [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Resistance during World War II|resistance group]] ''Christofoor'', as well as some of the more progressive members of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] parties [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) and [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP). The founding Congress was chaired by NVB-member [[Willem Banning]].\n\nThe founders of the PvdA wanted to create a [[Big tent|broad party]], breaking with the historic tradition of pillarisation. The party combined [[socialism|socialist]]s with [[Liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Christian left|progressive Christian]]s.<ref name=\"Notermans2001\">{{cite book|author=Ton Notermans|title=Social Democracy and Monetary Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKQB3czNk1oC&pg=PA226|date=January 2001|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-806-5|page=226}}</ref> However, the party was unable to break pillarisation. Instead the new party renewed the close ties that the SDAP had with other socialist organisations (see [[#Linked organisations|linked organisations]]). In 1948 some of the left-liberal members, led by former VDB leader [[Pieter Oud]], left the PvdA after concluding it had become too socialist for their liking. Together with the [[Freedom Party (Netherlands)|Freedom Party]], they formed the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD), a [[conservative liberalism|conservative liberal]] party.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1958, the PvdA led [[coalition government]]s with the [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP), and combinations of VVD, ARP and CHU, with the PvdA's [[Willem Drees]] as prime minister. The KVP and the PvdA together had a large majority in parliament. Under his leadership the Netherlands recovered from the war, began to build its [[welfare state]]  and [[Indonesia]] became [[Indonesian National Revolution|independent]].\n\nAfter the cabinet crisis of 1958, the PvdA was replaced by the VVD. The PvdA was in opposition until 1965. The electoral support of PvdA voters began to decline.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n[[File:Joop den Uyl 1975.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Joop den Uyl]], Leader from 1966 until 1986, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1973 until 1977]]\n\nIn 1965 a conflict in the KVP-ARP-CHU-VVD cabinet made continuation of the government impossible. The three [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessional]], Christian-influenced parties turned towards the PvdA. Together they formed the [[Cals cabinet]], with KVP leader [[Jo Cals]] as prime minister. This cabinet was also short lived and conflict ridden. The conflicts culminated in the fall of the Cals cabinet over [[economic policy]].\n\nMeanwhile, a younger generation was attempting to gain control of the PvdA. A group of young PvdA members, calling themselves the [[New Left (Netherlands)|New Left]], changed the party. The New Left believed the party should become oriented towards the [[new social movements]], adopting their anti-parliamentary strategies and their issues, such as [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]], [[environmentalism|environment]]al conservation and [[Third World]] development. Prominent New Left members were [[Jan Nagel]], [[Andr\u00e9 van der Louw]] and [[Bram Peper]]. One of their early victories followed the fall of the Cals cabinet. The party Congress adopted a motion that made it impossible for the PvdA to govern with the KVP and its Protestant allies. In response to the growing power of the New Left group, a group of older, [[centrism|centrist]] party members, led by Willem Drees' son, [[Willem Drees, Jr.]] founded the New Right. They split in 1970, after it was clear that they had lost the conflict with the New Left, and founded a new moderate Social Democratic party, [[Democratic Socialists '70]] (DS70).\n\nUnder the New Left, the PvdA started a strategy of polarisation, striving for a cabinet based on a progressive majority in parliament. In order to form that cabinet the PvdA allied itself with the [[social liberalism|social liberal]] party [[Democrats 66]] (D66) and the progressive Christian [[Political Party of Radicals]] (PPR). The alliance was called the Progressive Accord (PAK). In the [[1971 Dutch general election|1971]] and [[1972 Dutch general election|1972 elections]], these three parties promised to form a cabinet with a radical common programme after the elections. They were unable to gain a majority in either election. In 1971, they were kept out of cabinet, and the party of former PvdA members, DS70, became a partner of the [[First Biesheuvel cabinet]].\n\nIn the 1972 elections, neither the PvdA and its allies or the KVP and its allies were able to gain a majority. The two sides were forced to work together. [[Joop den Uyl]], the leader of the PvdA, led the cabinet. The cabinet was an [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|extra-parliamentary cabinet]] and it was composed of members of the three progressive parties and members of the KVP and the ARP. The cabinet attempted to radically reform government, society and the economy, and a wide range of progressive social reforms were enacted during its time in office, such as significant increases in welfare payments and the indexation of benefits and the minimum wage to the cost of living.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2exQnhFNyYC&pg=PA235|title=Recasting European Welfare States|first1=Maurizio|last1=Ferrera|first2=Martin|last2=Rhodes|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780714651040}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it also faced economic decline and was riddled with personal and ideological conflicts. Especially, the relationship between Prime Minister Den Uyl and the KVP [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]], [[Dries Van Agt|Van Agt]] was very problematic. The conflict culminated just before the 1977 elections, the cabinet fell. The [[1977 Dutch general election|1977 general election]] were won by the PvdA, but the ideological and personal conflict between Van Agt and Den Uyl prevented the formation of a new centre-left cabinet. After very long cabinet formation talks, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA), itself a new [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] political formation composed of KVP, CHU and ARP, formed government with the VVD, based on a very narrow majority. The PvdA was left in opposition.\n\nIn the [[1981 Dutch general election|1981 general election]], the incumbent CDA-VVD cabinet lost their majority. The CDA remained the largest party, but it was forced to co-operate with the PvdA and D66 (the PPR had left the alliance, after losing the 1977 elections). In the new cabinet led by Van Agt, Den Uyl returned to cabinet, now as Deputy Prime Minister. The personal and ideological conflict between Van Agt and Den Uyl culminated in the fall of the cabinet just months after it was formed. The VVD and the CDA regained their majority in the [[1982 Dutch general election|1982 general election]] and retained it in the [[1986 Dutch general election|1986 general election]]. The PvdA was left in opposition. During this period, the party began to reform. In 1986, Den Uyl left politics, appointing former [[trade union]] leader [[Wim Kok]] as his successor.\n\n[[File:Wim Kok 1994.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Wim Kok]], Leader from 1986 until 2001, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1994 until 2002]]\n\n===1989\u20132010===\nAfter the [[1989 Dutch general election|1989 general election]], the PvdA returned to cabinet together with the CDA. Kok became Deputy Prime Minister to CDA leader [[Ruud Lubbers]]. The PvdA accepted the major economic reforms the previous Lubbers cabinets made, including [[privatization|privatisation]] of [[Government-owned corporation|public enterprise]]s and [[welfare reform|reform of the welfare state]]. They continued these policies in this cabinet. The cabinet faced heavy protest from the unions and saw major political conflict within the PvdA itself.\n\nIn the [[1994 Dutch general election|1994 general election]], the PvdA and CDA coalition lost its majority in parliament. The PvdA, however, emerged as the biggest party. Kok formed a government together with the conservative liberal VVD and social liberal D66. The so-called ''[[purple (government)|purple government]]'' was a political novelty, because it was the first since 1918 without any ministers from the CDA or its predecessors. The [[First Kok cabinet]] continued the Lubbers-era economic reforms, but combined this with a progressive outlook on ethical questions and promises of political reform. Kok became a very popular Prime Minister; he was not a partisan figure but combined successful [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] policies with the charisma of a national leader. In the [[1998 Dutch general election|1998 general election]], the cabinet was rewarded for its stewardship of the economy. The PvdA and the VVD increased their seats, at the cost of D66; the [[Second Kok cabinet]] was formed.\n\nThe PvdA was expected to perform very well in the [[2002 Dutch general election|2002 general election]]. Kok left politics leaving the leadership of the party to his preferred successor [[Ad Melkert]]. But the political rise of [[Pim Fortuyn]] frustrated these hopes. The PvdA lost the 2002 elections, and the party's parliamentary representation fell from 45 seats to 23. The loss was blamed on the uncharismatic new leader Melkert, the perceived arrogance of the PvdA and the inability to answer to the [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] issues Fortuyn raised, especially [[immigration]] and [[Racial integration|integration]]. Melkert resigned as party leader and was replaced by [[Jeltje van Nieuwenhoven]]. The PvdA was kept out of cabinet. The government formed by CDA, VVD and the [[Pim Fortuyn List]] (LPF) fell after a very short period.\n\n[[File:Bos Dutch politician kabinet Balkenende IV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Wouter Bos]], Leader from 2002 until 2010]]\n\nMeanwhile, [[Wouter Bos]], [[Undersecretary]] in the [[second Kok cabinet|second purple cabinet]], was elected leader of the PvdA in a referendum among PvdA members, being elected closely to [[Jouke de Vries]]. He started to democratise the party organisation and began an ideological reorientation. In the [[2003 Dutch general election|2003 general election]], Wouter Bos managed to regain almost all seats lost in the previous election, and the PvdA was once again the second largest party in the Netherlands, only slightly smaller than the CDA. Personal and ideological conflicts between Bos and the CDA leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] prevented the formation of a CDA-PvdA cabinet. Instead, the PvdA was kept out of government by the formation of cabinet of the CDA, the VVD, and D66, the latter being former allies of PvdA. In the [[2006 Dutch municipal elections|2006 municipal elections]], the renewed PvdA performed very well. The PvdA became by far the largest party nationally, while the three governing parties lost a considerable number of seats in municipal councils.\n\nPvdA party lost the race for [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] to the CDA after suffering a loss of 9 seats in the [[2006 Dutch general election|2006 general election]]. The PvdA now held only 33 seats, losing many votes to the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] (SP). The PvdA had previously distanced themselves from the idea of a voting bloc on the left. It did, however, join the [[fourth Balkenende cabinet]] on 22 February 2007, in which Wouter Bos became [[Ministry of Finance (Netherlands)|minister of Finance]]. In the aftermath of the lost elections, the entire party executive stepped down on 26 April 2007. On Saturday 20 February 2010, the Labour Party withdrew from the government after arguments over the Dutch role in [[Afghanistan]].\n\n===Since 2010===\nAfter withdrawing from the government, Wouter Bos announced he would leave politics to spend more time with his wife and two daughters. Then mayor of Amsterdam, [[Job Cohen]], took his place as leader of the PvdA. In the [[2010 Dutch general election|2010 election]], the PvdA won 30 seats, a loss of three, and were narrowly overtaken by the VVD. After the election, a \"Purple Coalition\" was considered \u2013 it would have required a fourth party in addition to the VVD, PvdA and D66 \u2013 but talks broke down and the PvdA entered opposition.\n\n[[File:Lodewijk Asscher 2015 (1).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lodewijk Asscher]], Leader since 2016]]\n\nCohen resigned as leader in February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/dutch-labour-party-leader-resigns|title=Dutch Labour Party leader resigns|website=RNW Media|accessdate=8 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808095205/http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/dutch-labour-party-leader-resigns|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Diederik Samsom]] was subsequently elected the party leader. In the [[2012 Dutch general election|2012 general election]], the Labour Party won 38 seats, a gain of 8, defying initial predictions that the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] would overtake them. Following the election the party entered a governing coalition with the VVD under [[Mark Rutte]], with Labour's [[Lodewijk Asscher]] becoming Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nOpinion polls suggested that popular support for the PvdA fell into a gradual decline in the years after the 2012 election. The party was polled as low as 5% by ''Peil'' on 8 May 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.noties.nl/v/get.php?a=peil.nl&s=weekpoll&f=2016-05-08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512194452/https://www.noties.nl/v/get.php?a=peil.nl&s=weekpoll&f=2016-05-08.pdf |archivedate=12 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagelijksestandaard.nl/2016/05/tijd-voor-een-revolutie-in-de-politiek-gros-burgemeesters-heeft-niets-met-het-volk/|title=Tijd voor een revolutie in de politiek: gros burgemeesters heeft niets met het volk|date=9 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510105552/http://www.dagelijksestandaard.nl/2016/05/tijd-voor-een-revolutie-in-de-politiek-gros-burgemeesters-heeft-niets-met-het-volk/|archivedate=10 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In December 2016 Samson was defeated by [[Lodewijk Asscher]] in a party leadership election.\n\nIn the [[2017 Dutch general election|Dutch general election of 2017]], the PvdA suffered the biggest defeat in Dutch electoral history, receiving only 5.7% of the votes and losing 29 of its 38 seats. Asscher did not resign from his post, claiming the defeat was his predecessor's responsibility. The party experienced a degree of revival in 2019, obtaining the most votes in [[2019 European Parliament election in the Netherlands|that year's European Parliament election]]. This marked the first time the PvdA has finished on top in a national election since [[1998 Dutch general election|1998]].\n\n==Ideology==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nThe PvdA began as a traditional [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, committed to building a [[welfare state]]. During the 1970s, it radicalised its programme and included new issues, such as women's liberation, environmental conservation and Third World development. During the 1990s, it moderated its programme to include [[third way]] economic and social positions, including reform of the welfare state and privatisation of public enterprise. In 2005, the party adopted a new programme of principles, expressing a [[centre-left]] ideology. Its core issues are [[employment]], [[social security]] and [[welfare]], and investing in public [[education]], [[public safety]] and [[health care]].\n\n==Electorate==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nHistorically, the PvdA was supported by the [[working class]]. Currently the party is supported relatively well by [[civil servant]]s, [[Migrant worker|migrants]], and the elder working class.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The party has historically been very

protest 20041002.JPG|thumb|right|200px|PvdA activists in a demonstration in October 2004]]\n\nThe highest organ of the PvdA is the [[Party Congress|Congress]], formed by delegates from the municipal branches. It convenes once every year. It appoints the party board, decides the order of candidates on electoral lists for the Senate, House of Representatives and European Parliament and has the final say over the party programme. Since 2002, a [[referendum]] of all members has partially replaced the Congress. Both the [[lijsttrekker]] of the House of Representatives candidate list, who is the political leader of the party, and the party chairman, who leads the party organisation, are selected by such a referendum. In 2002, Wouter Bos won the [[2002 PvdA leadership election|PvdA leadership election]].\n\n===Members===\nThe PvdA has 45,040 members.<ref name=\"auto\"/> They are organised in over 500 municipal branches.\n\n===Linked organisations===\nThe [[Young Socialists (Netherlands)|Young Socialists in the PvdA]] is the youth organisation of the PvdA. It is a member of [[Young European Socialists]] and the [[International Union of Socialist Youth]]. They publish the periodical ''Lava''.\n\n''Rood'' is the party periodical. It appears eight times a year.\n\nThe scientific institute (or [[think tank]]) of the PvdA is the [[Wiardi Beckman Stichting|Wiardi Beckman Foundation]]. It publishes the periodical ''Socialisme & Democratie''.\n\nThe PvdA participates in the [[Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy]], a democracy assistance organisation of seven Dutch political parties.\n\n===International organisations===\nThe PvdA is a full member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] and was formerly an observer member of the [[Socialist International]] until December 2014, having previously downgraded their membership in December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pvda.nl/berichten/2012/12/PvdA+steunt+oprichting+Progressive+Alliance|title=PvdA steunt oprichting Progressive Alliance|website=PvdA \u2013 Partij van de Arbeid|accessdate=8 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924083343/http://www.pvda.nl/berichten/2012/12/PvdA+steunt+oprichting+Progressive+Alliance|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The PvdA joined the [[Progressive Alliance]], a new international network for social democratic political parties, at its founding event on 22 May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pvda.nl/berichten/2013/05/Progressive+Alliance+opgericht+in+Leipzig/|title=Progressive Alliance opgericht in Leipzig \u2013 PvdA|date=24 May 2013|website=pvda.nl|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224054121/http://www.pvda.nl/berichten/2013/05/Progressive+Alliance+opgericht+in+Leipzig|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Pillarised organisations===\nDuring the period of strong [[pillarisation]] the PvdA had strong links with the social democratic broadcasting organisation [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA Broadcasting Association]], the [[Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen|Dutch Association of Trade Unions]], and the paper ''[[Het Vrije Volk]]''.\n\n===Relationships to other parties===\nHistorically, the PvdA has co-operated in cabinets with the Christian democratic [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA), [[Political Party of Radicals]] (PPR), [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP), [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP), [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) and [[Christian Union (Netherlands)|ChristianUnion]] (CU) parties and the liberal parties [[Democrats 66]] (D66) and [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD). Between 1971 and 1977, PvdA was allied with D66 and the PPR. After 1977 until 1989, it was closely allied to D66. Since 2003, the relationship between the PvdA and D66 has considerably worsened, at first because PvdA was in opposition to the [[second Balkenende cabinet]] which D66 had co-operated in.\n\nDuring the governance of the [[second Balkenende cabinet|second]] and [[third Balkenende cabinet]], the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] and [[GroenLinks|GreenLeft]] were calling for closer cooperation with the PvdA, calling to form a shadow government against the Balkenende cabinet, PvdA leader Bos held this off.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n[[File:Lodewijk Asscher 2012 (1).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lodewijk Asscher]], Leader in the House of Representatives since 2016]]\n[[File:8.

In the [[European Parliament]], where the Labour Party has 6 seats, it is part of the parliamentary group [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\n===1946\u20131965===\n[[File:Willem Drees 1958.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Willem Drees]], co-Founder and Leader from 1946 until 1958, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1948 until 1958]]\n\nDuring the [[Netherlands in World War II|German Occupation of the Netherlands]] in the [[Second World War]] a group of prominent Dutchmen of all democratic political ideologies were interned as hostages in [[Gymnasium Beekvliet|St. Michielsgestel]] by the German occupation authorities. They came to the consensus that the pre-war fragmentation of Dutch political life, known as \"[[Pillarization]],\" should be overcome after the war in a so-called [[Breakthrough (Dutch political history)|''doorbraak'']]. These people formed the [[Nederlandse Volksbeweging|Dutch People's Movement]] (NVB) immediately after the war ended in 1945. The new movement promoted the foundation of the Labour Party (''Partij van de Arbeid - PvdA'')) on 9 February 1946, through a merger of three pre-war parties: the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (SDAP), the social liberal [[Free-thinking Democratic League]] (VDB) and progressive-Protestant [[Christian Democratic Union (Netherlands)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU).<ref name=\"Moldenhauer2001\">{{cite book|author=Gebhard Moldenhauer|title=Die Niederlande und Deutschland: einander kennen und verstehen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vm_h-NPz1T8C&pg=PA113|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|isbn=978-3-89325-747-8|page=113}}</ref> They were joined by individuals from [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Resistance during World War II|resistance group]] ''Christofoor'', as well as some of the more progressive members of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] parties [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) and [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP). The founding Congress was chaired by NVB-member [[Willem Banning]].\n\nThe founders of the PvdA wanted to create a [[Big tent|broad party]], breaking with the historic tradition of pillarisation. The party combined [[socialism|socialist]]s with [[Liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Christian left|progressive Christian]]s.<ref name=\"Notermans2001\">{{cite book|author=Ton Notermans|title=Social Democracy and Monetary Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKQB3czNk1oC&pg=PA226|date=January 2001|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-806-5|page=226}}</ref> However, the party was unable to break pillarisation. Instead the new party renewed the close ties that the SDAP had with other socialist organisations (see [[#Linked organisations|linked organisations]]). In 1948 some of the left-liberal members, led by former VDB leader [[Pieter Oud]], left the PvdA after concluding it had become too socialist for their liking. Together with the [[Freedom Party (Netherlands)|Freedom Party]], they formed the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD), a [[conservative liberalism|conservative liberal]] party.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1958, the PvdA led [[coalition government]]s with the [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP), and combinations of VVD, ARP and CHU, with the PvdA's [[Willem Drees]] as prime minister. The KVP and the PvdA together had a large majority in parliament. Under his leadership the Netherlands recovered from the war, began to build its [[welfare state]]  and [[Indonesia]] became [[Indonesian National Revolution|independent]].\n\nAfter the cabinet crisis of 1958, the PvdA was replaced by the VVD. The PvdA was in opposition until 1965. The electoral support of PvdA voters began to decline.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n[[File:Joop den Uyl 1975.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Joop den Uyl]], Leader from 1966 until 1986, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1973 until 1977]]\n\nIn 1965 a conflict in the KVP-ARP-CHU-VVD cabinet made continuation of the government impossible. The three [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessional]], Christian-influenced parties turned towards the PvdA. Together they formed the [[Cals cabinet]], with KVP leader [[Jo Cals]] as prime minister. This cabinet was also short lived and conflict ridden. The conflicts culminated in the fall of the Cals cabinet over [[economic policy]].\n\nMeanwhile, a younger generation was attempting to gain control of the PvdA. A group of young PvdA members, calling themselves the [[New Left (Netherlands)|New Left]], changed the party. The New Left believed the party should become oriented towards the [[new social movements]], adopting their anti-parliamentary strategies and their issues, such as [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]], [[environmentalism|environment]]al conservation and [[Third World]] development. Prominent New Left members were [[Jan Nagel]], [[Andr\u00e9 van der Louw]] and [[Bram Peper]]. One of their early victories followed the fall of the Cals cabinet. The party Congress adopted a motion that made it impossible for the PvdA to govern with the KVP and its Protestant allies. In response to the growing power of the New Left group, a group of older, [[centrism|centrist]] party members, led by Willem Drees' son, [[Willem Drees, Jr.]] founded the New Right. They split in 1970, after it was clear that they had lost the conflict with the New Left, and founded a new moderate Social Democratic party, [[Democratic Socialists '70]] (DS70).\n\nUnder the New Left, the PvdA started a strategy of polarisation, striving for a cabinet based on a progressive majority in parliament. In order to form that cabinet the PvdA allied itself with the [[social liberalism|social liberal]] party [[Democrats 66]] (D66) and the progressive Christian [[Political Party of Radicals]] (PPR). The alliance was called the Progressive Accord (PAK). In the [[1971 Dutch general election|1971]] and [[1972 Dutch general election|1972 elections]], these three parties promised to form a cabinet with a radical common programme after the elections. They were unable to gain a majority in either election. In 1971, they were kept out of cabinet, and the party of former PvdA members, DS70, became a partner of the [[First Biesheuvel cabinet]].\n\nIn the 1972 elections, neither the PvdA and its allies or the KVP and its allies were able to gain a majority. The two sides were forced to work together. [[Joop den Uyl]], the leader of the PvdA, led the cabinet. The cabinet was an [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|extra-parliamentary cabinet]] and it was composed of members of the three progressive parties and members of the KVP and the ARP. The cabinet attempted to radically reform government, society and the economy, and a wide range of progressive social reforms were enacted during its time in office, such as significant increases in welfare payments and the indexation of benefits and the minimum wage to the cost of living.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2exQnhFNyYC&pg=PA235|title=Recasting European Welfare States|first1=Maurizio|last1=Ferrera|first2=Martin|last2=Rhodes|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780714651040}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it also faced economic decline and was riddled with personal and ideological conflicts. Especially, the relationship between Prime Minister Den Uyl and the KVP [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]], [[Dries Van Agt|Van Agt]] was very problematic. The conflict culminated just before the 1977 elections, the cabinet fell. The [[1977 Dutch general election|1977 general election]] were won by the PvdA, but the ideological and personal conflict between Van Agt and Den Uyl prevented the formation of a new centre-left cabinet. After very long cabinet formation talks, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA), itself a new [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] political formation composed of KVP, CHU and ARP, formed government with the VVD, based on a very narrow majority. The PvdA was left in opposition.\n\nIn the [[1981 Dutch general election|1981 general election]], the incumbent CDA-VVD cabinet lost their majority. The CDA remained the largest party, but it was forced to co-operate with the PvdA and D66 (the PPR had left the alliance, after losing the 1977 elections). In the new cabinet led by Van Agt, Den Uyl returned to cabinet, now as Deputy Prime Minister. The personal and ideological conflict between Van Agt and Den Uyl culminated in the fall of the cabinet just months after it was formed. The VVD and the CDA regained their majority in the [[1982 Dutch general election|1982 general election]] and retained it in the [[1986 Dutch general election|1986 general election]]. The PvdA was left in opposition. During this period, the party began to reform. In 1986, Den Uyl left politics, appointing former [[trade union]] leader [[Wim Kok]] as his successor.\n\n[[File:Wim Kok 1994.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Wim Kok]], Leader from 1986 until 2001, [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] from 1994 until 2002]]\n\n===1989\u20132010===\nAfter the [[1989 Dutch general election|1989 general election]], the PvdA returned to cabinet together with the CDA. Kok became Deputy Prime Minister to CDA leader [[Ruud Lubbers]]. The PvdA accepted the major economic reforms the previous Lubbers cabinets made, including [[privatization|privatisation]] of [[Government-owned corporation|public enterprise]]s and [[welfare reform|reform of the welfare state]]. They continued these policies in this cabinet. The cabinet faced heavy protest from the unions and saw major political conflict within the PvdA itself.\n\nIn the [[1994 Dutch general election|1994 general election]], the PvdA and CDA coalition lost its majority in parliament. The PvdA, however, emerged as the biggest party. Kok formed a government together with the conservative liberal VVD and social liberal D66. The so-called ''[[purple (government)|purple government]]'' was a political novelty, because it was the first since 1918 without any ministers from the CDA or its predecessors. The [[First Kok cabinet]] continued the Lubbers-era economic reforms, but combined this with a progressive outlook on ethical questions and promises of political reform. Kok became a very popular Prime Minister; he was not a partisan figure but combined successful [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] policies with the charisma of a national leader. In the [[1998 Dutch general election|1998 general election]], the cabinet was rewarded for its stewardship of the economy. The PvdA and the VVD increased their seats, at the cost of D66; the [[Second Kok cabinet]] was formed.\n\nThe PvdA was expected to perform very well in the [[2002 Dutch general election|2002 general election]]. Kok left politics leaving the leadership of the party to his preferred successor [[Ad Melkert]]. But the political rise of [[Pim Fortuyn]] frustrated these hopes. The PvdA lost the 2002 elections, and the party's parliamentary representation fell from 45 seats to 23. The loss was blamed on the uncharismatic new leader Melkert, the perceived arrogance of the PvdA and the inability to answer to the [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] issues Fortuyn raised, especially [[immigration]] and [[Racial integration|integration]]. Melkert resigned as party leader and was replaced by [[Jeltje van Nieuwenhoven]]. The PvdA was kept out of cabinet. The government formed by CDA, VVD and the [[Pim Fortuyn List]] (LPF) fell after a very short period.\n\n[[File:Bos Dutch politician kabinet Balkenende IV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Wouter Bos]], Leader from 2002 until 2010]]\n\nMeanwhile, [[Wouter Bos]], [[Undersecretary]] in the [[second Kok cabinet|second purple cabinet]], was elected leader of the PvdA in a referendum among PvdA members, being elected closely to [[Jouke de Vries]]. He started to democratise the party organisation and began an ideological reorientation. In the [[2003 Dutch general election|2003 general election]], Wouter Bos managed to regain almost all seats lost in the previous election, and the PvdA was once again the second largest party in the Netherlands, only slightly smaller than the CDA. Personal and ideological conflicts between Bos and the CDA leader [[Jan Peter Balkenende]] prevented the formation of a CDA-PvdA cabinet. Instead, the PvdA was kept out of government by the formation of cabinet of the CDA, the VVD, and D66, the latter being former allies of PvdA. In the [[2006 Dutch municipal elections|2006 municipal elections]], the renewed PvdA performed very well. The PvdA became by far the largest party nationally, while the three governing parties lost a considerable number of seats in municipal councils.\n\nPvdA party lost the race for [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]] to the CDA after suffering a loss of 9 seats in the [[2006 Dutch general election|2006 general election]]. The PvdA now held only 33 seats, losing many votes to the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] (SP). The PvdA had previously distanced themselves from the idea of a voting bloc on the left. It did, however, join the [[fourth Balkenende cabinet]] on 22 February 2007, in which Wouter Bos became [[Ministry of Finance (Netherlands)|minister of Finance]]. In the aftermath of the lost elections, the entire party executive stepped down on 26 April 2007. On Saturday 20 February 2010, the Labour Party withdrew from the government after arguments over the Dutch role in [[Afghanistan]].\n\n===Since 2010===\nAfter withdrawing from the government, Wouter Bos announced he would leave politics to spend more time with his wife and two daughters. Then mayor of Amsterdam, [[Job Cohen]], took his place as leader of the PvdA. In the [[2010 Dutch general election|2010 election]], the PvdA won 30 seats, a loss of three, and were narrowly overtaken by the VVD. After the election, a \"Purple Coalition\" was considered - it would have required a fourth party in addition to the VVD, PvdA and D66 - but talks broke down and the PvdA entered opposition.\n\n[[File:Lodewijk Asscher 2015 (1).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lodewijk Asscher]], Leader since 2016]]\n\nCohen resigned as leader in February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/dutch-labour-party-leader-resigns|title=Dutch Labour Party leader resigns|website=RNW Media|accessdate=8 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808095205/http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/dutch-labour-party-leader-resigns|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Diederik Samsom]] was subsequently elected the party leader. In the [[2012 Dutch general election|2012 general election]], the Labour Party won 38 seats, a gain of 8, defying initial predictions that the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] would overtake them. Following the election the party entered a governing coalition with the VVD under [[Mark Rutte]], with Labour's [[Lodewijk Asscher]] becoming Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nOpinion polls suggested that popular support for the PvdA fell into a gradual decline in the years after the 2012 election. The party was polled as low as 5% by ''Peil'' on 8 May 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.noties.nl/v/get.php?a=peil.nl&s=weekpoll&f=2016-05-08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512194452/https://www.noties.nl/v/get.php?a=peil.nl&s=weekpoll&f=2016-05-08.pdf |archivedate=12 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagelijksestandaard.nl/2016/05/tijd-voor-een-revolutie-in-de-politiek-gros-burgemeesters-heeft-niets-met-het-volk/|title=Tijd voor een revolutie in de politiek: gros burgemeesters heeft niets met het volk|date=9 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510105552/http://www.dagelijksestandaard.nl/2016/05/tijd-voor-een-revolutie-in-de-politiek-gros-burgemeesters-heeft-niets-met-het-volk/|archivedate=10 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In December 2016 Samson was defeated by [[Lodewijk Asscher]] in a party leadership election.\n\nIn the [[2017 Dutch general election|Dutch general election of 2017]], the PvdA suffered the biggest defeat in Dutch electoral history, receiving only 5.7% of the votes and losing 29 of its 38 seats. Asscher did not resign from his post, claiming the defeat was his predecessor's responsibility. The party experienced a degree of revival in 2019, obtaining the most votes in [[2019 European Parliament election in the Netherlands|that year's European Parliament election]]. This marked the first time the PvdA has finished on top in a national election since [[1998 Dutch general election|1998]].\n\n==Ideology==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}\nThe PvdA began as a traditional [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, committed to building a [[welfare state]]. During the 1970s, it radicalised its programme and included new issues, such as women's liberation, environmental conservation and Third World development. During the 1990s, it moderated its programme to include [[third way]] economic and social positions, including reform of the welfare state and privatisation of public enterprise. In 2005, the party adopted a new programme of principles, expressing a [[centre-left]] ideology. Its core issues are [[employment]], [[social security]] and [[welfare]], and investing in public [[education]], [[public safety]] and [[health care]].\n\n==Electorate==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nHistorically, the PvdA was supported by the [[working class]]. Currently the party is supported relatively well by [[civil servant]]s, [[Migrant worker|migrants]], and the elder working class.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The party has historically been very strong in the major cities, such as [[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]], and in the northern provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Friesland]] and [[Drenthe]].\n\n== Organisation ==\n{{More

branches. It convenes once every year. It appoints the party board, decides the order of candidates on electoral lists for the Senate, House of Representatives and European Parliament and has the final say over the party programme. Since 2002, a [[referendum]] of all members has partially replaced the Congress. Both the [[lijsttrekker]] of the House of Representatives candidate list, who is the political leader of the party, and the party chairman, who leads the party organisation, are selected by such a referendum.

Between 1971 and 1977, PvdA was allied with D66 and the PPR. After 1977 until 1989, it was closely allied to D66. Since 2003, the relationship between the PvdA and D66 has considerably worsened, at first because PvdA was in opposition to the [[second Balkenende cabinet]] which D66 had co-operated in.\n\nDuring the governance of the [[second Balkenende cabinet|second]] and [[third Balkenende cabinet]], the [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Socialist Party]] and [[GroenLinks|GreenLeft]] were calling for closer cooperation with the PvdA, calling to form a shadow government against the Balkenende cabinet, PvdA leader Bos held this off.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n[[File:Lodewijk Asscher 2012 (1).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Lodewijk Asscher]], Leader in the House of Representatives since 2016]]\n[[File:8.
