For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.\n\nAirway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.\n\n===CPR===\nThe basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].\n\nIn this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.\n\nIn the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.\n\nPreviously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.  However, some trainers now use the C to mean Compressions in their basic first aid training.\n\n== Airway ==\n{{main article|airway management}}\n\n=== Unconscious patients ===\nIn the unconscious patient, the priority is [[airway management]], to avoid a preventable cause of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  Common problems with the airway of patient with a seriously reduced level of consciousness involve blockage of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] by the [[tongue]], a [[foreign body]], or [[vomiting|vomit]].\n\nAt a basic level, opening of the airway is achieved through manual movement of the head using [[basic airway management|various techniques]], with the most widely taught and used being the \"head tilt \u2014 chin lift\", although other methods such as the \"modified [[jaw thrust]]\" can be used, especially where spinal injury is suspected,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement|title=Airway Management|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021030909/http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement| archivedate= 21 October 2008| url-status= dead}}</ref> although in some countries, its use is not recommended for lay rescuers for safety reasons.<ref name=rsukbls>{{cite journal|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|title=Adult Basic Life Support|journal=Resuscitation UK Guidelines|publisher=Resuscitaton Council (UK)|page=14|accessdate=2008-12-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202034805/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|archivedate=2 December 2005}}</ref>\n\nHigher level practitioners such as [[emergency medical service]] personnel may use more [[invasive airway management|advanced techniques]], from [[oropharyngeal airway]]s to [[intubation]], as deemed necessary.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Grande, Christopher M. |author2=S\u00f8reide, Eldar |title=Prehospital trauma care |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=2001 |pages=211 |isbn=978-0-8247-0537-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Conscious patients===\nIn the conscious patient, other signs of airway obstruction that may be considered by the rescuer include paradoxical chest movements, use of accessory muscles for breathing, tracheal deviation, noisy air entry or exit, and [[cyanosis]].<ref name=rsukils>{{cite book|title=Immediate Life Support|publisher=Resuscitation Council(UK)|author1=Soar, J |author2=Nolan, J|author3= Perkins, G|author4= Scott, M|author5= Goodman, N|author6= Mitchell, S|year=2006|isbn=978-1-903812-12-9}}</ref>\n\n== Breathing ==\n\n===Unconscious patients===\nIn the unconscious patient, after the airway is opened the next area to assess is the patient's breathing,<ref name=rsukbls/> primarily to find if the patient is making normal respiratory efforts.

If any of these deviate from normal, this may indicate an underlying problem (such as with [[Cheyne-Stokes respiration]])\n* Chest deformity and movement - The chest should rise and fall equally on both sides, and should be free of deformity.  Clinicians may be able to get a working diagnosis from abnormal movement or shape of the chest in cases such as [[pneumothorax]] or [[haemothorax]]\n* Listening to external breath sounds a short distance from the patient can reveal dysfunction such as a rattling noise (indicative of secretions in the airway) or [[stridor]] (which indicates airway obstruction)\n* Checking for [[surgical emphysema]] which is air in the subcutaneous layer which is suggestive of a [[pneumothorax]]\n* [[Auscultation]] and [[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]] of the chest by using a [[stethoscope]] to listen for normal chest sounds or any abnormalities\n* Pulse oximetry may be useful in assessing the amount of oxygen present in the blood, and by inference the effectiveness of the breathing\n\n== Circulation ==\nOnce oxygen can be delivered to the lungs by a clear airway and efficient breathing, there needs to be a circulation to deliver it to the rest of the body.\n\n===Non-breathing patients===\nCirculation is the original meaning of the \"C\" as laid down by Jude, Knickerbocker & Safar, and was intended to suggest assessing the presence or absence of circulation, usually by taking a [[carotid]] [[pulse]], before taking any further treatment steps.\n\nIn modern protocols for lay persons, this step is omitted as it has been proven that lay rescuers may have difficulty in accurately determining the presence or absence of a pulse, and that, in any case, there is less risk of harm by performing chest compressions on a beating heart than failing to perform them when the heart is not beating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cjstudios.com/Aquatics/new_cpr_standards.htm|title=New CPR Standards|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> For this reason, lay rescuers proceed directly to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, starting with chest compressions, which is effectively artificial circulation.

This can be performed peripherally, usually on a fingernail bed, or centrally, usually on the sternum or forehead\n* Pulse checks, both centrally and peripherally, assessing rate (normally 60-80 beats per minute in a resting adult), regularity, strength, and equality between different pulses\n* Blood pressure measurements can be taken to assess for signs of shock\n* Auscultation of the heart can be undertaken by medical professionals\n* Observation for secondary signs of circulatory failure such as edema or frothing from the mouth (indicative of congestive heart failure)\n* ECG monitoring will allow the healthcare professional to help diagnose underlying heart conditions, including [[myocardial infractions]]\n\n== Variations ==\nNearly all first aid organisations use \"ABC\" in some form, but some incorporate it as part of a larger initialism, ranging from the simple 'ABCD' (designed for training lay responders in defibrillation) to 'AcBCDEEEFG'{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (the UK ambulance service version for patient assessment).\n\n===ABCD===\nThere are several protocols taught which add a D to the end of the simpler ABC (or DR ABC).

For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.\n\nAirway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.\n\n===CPR===\nThe basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].\n\nIn this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.\n\nIn the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.\n\nPreviously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.

Clinicians may be able to get a working diagnosis from abnormal movement or shape of the chest in cases such as [[pneumothorax]] or [[haemothorax]]\n* Listening to external breath sounds a short distance from the patient can reveal dysfunction such as a rattling noise (indicative of secretions in the airway) or [[stridor]] (which indicates airway obstruction)\n* Checking for [[surgical emphysema]] which is air in the subcutaneous layer which is suggestive of a [[pneumothorax]]\n* [[Auscultation]] and [[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]] of the chest by using a [[stethoscope]] to listen for normal chest sounds or any abnormalities\n* Pulse oximetry may be useful in assessing the amount of oxygen present in the blood, and by inference the effectiveness of the breathing\n\n== Circulation ==\nOnce oxygen can be delivered to the lungs by a clear airway and efficient breathing, there needs to be a circulation to deliver it to the rest of the body.\n\n===Non-breathing patients===\nCirculation is the original meaning of the \"C\" as laid down by Jude, Knickerbocker & Safar, and was intended to suggest assessing the presence or absence of circulation, usually by taking a [[carotid]] [[pulse]], before taking any further treatment steps.\n\nIn modern protocols for lay persons, this step is omitted as it has been proven that lay rescuers may have difficulty in accurately determining the presence or absence of a pulse, and that, in any case, there is less risk of harm by performing chest compressions on a beating heart than failing to perform them when the heart is not beating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cjstudios.com/Aquatics/new_cpr_standards.htm|title=New CPR Standards|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> For this reason, lay rescuers proceed directly to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, starting with chest compressions, which is effectively artificial circulation.

This can be performed peripherally, usually on a fingernail bed, or centrally, usually on the sternum or forehead\n* Pulse checks, both centrally and peripherally, assessing rate (normally 60-80 beats per minute in a resting adult), regularity, strength, and equality between different pulses\n* Blood pressure measurements can be taken to assess for signs of shock\n* Auscultation of the heart can be undertaken by medical professionals\n* Observation for secondary signs of circulatory failure such as edema or frothing from the mouth (indicative of congestive heart failure)\n* ECG monitoring will allow the healthcare professional to help diagnose underlying heart conditions, including [[myocardial infractions]]\n\n== Variations ==\nNearly all first aid organisations use \"ABC\" in some form, but some incorporate it as part of a larger initialism, ranging from the simple 'ABCD' (designed for training lay responders in defibrillation) to 'AcBCDEEEFG'{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (the UK ambulance service version for patient assessment).\n\n===ABCD===\nThere are several protocols taught which add a D to the end of the simpler ABC (or DR ABC).

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]] ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum after killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates. It was the intention of writer Joseph Stefano to make her at a young age as attractive as Norman had been in the first film.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBQyz8dBaEU PSYCHO LEGACY Facebook Clip 8 - Olivia Hussey on Mother]</ref>\n\nWhen [[Henry Thomas]] was cast as young [[Norman Bates]], Perkins wanted to meet with him and discuss the role. In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original. He describes it as a \"Slow, stilted, completely pointless scene-for-scene remake of the Hitchcock classic (with a few awkward new touches to taint its claim as an exact replica.)\" He ultimately calls it \"an insult, rather than a tribute to a landmark film.\"{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Continuity===\nWhile ''Bates Motel'' (1987) was a partial continuation of the series as it continued from where ''Psycho'' left off, it ignored the continuity of ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'', and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' due to the death of Norman Bates in the film and the fact that Bates is deemed sane and returns to the Bates Motel in ''Psycho II''. ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]] ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum after killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth.

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

With a budget of over $27 billion, USAID is one of the [[List of development aid country donors|largest official aid agencies]] in the world, and accounts for more than half of all U.S. foreign assistance\u2014the highest in the world in absolute dollar terms.\n\nCongress passed the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] on September 4, 1961, which reorganized U.S. foreign assistance programs and mandated the creation of an agency to administer economic aid. USAID was subsequently established by the [[executive order]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], who sought to unite several existing foreign assistance organizations and programs under one agency.<ref>{{cite web|title=USAID HISTORY|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/usaid-history|website=usaid.gov|publisher=USAID|accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref> USAID became the first U.S. foreign assistance organization whose primary focus was long-term socioeconomic development.\n\nUSAID's programs are authorized by Congress in the [[Foreign Assistance Act]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/400/fsa.pdf |title=USAID: Automated Directives System 400 |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref> which Congress supplements through directions in annual funding appropriation acts and other legislation.

The best official statement relevant to the most recent era is contained in USAID's 2004 \"White Paper,\" which was reaffirmed in high-level USAID policy documents in 2006 and 2011.  (See the references authored by USAID, at the end of this article.)\n\nTo give a perspective of USAID's goals that is as general as possible, the list of goals in this article subsumes one of the goals from the 2004 White Paper, \"Strengthen fragile states,\" whose emphasis as understood at the time was on Iraq and Afghanistan, into a more general goal, \"U.S. national interests,\" together with one of the White Paper's other goals, \"Support strategic states.\"  State fragility is understood to be one of the development issues addressed under this article's \"Socioeconomic development\" goal.\n\nOn the other hand, the White Paper's goal, \"Provide humanitarian relief,\" is divided in this article into two goals, both of which are humanitarian: \"Disaster relief\" (which may assist victims at various income levels) and \"Poverty relief\" (which targets proverty that is chronic, not just the result of a disaster, and which does not necessarily have to be justified by developmental impact).</ref>\n\n* Disaster relief\n* Poverty relief\n* Technical cooperation on [[global issue]]s, including the environment\n* U.S. bilateral interests\n* Socioeconomic development\n\n===Disaster relief===\n[[File:USAID.jpg|thumb|right|USAID Packages are delivered by [[United States Coast Guard]] personnel]]\n\nSome of the U.S. Government's earliest foreign aid programs provided relief in crises created by war. In 1915, USG assistance through the Commission for Relief of Belgium headed by Herbert Hoover prevented starvation in Belgium after the German invasion.  After 1945, the European Recovery Program championed by Secretary of State George Marshall (the \"[[Marshall Plan]]\") helped rebuild war-torn Western Europe.\n\nUSAID manages relief efforts after wars and natural disasters through its Office of U.S Foreign Disaster Assistance in Washington D.C. Privately funded U.S. NGOs and the U.S. military also play major roles in disaster relief overseas.\n\n===Poverty relief===\n[[File:Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development (7269588282).jpg|thumb|right|Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development, USAID [[Nigeria]]]]\nAfter 1945, many newly independent countries needed assistance to relieve the chronic deprivation afflicting their low-income populations.  USAID and its predecessor agencies have continuously provided poverty relief in many forms, including assistance to public health and education services targeted at the poorest.  USAID has also helped manage food aid provided by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].  In addition, USAID provides funding to NGOs to supplement private donations in relieving chronic poverty.\n\n===Global issues===\nTechnical cooperation between nations is essential for addressing a range of cross-border concerns like communicable diseases, environmental issues, trade and investment cooperation, safety standards for traded products, money laundering, and so forth.  The USG has specialized agencies dealing with such areas, such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency.  USAID's special ability to administer programs in low-income countries supports these and other USG agencies' international work on global concerns.\n\n====Environment====\n\nAmong these global interests, environmental issues attract high attention.  USAID assists projects that conserve and protect threatened land, water, forests, and wildlife.  USAID also assists projects to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and to build resilience to the risks associated with global [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Global Climate Change: Capacity Building | publisher = [[USAID]] | url = http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | accessdate = 2014-08-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120113701/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | archivedate = 2012-01-20 }}</ref>  U.S. environmental regulation laws require that programs sponsored by USAID should be both economically and environmentally [[sustainable]].\n\n===U.S. national interests===\nTo support U.S. geopolitical interests, Congress appropriates exceptional financial assistance to allies, largely in the form of \"Economic Support Funds\" (ESF).  USAID is called on to administer the bulk (90%) of ESF<ref>Tarnoff (2015), p. 13.</ref> and is instructed \"To the maximum extent feasible, [to] provide [ESF] assistance ... consistent with the policy directions, purposes, and programs of [development assistance].\"<ref>Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as amended), Section 531.</ref>\n\nAlso, when U.S. troops are in the field, USAID can supplement the \"[[Civil Affairs]]\" programs that the U.S. military conducts to win the friendship of local populations.  In these circumstances, USAID may be directed by specially appointed diplomatic officials of the State Department, as has been done in Afghanistan and Pakistan during operations against al-Qaeda.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stabilization: Lessons from the U.S. Experience in Afghanistan |url=https://www.sigar.mil/interactive-reports/stabilization/index.html |publisher=SIGAR |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nU.S. commercial interests are served by U.S. law's requirement that most goods and services financed by USAID must be sourced from U.S. vendors.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADS Chapter 310: Source and Nationality Requirements for Procurement of Commodities and Services Financed by USAID |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/310.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Socioeconomic development===\nTo help low-income nations achieve self-sustaining socioeconomic development, USAID assists them in improving management of their own resources.  USAID's assistance for socioeconomic development mainly provides technical advice, training, scholarships, commodities, and financial assistance.  Through grants and contracts, USAID mobilizes the technical resources of the private sector, other USG agencies, universities, and NGOs to participate in this assistance.\n\nPrograms of the various types above frequently reinforce one another.  For example, the Foreign Assistance Act requires USAID to use funds appropriated for geopolitical purposes (\"Economic Support Funds\") to support socioeconomic development to the maximum extent possible.\n\n==Modes of assistance==\nUSAID delivers both technical assistance and financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/primer.html |title=USAID Primer: What We Do and How We Do It |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>\n\n===Technical assistance===\nTechnical assistance includes technical advice, training, scholarships, construction, and commodities.  Technical assistance is contracted or procured by USAID and provided in-kind to recipients.  For technical advisory services, USAID draws on experts from the private sector, mainly from the assisted country's own pool of expertise, as well as from specialized USG agencies.  Many host-government leaders have drawn on USAID's technical assistance for development of IT systems and computer hardware procurement to strengthen their institutions.\n\nTo build indigenous expertise and leadership, USAID finances scholarships to U.S. universities and assists the strengthening of developing countries' own universities.  Local universities' programs in developmentally important sectors are assisted directly and through USAID support for forming partnerships with U.S. universities.\n\nThe various forms of technical assistance are frequently coordinated as capacity building packages for development of local institutions.\n\n===Financial assistance===\n[[File:National Open Source Software Competition - USAID.jpg|thumb|National Open Source Software Competition \u2013 USAID financial assistance for groups developing technology in Indonesia]]\n\nFinancial assistance supplies cash to developing country organizations to supplement their budgets.  USAID also provides financial assistance to local and international [[NGOs]] who in turn give technical assistance in developing countries.  Although USAID formerly provided loans, all financial assistance is now provided in the form of nonreimbursable grants.\n\nIn recent years, the USG has increased its emphasis on financial rather than technical assistance.  In 2004, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Administration created the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] as a new foreign aid agency that is mainly restricted to providing financial assistance. In 2009, the Obama Administration initiated a major realignment of USAID's own programs to emphasize financial assistance, referring to it as \"government-to-government\" or \"G2G\" assistance.\n\n==Organization==\n\nUSAID is organized around country development programs managed by resident USAID offices in developing countries (\"USAID missions\"), supported by USAID's global headquarters in Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |title=USAID: Organization |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423111526/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |archive-date=2011-04-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Country development programs===\nUSAID plans its work in each country around an individual country development program managed by a resident office called a \"mission.\"  The USAID mission and its U.S. staff are guests in the country, with a status that is usually defined by a \"framework bilateral agreement\" between the USG and the host government.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 349|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/349.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 349.3.1.1|date=2003}}</ref> Framework bilaterals give the mission and its U.S. staff privileges similar to (but not necessarily the same as) those accorded to the U.S. embassy and diplomats by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 155|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1868/155.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 155.3.1.1.c|date=2004}}</ref>\n\nUSAID missions work in over fifty countries, consulting with their governments and non-governmental organizations to identify programs that will receive USAID's assistance. As part of this process, USAID missions conduct socioeconomic analysis, discuss projects with host-country leaders, design assistance to those projects, award contracts and grants, administer assistance (including evaluation and reporting), and manage flows of funds.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tarnoff|first1=Curt|title=U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID): Background, Operations, and Issues|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44117.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=July 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs countries develop and need less assistance, USAID shrinks and ultimately closes its resident missions.  USAID has closed missions in a number of countries that had achieved a substantial level of prosperity, including South Korea,<ref>{{cite web |title=South Korea: From Aid Recipient to Donor |url=https://photos.state.gov/libraries/korea/115197/kimnamhee/Korea%20case%20study%2020110615%20_corrected%2020111027%20TU_%20-%2050th.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> Turkey,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission Directory |url=https://www.usaid.gov/mission-directory |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> and Costa Rica.<ref>{{cite web |title=Costa Rica-United States Relations |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica%E2%80%93United_States_relations |publisher=Wikipedia |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=December 2019}}\n\nUSAID also closes missions when requested by host countries for political reasons.

Its mission in [[Moscow]] had been in operation for two decades.<ref>{{cite news |title=USAID mission in Russia to close following Moscow decision |first=Arshad |last=Mohammed |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/18/us-usa-russia-aid-idUSBRE88H11E20120918 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=September 18, 2012 |accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref>  On May 1, 2013, the President of [[Bolivia]], [[Evo Morales]], asked USAID to close its mission, which had worked in the country for 49 years.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bolivia's President Morales expels USAID, accused it of working against him |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/bolivias-president-morales-expels-usaid-accused-it-of-working-against-him/2013/05/01/00e1ce28-b263-11e2-9fb1-62de9581c946_story.html |agency=[[Washington Post]] |date=May 1, 2013}}</ref>  The closure was completed on September 20, 2013.\n\nUSAID missions are led by Mission Directors and are staffed both by USAID [[Foreign Service Officers]] and by development professionals from the country itself, with the host-country professionals forming the majority of the staff.  The length of a Foreign Service Officer's \"tour\" in most countries is four years, to provide enough time to develop in-depth knowledge about the country.  (Shorter tours of one or two years are usual in countries of exceptional hardship or danger.)<ref>{{cite web |title=ADS Chapter 436: Foreign Service Assignments and Tours of Duty |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1877/436.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Mission Director is a member of the U.S. Embassy's \"Country Team\" under the direction of the U.S. Ambassador.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dorman |first1=Shawn |title=Foreign Service Work and Life: Embassy, Employee, Family |url=http://afsa.org/sites/default/files/iuse_country_team_local_staff_role.pdf |publisher=American Foreign Service Association |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>  As a USAID mission works in an unclassified environment with relative frequent public interaction, most missions were initially located in independent offices in the business districts of capital cities.  However, since the passage of the Foreign Affairs Agencies Consolidation Act in 1998 and the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|bombings of U.S. Embassy chanceries]] in east Africa in the same year, missions have gradually been moved into U.S. Embassy chancery compounds.\n\n===USAID/Washington===\nThe country programs are supported by USAID's headquarters in Washington, D.C., \"USAID/Washington,\" where about half of USAID's Foreign Service Officers work on rotation from foreign assignments, alongside USAID's Civil Service staff and top leadership.

However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>  The technical offices that are frequently found in USAID missions include Health and Family Planning, Education, Environment, Democracy, and Economic Growth.\n\n====Health and Family Planning====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by missions' Health and Family Planning offices are projects for eradication of communicable diseases, strengthening of public health systems focusing on maternal-child health including family planning services, [[HIV/AIDS|HIV-AIDS]] monitoring, delivery of medical supplies including contraceptives and [[HIV]] vaccines, and coordination of Demographic and Health Surveys. This assistance is primarily targeted to the poor majority of the population and corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as strengthening the basis for socioeconomic development.\n\n====Education====\n\nUSAID's Education offices mainly assist the national school system, emphasizing broadening coverage of quality basic education to reach the entire population. Examples of projects often assisted by Education offices are projects for curriculum development, teacher training, and provision of improved textbooks and materials.  Larger programs have included school construction.  Education offices often manage scholarship programs for training in the U.S., while assistance to the country's universities and professional education institutions may be provided by Economic Growth and Health offices.  The Education office's emphasis on school access for the poor majority of the population corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as to the socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Environment====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by Environment offices are projects for tropical forest conservation, protection of indigenous people's lands, regulation of marine fishing industries, pollution control, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and helping communities adapt to climate change.  Environment assistance corresponds to USAID's objective of technical cooperation on global issues, as well as laying a sustainable basis for USAID's socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Democracy====\nExamples of projects assisted by Democracy offices are projects for the country's political institutions, including elections, political parties, legislatures, and human rights organizations.  Counterparts include the judicial sector and civil-society organizations that monitor government performance.  Democracy assistance received its greatest impetus at the time of the creation of the successor states to the USSR starting in about 1990, corresponding both to USAID's objective of supporting U.S. bilateral interests and to USAID's socioeconomic development objective.\n\n====Economic Growth====\n\nExamples of projects often assisted by Economic Growth offices are projects for improvements in agricultural techniques and marketing (the mission may have a specialized \"Agriculture\" office), development of microfinance industries, streamlining of Customs administrations (to accelerate growth of exporting industries), and modernization of government regulatory frameworks for industry in various sectors (telecommunications, agriculture, and so forth). [[File:USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms.jpg|thumb|USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms]] In USAID's early years and in some larger programs, Economic Growth offices have financed economic infrastructure like roads and electrical power plants.  Economic Growth assistance is thus quite diverse in terms of the range of sectors where it may work.  It corresponds to USAID's socioeconomic development objective and is the source of sustainable poverty reduction.  Economic Growth offices also occasionally manage assistance to poverty relief projects, such as to government programs that provide \"cash transfer\" payments to low-income families.\n\n====Special assistance offices====\n\nSome USAID missions have specialized technical offices for areas like counter-narcotics assistance or assistance in conflict zones.\n\nDisaster assistance on a large scale is provided through USAID's [[Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance|Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance]].  Rather than having a permanent presence in country missions, this office has supplies pre-positioned in strategic locations to respond quickly to disasters when and where they occur.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-democracy-conflict-and-humanitarian-assistance/office-us|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The Office of the Mission Director and the Program Office===\nThe Mission Director's signature authorizes technical offices to provide assistance according to the designs and budgets they propose.  With the help of the Program Office, the Mission Director ensures that designs are consistent with USAID policy for the country, including budgetary earmarks by which Washington directs that funds be used for certain general purposes such as public health or environmental conservation.  The Program Office compiles combined reports to Washington to support budget requests to Congress and to verify that budgets were used as planned.\n\n===Contracting, financial management and management offices===\nWhile the Mission Director is the public face and key decision-maker for an impressive array of USAID technical capabilities, arguably the offices that make USAID preeminent among U.S. government agencies in the ability to follow through on assistance agreements in low-income countries are the \"support\" offices.\n\n====Contracting offices====\n\nCommitments of U.S. government funds to NGOs and firms that implement USAID's assistance programs can only be made in compliance with carefully designed contracts and grant agreements executed by warranted Contracting and Agreement Officers.  The Mission Director is authorized to commit financial assistance directly to the country's government agencies.\n\n====Financial management offices====\n\nFunds can be committed only when the Mission's Controller certifies their availability for the stated purpose.  \"FM\" offices assist technical offices in financial analysis and in developing detailed budgets for inputs needed by projects assisted.  They evaluate potential recipients' management abilities before financial assistance can be authorized and then review implementers' expenditure reports with great care.  This office often has the largest number of staff of any office in the mission.\n\n====Management offices====\n\nCalled the \"Executive Office\" in USAID (sometimes leading to confusion with the Embassy's Executive Office, which is the office of the Ambassador), \"EXO\" provides operational support for mission offices, including human resources, information systems management, transportation, property and procurement services. Increasing integration into Embassies' chancery complexes, and the State Department's recently increased role in providing support services to USAID, is expanding the importance of coordination between USAID's EXO and the Embassy's Management section.\n\n==Assistance projects==\nWhile the terms \"assistance project\" and \"development project\" might sometimes be used indiscriminately, it helps in understanding USAID's work to make a distinction.  (1) Development is what developing countries do.  Development projects are projects of local government agencies and NGOs, such as projects to improve public services or business regulations, etc.  (2) Assistance is what USAID does.  USAID's assistance projects support local development projects.\n\nThe key to a successful development project is the institutional capacity of local organizations, including the professional ability of their staff members.  The key to successful assistance is how well it fits the needs of local development projects, including institutional capacity building and supporting professional education and training for staff.\n\nWhen a local development project's assistance needs have been identified, USAID arranges the agreed assistance through funding agreements with implementing organizations, referred to by USAID staff as \"implementing partners.\"  USAID finances several types of implementers using a variety of funding agreements.\n\nTo illustrate, USAID might assist a development project with inputs provided through several different funding agreements:\n\n# A budget-support grant to a government agency.\n# A contract with a firm for support to the agency.\n# A grant to a local NGO serving the beneficiary group.\n# A grant to an international NGO to strengthen the operations of the local NGO.\n\nEach of these types of USAID funding agreements is profiled below.\n\n===Budget support to a government agency===\nThis funding agreement would take the form of a letter from USAID's Mission Director, countersigned by the recipient agency, explaining the agency's objectives, the amount of USAID's financial commitment, the specific expenditures to be financed by USAID's grant, and other operational aspects of the agreement.\n\nUSAID's technical office would assign a staff member (U.S. or local) to oversee progress in the agency's implementation.  USAID's financial management office would transfer funds to the agency, in tranches as needed.  Audit under this kind of government-to-government (G2G) financial assistance is usually performed by the host government's own audit agency.\n\n===Contract for technical assistance to a government agency===\nAs a government agency is usually specialized in services to the beneficiary population (medical services, for example), its staff may not be equipped to undertake planning and evaluation, construction, acquisition of equipment, or management of training and study tours.  The government agency might, therefore, request USAID's assistance in these areas, and USAID could respond by contracting with a firm to supply the services or technical assistance requested.\n\nUSAID's technical office would collaborate with the government agency in drafting the specifications for what is needed (generally referred to as a \"Statement of Work\" for the contract) and in conducting market research for available sources and potential bidders.  USAID's Contracting Officer would then advertise for bids, manage the selection of a contractor from among the competing bidders, sign the contract, and assign a technical-office staff member as the Contracting Officer's Representative to oversee the performance under the contract.  (If the workload permits, this staff member might be the same person who oversees USAID's financial assistance to the government agency.)\n\nThe contractor supplies technical assistance directly to the government agency, so that in monitoring contractor performance USAID relies substantially on the agency's evaluation of the contractor's work.\n\n===Grant to finance NGO services to a beneficiary group===\nNon-governmental organizations are, like their government counterparts, usually already engaged in service provision in areas where USAID wants to assist, and they often have unique abilities that complement public programs.  Therefore, USAID technical-office staff might set aside a budget and, with the help of the mission's contracting office, publish a solicitation for applications from NGOs for financial assistance to their programs.  One or several grants could be made to selected NGOs by the contracting office's \"Agreement Officer.\"  Similar to the case of a contract, a USAID technical-office staff member would be assigned as the Agreement Officer's Representative to monitor progress in the NGOs' implementation and to arrange for external evaluations.  USAID grants require recipient NGOs to contract for external audits.\n\nAs some local NGOs may be small and young organizations with no prior experience in receiving awards from USAID, the USAID mission's financial management office reviews grant applicants' administrative systems to ensure that they are capable of managing USG funds.  Where necessary, USAID can devote part of the grant to the NGO's internal strengthening to help the NGO qualify for USAID's financing and build the capacity of the organization in the process.  Following completion of the NGO's internal strengthening, USAID would disburse financing for the NGO's service project.\n\n===Grant to international NGOs for technical assistance===\nInternational NGOs have their own development projects and capabilities.  If USAID and its counterparts determine that development objectives can best be met by supporting an NGO project, and if local NGO capacity is not yet sufficient, the relevant USAID technical office will draft a program description and the contracting office will issue as a request for applications to solicit responses from the international NGO community.  USAID manages the award and implementation processes in the same way as for local NGOs.\n\nAlso, international NGOs frequently make unsolicited proposals to USAID, requesting funding for their own planned assistance activities.  Where NGOs or business enterprises are dedicating a substantial amount of non-USG resources to their projects, they can receive USAID funding through \"Global Development Alliance\" grants, provided that the non-USG resources are at least equal in value to USAID's grant.\n\nIn general, USAID provides financial assistance to support other organizations' programs when those programs correspond to the areas that USAID wants to support, while USAID uses contracts to procure products or services requested by the leaders of local development projects.\n\n===Other mechanisms===\nIn addition to the types of projects described above, USAID uses various other assistance mechanisms for different U.S. objectives.  Budget agreements with other USG agencies are common in supporting collaboration between the U.S. and other countries on global issues.  Large budget-support grants, referred to as \"non-project\" assistance, may be made to recipient governments to pursue U.S. foreign policy interests.\n\n==History==\nWhen the USG created USAID in November 1961, it built on a legacy of previous development-assistance agencies and their people, budgets, and operating procedures. USAID's predecessor agency was already substantial, with 6,400 U.S. staff in developing-country field missions in 1961.  Except for the peak years of the Vietnam War, 1965\u201370, that was more U.S. field staff than USAID would have in the future, and triple the number USAID has had in field missions in the years since 2000.<ref>Data from USAID reports, \"Distribution of Personnel as of June 30, 1949 thru 1976,\" \"Supporting the USAID Mission, and the \"USAID Staffing Report to Congress\" of 2016.  See full citations in \"References,\" below.</ref>\n\nAlthough the size of the development-assistance effort was not new, the 1961 decision to reorganize the USG's main development-assistance agency was a landmark in terms of institutional evolution, representing the culmination of twenty years' experience with different organizational forms and procedures, in changing foreign-policy environments.\n\nThe new structure created in 1961 \"proved to be sturdy and durable.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|page=60}}</ref> In particular, the USG has maintained since then \"the unique American pattern of placing strong resident aid missions in countries that [the U.S. was] helping.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|page=37}}</ref>\n\nThe story of how the base for USAID's structure was built is described below, along with an account of changes that have been made since 1961.<ref>A history of all the programs that USAID has supported since 1961, in scores of countries, plus the evolution of USG policies and academic theories about development and development assistance, to say nothing of the development in the low-income countries themselves, would require enough books to fill a library.  For a start, see Samuel Butterfield's ''U.S. Development Aid'' (2004).</ref>\n\n=== Before World War II ===\nThe realization that early industrializers like the United States could provide technical assistance to other countries' development efforts spread gradually in the late 1800s, leading to a substantial number of visits to other countries by U.S. technical experts, generally with official support by the U.S. Government even when the missions were unofficial. [[Japan]], China, Turkey, and several Latin American countries requested missions on subjects like fiscal management, monetary institutions, election management, mining, schooling, roads, flood control, and urban sanitation.  The U.S. Government also initiated missions, particularly to Central America and the Caribbean, when it felt that U.S. interests might be affected by crises like failed elections, debt defaults, or spread of infectious disease.<ref>Merle Curti and Kendall Birr, \"Prelude to Point Four: American Technical Missions Overseas, 1838\u20131938\" (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1954).</ref>\n\nU.S. technical missions in this era were not, however, part of a systematic, USG-supported program.  Possibly the closest approximation to what USG development assistance would become was the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinafound.org.tw/ec99/eshop1387/e_profile.asp | title=China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture}}</ref> established by the USG in 1924 using funds provided by China as reparations following the \"Boxer\" conflict.  The Foundation's activities ranged widely and included support for development of a leading Chinese university, [[Tsinghua University]].\n\nA notable early example of U.S. Government foreign assistance for disaster relief was its contribution to the 1915 [[Committee for Relief in Belgium]] headed by [[Herbert Hoover]], to prevent starvation in [[Belgium]] after the German invasion.  After World War I in 1919, the USG created the American Relief Administration, also headed by Hoover, which provided food primarily in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween the two world wars, however,  U.S. assistance in low-income countries was often the product of private initiative, including the work of private foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Near East Foundation.<ref>For information on the Near East Foundation, see {{cite web|title=Near East Foundation|url=http://www.neareast.org/}}  Also {{cite book|last1=Badeau|first1=John S.|last2=Stevens|first2=G.

Since countries in the region were regularly requesting expert assistance from USG cabinet departments, an Interdepartmental Committee on Cooperation with the American Republics was established in 1938, with the State Department in the chair, to ensure systematic responses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Records of Interdepartmental Committees|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/353.html|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Glick|first1=Philip|title=The Administration of Technical Assistance|date=1957|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|pages=7\u20139}}</ref>\n\nMore ambitiously, the U.S. subsequently created an institution that for the first time would take an active role in development assistance programming: the Institute of Inter-American Affairs (IIAA), chartered in March 1942. The Institute was the initiative of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, Nelson Rockefeller, the future Vice President of the United States, whose family financed the Rockefeller Foundation. IIAA's 1,400 employees provided technical assistance across Central and South America for economic stabilization, food supply, health, and sanitation. U.S. benefits included development of sources for raw materials that had been disrupted by the war.<ref>Erb, Claude (1985). \"Prelude to Point Four: The Institute of Inter-American Affairs\".

In particular, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations (OFAR) continued to operate separately until 1954.<ref>OFAR was an office in USDA between 1939 and 1953.  In this period, the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] reported to the Department of State rather than to USDA.

When this process finally resulted in the creation USAID in 1961, USAID continued to use TCA's core mechanism \u2014 providing technical assistance led by in-country resident offices \u2014 and supplemented it with substantial amounts of financial assistance.\n\n==== Post-war foreign aid ====\n\nPoint Four and TCA had been established in the context of a number of other programs in the large-scale U.S. foreign aid effort of the 1940s.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953).</ref> Already during the war, in 1943, the U.S. (jointly with its wartime allies, referred to collectively as \"the United Nations\") established the \"United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\" ([[UNRRA]]) for war-affected parts of Europe, China, the Philippines, Korea, and Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ninth and Final Financial Report of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration |date=March 1949 |publisher=UNRRA |location=Washington, D.C. |page=25 |hdl=2027/nnc1.cu03384870 }}</ref> Immediately after the war, the USG supplied relief in Germany and Japan, funded by appropriations for \"Government and Relief in Occupied Areas\" ([[GARIOA]]).<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nRelief was quickly followed by reconstruction assistance.  In 1946, the U.S. created a special financial-assistance program for rehabilitation of war damages in its former possession, the Philippines.<ref>By the program's completion in March 1951, the U.S. had provided $388 million for private property claims and $55 million for public property reconstruction.  (See {{cite book |last1=Waring |first1=Frank A. |last2=Delgado |first2=Francisco A. |last3=O'Donnell |first3=John A. |title=Rehabilitation of the Philippines: Final and Ninth Semiannual Report of the United States Philippine War Damage Commission |date=March 31, 1951 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington D.C. |hdl=2027/mdp.39015039449130 }})  The following month, in April 1951, the U.S. and the Philippines signed an agreement for the U.S. to open an aid office (a Special Technical and Economic Mission). (See {{cite book |title=Thirteenth Report to Congress of the Economic Cooperation Administration: Supplement |pages=58\u201365 |hdl=2027/umn.31951d03727992c }})</ref> In 1948, reconstruction assistance was expanded through the [[Marshall Plan]], implemented by the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), mainly for Western Europe. In the same year, the U.S. and China established the [[Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]],<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 341\u2013342.</ref> which, starting on the mainland and continuing for two decades in Taiwan, provided sustained development assistance.\n\nAlso, the [[Fulbright Program]] of academic exchanges was established in 1946, globalizing the wartime program of exchange visits between professionals from Latin America and the United States.\n\nIn contrast to the [[Marshall Plan]], Point Four focussed on technical assistance and provided financial assistance only in limited amounts to support its technical initiatives. In terms of geographic focus, while the two programs mainly operated in different countries, the Marshall Plan also expanded into developing nations.  In particular, the Marshall Plan financed activities in parts of the Middle East, in overseas territories of European allies (principally in Africa), and in \"the general area of China\" (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines), where it operated through Special Technical and Economic Missions (STEMs).  The STEMs were set up in 1950 and 1951, and had a \"Point Four character\" in the sense that they emphasized services by technical experts.<ref>Hayes (1971), pp. 44\u201352.</ref>  Minimizing overlaps with the Marshall Plan, Point Four managed assistance mainly in Latin America (via IIAA), in North Africa and Eritrea, in parts of the Middle East, and in India, Pakistan, and Ceylon.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 412\u2013414.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also participated in post-1945 UN initiatives for technical assistance to developing countries.  Through a series of actions in 1948 and 1949, the UN's General Assembly and Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) created the [[Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance]] (EPTA).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jolly|first1=Richard|last2=Emmerji|first2=Louis|last3=Ghai|first3=Dharam|last4=Lapeyre|first4=Frederic|title=UN Contributions to Development Thinking and Practice|date=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=68\u201373}}</ref>  The U.S. provided 60% of EPTA's financing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirdar|first1=\u00dcner|title=The Structure of United Nations Economic-Aid to Underdeveloped Countries|url=https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird|url-access=registration|date=1966|publisher=M. Nijhoff|location=The Hague|page=[https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird/page/60 60]}}</ref> By 1955, EPTA adopted a country-led approach where the UN's TA in each country was programmed according to a plan drawn up by the receiving country in consultation with the UN.  ECOSOC also created a new Technical Assistance Board, which (similarly to the USG's wartime Interdepartmental Committee) coordinated the TA being provided to low-income countries by various individual UN agencies.\n\n==== Korean War ====\n\nCoordination between development assistance and the Marshall Plan was tightened in response to the 1950\u201351 war in Korea.  In October 1951 Congress passed the [[Mutual Security Act]], creating the Mutual Security Agency (MSA), which reported directly to the President and supervised both civilian and military assistance. MSA increased the emphasis on large-scale financial assistance to U.S. allies, which was provided as civilian \"economic assistance\" but was intended to help the allies to make greater military efforts and was therefore often called \"defense support.\"<ref>The name under which Congress appropriates these funds has changed over time, becoming \"Supporting Assistance\" in 1961, \"Security Supporting Assistance\" in 1971, and finally \"Economic Support Funds\" from 1978 to the present. See Nowels (1987), pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe Mutual Security Agency absorbed the Marshall Plan (the ECA), which otherwise had been scheduled to end in 1952.  The Technical Cooperation Administration remained a semi-autonomous agency in the State Department to administer Point Four, but after 1951 under the supervision of MSA.<ref>Butterfield (2004), p. 37.</ref> Under this coordinated approach, the policy was adopted that ECA and TCA would not both operate in the same country (\"one country \u2014 one agency\").  Accordingly, each agency transferred programs to the other and closed down in some countries.<ref>Bingham (2004), pp. 262\u2013263.</ref> For example, in Indonesia and Burma, ECA closed its financial-assistance programs, while TCA initiated technical assistance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oral History Interview with Stanley Andrews |url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/andrewss.htm |publisher=Harry S.

The President's party, which had been out of the White House since 1933,<ref>The only times the Republican Party had a majority in either house in the 48-year span from 1933 to 1981 was when it enjoyed small majorities in both houses of the 80th Congress in 1947\u20131949 under Pres. Truman and both houses of the 83rd Congress 1953\u20131955 under Pres. Eisenhower.</ref> took a critical view of the previous administrations' policies, including both the globalizing policies of the 1940s and the New Deal initiatives of the 1930s.<ref>The New Deal's Tennessee Valley Authority was the model for some major development assistance projects. See Ekbladh (2002).</ref>\n \nAn overall goal of the new administration was to administer the government efficiently and cut spending.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 14.</ref> While TCA's technical assistance to developing countries was a small budget item and was considered a long-term program (although fresh funds were appropriated annually), \"economic assistance\" (or \"defense support\") was considered an inherently short-term measure.<ref>Bingham (1953), p. 38.</ref> In place of U.S. economic assistance, the Eisenhower administration proposed that U.S. allies should increasingly finance themselves through their own exports: in other words, through \"trade not aid.\"<ref>Kaufman (1982), ch. 2, pp. 12\u201333.</ref>  With respect to financial assistance for developing countries, the policy was maintained that it should be provided primarily by the U.S. Export-Import Bank and by the World Bank,<ref>U.S. documents of the 1950s usually referred to the World Bank as \"the International Bank.\"</ref> and that it should be available only on commercial terms and primarily to finance private investment.<ref>Glick (1957), pp. 130\u2013136: \"The Relation of Technical Co-operation to Economic Aid.\"</ref>\n\nTo administer the foreign assistance more efficiently, President Eisenhower integrated management into a single agency, the newly created Foreign Operations Administration (FOA).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on the Organization of the Executive Branch for the Conduct of Foreign Affairs |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-the-organization-the-executive-branch-for-the-conduct-foreign |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=26 April 2019 |date=June 1, 1953}}</ref> MSA, TCA (which had been under MSA's direction), and IIAA (which had been part of TCA) were all abolished as of August 1953 and their country offices became \"United States Operations Missions\" (USOMs) under FOA.<ref>Bingham (2004), p. 240.</ref> The President directed other USG agencies to put their technical assistance in developing countries under FOA's management as well. USDA in particular transferred OFAR's programs to FOA, while reconstituting the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] for the task of building global markets for U.S. farm products.<ref>Glick (1957) p. 49.</ref>\n\nAdministrative functions were consolidated as the various agencies came into FOA, and the Mutual Security Act of July 1953 instructed FOA to reduce personnel by at least 10% within 120 days.<ref>{{cite web|last1=U.S. Government|title=Mutual Security Act of 1953|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-67/pdf/STATUTE-67-Pg152.pdf|at=Section 706(a)|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=July 16, 1953}}</ref> A large number of TCA's senior professionals were summarily dismissed, and FOA's administrator mounted an effort to compensate for lower USG staffing by drawing on experts from U.S. universities and private voluntary organizations.<ref>Ruttan (1996), p. 205.</ref>  The ExIm Bank's lending volume in developing countries was also cut dramatically in 1953.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 29\u201333.</ref>\n\nChanging world events and differences of opinion within the [[Eisenhower]] administration soon altered the administration's cutbacks, however.\n \nFirst, while a \"trade not aid\" strategy required the U.S. to import more goods from its allies, the administration was unable to convince Congress to liberalize import policy.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 37\u201346.</ref>  On the contrary, the main foreign commercial measure taken at this time went in the other direction: the U.S. ramped up subsidies for exports of U.S. agricultural products.  The 1953 amendment to the Mutual Security Act and the much larger Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, known as \"PL-480,\" allowed the U.S. Government to buy U.S. farm surpluses and sell them in developing countries for inconvertible local currencies.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 26\u201329.  Sen. Hubert Humphrey was a prominent supporter of the PL-480 concept.</ref><ref>A currency is \"inconvertible\" when the government forbids it to be used to buy foreign exchange, so that it can only be spent in the country that issues it.</ref> Much of PL-480's foreign-currency revenue was returned to developing countries as a supplement to U.S. development assistance.  PL-480 revenues in the first twenty years were sometimes huge and although PL-480 has become smaller it continues to provide resources to USAID for nutrition and disaster relief programs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Food Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security/food-assistance|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=2017}}</ref>\n \nSecond, several factors arose that favored large-scale economic assistance to developing countries, especially in Asia. [[South Korea]] needed massive economic assistance after an armistice was finally signed in July 1953,<ref>Mason, Kim ''et al''. (1980), chapter 6.</ref> and U.S. economic assistance to South Vietnam increased after the retreat of France in 1954.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 259\u2013260.</ref>  On a global scale, the Cold War after the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 evolved in the direction of rivalry over influence in low-income countries who were seeking financing for their development initiatives. India was a particular case of a country where the U.S. felt it needed to provide economic assistance to balance the USSR's influence, even though India was not a U.S. military ally.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 72\u201373.</ref>  These considerations led to advocacy of expanded economic assistance by several voices within the Eisenhower administration: the FOA Director, former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen; C.D. Jackson, from the Time-Life publishing business (who draw on advice from MIT economists Millikan and Rostow); the State Department; and the National Security Council.\n \nAs a result, the USG took several steps in the course of 1954 and 1955 to raise the profile of development assistance.\n\nIn June 1954, the USG raised the ExIm Bank's lending authority from $4.5 billion to $5 billion.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 32.</ref>  Pres. Eisenhower also created in December 1954 a Cabinet-level Council on Foreign Economic Policy,<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 37.</ref> which in March 1955 recommended expanded soft loans for development.  In April 1955, Pres. Eisenhower proposed a special economic fund for Asia.<ref name=\"Kaufman 1982, p. 52\"/>\n\nTo implement Congress's August 1954 decision that technical assistance for developing countries should be put back under the State Department,<ref>{{cite web|last1=U.S. Government|title=Mutual Security Act of 1953|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-67/pdf/STATUTE-67-Pg152.pdf|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=1953}}</ref> Pres.

Eisenhower and Congress conducted in 1956 a number of studies to give foreign aid policy a more solid basis.  Mainly delivered in early 1957, the reports included an updated version of the essay by Millikan & Rostow that C.D. Jackson had circulated in 1954.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1951900|title = Foreign Aid and the Policy Process: 1957|journal = The American Political Science Review|volume = 52|issue = 3|pages = 689\u2013724|last1 = Haviland|first1 = H.

See Ruttan (1996), pp. 89\u201391.</ref> Personnel changes soon reflected this change in the administration's view: Christian Herter succeeded Herbert Hoover Jr. as Under Secretary of State in February 1957, Robert Anderson succeeded George Humphrey as Treasury Secretary in July 1957, and James H. Smith Jr. replaced John Hollister as ICA Director in September 1957.<ref>Haviland (1958), pp. 690, 691, 696.</ref>\n \nPres. Eisenhower summarized the conclusions in his May 21, 1957 message to Congress: \"This past year ... Congressional Committees, the Executive Branch and distinguished private citizens have just examined these programs anew. ... I recommend the following legislative actions: ... economic development assistance should be provided primarily through loans, on a continuing basis, and related closely to technical assistance. ... I recommend a clear separation of military and defense support assistance on the one hand, from economic development assistance on the other. ... I recommend that longterm [sic] development assistance be provided from a Development Loan Fund. ... Such loans should not compete with or replace such existing sources of credit as private investors, the International Bank [the World Bank], or the Export-Import Bank. ... I believe the Fund should be established and administered in the International Cooperation Administration. ... The technical cooperation program is one of the most valuable elements of our entire mutual security effort. It also should be continued on a long-term basis and must be closely related to the work of the Fund.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on the Mutual Security Programs |date=May 21, 1957 |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-the-mutual-security-programs |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC-\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n \nAs a result, the Development Loan Fund was established in August 1957. The DLF largely financed infrastructure (such as railroads, highways, and power plants), factories, and agriculture with loans whose terms were relatively \"soft\" in the sense of charging interest rates lower than commercial levels and being repayable in local currency rather than U.S. dollars.<ref>Local-currency repayments were adjusted when exchange rates changed to maintain their value in terms of U.S. dollars.</ref> Some projects were financed by a combination of a DLF soft loan and a harder World Bank loan.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Terminal Report of the Development Loan Fund|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pdabc787.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|pages=3\u20134|date=1962}}</ref> Operationally, the DLF became administratively self-contained by 1959 after contracting for administrative support from ICA for its first two years.<ref>Terminal Report of the DLF, p. 6.</ref> Also, the Export-Import Bank's lending limit was raised in 1958 from $5 billion to $7 billion,<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 167</ref> and the administration advocated in January 1959 an expanded \"food for peace\" program.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on Agriculture |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-agriculture-3 |date=January 29, 1959 |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe overall trend in USG development-assistance activity in the 1950s is indicated by the change in the number of U.S. staff in field missions, which during Pres.

The U.S. supported their involvement through several multilateral initiatives.\n\nThree of these initiatives expanded World Bank facilities.\n\nIn November 1954, the U.S. decided to endorse the World Bank's proposed International Finance Corporation, which would raise funds from global capital markets to lend to the private sector in developing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 46\u201349.</ref> The IFC was finally established in 1956.\n\nWith Senator [[Mike Monroney]] playing a prominent role, Congress approved in July 1958 another new World Bank facility, the International Development Association (IDA).  Funded by grants from industrialized countries, the IDA would make low-interest credits to developing countries for projects like public works.  The IDA formally came into being in September 1960, with the U.S. contributing 42% of its initial resources.<ref>Mason, Edward; Asher, Robert (1973). ''The World Bank Since Bretton Woods''. Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution. pp. 381\u2013389.</ref><ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/ida-articlesofagreement.pdf International Development Association. \"Articles of Agreement, Schedule A\"]\nIDA-articlesofagreement.pdf.

P, & Webb, R. Charles. (1997). ''The World Bank : its first half century'' (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution), p. 929.</ref>\n\nWhile the U.S. supported expanded World Bank facilities, it did not support the proposal for a Special UN Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED). The UN did create a \"Special Fund\" in 1957, but it was limited to designing projects for the UN's technical assistance program, EPTA, and could not finance public works.<ref>Jolly ''et al.'' (2004), pp. 73\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also adopted a regional initiative with [[Latin America]].  Through most of the 1950s, the U.S. concentrated on technical assistance in the region.  Financial assistance sources were limited to the Eximbank and the World Bank, with the U.S. opposing proposals for a regional development bank.  However, events in 1958 \u2014 notably a riot during Vice President Nixon's visit to [[Caracas, Venezuela]] in May 1958 \u2014 resulted in a reversal of the U.S. position in August 1958.  With U.S. support, the Organization of American States created in April 1959 the Inter-American Development Bank, most of whose capital was contributed by the borrowing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 161-162.</ref>\n\nTo further engage other wealthy countries in development assistance, the USG supported the creation of the Aid India Consortium in August 1958. This was the first of several informal groupings of donors focussing on particular countries.\n\nThe USG also supported the Organization of European Economic Co-operation (the European Marshall Plan organization) in creating a Development Assistance Group in January 1960.<ref>{{cite web |last1=OECD |title=DAC in Dates: The History of OECD's Development Assistance Committee |url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/1896808.pdf |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=2006}} As the organization broadened its membership and became the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ([[OECD]]) in 1961, the Development Assistance Group was re-named the [[Development Assistance Committee]], or DAC.</ref>\n\n=== Creation of USAID and the Development Decade ===\nAt the end of the 1950s, the momentum in favor of development assistance\u2014as represented by PL-480, new mechanisms for financial assistance, larger U.S. budgets and staffing, and multilateral initiatives\u2014picked up support from Senator John F. Kennedy, who was preparing to be a candidate for the presidency. In 1957, JFK proposed, in bipartisan collaboration with Sen. John Sherman Cooper (a former U.S. Ambassador to India), a major expansion of U.S. economic support for India. As a candidate in 1960, he supported the emphasis on humanitarian goals for PL-480 set by Sen. Hubert Humphrey's \"Food for Peace\" Act of 1959<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 156\u2013159.</ref> and supported the idea of a [[Peace Corps]] that was under development thanks to the initiatives of Sen. Humphrey, Rep. Reuss, and Sen. Neuberger.  {{Crossreference| (See the \"History\" section of [[Peace Corps]].)}}<ref>Until 1973, USAID and its predecessors also supported [[International Voluntary Services]], which was founded in 1953.

On March 22, he sent a special message to Congress on foreign aid, asserting that the 1960s should be a \"Decade of Development\" and proposing to unify U.S. development assistance administration into a single agency.  He sent a proposed \"Act for International Development\" to Congress in May and the resulting \"Foreign Assistance Act\" was approved in September, repealing the Mutual Security Act.  In November, Pres. Kennedy signed the act and issued an Executive Order tasking the Secretary of State to create, within the State Department, the \"Agency for International Development\" (or A.I.D.: subsequently re-branded as USAID),<ref>The names of predecessor agencies often continued in popular usage.  In Vietnam in the 1960s, it was common to refer to A.I.D.'s office as \"USOM,\" while in Peru A.I.D. telephone operators continued in the 1960s to answer calls saying \"Punto Cuatro\" (Point Four).</ref> as the successor to both ICA and the Development Loan Fund.<ref>In 1966, the UN would also integrate its EPTA and the Special Fund into a new agency, the UN Development Program, or UNDP.</ref>\n\nWith these actions, the U.S. created a permanent agency working with administrative autonomy under the policy guidance of the State Department to implement, through resident field missions, a global program of both technical and financial development assistance for low-income countries. This structure has continued to date.<ref>The Fulbright educational and cultural exchange program was also strengthened by the Fulbright-Hays Act in September 1961.</ref>\n\nTaking this momentum onto the world stage via an address to the UN General Assembly in September 1961, Pres.

Through TV and internet ads as well as social media initiatives, FWD encouraged Americans to spread awareness about the crisis, support the humanitarian organizations that were conducting relief operations, and consult the Feed the Future global initiative for broader solutions. Celebrities [[Geena Davis]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[Josh Hartnett]] and [[Chanel Iman]] took part in the campaign via a series of Public Service Announcements. Corporations like [[Cargill]], [[General Mills]], [[PepsiCo.]] and [[General Mills]] also signed on to support FWD.<ref>[http://adage.com/article/goodworks/psas-fwd-awareness-horn-africa-crisis/230640/ \"New PSAs: 'FWD' Awareness About the Horn of Africa Crisis\"].

Debates of this kind are arbitrated in Washington by Congress and the Administration before budgets are decided and before USAID staff undertake detailed programming in the field.  The result is normally that USAID's programs in a given country pursue a mix of goals.\n\n===Modes of assistance===\nSome feel that USAID overemphasizes technical assistance and should instead provide more financial assistance (budget support, or debt relief).  They argue that financial assistance allows recipients to spend as they like with less influence from donors.  Others feel that financial assistance does not result in durable improvements and that person-to-person technical assistance has the advantage of sharing knowledge and experience, leading to permanent improvements.\n\nIn practice, many USAID missions find that their counterparts appreciate having both forms of aid: an assistance package that includes some financial assistance for things that can simply be bought and some technical assistance to confront problems and issues whose solutions are not so clear.\n\n===Cost of delivering assistance===\nUSAID is frequently criticized for providing expensive expert services to counterparts.  The majority of the staff that USAID finances are from the country itself, but USAID is also able to recruit internationally when necessary to meet the counterpart's needs.  USAID uses competition to arrive at market rates for the staff it recruits, and has experimented with volunteer programs for expertise from high paid professions.\n\n===Non-career contracts===\nUSAID frequently contracts with private firms or individuals for specialist services lasting from a few weeks to several years.  It has long been asked whether USAID should more often assign such tasks to career U.S. Government employees instead.  USG staff directly performed technical assistance in the earliest days of the program in the 1940s.  However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  By 1955, observers commented on a perceived shift towards more use of shorter-term contracts (rather than using employees with career-length contracts).<ref>See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\n===Anti-government programs===\nIn situations where the U.S. is hostile to the government of a country, USAID may be asked to undertake programs that the government would not accept and thus to operate without the government's knowledge.  This might include USAID support for opposition political movements that seek to remove the government.  Such \"political aid\" is criticized by some as being incompatible with USAID's role as an assistance or cooperation agency and as exposing USAID staff worldwide to the suspicion of being covertly engaged in subversion.  Similarly, USAID's participation in actions against foreign governments led by the U.S. military is criticized by some as inappropriate and as exposing USAID civilian staff to the dangers of military combat.  However, such political aid and joint civilian-military programs are supported by others as necessary to support U.S. geopolitical interests and to build democracy.\n\n===Economic interests===\nUSAID states that \"U.S. foreign assistance has always had the twofold purpose of furthering America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the developing world.\" However, non-government organization watch groups have noted that as much as 40% of aid to Afghanistan has found its way back to donor countries through awarding contracts at inflated costs.<ref>Richard Norton-Taylor [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/25/afghanistan.internationalaidanddevelopment1 40% of Afghan aid returns to donor countries, says report] ''guardian.co.uk'' 25 March 2008</ref>\n\nAlthough USAID officially selects contractors on a competitive and objective basis, watch dog groups, politicians, foreign governments and corporations have occasionally accused the agency of allowing its bidding process to be unduly influenced by the political and financial interests of its current Presidential administration. Under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], for instance, it emerged that all five implementing partners selected to bid on a $600 million Iraq reconstruction contract enjoyed close ties to the administration.<ref>Barbara Slavin [https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/iraq/2003-04-17-iraqdeal_x.htm Another Iraq deal rewards company with connections] ''[[USA Today]]'' 4/17/2003</ref><ref>Mark Tran [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/mar/31/iraq.usnews Halliburton misses $600m Iraq contract] ''guardian.oc.uk'' 31 March 2003</ref>\n\n===Political interests===\n[[File:USAID We dont need your aid criticism.jpg|thumb|Critical [[graffiti]] on a USAID Advertisement saying \"We dont need your aid\", [[West Bank]], Jan 2007]]\nSome critics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/sandels04262003.html |title=Robert Sandels: Cuba Crackdown: a Revolt Against Bush National Security Strategy? |publisher=Counterpunch.org |date=2002-05-20 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_dangl0208 |title=Undermining Bolivia |publisher=The Progressive |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23847990 |title=Bush aide resigns - Politics - White House - NBC News |publisher=NBC News |date=2008-03-28 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Golinger |first=Eva |url=http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/2600 |title=USAID in Bolivia and Venezuela: The Silent Subversion |publisher=venezuelanalysis.com |date=2007-09-12 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref> say that the US government gives aid to reward political and military partners rather than to advance genuine social or humanitarian causes abroad.

USAID spent $95,000 US in 2005 on a seminar in the Brazilian Congress to promote a reform aimed at pushing for legislation punishing party infidelity. According to USAID papers acquired by Folha under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], the seminar was planned to coincide with the eve of talks in that country's Congress on a broad political reform. The papers read that although the \"pattern of weak party discipline is found across the political spectrum, it is somewhat less true of parties on the liberal left, such as the [ruling] [[Worker's Party (Brazil)|Worker's Party]].\" The papers also expressed a concern about the \"'indigenization' of the conference so that it is not viewed as providing a U.S. perspective.\" The event's main sponsor was the [[International Republican Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u424786.shtml |title=''EUA tentaram influenciar reforma pol\u00edtica do Brasil'' |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2012, [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|ALBA]] countries (Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia,  Nicaragua, San Vicente y Las Granadinas, Dominica, Antigua y Barbuda) called on its members to expel USAID from their countries.<ref>[http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/7069 ALBA Expels USAID from Member Countries] Retrieved 2012-09-16</ref>\n\n===Influence on the United Nations===\nSeveral studies{{Which|date=April 2016}} suggest that foreign aid is used as a political weapon for the U.S. to elicit desired actions from other nations.

With a budget of over $27 billion, USAID is one of the [[List of development aid country donors|largest official aid agencies]] in the world, and accounts for more than half of all U.S. foreign assistance\u2014the highest in the world in absolute dollar terms.\n\nCongress passed the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] on September 4, 1961, which reorganized U.S. foreign assistance programs and mandated the creation of an agency to administer economic aid. USAID was subsequently established by the [[executive order]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], who sought to unite several existing foreign assistance organizations and programs under one agency.<ref>{{cite web|title=USAID HISTORY|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/usaid-history|website=usaid.gov|publisher=USAID|accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref> USAID became the first U.S. foreign assistance organization whose primary focus was long-term socioeconomic development.\n\nUSAID's programs are authorized by Congress in the [[Foreign Assistance Act]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/400/fsa.pdf |title=USAID: Automated Directives System 400 |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref> which Congress supplements through directions in annual funding appropriation acts and other legislation. As an official component of U.S. foreign policy, USAID operates subject to the guidance of the [[President of the United States|President]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]].<ref name=\"USAID\">{{cite web|last=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 101.2 Agency Programs and Functions|url=http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/100/101.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref> USAID has missions in over 100 countries, primarily in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Eastern Europe]].\n\n==Goals==\nUSAID's mission statement, adopted in February 2018, is:<blockquote>\"On behalf of the American people, we promote and demonstrate democratic values abroad, and advance a free, peaceful, and prosperous world. \n\nIn support of America's foreign policy, the U.S. Agency for International Development leads the U.S. Government's international development and disaster assistance through partnerships and investments that save lives, reduce poverty, strengthen democratic governance, and help people emerge from humanitarian crises and progress beyond assistance.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/mission-vision-values|title=Mission, Vision and Values {{!}} U.S. Agency for International Development|date=2018-02-16|website=usaid.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref><ref>[https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1870/JSP_FY_2018_-_2022_FINAL.pdf USAID-State Joint Strategic Plan 2018-2020] (PDF).

The best official statement relevant to the most recent era is contained in USAID's 2004 \"White Paper,\" which was reaffirmed in high-level USAID policy documents in 2006 and 2011.  (See the references authored by USAID, at the end of this article.)\n\nTo give a perspective of USAID's goals that is as general as possible, the list of goals in this article subsumes one of the goals from the 2004 White Paper, \"Strengthen fragile states,\" whose emphasis as understood at the time was on Iraq and Afghanistan, into a more general goal, \"U.S. national interests,\" together with one of the White Paper's other goals, \"Support strategic states.\"  State fragility is understood to be one of the development issues addressed under this article's \"Socioeconomic development\" goal.\n\nOn the other hand, the White Paper's goal, \"Provide humanitarian relief,\" is divided in this article into two goals, both of which are humanitarian: \"Disaster relief\" (which may assist victims at various income levels) and \"Poverty relief\" (which targets proverty that is chronic, not just the result of a disaster, and which does not necessarily have to be justified by developmental impact).</ref>\n\n* Disaster relief\n* Poverty relief\n* Technical cooperation on [[global issue]]s, including the environment\n* U.S. bilateral interests\n* Socioeconomic development\n\n===Disaster relief===\n[[File:USAID.jpg|thumb|right|USAID Packages are delivered by [[United States Coast Guard]] personnel]]\n\nSome of the U.S. Government's earliest foreign aid programs provided relief in crises created by war. In 1915, USG assistance through the Commission for Relief of Belgium headed by Herbert Hoover prevented starvation in Belgium after the German invasion.  After 1945, the European Recovery Program championed by Secretary of State George Marshall (the \"[[Marshall Plan]]\") helped rebuild war-torn Western Europe.\n\nUSAID manages relief efforts after wars and natural disasters through its Office of U.S Foreign Disaster Assistance in Washington D.C. Privately funded U.S. NGOs and the U.S. military also play major roles in disaster relief overseas.\n\n===Poverty relief===\n[[File:Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development (7269588282).jpg|thumb|right|Early reading and literacy programs contribute to long-term development, USAID [[Nigeria]]]]\nAfter 1945, many newly independent countries needed assistance to relieve the chronic deprivation afflicting their low-income populations.  USAID and its predecessor agencies have continuously provided poverty relief in many forms, including assistance to public health and education services targeted at the poorest.  USAID has also helped manage food aid provided by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].  In addition, USAID provides funding to NGOs to supplement private donations in relieving chronic poverty.\n\n===Global issues===\nTechnical cooperation between nations is essential for addressing a range of cross-border concerns like communicable diseases, environmental issues, trade and investment cooperation, safety standards for traded products, money laundering, and so forth.  The USG has specialized agencies dealing with such areas, such as the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency.  USAID's special ability to administer programs in low-income countries supports these and other USG agencies' international work on global concerns.\n\n====Environment====\n\nAmong these global interests, environmental issues attract high attention.  USAID assists projects that conserve and protect threatened land, water, forests, and wildlife.  USAID also assists projects to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and to build resilience to the risks associated with global [[climate change]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Global Climate Change: Capacity Building | publisher = [[USAID]] | url = http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | accessdate = 2014-08-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120120113701/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/climate/policies_prog/capacity.html | archivedate = 2012-01-20 }}</ref>  U.S. environmental regulation laws require that programs sponsored by USAID should be both economically and environmentally [[sustainable]].\n\n===U.S. national interests===\nTo support U.S. geopolitical interests, Congress appropriates exceptional financial assistance to allies, largely in the form of \"Economic Support Funds\" (ESF).  USAID is called on to administer the bulk (90%) of ESF<ref>Tarnoff (2015), p. 13.</ref> and is instructed \"To the maximum extent feasible, [to] provide [ESF] assistance ... consistent with the policy directions, purposes, and programs of [development assistance].\"<ref>Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as amended), Section 531.</ref>\n\nAlso, when U.S. troops are in the field, USAID can supplement the \"[[Civil Affairs]]\" programs that the U.S. military conducts to win the friendship of local populations.  In these circumstances, USAID may be directed by specially appointed diplomatic officials of the State Department, as has been done in Afghanistan and Pakistan during operations against al-Qaeda.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stabilization: Lessons from the U.S. Experience in Afghanistan |url=https://www.sigar.mil/interactive-reports/stabilization/index.html |publisher=SIGAR |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nU.S. commercial interests are served by U.S. law's requirement that most goods and services financed by USAID must be sourced from U.S. vendors.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADS Chapter 310: Source and Nationality Requirements for Procurement of Commodities and Services Financed by USAID |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/310.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Socioeconomic development===\nTo help low-income nations achieve self-sustaining socioeconomic development, USAID assists them in improving management of their own resources.  USAID's assistance for socioeconomic development mainly provides technical advice, training, scholarships, commodities, and financial assistance.  Through grants and contracts, USAID mobilizes the technical resources of the private sector, other USG agencies, universities, and NGOs to participate in this assistance.\n\nPrograms of the various types above frequently reinforce one another.  For example, the Foreign Assistance Act requires USAID to use funds appropriated for geopolitical purposes (\"Economic Support Funds\") to support socioeconomic development to the maximum extent possible.\n\n==Modes of assistance==\nUSAID delivers both technical assistance and financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/primer.html |title=USAID Primer: What We Do and How We Do It |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>\n\n===Technical assistance===\nTechnical assistance includes technical advice, training, scholarships, construction, and commodities.  Technical assistance is contracted or procured by USAID and provided in-kind to recipients.  For technical advisory services, USAID draws on experts from the private sector, mainly from the assisted country's own pool of expertise, as well as from specialized USG agencies.  Many host-government leaders have drawn on USAID's technical assistance for development of IT systems and computer hardware procurement to strengthen their institutions.\n\nTo build indigenous expertise and leadership, USAID finances scholarships to U.S. universities and assists the strengthening of developing countries' own universities.  Local universities' programs in developmentally important sectors are assisted directly and through USAID support for forming partnerships with U.S. universities.\n\nThe various forms of technical assistance are frequently coordinated as capacity building packages for development of local institutions.\n\n===Financial assistance===\n[[File:National Open Source Software Competition - USAID.jpg|thumb|National Open Source Software Competition \u2013 USAID financial assistance for groups developing technology in Indonesia]]\n\nFinancial assistance supplies cash to developing country organizations to supplement their budgets.  USAID also provides financial assistance to local and international [[NGOs]] who in turn give technical assistance in developing countries.  Although USAID formerly provided loans, all financial assistance is now provided in the form of nonreimbursable grants.\n\nIn recent years, the USG has increased its emphasis on financial rather than technical assistance.  In 2004, the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Administration created the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] as a new foreign aid agency that is mainly restricted to providing financial assistance. In 2009, the Obama Administration initiated a major realignment of USAID's own programs to emphasize financial assistance, referring to it as \"government-to-government\" or \"G2G\" assistance.\n\n==Organization==\n\nUSAID is organized around country development programs managed by resident USAID offices in developing countries (\"USAID missions\"), supported by USAID's global headquarters in Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |title=USAID: Organization |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423111526/http://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidorg.html |archive-date=2011-04-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Country development programs===\nUSAID plans its work in each country around an individual country development program managed by a resident office called a \"mission.\"  The USAID mission and its U.S. staff are guests in the country, with a status that is usually defined by a \"framework bilateral agreement\" between the USG and the host government.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 349|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1876/349.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 349.3.1.1|date=2003}}</ref> Framework bilaterals give the mission and its U.S. staff privileges similar to (but not necessarily the same as) those accorded to the U.S. embassy and diplomats by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=ADS Chapter 155|url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1868/155.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|page=Section 155.3.1.1.c|date=2004}}</ref>\n\nUSAID missions work in over fifty countries, consulting with their governments and non-governmental organizations to identify programs that will receive USAID's assistance. As part of this process, USAID missions conduct socioeconomic analysis, discuss projects with host-country leaders, design assistance to those projects, award contracts and grants, administer assistance (including evaluation and reporting), and manage flows of funds.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tarnoff|first1=Curt|title=U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID): Background, Operations, and Issues|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44117.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=July 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs countries develop and need less assistance, USAID shrinks and ultimately closes its resident missions.  USAID has closed missions in a number of countries that had achieved a substantial level of prosperity, including South Korea,<ref>{{cite web |title=South Korea: From Aid Recipient to Donor |url=https://photos.state.gov/libraries/korea/115197/kimnamhee/Korea%20case%20study%2020110615%20_corrected%2020111027%20TU_%20-%2050th.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> Turkey,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission Directory |url=https://www.usaid.gov/mission-directory |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> and Costa Rica.<ref>{{cite web |title=Costa Rica-United States Relations |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica%E2%80%93United_States_relations |publisher=Wikipedia |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=December 2019}}\n\nUSAID also closes missions when requested by host countries for political reasons.  In September 2012, the U.S. closed USAID/Russia at that country's request.  Its mission in [[Moscow]] had been in operation for two decades.<ref>{{cite news |title=USAID mission in Russia to close following Moscow decision |first=Arshad |last=Mohammed |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/18/us-usa-russia-aid-idUSBRE88H11E20120918 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=September 18, 2012 |accessdate=September 19, 2012}}</ref>  On May 1, 2013, the President of [[Bolivia]], [[Evo Morales]], asked USAID to close its mission, which had worked in the country for 49 years.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bolivia's President Morales expels USAID, accused it of working against him |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/bolivias-president-morales-expels-usaid-accused-it-of-working-against-him/2013/05/01/00e1ce28-b263-11e2-9fb1-62de9581c946_story.html |agency=[[Washington Post]] |date=May 1, 2013}}</ref>  The closure was completed on September 20, 2013.\n\nUSAID missions are led by Mission Directors and are staffed both by USAID [[Foreign Service Officers]] and by development professionals from the country itself, with the host-country professionals forming the majority of the staff.  The length of a Foreign Service Officer's \"tour\" in most countries is four years, to provide enough time to develop in-depth knowledge about the country.  (Shorter tours of one or two years are usual in countries of exceptional hardship or danger.)<ref>{{cite web |title=ADS Chapter 436: Foreign Service Assignments and Tours of Duty |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1877/436.pdf |publisher=USAID |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Mission Director is a member of the U.S. Embassy's \"Country Team\" under the direction of the U.S. Ambassador.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dorman |first1=Shawn |title=Foreign Service Work and Life: Embassy, Employee, Family |url=http://afsa.org/sites/default/files/iuse_country_team_local_staff_role.pdf |publisher=American Foreign Service Association |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>  As a USAID mission works in an unclassified environment with relative frequent public interaction, most missions were initially located in independent offices in the business districts of capital cities.

However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>  The technical offices that are frequently found in USAID missions include Health and Family Planning, Education, Environment, Democracy, and Economic Growth.\n\n====Health and Family Planning====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by missions' Health and Family Planning offices are projects for eradication of communicable diseases, strengthening of public health systems focusing on maternal-child health including family planning services, [[HIV/AIDS|HIV-AIDS]] monitoring, delivery of medical supplies including contraceptives and [[HIV]] vaccines, and coordination of Demographic and Health Surveys. This assistance is primarily targeted to the poor majority of the population and corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as strengthening the basis for socioeconomic development.\n\n====Education====\n\nUSAID's Education offices mainly assist the national school system, emphasizing broadening coverage of quality basic education to reach the entire population. Examples of projects often assisted by Education offices are projects for curriculum development, teacher training, and provision of improved textbooks and materials.  Larger programs have included school construction.  Education offices often manage scholarship programs for training in the U.S., while assistance to the country's universities and professional education institutions may be provided by Economic Growth and Health offices.  The Education office's emphasis on school access for the poor majority of the population corresponds to USAID's poverty relief objective, as well as to the socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Environment====\n\nExamples of projects assisted by Environment offices are projects for tropical forest conservation, protection of indigenous people's lands, regulation of marine fishing industries, pollution control, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and helping communities adapt to climate change.  Environment assistance corresponds to USAID's objective of technical cooperation on global issues, as well as laying a sustainable basis for USAID's socioeconomic development objective in the long term.\n\n====Democracy====\nExamples of projects assisted by Democracy offices are projects for the country's political institutions, including elections, political parties, legislatures, and human rights organizations.  Counterparts include the judicial sector and civil-society organizations that monitor government performance.  Democracy assistance received its greatest impetus at the time of the creation of the successor states to the USSR starting in about 1990, corresponding both to USAID's objective of supporting U.S. bilateral interests and to USAID's socioeconomic development objective.\n\n====Economic Growth====\n\nExamples of projects often assisted by Economic Growth offices are projects for improvements in agricultural techniques and marketing (the mission may have a specialized \"Agriculture\" office), development of microfinance industries, streamlining of Customs administrations (to accelerate growth of exporting industries), and modernization of government regulatory frameworks for industry in various sectors (telecommunications, agriculture, and so forth). [[File:USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms.jpg|thumb|USAID Firms Project's Agriculture Marketing Reforms]] In USAID's early years and in some larger programs, Economic Growth offices have financed economic infrastructure like roads and electrical power plants.  Economic Growth assistance is thus quite diverse in terms of the range of sectors where it may work.  It corresponds to USAID's socioeconomic development objective and is the source of sustainable poverty reduction.  Economic Growth offices also occasionally manage assistance to poverty relief projects, such as to government programs that provide \"cash transfer\" payments to low-income families.\n\n====Special assistance offices====\n\nSome USAID missions have specialized technical offices for areas like counter-narcotics assistance or assistance in conflict zones.\n\nDisaster assistance on a large scale is provided through USAID's [[Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance|Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance]].  Rather than having a permanent presence in country missions, this office has supplies pre-positioned in strategic locations to respond quickly to disasters when and where they occur.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/bureaus/bureau-democracy-conflict-and-humanitarian-assistance/office-us|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=November 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The Office of the Mission Director and the Program Office===\nThe Mission Director's signature authorizes technical offices to provide assistance according to the designs and budgets they propose.  With the help of the Program Office, the Mission Director ensures that designs are consistent with USAID policy for the country, including budgetary earmarks by which Washington directs that funds be used for certain general purposes such as public health or environmental conservation.  The Program Office compiles combined reports to Washington to support budget requests to Congress and to verify that budgets were used as planned.\n\n===Contracting, financial management and management offices===\nWhile the Mission Director is the public face and key decision-maker for an impressive array of USAID technical capabilities, arguably the offices that make USAID preeminent among U.S. government agencies in the ability to follow through on assistance agreements in low-income countries are the \"support\" offices.\n\n====Contracting offices====\n\nCommitments of U.S. government funds to NGOs and firms that implement USAID's assistance programs can only be made in compliance with carefully designed contracts and grant agreements executed by warranted Contracting and Agreement Officers.  The Mission Director is authorized to commit financial assistance directly to the country's government agencies.\n\n====Financial management offices====\n\nFunds can be committed only when the Mission's Controller certifies their availability for the stated purpose.  \"FM\" offices assist technical offices in financial analysis and in developing detailed budgets for inputs needed by projects assisted.  They evaluate potential recipients' management abilities before financial assistance can be authorized and then review implementers' expenditure reports with great care.  This office often has the largest number of staff of any office in the mission.\n\n====Management offices====\n\nCalled the \"Executive Office\" in USAID (sometimes leading to confusion with the Embassy's Executive Office, which is the office of the Ambassador), \"EXO\" provides operational support for mission offices, including human resources, information systems management, transportation, property and procurement services. Increasing integration into Embassies' chancery complexes, and the State Department's recently increased role in providing support services to USAID, is expanding the importance of coordination between USAID's EXO and the Embassy's Management section.\n\n==Assistance projects==\nWhile the terms \"assistance project\" and \"development project\" might sometimes be used indiscriminately, it helps in understanding USAID's work to make a distinction.  (1) Development is what developing countries do.  Development projects are projects of local government agencies and NGOs, such as projects to improve public services or business regulations, etc.  (2) Assistance is what USAID does.  USAID's assistance projects support local development projects.\n\nThe key to a successful development project is the institutional capacity of local organizations, including the professional ability of their staff members.  The key to successful assistance is how well it fits the needs of local development projects, including institutional capacity building and supporting professional education and training for staff.\n\nWhen a local development project's assistance needs have been identified, USAID arranges the agreed assistance through funding agreements with implementing organizations, referred to by USAID staff as \"implementing partners.\"  USAID finances several types of implementers using a variety of funding agreements.\n\nTo illustrate, USAID might assist a development project with inputs provided through several different funding agreements:\n\n# A budget-support grant to a government agency.\n# A contract with a firm for support to the agency.\n# A grant to a local NGO serving the beneficiary group.\n# A grant to an international NGO to strengthen the operations of the local NGO.\n\nEach of these types of USAID funding agreements is profiled below.\n\n===Budget support to a government agency===\nThis funding agreement would take the form of a letter from USAID's Mission Director, countersigned by the recipient agency, explaining the agency's objectives, the amount of USAID's financial commitment, the specific expenditures to be financed by USAID's grant, and other operational aspects of the agreement.\n\nUSAID's technical office would assign a staff member (U.S. or local) to oversee progress in the agency's implementation.  USAID's financial management office would transfer funds to the agency, in tranches as needed.  Audit under this kind of government-to-government (G2G) financial assistance is usually performed by the host government's own audit agency.\n\n===Contract for technical assistance to a government agency===\nAs a government agency is usually specialized in services to the beneficiary population (medical services, for example), its staff may not be equipped to undertake planning and evaluation, construction, acquisition of equipment, or management of training and study tours.  The government agency might, therefore, request USAID's assistance in these areas, and USAID could respond by contracting with a firm to supply the services or technical assistance requested.\n\nUSAID's technical office would collaborate with the government agency in drafting the specifications for what is needed (generally referred to as a \"Statement of Work\" for the contract) and in conducting market research for available sources and potential bidders.  USAID's Contracting Officer would then advertise for bids, manage the selection of a contractor from among the competing bidders, sign the contract, and assign a technical-office staff member as the Contracting Officer's Representative to oversee the performance under the contract.  (If the workload permits, this staff member might be the same person who oversees USAID's financial assistance to the government agency.)\n\nThe contractor supplies technical assistance directly to the government agency, so that in monitoring contractor performance USAID relies substantially on the agency's evaluation of the contractor's work.\n\n===Grant to finance NGO services to a beneficiary group===\nNon-governmental organizations are, like their government counterparts, usually already engaged in service provision in areas where USAID wants to assist, and they often have unique abilities that complement public programs.  Therefore, USAID technical-office staff might set aside a budget and, with the help of the mission's contracting office, publish a solicitation for applications from NGOs for financial assistance to their programs.  One or several grants could be made to selected NGOs by the contracting office's \"Agreement Officer.\"  Similar to the case of a contract, a USAID technical-office staff member would be assigned as the Agreement Officer's Representative to monitor progress in the NGOs' implementation and to arrange for external evaluations.  USAID grants require recipient NGOs to contract for external audits.\n\nAs some local NGOs may be small and young organizations with no prior experience in receiving awards from USAID, the USAID mission's financial management office reviews grant applicants' administrative systems to ensure that they are capable of managing USG funds.  Where necessary, USAID can devote part of the grant to the NGO's internal strengthening to help the NGO qualify for USAID's financing and build the capacity of the organization in the process.  Following completion of the NGO's internal strengthening, USAID would disburse financing for the NGO's service project.\n\n===Grant to international NGOs for technical assistance===\nInternational NGOs have their own development projects and capabilities.  If USAID and its counterparts determine that development objectives can best be met by supporting an NGO project, and if local NGO capacity is not yet sufficient, the relevant USAID technical office will draft a program description and the contracting office will issue as a request for applications to solicit responses from the international NGO community.  USAID manages the award and implementation processes in the same way as for local NGOs.\n\nAlso, international NGOs frequently make unsolicited proposals to USAID, requesting funding for their own planned assistance activities.  Where NGOs or business enterprises are dedicating a substantial amount of non-USG resources to their projects, they can receive USAID funding through \"Global Development Alliance\" grants, provided that the non-USG resources are at least equal in value to USAID's grant.\n\nIn general, USAID provides financial assistance to support other organizations' programs when those programs correspond to the areas that USAID wants to support, while USAID uses contracts to procure products or services requested by the leaders of local development projects.\n\n===Other mechanisms===\nIn addition to the types of projects described above, USAID uses various other assistance mechanisms for different U.S. objectives.  Budget agreements with other USG agencies are common in supporting collaboration between the U.S. and other countries on global issues.  Large budget-support grants, referred to as \"non-project\" assistance, may be made to recipient governments to pursue U.S. foreign policy interests.\n\n==History==\nWhen the USG created USAID in November 1961, it built on a legacy of previous development-assistance agencies and their people, budgets, and operating procedures. USAID's predecessor agency was already substantial, with 6,400 U.S. staff in developing-country field missions in 1961.  Except for the peak years of the Vietnam War, 1965\u201370, that was more U.S. field staff than USAID would have in the future, and triple the number USAID has had in field missions in the years since 2000.<ref>Data from USAID reports, \"Distribution of Personnel as of June 30, 1949 thru 1976,\" \"Supporting the USAID Mission, and the \"USAID Staffing Report to Congress\" of 2016.  See full citations in \"References,\" below.</ref>\n\nAlthough the size of the development-assistance effort was not new, the 1961 decision to reorganize the USG's main development-assistance agency was a landmark in terms of institutional evolution, representing the culmination of twenty years' experience with different organizational forms and procedures, in changing foreign-policy environments.\n\nThe new structure created in 1961 \"proved to be sturdy and durable.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|page=60}}</ref> In particular, the USG has maintained since then \"the unique American pattern of placing strong resident aid missions in countries that [the U.S. was] helping.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|page=37}}</ref>\n\nThe story of how the base for USAID's structure was built is described below, along with an account of changes that have been made since 1961.<ref>A history of all the programs that USAID has supported since 1961, in scores of countries, plus the evolution of USG policies and academic theories about development and development assistance, to say nothing of the development in the low-income countries themselves, would require enough books to fill a library.  For a start, see Samuel Butterfield's ''U.S. Development Aid'' (2004).</ref>\n\n=== Before World War II ===\nThe realization that early industrializers like the United States could provide technical assistance to other countries' development efforts spread gradually in the late 1800s, leading to a substantial number of visits to other countries by U.S. technical experts, generally with official support by the U.S. Government even when the missions were unofficial. [[Japan]], China, Turkey, and several Latin American countries requested missions on subjects like fiscal management, monetary institutions, election management, mining, schooling, roads, flood control, and urban sanitation.  The U.S. Government also initiated missions, particularly to Central America and the Caribbean, when it felt that U.S. interests might be affected by crises like failed elections, debt defaults, or spread of infectious disease.<ref>Merle Curti and Kendall Birr, \"Prelude to Point Four: American Technical Missions Overseas, 1838\u20131938\" (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1954).</ref>\n\nU.S. technical missions in this era were not, however, part of a systematic, USG-supported program.  Possibly the closest approximation to what USG development assistance would become was the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinafound.org.tw/ec99/eshop1387/e_profile.asp | title=China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture}}</ref> established by the USG in 1924 using funds provided by China as reparations following the \"Boxer\" conflict.  The Foundation's activities ranged widely and included support for development of a leading Chinese university, [[Tsinghua University]].\n\nA notable early example of U.S. Government foreign assistance for disaster relief was its contribution to the 1915 [[Committee for Relief in Belgium]] headed by [[Herbert Hoover]], to prevent starvation in [[Belgium]] after the German invasion.  After World War I in 1919, the USG created the American Relief Administration, also headed by Hoover, which provided food primarily in Eastern Europe.\n\nBetween the two world wars, however,  U.S. assistance in low-income countries was often the product of private initiative, including the work of private foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation and the Near East Foundation.<ref>For information on the Near East Foundation, see {{cite web|title=Near East Foundation|url=http://www.neareast.org/}}  Also {{cite book|last1=Badeau|first1=John S.|last2=Stevens|first2=G.

Since countries in the region were regularly requesting expert assistance from USG cabinet departments, an Interdepartmental Committee on Cooperation with the American Republics was established in 1938, with the State Department in the chair, to ensure systematic responses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Records of Interdepartmental Committees|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/353.html|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Glick|first1=Philip|title=The Administration of Technical Assistance|date=1957|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|pages=7\u20139}}</ref>\n\nMore ambitiously, the U.S. subsequently created an institution that for the first time would take an active role in development assistance programming: the Institute of Inter-American Affairs (IIAA), chartered in March 1942. The Institute was the initiative of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, Nelson Rockefeller, the future Vice President of the United States, whose family financed the Rockefeller Foundation. IIAA's 1,400 employees provided technical assistance across Central and South America for economic stabilization, food supply, health, and sanitation. U.S. benefits included development of sources for raw materials that had been disrupted by the war.<ref>Erb, Claude (1985). \"Prelude to Point Four: The Institute of Inter-American Affairs\".

On the basis of positive evaluations from the U.S. Ambassadors in Latin America, the State Department succeeded in getting Congressional authorization to extend IIAA, initially through 1950 and then through 1955.<ref>Glick (1957), pp. 26\u201328</ref> Some existing USG technical-assistance agencies continued work in parallel with IIAA.  In particular, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Foreign Agricultural Relations (OFAR) continued to operate separately until 1954.<ref>OFAR was an office in USDA between 1939 and 1953.

The revised operating procedure was modeled on reforms that had been pioneered by IIAA in March 1951.]</ref>\n\n=== Maturation of American development assistance institutions ===\n\nWhile USG development assistance was institutionalized on a nearly global scale by TCA, strong currents of change in U.S. foreign economic policy during the 1950s affected how development assistance worked and at times called its continued existence into question.  When this process finally resulted in the creation USAID in 1961, USAID continued to use TCA's core mechanism \u2014 providing technical assistance led by in-country resident offices \u2014 and supplemented it with substantial amounts of financial assistance.\n\n==== Post-war foreign aid ====\n\nPoint Four and TCA had been established in the context of a number of other programs in the large-scale U.S. foreign aid effort of the 1940s.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953).</ref> Already during the war, in 1943, the U.S. (jointly with its wartime allies, referred to collectively as \"the United Nations\") established the \"United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration\" ([[UNRRA]]) for war-affected parts of Europe, China, the Philippines, Korea, and Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ninth and Final Financial Report of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration |date=March 1949 |publisher=UNRRA |location=Washington, D.C. |page=25 |hdl=2027/nnc1.cu03384870 }}</ref> Immediately after the war, the USG supplied relief in Germany and Japan, funded by appropriations for \"Government and Relief in Occupied Areas\" ([[GARIOA]]).<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 108\u2013109.</ref>\n\nRelief was quickly followed by reconstruction assistance.  In 1946, the U.S. created a special financial-assistance program for rehabilitation of war damages in its former possession, the Philippines.<ref>By the program's completion in March 1951, the U.S. had provided $388 million for private property claims and $55 million for public property reconstruction.  (See {{cite book |last1=Waring |first1=Frank A. |last2=Delgado |first2=Francisco A. |last3=O'Donnell |first3=John A. |title=Rehabilitation of the Philippines: Final and Ninth Semiannual Report of the United States Philippine War Damage Commission |date=March 31, 1951 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington D.C. |hdl=2027/mdp.39015039449130 }})  The following month, in April 1951, the U.S. and the Philippines signed an agreement for the U.S. to open an aid office (a Special Technical and Economic Mission). (See {{cite book |title=Thirteenth Report to Congress of the Economic Cooperation Administration: Supplement |pages=58\u201365 |hdl=2027/umn.31951d03727992c }})</ref> In 1948, reconstruction assistance was expanded through the [[Marshall Plan]], implemented by the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), mainly for Western Europe. In the same year, the U.S. and China established the [[Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]],<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 341\u2013342.</ref> which, starting on the mainland and continuing for two decades in Taiwan, provided sustained development assistance.\n\nAlso, the [[Fulbright Program]] of academic exchanges was established in 1946, globalizing the wartime program of exchange visits between professionals from Latin America and the United States.\n\nIn contrast to the [[Marshall Plan]], Point Four focussed on technical assistance and provided financial assistance only in limited amounts to support its technical initiatives. In terms of geographic focus, while the two programs mainly operated in different countries, the Marshall Plan also expanded into developing nations.  In particular, the Marshall Plan financed activities in parts of the Middle East, in overseas territories of European allies (principally in Africa), and in \"the general area of China\" (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines), where it operated through Special Technical and Economic Missions (STEMs).  The STEMs were set up in 1950 and 1951, and had a \"Point Four character\" in the sense that they emphasized services by technical experts.<ref>Hayes (1971), pp. 44\u201352.</ref>  Minimizing overlaps with the Marshall Plan, Point Four managed assistance mainly in Latin America (via IIAA), in North Africa and Eritrea, in parts of the Middle East, and in India, Pakistan, and Ceylon.<ref>Brown & Opie (1953), pp. 412\u2013414.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also participated in post-1945 UN initiatives for technical assistance to developing countries.  Through a series of actions in 1948 and 1949, the UN's General Assembly and Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) created the [[Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance]] (EPTA).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jolly|first1=Richard|last2=Emmerji|first2=Louis|last3=Ghai|first3=Dharam|last4=Lapeyre|first4=Frederic|title=UN Contributions to Development Thinking and Practice|date=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=68\u201373}}</ref>  The U.S. provided 60% of EPTA's financing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirdar|first1=\u00dcner|title=The Structure of United Nations Economic-Aid to Underdeveloped Countries|url=https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird|url-access=registration|date=1966|publisher=M. Nijhoff|location=The Hague|page=[https://archive.org/details/structureofunite0000kird/page/60 60]}}</ref> By 1955, EPTA adopted a country-led approach where the UN's TA in each country was programmed according to a plan drawn up by the receiving country in consultation with the UN.  ECOSOC also created a new Technical Assistance Board, which (similarly to the USG's wartime Interdepartmental Committee) coordinated the TA being provided to low-income countries by various individual UN agencies.\n\n==== Korean War ====\n\nCoordination between development assistance and the Marshall Plan was tightened in response to the 1950\u201351 war in Korea.  In October 1951 Congress passed the [[Mutual Security Act]], creating the Mutual Security Agency (MSA), which reported directly to the President and supervised both civilian and military assistance. MSA increased the emphasis on large-scale financial assistance to U.S. allies, which was provided as civilian \"economic assistance\" but was intended to help the allies to make greater military efforts and was therefore often called \"defense support.\"<ref>The name under which Congress appropriates these funds has changed over time, becoming \"Supporting Assistance\" in 1961, \"Security Supporting Assistance\" in 1971, and finally \"Economic Support Funds\" from 1978 to the present. See Nowels (1987), pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe Mutual Security Agency absorbed the Marshall Plan (the ECA), which otherwise had been scheduled to end in 1952.  The Technical Cooperation Administration remained a semi-autonomous agency in the State Department to administer Point Four, but after 1951 under the supervision of MSA.<ref>Butterfield (2004), p. 37.</ref> Under this coordinated approach, the policy was adopted that ECA and TCA would not both operate in the same country (\"one country \u2014 one agency\").  Accordingly, each agency transferred programs to the other and closed down in some countries.<ref>Bingham (2004), pp. 262\u2013263.</ref> For example, in Indonesia and Burma, ECA closed its financial-assistance programs, while TCA initiated technical assistance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oral History Interview with Stanley Andrews |url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/andrewss.htm |publisher=Harry S. Truman Library & Museum |accessdate=22 April 2019 |pages=42\u201344}}</ref>\n\n==== Eisenhower administration ====\n\nIn 1953, the Eisenhower administration took office.  The President's party, which had been out of the White House since 1933,<ref>The only times the Republican Party had a majority in either house in the 48-year span from 1933 to 1981 was when it enjoyed small majorities in both houses of the 80th Congress in 1947\u20131949 under Pres. Truman and both houses of the 83rd Congress 1953\u20131955 under Pres. Eisenhower.</ref> took a critical view of the previous administrations' policies, including both the globalizing policies of the 1940s and the New Deal initiatives of the 1930s.<ref>The New Deal's Tennessee Valley Authority was the model for some major development assistance projects. See Ekbladh (2002).</ref>\n \nAn overall goal of the new administration was to administer the government efficiently and cut spending.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 14.</ref> While TCA's technical assistance to developing countries was a small budget item and was considered a long-term program (although fresh funds were appropriated annually), \"economic assistance\" (or \"defense support\") was considered an inherently short-term measure.<ref>Bingham (1953), p. 38.</ref> In place of U.S. economic assistance, the Eisenhower administration proposed that U.S. allies should increasingly finance themselves through their own exports: in other words, through \"trade not aid.\"<ref>Kaufman (1982), ch. 2, pp. 12\u201333.</ref>  With respect to financial assistance for developing countries, the policy was maintained that it should be provided primarily by the U.S. Export-Import Bank and by the World Bank,<ref>U.S. documents of the 1950s usually referred to the World Bank as \"the International Bank.\"</ref> and that it should be available only on commercial terms and primarily to finance private investment.<ref>Glick (1957), pp. 130\u2013136: \"The Relation of Technical Co-operation to Economic Aid.\"</ref>\n\nTo administer the foreign assistance more efficiently, President Eisenhower integrated management into a single agency, the newly created Foreign Operations Administration (FOA).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on the Organization of the Executive Branch for the Conduct of Foreign Affairs |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-the-organization-the-executive-branch-for-the-conduct-foreign |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=26 April 2019 |date=June 1, 1953}}</ref> MSA, TCA (which had been under MSA's direction), and IIAA (which had been part of TCA) were all abolished as of August 1953 and their country offices became \"United States Operations Missions\" (USOMs) under FOA.<ref>Bingham (2004), p. 240.</ref> The President directed other USG agencies to put their technical assistance in developing countries under FOA's management as well. USDA in particular transferred OFAR's programs to FOA, while reconstituting the [[Foreign Agricultural Service]] for the task of building global markets for U.S. farm products.<ref>Glick (1957) p. 49.</ref>\n\nAdministrative functions were consolidated as the various agencies came into FOA, and the Mutual Security Act of July 1953 instructed FOA to reduce personnel by at least 10% within 120 days.<ref>{{cite web|last1=U.S. Government|title=Mutual Security Act of 1953|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-67/pdf/STATUTE-67-Pg152.pdf|at=Section 706(a)|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=July 16, 1953}}</ref> A large number of TCA's senior professionals were summarily dismissed, and FOA's administrator mounted an effort to compensate for lower USG staffing by drawing on experts from U.S. universities and private voluntary organizations.<ref>Ruttan (1996), p. 205.</ref>  The ExIm Bank's lending volume in developing countries was also cut dramatically in 1953.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 29\u201333.</ref>\n\nChanging world events and differences of opinion within the [[Eisenhower]] administration soon altered the administration's cutbacks, however.\n \nFirst, while a \"trade not aid\" strategy required the U.S. to import more goods from its allies, the administration was unable to convince Congress to liberalize import policy.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 37\u201346.</ref>  On the contrary, the main foreign commercial measure taken at this time went in the other direction: the U.S. ramped up subsidies for exports of U.S. agricultural products.  The 1953 amendment to the Mutual Security Act and the much larger Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, known as \"PL-480,\" allowed the U.S. Government to buy U.S. farm surpluses and sell them in developing countries for inconvertible local currencies.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 26\u201329.  Sen. Hubert Humphrey was a prominent supporter of the PL-480 concept.</ref><ref>A currency is \"inconvertible\" when the government forbids it to be used to buy foreign exchange, so that it can only be spent in the country that issues it.</ref> Much of PL-480's foreign-currency revenue was returned to developing countries as a supplement to U.S. development assistance.  PL-480 revenues in the first twenty years were sometimes huge and although PL-480 has become smaller it continues to provide resources to USAID for nutrition and disaster relief programs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Food Assistance|url=https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security/food-assistance|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=2017}}</ref>\n \nSecond, several factors arose that favored large-scale economic assistance to developing countries, especially in Asia. [[South Korea]] needed massive economic assistance after an armistice was finally signed in July 1953,<ref>Mason, Kim ''et al''. (1980), chapter 6.</ref> and U.S. economic assistance to South Vietnam increased after the retreat of France in 1954.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 259\u2013260.</ref>  On a global scale, the Cold War after the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 evolved in the direction of rivalry over influence in low-income countries who were seeking financing for their development initiatives. India was a particular case of a country where the U.S. felt it needed to provide economic assistance to balance the USSR's influence, even though India was not a U.S. military ally.<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 72\u201373.</ref>  These considerations led to advocacy of expanded economic assistance by several voices within the Eisenhower administration: the FOA Director, former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen; C.D. Jackson, from the Time-Life publishing business (who draw on advice from MIT economists Millikan and Rostow); the State Department; and the National Security Council.\n \nAs a result, the USG took several steps in the course of 1954 and 1955 to raise the profile of development assistance.\n\nIn June 1954, the USG raised the ExIm Bank's lending authority from $4.5 billion to $5 billion.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 32.</ref>  Pres. Eisenhower also created in December 1954 a Cabinet-level Council on Foreign Economic Policy,<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 37.</ref> which in March 1955 recommended expanded soft loans for development.  In April 1955, Pres. Eisenhower proposed a special economic fund for Asia.<ref name=\"Kaufman 1982, p. 52\"/>\n\nTo implement Congress's August 1954 decision that technical assistance for developing countries should be put back under the State Department,<ref>{{cite web|last1=U.S. Government|title=Mutual Security Act of 1953|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-67/pdf/STATUTE-67-Pg152.pdf|accessdate=21 June 2017|date=1953}}</ref> Pres.

Eisenhower and Congress conducted in 1956 a number of studies to give foreign aid policy a more solid basis.

Jackson had circulated in 1954.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1951900|title = Foreign Aid and the Policy Process: 1957|journal = The American Political Science Review|volume = 52|issue = 3|pages = 689\u2013724|last1 = Haviland|first1 = H.

See Ruttan (1996), pp. 89\u201391.</ref> Personnel changes soon reflected this change in the administration's view: Christian Herter succeeded Herbert Hoover Jr. as Under Secretary of State in February 1957, Robert Anderson succeeded George Humphrey as Treasury Secretary in July 1957, and James H. Smith Jr. replaced John Hollister as ICA Director in September 1957.<ref>Haviland (1958), pp. 690, 691, 696.</ref>\n \nPres. Eisenhower summarized the conclusions in his May 21, 1957 message to Congress: \"This past year ... Congressional Committees, the Executive Branch and distinguished private citizens have just examined these programs anew. ... I recommend the following legislative actions: ... economic development assistance should be provided primarily through loans, on a continuing basis, and related closely to technical assistance. ... I recommend a clear separation of military and defense support assistance on the one hand, from economic development assistance on the other. ... I recommend that longterm [sic] development assistance be provided from a Development Loan Fund. ... Such loans should not compete with or replace such existing sources of credit as private investors, the International Bank [the World Bank], or the Export-Import Bank. ... I believe the Fund should be established and administered in the International Cooperation Administration. ... The technical cooperation program is one of the most valuable elements of our entire mutual security effort. It also should be continued on a long-term basis and must be closely related to the work of the Fund.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on the Mutual Security Programs |date=May 21, 1957 |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-the-mutual-security-programs |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC-\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n \nAs a result, the Development Loan Fund was established in August 1957. The DLF largely financed infrastructure (such as railroads, highways, and power plants), factories, and agriculture with loans whose terms were relatively \"soft\" in the sense of charging interest rates lower than commercial levels and being repayable in local currency rather than U.S. dollars.<ref>Local-currency repayments were adjusted when exchange rates changed to maintain their value in terms of U.S. dollars.</ref> Some projects were financed by a combination of a DLF soft loan and a harder World Bank loan.<ref>{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Terminal Report of the Development Loan Fund|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pdabc787.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2017|pages=3\u20134|date=1962}}</ref> Operationally, the DLF became administratively self-contained by 1959 after contracting for administrative support from ICA for its first two years.<ref>Terminal Report of the DLF, p. 6.</ref> Also, the Export-Import Bank's lending limit was raised in 1958 from $5 billion to $7 billion,<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 167</ref> and the administration advocated in January 1959 an expanded \"food for peace\" program.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Special Message to the Congress on Agriculture |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/special-message-the-congress-agriculture-3 |date=January 29, 1959 |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC\u2013Santa Barbara |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe overall trend in USG development-assistance activity in the 1950s is indicated by the change in the number of U.S. staff in field missions, which during Pres.

The U.S. supported their involvement through several multilateral initiatives.\n\nThree of these initiatives expanded World Bank facilities.\n\nIn November 1954, the U.S. decided to endorse the World Bank's proposed International Finance Corporation, which would raise funds from global capital markets to lend to the private sector in developing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), pp. 46\u201349.</ref> The IFC was finally established in 1956.\n\nWith Senator [[Mike Monroney]] playing a prominent role, Congress approved in July 1958 another new World Bank facility, the International Development Association (IDA).  Funded by grants from industrialized countries, the IDA would make low-interest credits to developing countries for projects like public works.  The IDA formally came into being in September 1960, with the U.S. contributing 42% of its initial resources.<ref>Mason, Edward; Asher, Robert (1973). ''The World Bank Since Bretton Woods''. Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution. pp. 381\u2013389.</ref><ref>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/ida-articlesofagreement.pdf International Development Association. \"Articles of Agreement, Schedule A\"]\nIDA-articlesofagreement.pdf.

P, & Webb, R. Charles. (1997). ''The World Bank : its first half century'' (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution), p. 929.</ref>\n\nWhile the U.S. supported expanded World Bank facilities, it did not support the proposal for a Special UN Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED). The UN did create a \"Special Fund\" in 1957, but it was limited to designing projects for the UN's technical assistance program, EPTA, and could not finance public works.<ref>Jolly ''et al.'' (2004), pp. 73\u201383.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. also adopted a regional initiative with [[Latin America]].  Through most of the 1950s, the U.S. concentrated on technical assistance in the region.  Financial assistance sources were limited to the Eximbank and the World Bank, with the U.S. opposing proposals for a regional development bank.  However, events in 1958 \u2014 notably a riot during Vice President Nixon's visit to [[Caracas, Venezuela]] in May 1958 \u2014 resulted in a reversal of the U.S. position in August 1958.  With U.S. support, the Organization of American States created in April 1959 the Inter-American Development Bank, most of whose capital was contributed by the borrowing countries.<ref>Kaufman (1982), p. 161-162.</ref>\n\nTo further engage other wealthy countries in development assistance, the USG supported the creation of the Aid India Consortium in August 1958. This was the first of several informal groupings of donors focussing on particular countries.\n\nThe USG also supported the Organization of European Economic Co-operation (the European Marshall Plan organization) in creating a Development Assistance Group in January 1960.<ref>{{cite web |last1=OECD |title=DAC in Dates: The History of OECD's Development Assistance Committee |url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/1896808.pdf |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=2006}} As the organization broadened its membership and became the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ([[OECD]]) in 1961, the Development Assistance Group was re-named the [[Development Assistance Committee]], or DAC.</ref>\n\n=== Creation of USAID and the Development Decade ===\nAt the end of the 1950s, the momentum in favor of development assistance\u2014as represented by PL-480, new mechanisms for financial assistance, larger U.S. budgets and staffing, and multilateral initiatives\u2014picked up support from Senator John F. Kennedy, who was preparing to be a candidate for the presidency. In 1957, JFK proposed, in bipartisan collaboration with Sen. John Sherman Cooper (a former U.S. Ambassador to India), a major expansion of U.S. economic support for India. As a candidate in 1960, he supported the emphasis on humanitarian goals for PL-480 set by Sen. Hubert Humphrey's \"Food for Peace\" Act of 1959<ref>Ruttan (1996), pp. 156\u2013159.</ref> and supported the idea of a [[Peace Corps]] that was under development thanks to the initiatives of Sen. Humphrey, Rep. Reuss, and Sen. Neuberger.  {{Crossreference| (See the \"History\" section of [[Peace Corps]].)}}<ref>Until 1973, USAID and its predecessors also supported [[International Voluntary Services]], which was founded in 1953.

On March 22, he sent a special message to Congress on foreign aid, asserting that the 1960s should be a \"Decade of Development\" and proposing to unify U.S. development assistance administration into a single agency.  He sent a proposed \"Act for International Development\" to Congress in May and the resulting \"Foreign Assistance Act\" was approved in September, repealing the Mutual Security Act.  In November, Pres. Kennedy signed the act and issued an Executive Order tasking the Secretary of State to create, within the State Department, the \"Agency for International Development\" (or A.I.D.: subsequently re-branded as USAID),<ref>The names of predecessor agencies often continued in popular usage.  In Vietnam in the 1960s, it was common to refer to A.I.D.'s office as \"USOM,\" while in Peru A.I.D. telephone operators continued in the 1960s to answer calls saying \"Punto Cuatro\" (Point Four).</ref> as the successor to both ICA and the Development Loan Fund.<ref>In 1966, the UN would also integrate its EPTA and the Special Fund into a new agency, the UN Development Program, or UNDP.</ref>\n\nWith these actions, the U.S. created a permanent agency working with administrative autonomy under the policy guidance of the State Department to implement, through resident field missions, a global program of both technical and financial development assistance for low-income countries.

Through TV and internet ads as well as social media initiatives, FWD encouraged Americans to spread awareness about the crisis, support the humanitarian organizations that were conducting relief operations, and consult the Feed the Future global initiative for broader solutions. Celebrities [[Geena Davis]], [[Uma Thurman]], [[Josh Hartnett]] and [[Chanel Iman]] took part in the campaign via a series of Public Service Announcements. Corporations like [[Cargill]], [[General Mills]], [[PepsiCo.]] and [[General Mills]] also signed on to support FWD.<ref>[http://adage.com/article/goodworks/psas-fwd-awareness-horn-africa-crisis/230640/ \"New PSAs: 'FWD' Awareness About the Horn of Africa Crisis\"].

Debates of this kind are arbitrated in Washington by Congress and the Administration before budgets are decided and before USAID staff undertake detailed programming in the field.  The result is normally that USAID's programs in a given country pursue a mix of goals.\n\n===Modes of assistance===\nSome feel that USAID overemphasizes technical assistance and should instead provide more financial assistance (budget support, or debt relief).  They argue that financial assistance allows recipients to spend as they like with less influence from donors.  Others feel that financial assistance does not result in durable improvements and that person-to-person technical assistance has the advantage of sharing knowledge and experience, leading to permanent improvements.\n\nIn practice, many USAID missions find that their counterparts appreciate having both forms of aid: an assistance package that includes some financial assistance for things that can simply be bought and some technical assistance to confront problems and issues whose solutions are not so clear.\n\n===Cost of delivering assistance===\nUSAID is frequently criticized for providing expensive expert services to counterparts.  The majority of the staff that USAID finances are from the country itself, but USAID is also able to recruit internationally when necessary to meet the counterpart's needs.  USAID uses competition to arrive at market rates for the staff it recruits, and has experimented with volunteer programs for expertise from high paid professions.\n\n===Non-career contracts===\nUSAID frequently contracts with private firms or individuals for specialist services lasting from a few weeks to several years.  It has long been asked whether USAID should more often assign such tasks to career U.S. Government employees instead.  USG staff directly performed technical assistance in the earliest days of the program in the 1940s.  However, it soon became necessary for the USG's technical experts to plan and manage larger assistance programs than they could perform by themselves. The global expansion of TA in the early 1950s reinforced the need to draw on outside experts, which was also accelerated by Congress's requirement of major reductions of USG staffing in 1953.  By 1955, observers commented on a perceived shift towards more use of shorter-term contracts (rather than using employees with career-length contracts).<ref>See {{cite book|last1=Richardson|title=Partners in Development|pages=13\u201314, 37}} Also {{cite book|last1=Butterfield|title=U.S. Development Aid|pages=25\u201326}}</ref>\n\n===Anti-government programs===\nIn situations where the U.S. is hostile to the government of a country, USAID may be asked to undertake programs that the government would not accept and thus to operate without the government's knowledge.  This might include USAID support for opposition political movements that seek to remove the government.  Such \"political aid\" is criticized by some as being incompatible with USAID's role as an assistance or cooperation agency and as exposing USAID staff worldwide to the suspicion of being covertly engaged in subversion.  Similarly, USAID's participation in actions against foreign governments led by the U.S. military is criticized by some as inappropriate and as exposing USAID civilian staff to the dangers of military combat.  However, such political aid and joint civilian-military programs are supported by others as necessary to support U.S. geopolitical interests and to build democracy.\n\n===Economic interests===\nUSAID states that \"U.S. foreign assistance has always had the twofold purpose of furthering America's foreign policy interests in expanding democracy and free markets while improving the lives of the citizens of the developing world.\" However, non-government organization watch groups have noted that as much as 40% of aid to Afghanistan has found its way back to donor countries through awarding contracts at inflated costs.<ref>Richard Norton-Taylor [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/25/afghanistan.internationalaidanddevelopment1 40% of Afghan aid returns to donor countries, says report] ''guardian.co.uk'' 25 March 2008</ref>\n\nAlthough USAID officially selects contractors on a competitive and objective basis, watch dog groups, politicians, foreign governments and corporations have occasionally accused the agency of allowing its bidding process to be unduly influenced by the political and financial interests of its current Presidential administration. Under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], for instance, it emerged that all five implementing partners selected to bid on a $600 million Iraq reconstruction contract enjoyed close ties to the administration.<ref>Barbara Slavin [https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/iraq/2003-04-17-iraqdeal_x.htm Another Iraq deal rewards company with connections] ''[[USA Today]]'' 4/17/2003</ref><ref>Mark Tran [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/mar/31/iraq.usnews Halliburton misses $600m Iraq contract] ''guardian.oc.uk'' 31 March 2003</ref>\n\n===Political interests===\n[[File:USAID We dont need your aid criticism.jpg|thumb|Critical [[graffiti]] on a USAID Advertisement saying \"We dont need your aid\", [[West Bank]], Jan 2007]]\nSome critics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/sandels04262003.html |title=Robert Sandels: Cuba Crackdown: a Revolt Against Bush National Security Strategy? |publisher=Counterpunch.org |date=2002-05-20 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_dangl0208 |title=Undermining Bolivia |publisher=The Progressive |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23847990 |title=Bush aide resigns - Politics - White House - NBC News |publisher=NBC News |date=2008-03-28 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Golinger |first=Eva |url=http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/2600 |title=USAID in Bolivia and Venezuela: The Silent Subversion |publisher=venezuelanalysis.com |date=2007-09-12 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref> say that the US government gives aid to reward political and military partners rather than to advance genuine social or humanitarian causes abroad.

USAID spent $95,000 US in 2005 on a seminar in the Brazilian Congress to promote a reform aimed at pushing for legislation punishing party infidelity. According to USAID papers acquired by Folha under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], the seminar was planned to coincide with the eve of talks in that country's Congress on a broad political reform. The papers read that although the \"pattern of weak party discipline is found across the political spectrum, it is somewhat less true of parties on the liberal left, such as the [ruling] [[Worker's Party (Brazil)|Worker's Party]].\" The papers also expressed a concern about the \"'indigenization' of the conference so that it is not viewed as providing a U.S. perspective.\" The event's main sponsor was the [[International Republican Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u424786.shtml |title=''EUA tentaram influenciar reforma pol\u00edtica do Brasil'' |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2012, [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|ALBA]] countries (Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia,  Nicaragua, San Vicente y Las Granadinas, Dominica, Antigua y Barbuda) called on its members to expel USAID from their countries.<ref>[http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/7069 ALBA Expels USAID from Member Countries] Retrieved 2012-09-16</ref>\n\n===Influence on the United Nations===\nSeveral studies{{Which|date=April 2016}} suggest that foreign aid is used as a political weapon for the U.S. to elicit desired actions from other nations.
