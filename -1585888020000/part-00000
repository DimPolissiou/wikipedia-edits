Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Jane Seymour each gave him one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children eventually ascended to the throne as [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].\n\nCatherine Howard and Anne Boleyn were first cousins and were both beheaded. Several of Henry's wives worked in service to another wife, typically as a [[lady-in-waiting]]. Anne Boleyn served Catherine of Aragon, Jane Seymour served both Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, and Catherine Howard served Anne of Cleves.\n\n==Catherine of Aragon==\n{{Main|Catherine of Aragon}}\n[[File:Catalina de Arag\u00f3n, por un artista an\u00f3nimo.jpg|right|thumb|Catherine of Aragon]]\n[[Catherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Arag\u00f3n}}) was Henry's first wife.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Carolly |title=Great Harry: A Biography of Henry the VII |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-16858-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatharry00eric_0/page/48 48] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/greatharry00eric_0/page/48 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />  In modern sources her name is most commonly spelled ''Catherine'', although she spelled and signed her name with a \"K,\" which was an accepted spelling in England at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}</ref> After the death in 1502 of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until he came to the throne in 1509. Catherine became pregnant in 1510 but the girl was stillborn. She became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. She gave birth to a stillborn boy in 1513, and to another boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally she bore a healthy daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], in 1516. It was two years before she conceived again, the pregnancy ended with a short-lived girl. It is said{{by whom|date=March 2020}} that Henry truly loved Catherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times.\n\nHenry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that  Catherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21): \"If a man shall take his brother\u2019s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother\u2019s nakedness; they shall be childless.\u201d Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who refused to become his mistress. (He had already had and ended an affair with Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Despite the pope's refusal to annul the marriage Henry separated from Catherine in 1531. He ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court. On 23 May 1533,<ref name=\":1\">Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116</ref> Cranmer ruled the marriage to Catherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows). This led to England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church and the establishment of the [[Church of England]].\n\n[[William Shakespeare]], in the play [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry VIII'']], called Catherine \"The queen of earthly queens\" (2.4.138).\n\n==Anne Boleyn==\n{{Main|Anne Boleyn}}\n[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]\n[[Anne Boleyn]] ({{circa|1501|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne and her execution made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval at the start of the [[English Reformation]]. She was the daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and Lady [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), and she was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a lady-in-waiting to Queen [[Claude of France]].\n\nAnne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her, and she refused to become his mistress as her sister [[Mary Boleyn]] had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]] so that he could marry Anne. He wrote a love letter which provides evidence of some level of intimacy between them, in which he admires her \"pretty duckies\" (breasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}</ref> It eventually became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, so Henry began to break the power of the Catholic Church in England.\n\nHenry dismissed [[Thomas Wolsey]] from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain [[Thomas Cranmer]] appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\">\"Anne Boleyn 1507\u20131536.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref> She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of excommunication against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the Church of England was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\" />\nAnne was crowned Queen Consort of England on 1 June 1533, and she gave birth to Henry's second daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] on 7 September. She failed to produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, and the King grew tired of her and had their marriage annulled. [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] devised a plot to execute her.\n\nDespite unconvincing evidence she was found guilty, and beheaded on 19 May 1536 for adultery, incest, and high treason. After the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth I, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, she has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].\n\n==Jane Seymour==\n{{Main|Jane Seymour}}\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]\n[[Jane Seymour]] ({{circa|1508|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waiting.<ref>Jokinen, Anniina. \"[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]\" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.</ref> It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Almost a year and a half after marriage Jane gave birth to a male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later from postpartum complications. Henry apparently suffered genuine grief, as she was the only one of his queens to receive a Queen's burial, and when he died he was buried next to her.\n\n==Anne of Cleves==\n{{Main|Anne of Cleves}}\n[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]\n[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was a German princess<ref>\"Anne of Cleves.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref> and Henry's wife for just six months in 1540, from 6 January to 9 July. Henry may have referred to her as \"''A Flanders Mare''\", and the label has stuck.<ref>Burnett \"History of the Reformation of England\" Print</ref> Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for annulment. Anne did not resist the annulment, claiming the marriage had not been consummated, and was rewarded with a generous settlement including [[Hever Castle]], the former home of the Boleyns, Henry's former in-laws. She was given the name \"The King's Sister\", and was a lifelong friend to him and his children. She outlived the King and all his wives.\n\n==Catherine Howard==\n{{Main|Catherine Howard}}\n[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]\n[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540\u20131542, sometimes known as \"the rose without a\nthorn\". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.<ref>\"Catherine Howard.\" World Book Encyclopaedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref>\n\n==Catherine Parr==\n{{Main|Catherine Parr}}\n[[File:Catherine Parr from NPG.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Parr]]\n[[Catherine Parr]] (1512{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543\u20131547. She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm<!-- Bot generated title --> |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}<!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--></ref>\n\nCatherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.\n\nCatherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.\n\n==Ancestry==\nHenry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I of England]],<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', genealogical tables</ref> through more than one ancestor.<ref>{{cite

Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Jane Seymour each gave him one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children eventually ascended to the throne as [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].\n\nCatherine Howard and Anne Boleyn were first cousins and were both beheaded. Several of Henry's wives worked in service to another wife, typically as a [[lady-in-waiting]]. Anne Boleyn served Catherine of Aragon, Jane Seymour served both Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, and Catherine Howard served Anne of Cleves.\n\n==Catherine of Aragon==\n{{Main|Catherine of Aragon}}\n[[File:Catalina de Arag\u00f3n, por un artista an\u00f3nimo.jpg|right|thumb|Catherine of Aragon]]\n[[Catherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Arag\u00f3n}}) was Henry's first wife.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Carolly |title=Great Harry: A Biography of Henry the VII |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-0-312-16858-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatharry00eric_0/page/48 48] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/greatharry00eric_0/page/48 }}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />  In modern sources her name is most commonly spelled ''Catherine'', although she spelled and signed her name with a \"K,\" which was an accepted spelling in England at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}</ref> After the death in 1502 of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until he came to the throne in 1509. Catherine became pregnant in 1510 but the girl was stillborn. She became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. She gave birth to a stillborn boy in 1513, and to another boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally she bore a healthy daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], in 1516. It was two years before she conceived again, the pregnancy ended with a short-lived girl. It is said{{by whom|date=March 2020}} that Henry truly loved Catherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times.\n\nHenry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that  Catherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21): \"If a man shall take his brother\u2019s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother\u2019s nakedness; they shall be childless.\u201d Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who refused to become his mistress. (He had already had and ended an affair with Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Despite the pope's refusal to annul the marriage Henry separated from Catherine in 1531. He ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court. On 23 May 1533,<ref name=\":1\">Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116</ref> Cranmer ruled the marriage to Catherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows). This led to England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church and the establishment of the [[Church of England]].\n\n[[William Shakespeare]], in the play [[Henry VIII (play)|''Henry VIII'']], called Catherine \"The queen of earthly queens\" (2.4.138).\n\n==Anne Boleyn==\n{{Main|Anne Boleyn}}\n[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne Boleyn]]\n[[Anne Boleyn]] ({{circa|1501|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne and her execution made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval at the start of the [[English Reformation]]. She was the daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and Lady [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), and she was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a lady-in-waiting to Queen [[Claude of France]].\n\nAnne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her, and she refused to become his mistress as her sister [[Mary Boleyn]] had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]] so that he could marry Anne. He wrote a love letter which provides evidence of some level of intimacy between them, in which he admires her \"pretty duckies\" (breasts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}</ref> It eventually became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, so Henry began to break the power of the Catholic Church in England.\n\nHenry dismissed [[Thomas Wolsey]] from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain [[Thomas Cranmer]] appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\">\"Anne Boleyn 1507\u20131536.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref> She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of excommunication against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the Church of England was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.<ref name=\"wbe-boleyn\" />\nAnne was crowned Queen Consort of England on 1 June 1533, and she gave birth to Henry's second daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] on 7 September. She failed to produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, and the King grew tired of her and had their marriage annulled. [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] devised a plot to execute her.\n\nDespite unconvincing evidence she was found guilty, and beheaded on 19 May 1536 for adultery, incest, and high treason. After the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth I, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, she has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].\n\n==Jane Seymour==\n{{Main|Jane Seymour}}\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]\n[[Jane Seymour]] ({{circa|1508|lk=yes}}{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waiting.<ref>Jokinen, Anniina. \"[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]\" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.</ref> It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Almost a year and a half after marriage Jane gave birth to a male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later from postpartum complications. Henry apparently suffered genuine grief, as she was the only one of his queens to receive a Queen's burial, and when he died he was buried next to her.\n\n==Anne of Cleves==\n{{Main|Anne of Cleves}}\n[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]\n[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was a German princess<ref>\"Anne of Cleves.\" World Book Encyclopedia. \"19th ed\". 2001.

Henry may have referred to her as \"''A Flanders Mare''\", and the label has stuck.<ref>Burnett \"History of the Reformation of England\" Print</ref> Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for annulment. Anne did not resist the annulment, claiming the marriage had not been consummated, and was rewarded with a generous settlement including [[Hever Castle]], the former home of the Boleyns, Henry's former in-laws. She was given the name \"The King's Sister\", and was a lifelong friend to him and his children. She outlived the King and all his wives.\n\n==Catherine Howard==\n{{Main|Catherine Howard}}\n[[File:HowardCatherine02.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Howard]]\n[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540\u20131542, sometimes known as \"the rose without a\nthorn\". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.<ref>\"Catherine Howard.\" World Book Encyclopaedia. \"19th ed\". 2001. Print.</ref>\n\n==Catherine Parr==\n{{Main|Catherine Parr}}\n[[File:Catherine Parr from NPG.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Parr]]\n[[Catherine Parr]] (1512{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543\u20131547. She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm<!-- Bot generated title --> |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}<!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--></ref>\n\nCatherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.\n\nCatherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.\n\n==Ancestry==\nHenry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I of England]],<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', genealogical tables</ref> through more than one ancestor.<ref>{{cite

Soon after, he appeared in commercials for products such as [[Pepsi-Cola]].\n\nHe began his career with bit parts in smaller movies, including ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'' (invited on the set by [[Mae West]]<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/>), ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'', and ''[[The Seven Minutes (film)|The Seven Minutes]]''. He appeared in a number of TV series, mini-series and TV movies. He was also the face of Marlboro cigarettes as the Marlboro Man and [[Revlon]]'s Chaz cologne.<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/> Selleck appeared in the commercial for [[Right Guard]] deodorant in 1971, with [[Farrah Fawcett]] in 1972 for the [[aperitif]] [[Dubonnet]], and another in 1977 for the toothpaste [[Close-Up (toothpaste)|Close-Up]].  He was also in a Safeguard deodorant soap commercial (date not available). In 1972, he starred in the B-movie ''[[Daughters of Satan]]''. Still struggling as an unfamiliar TV actor, Selleck had a recurring role in the 1970s as private investigator Lance White in ''[[The Rockford Files]]''.\n\nSelleck is an avid [[outdoorsman]], marksman and [[firearms]] collector. These interests led him to leading-man [[cowboy]] roles in [[Western films]], starting with his role as cowboy and frontier marshal [[Sackett|Orrin Sackett]] in the 1979 film ''[[The Sacketts]]'', opposite [[Sam Elliott]], [[Jeff Osterhage]], and Western legends [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]]. He followed ''The Sacketts'' with ''[[The Shadow Riders (film)|The Shadow Riders]]'' in 1982, then portraying a cat burglar in 1930s London in ''Lassiter'' in 1984.  ''Quigley Down Under'' is probably one of his best-known Western films, although he won a \"Western Heritage Award\" for his 1997 role in ''[[Last Stand at Saber River]]''. In 1979 he starred in ''[[Concrete Cowboys (1979 film)|Concrete Cowboys]]'' with [[Jerry Reed]].\n\n===Magnum stardom===\n[[File:Princess Diana and Tom Selleck at White House C31879-14.jpg|thumb|Selleck meeting [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] at the [[White House]] in November 1985.

Diana is wearing the [[Travolta dress]].]]\nSelleck was an accessible actor, but spent years receiving little interest from the entertainment industry. His big break came when he was cast in the lead role as Thomas Magnum in ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''. The producers would not release the actor for other projects, so Selleck had to pass on the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', which then went to ''[[Star Wars]]'' alumnus [[Harrison Ford]]. It turned out that the shooting of the pilot for ''Magnum'' was delayed for over six months by a [[List of Hollywood strikes|writers' strike]], which would have enabled him to complete ''Raiders''.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://siouxcityjournal.com/entertainment/television/tom-selleck-recalls-magnum-looks-to-blue-bloods-for-change/article_8bf13baf-850b-5a0a-8a70-f7d448cac369.html | title = Tom Selleck recalls 'Magnum,' looks to 'Blue Bloods' for change | first = Bruce R. | last = Miller | work = Sioux City Journal | date = September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Look, I made a deal with Magnum and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.

Magnum was a former [[U.S. Navy]] Officer, a veteran of a Special Operations unit, \"SEAL\" in the Vietnam War, and later a member of the \"Naval Intelligence Agency\" (a fictional version of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]), who had resigned his commission with the Navy to become a private investigator living in Hawaii.  The show would go on for eight seasons and 163 episodes until 1988, winning him an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/tom-selleck | title = Tom Selleck Emmy Award Winner | publisher = Emmys.com | accessdate = December 27, 2013}}</ref> for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in [[36th Primetime Emmy Awards|1984]].\n\nSelleck was famous for his mustache, a Hawaiian-style [[aloha shirt]], a [[Detroit Tigers]] baseball cap, and a Colt MKIV/Series 70 Government Model handgun (a commercial version of the U.S. Military M1911A1) which his character regularly carried. The actual prop from the show was a 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, serial number 70L33101, used for its reliable functioning with readily available blanks; although the original gun was a traditional .45 ACP 1911.  Magnum also used a Star Model B, another 9mm similar to the M1911A1, and a Detonics Pocket 9 during the series.\n\nMagnum drove a [[Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308 GTS]] in the series. The model became so identified with the role that Ferrari fans now refer to the red-painted model as a \"Magnum\" Ferrari.\n\nAfter the end of the show in 1988, it established itself as the top-rated one-hour show in the history of syndicated reruns (at least until 1998).<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1998-02-21-9802210041-story.html|title=Tom Selleck just does what feels right|website=Chicagotribune.com|date=21 February 1998|author=Mike Duffy}}</ref> Selleck confirmed that he was the most popular choice by fans to play the role of Magnum in the once-rumored ''Magnum, P.I.'' movie.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0698726/ | title = Selleck Wants Back in the Magnum Driver's Seat | website = IMDb.com | date = March 4, 2009 |access-date=July 24, 2016}}</ref> In 1984, he introduced [[Nancy Reagan]] at the [[1984 Republican National Convention]].<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/> Selleck was offered the lead role of Mitch Buchannon in ''[[Baywatch]]'', but turned down the role because he did not want to be seen as a sex symbol. The role eventually went to [[David Hasselhoff]].\n\nDuring the Magnum years, he also starred as an [[acrophobia|acrophobic]] police detective in ''[[Runaway (1984 film)|Runaway]]'' and a stand-in father in ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''.\n\n===TV and advertising===\n[[File:Tom Selleck 2010.jpg|thumb|Tom Selleck at the 2010 Summer Session of the Television Critics Association]]\nIn 1990, he starred as an American 19th-century sharpshooter in the [[Western (genre)#Meat pie Western|Australian western]] ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'', a role and film that he considers one of his best. During the 1990s, he also starred in ''[[Three Men and a Little Lady]]'', ''[[High Road to China]]'', ''[[Lassiter (film)|Lassiter]]'', ''[[Her Alibi]]'', ''[[An Innocent Man (film)|An Innocent Man]]'', ''[[Folks!

Richard was a divorced [[ophthalmologist]] who was a friend of Monica's parents, and at first the relationship was hidden from her parents. The relationship eventually ended over Richard's reluctance to commit to having children, though Selleck did make a few more appearances in later episodes. His decision to star in a six-episode plot of ''Friends'' was seen as a digression from the movies back to TV shows and a mistake by his career advisers. Selleck recruited a new agent and accepted the part.<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\"/> This role earned him an [[Emmy Award]] nomination in 2000 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.<ref name=\"cbs 62421\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs.com/shows/blue_bloods/cast/62421/|title=Biography|website=Cbs.com}}</ref>\n\nHe did the voice-over for the 1993 [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] advertising campaigns titled \"You Will.\" These advertisements had a futuristic feel, and posed the question of, \"What if you had the technology to _____? Well, you will ... and the company that will bring it to you? AT&T.\" \n\nIn the mid-1990s, Selleck hosted a special series on TLC called ''The Practical Guide to the Universe'', in which he talked about the stars, planets, galaxies, etc.\n\nIn February 1998, Selleck accepted the lead role in a sitcom for CBS called ''[[The Closer (1998 TV series)|The Closer]]''. This role was Tom Selleck's big comeback on prime time TV.<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\"/> In it he played Jack McLaren, a legendary publicist heading up a brand new marketing firm. His costars included [[Ed Asner]], [[David Krumholtz]], and [[Penelope Ann Miller]]. Despite the high pedigree, and the expectations for his first series since ''Magnum, P.I.'', low ratings caused the show to be canceled after ten episodes.\n\nHis last two cowboy roles to date were in the 2001 [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] movie ''[[Crossfire Trail]]'' (based on a [[Louis L'Amour]] novel of the same name), and the 2003 motion picture ''[[Monte Walsh (2003 film)|Monte Walsh]]''. In 2001, Selleck played the lead role of Murray in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of [[Herb Gardner]]'s comedic play ''[[A Thousand Clowns]]''. It ran for only two months. Critics, though far from uniformly negative about Selleck's performance, generally compared it unfavorably to that of [[Jason Robards|Jason Robards, Jr.]], who won awards in the 1960s for playing the character on the stage and in [[A Thousand Clowns|a movie version]].\n\nSelleck played the role of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in [[A&E Network|A&E]]'s 2004 made-for-TV movie ''[[Ike: Countdown to D-Day]]''. The movie showed the planning, politics, and preparation for the 1944 [[Invasion of Normandy]], and Selleck was critically lauded for playing a cool, calm Eisenhower.\n\nSince 2005, Selleck has starred in the role of transplanted lawman [[Jesse Stone (character)|Jesse Stone]] in a series of made-for-TV movies based on [[Robert B.

Soon after, he appeared in commercials for products such as [[Pepsi-Cola]].\n\nHe began his career with bit parts in smaller movies, including ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'' (invited on the set by [[Mae West]]<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/>), ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'', and ''[[The Seven Minutes (film)|The Seven Minutes]]''. He appeared in a number of TV series, mini-series and TV movies. He was also the face of Marlboro cigarettes as the Marlboro Man and [[Revlon]]'s Chaz cologne.<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/> Selleck appeared in the commercial for [[Right Guard]] deodorant in 1971, with [[Farrah Fawcett]] in 1972 for the [[aperitif]] [[Dubonnet]], and another in 1977 for the toothpaste [[Close-Up (toothpaste)|Close-Up]].  He was also in a Safeguard deodorant soap commercial (date not available). In 1972, he starred in the B-movie ''[[Daughters of Satan]]''. Still struggling as an unfamiliar TV actor, Selleck had a recurring role in the 1970s as private investigator Lance White in ''[[The Rockford Files]]''.\n\nSelleck is an avid [[outdoorsman]], marksman and [[firearms]] collector. These interests led him to leading-man [[cowboy]] roles in [[Western films]], starting with his role as cowboy and frontier marshal [[Sackett|Orrin Sackett]] in the 1979 film ''[[The Sacketts]]'', opposite [[Sam Elliott]], [[Jeff Osterhage]], and Western legends [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]]. He followed ''The Sacketts'' with ''[[The Shadow Riders (film)|The Shadow Riders]]'' in 1982, then portraying a cat burglar in 1930s London in ''Lassiter'' in 1984.  ''Quigley Down Under'' is probably one of his best-known Western films, although he won a \"Western Heritage Award\" for his 1997 role in ''[[Last Stand at Saber River]]''. In 1979 he starred in ''[[Concrete Cowboys (1979 film)|Concrete Cowboys]]'' with [[Jerry Reed]].\n\n===Magnum stardom===\n[[File:Princess Diana and Tom Selleck at White House C31879-14.jpg|thumb|Selleck meeting [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] at the [[White House]] in November 1985.

Diana is wearing the [[Travolta dress]].]]\nSelleck was an accessible actor, but spent years receiving little interest from the entertainment industry. His big break came when he was cast in the lead role as Thomas Magnum in ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''. The producers would not release the actor for other projects, so Selleck had to pass on the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', which then went to ''[[Star Wars]]'' alumnus [[Harrison Ford]]. It turned out that the shooting of the pilot for ''Magnum'' was delayed for over six months by a [[List of Hollywood strikes|writers' strike]], which would have enabled him to complete ''Raiders''.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://siouxcityjournal.com/entertainment/television/tom-selleck-recalls-magnum-looks-to-blue-bloods-for-change/article_8bf13baf-850b-5a0a-8a70-f7d448cac369.html | title = Tom Selleck recalls 'Magnum,' looks to 'Blue Bloods' for change | first = Bruce R. | last = Miller | work = Sioux City Journal | date = September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Look, I made a deal with Magnum and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.

Magnum was a former [[U.S. Navy]] Officer, a veteran of a Special Operations unit, \"SEAL\" in the Vietnam War, and later a member of the \"Naval Intelligence Agency\" (a fictional version of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]), who had resigned his commission with the Navy to become a private investigator living in Hawaii.  The show would go on for eight seasons and 163 episodes until 1988, winning him an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/tom-selleck | title = Tom Selleck Emmy Award Winner | publisher = Emmys.com | accessdate = December 27, 2013}}</ref> for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in [[36th Primetime Emmy Awards|1984]].\n\nSelleck was famous for his mustache, a Hawaiian-style [[aloha shirt]], a [[Detroit Tigers]] baseball cap, and a Colt MKIV/Series 70 Government Model handgun (a commercial version of the U.S. Military M1911A1) which his character regularly carried. The actual prop from the show was a 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, serial number 70L33101, used for its reliable functioning with readily available blanks; although the original gun was a traditional .45 ACP 1911.  Magnum also used a Star Model B, another 9mm similar to the M1911A1, and a Detonics Pocket 9 during the series.\n\nMagnum drove a [[Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308 GTS]] in the series. The model became so identified with the role that Ferrari fans now refer to the red-painted model as a \"Magnum\" Ferrari.\n\nAfter the end of the show in 1988, it established itself as the top-rated one-hour show in the history of syndicated reruns (at least until 1998).<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1998-02-21-9802210041-story.html|title=Tom Selleck just does what feels right|website=Chicagotribune.com|date=21 February 1998|author=Mike Duffy}}</ref> Selleck confirmed that he was the most popular choice by fans to play the role of Magnum in the once-rumored ''Magnum, P.I.'' movie.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0698726/ | title = Selleck Wants Back in the Magnum Driver's Seat | website = IMDb.com | date = March 4, 2009 |access-date=July 24, 2016}}</ref> In 1984, he introduced [[Nancy Reagan]] at the [[1984 Republican National Convention]].<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/> Selleck was offered the lead role of Mitch Buchannon in ''[[Baywatch]]'', but turned down the role because he did not want to be seen as a sex symbol. The role eventually went to [[David Hasselhoff]].\n\nDuring the Magnum years, he also starred as an [[acrophobia|acrophobic]] police detective in ''[[Runaway (1984 film)|Runaway]]'' and a stand-in father in ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''.\n\n===TV and advertising===\n[[File:Tom Selleck 2010.jpg|thumb|Tom Selleck at the 2010 Summer Session of the Television Critics Association]]\nIn 1990, he starred as an American 19th-century sharpshooter in the [[Western (genre)#Meat pie Western|Australian western]] ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'', a role and film that he considers one of his best. During the 1990s, he also starred in ''[[Three Men and a Little Lady]]'', ''[[High Road to China]]'', ''[[Lassiter (film)|Lassiter]]'', ''[[Her Alibi]]'', ''[[An Innocent Man (film)|An Innocent Man]]'', ''[[Folks! (film)|Folks!]]'', ''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]'', ''[[Mr. Baseball]]'', ''[[In & Out (film)|In & Out]]'' and ''[[The Love Letter (1999 film)|The Love Letter]]''.

Richard was a divorced [[ophthalmologist]] who was a friend of Monica's parents, and at first the relationship was hidden from her parents. The relationship eventually ended over Richard's reluctance to commit to having children, though Selleck did make a few more appearances in later episodes. His decision to star in a six-episode plot of ''Friends'' was seen as a digression from the movies back to TV shows and a mistake by his career advisers. Selleck recruited a new agent and accepted the part.<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\"/> This role earned him an [[Emmy Award]] nomination in 2000 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.<ref name=\"cbs 62421\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs.com/shows/blue_bloods/cast/62421/|title=Biography|website=Cbs.com}}</ref>\n\nHe did the voice-over for the 1993 [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] advertising campaigns titled \"You Will.\" These advertisements had a futuristic feel, and posed the question of, \"What if you had the technology to _____? Well, you will ... and the company that will bring it to you? AT&T.\" \n\nIn the mid-1990s, Selleck hosted a special series on TLC called ''The Practical Guide to the Universe'', in which he talked about the stars, planets, galaxies, etc.\n\nIn February 1998, Selleck accepted the lead role in a sitcom for CBS called ''[[The Closer (1998 TV series)|The Closer]]''. This role was Tom Selleck's big comeback on prime time TV.<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\"/> In it he played Jack McLaren, a legendary publicist heading up a brand new marketing firm. His costars included [[Ed Asner]], [[David Krumholtz]], and [[Penelope Ann Miller]]. Despite the high pedigree, and the expectations for his first series since ''Magnum, P.I.'', low ratings caused the show to be canceled after ten episodes.\n\nHis last two cowboy roles to date were in the 2001 [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] movie ''[[Crossfire Trail]]'' (based on a [[Louis L'Amour]] novel of the same name), and the 2003 motion picture ''[[Monte Walsh (2003 film)|Monte Walsh]]''. In 2001, Selleck played the lead role of Murray in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of [[Herb Gardner]]'s comedic play ''[[A Thousand Clowns]]''. It ran for only two months. Critics, though far from uniformly negative about Selleck's performance, generally compared it unfavorably to that of [[Jason Robards|Jason Robards, Jr.]], who won awards in the 1960s for playing the character on the stage and in [[A Thousand Clowns|a movie version]].\n\nSelleck played the role of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in [[A&E Network|A&E]]'s 2004 made-for-TV movie ''[[Ike: Countdown to D-Day]]''. The movie showed the planning, politics, and preparation for the 1944 [[Invasion of Normandy]], and Selleck was critically lauded for playing a cool, calm Eisenhower.\n\nSince 2005, Selleck has starred in the role of transplanted lawman [[Jesse Stone (character)|Jesse Stone]] in a series of made-for-TV movies based on [[Robert B. Parker]]'s novels. To date, the series comprises nine films, with the most recent released in October 2015.<ref name=\"eight\">{{cite web | url = http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/01/26/emmy-and-golden-globe-award-winner-tom-selleck-stars-in-jesse-stone-benefit-of-the-doubt-a-new-television-movie-to-be-broadcast-sunday-may-20-082404/20120126cbs03/ | title = Emmy and Golden Globe Award Winner Tom Selleck Stars in \"Jesse Stone: Benefit Of The Doubt,\" a New Television Movie To Be Broadcast Sunday, May 20 | website = The Futon Critic.com | accessdate = January 26, 2012}}</ref> In addition to his portrayal of the films' protagonist, Selleck now acts as producer for the series.

Outrigger Canoe Club teammate Dennis Berg, in the summer 2011 issue of ''Volleyball USA'' magazine, said of Selleck, \"Tom was a great teammate, appreciative of being included with such a talented and experienced group, practicing and playing hard when his ''Magnum'' schedule permitted.... He was very patient with all of us, and we relished the big crowds that replaced the usual sparse number of players' friends and spouses at the national tourney matches.\"<ref>''Volleyball USA'' (Summer 2011), vol 39, no 2 {{OCLC|31165992}}</ref>\n\nSelleck is an avid [[ice hockey]] fan and has been seen attending [[Los Angeles Kings]] games at [[Staples Center]]. He lists [[An\u017ee Kopitar]] and [[Alexander Frolov]] as two of his favorite players. He was once a minority owner of the [[Detroit Tigers]], his favorite baseball team since childhood.\n\nOne of Selleck's ''Magnum'' co-stars, [[Larry Manetti]], in his 1996 memoir ''Aloha Magnum'', was lavish in his praise of Selleck. Manetti lauded Selleck for his extraordinary work ethic on a grueling show (shooting for hours in the midday Hawaiian sun), Selleck's work with Hawaiian charities, and his willingness to support the program's cast and crew members.\n\nIn February 2009, Selleck joined the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund]] as national spokesman for the new Education Center being built on the [[National Mall]].<ref name=\"VVMF\"/>\n\nUpon [[James Garner]]'s death, he said, \"Jim was a mentor to me and a friend, and I will miss him.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.toledoblade.com/TV-Radio/2012/05/11/Tom-Selleck-2-kinds-of-lawmen.html | title = Tom Selleck: 2 kinds of lawmen | publisher = ToledoBlade.com | date = May 11, 2012 | accessdate = October 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://people.com/celebrity/james-garner-looked-back-on-his-career-in-people-interview | title = James Garner: In His Own Words on The Notebook, Maverick and More | publisher = People.com | date = July 21, 2014 | accessdate = October 23, 2017}}</ref> Two years after Garner's death, Selleck said, prior to filming his then 6th season of ''Blue Bloods'': \"It's kind of like my mentor, who never wanted to hear he was my mentor (James Garner), I don't accept the mentor role.

It is classified as 'High Sufficiency' by [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]], with some of the most prominent infrastructures in Taiwan. The [[Port of Kaohsiung]] is the largest and busiest harbour in Taiwan while [[Kaohsiung International Airport]] is the second busiest airport in number of passengers. The city is well-connected to other major cities by [[Taiwan High Speed Rail|high speed]] and [[Taiwan Railways Administration|conventional]] rail, as well as several national freeways. It also hosts the [[Republic of China Navy]] fleet headquarters and its [[Republic of China Naval Academy|naval academy]].

The surface meaning of the associated [[Chinese characters]] was \"beat the dog\". According to one theory, the name Takau originates from the aboriginal [[Siraya language]] and translates as \"bamboo forest\". According to another theory, the name evolved via [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] from the name of the [[Makatao people|Makatao]] tribe, who inhabited the area at the time of European and Hoklo settlement. The Makatao are considered to be part of the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colonization]] of southern Taiwan, the area was known as ''Tancoia'' to the western world for a period of about three decades.{{Specify|reason=Which three decades?|date=January 2019}} In 1662, the Dutch were expelled by the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], founded by Ming loyalists of [[Koxinga]].

In his 1903 general history of Taiwan, US Consul to Formosa [[James W. Davidson]] relates that \"Takow\" was already a well-known name in English.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=James W. |authorlink=James W.

While the new name had quite a different surface meaning, its pronunciation in Japanese sounded more or less the same as the old name spoken in [[Hokkien]].\n\nAfter Taiwan was handed to the Republic of China, the name did not change, but the official romanization became Kaohsiung ({{zh|w=Kao\u00b9-hsiung\u00b2|p=G\u0101oxi\u00f3ng}}), derived from the [[Wade-Giles]] romanization of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation for {{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u96c4}}.\n\nThe name ''Takau'' remains the official name of the city in [[Formosan languages|Austronesian languages]] of Taiwan such as [[Rukai language|Rukai]], although these are not widely spoken in the city. The name also remains popular locally in the naming of businesses, associations, and events.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Kaohsiung}}\n{{See also|History of Taiwan|North-South divide in Taiwan#Kaohsiung}}\n[[File:Harbor Takao.jpg|thumb|right|Port of Ta-kau (1893)]]\nThe written history of Kaohsiung can be traced back to the early 17th century, through archaeological studies have found signs of human activity in the region from as long as 7,000 years ago. Prior to the 17th century, the region was inhabited by the [[Makatao people|Makatao]] people of the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe, who settled on what they named Takau Isle (translated to \u6253\u72d7\u5dbc by Ming Chinese explorers); \"Takau\" meaning \"bamboo forest\" in the aboriginal language.\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Makatao.jpg|right|thumb|Sketch of the Makatao people during the [[Qing dynasty]]]]\nThe earliest evidence of human activity in the Kaohsiung area dates back to roughly 4,700\u20135,200 years ago. Most of the discovered remnants were located in the hills surrounding [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung Harbor]]. Artifacts were found at [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Shoushan]], Longquan Temple, Taoziyuan, [[Zuoying District|Zuoying]], Houjing, Fudingjin and [[Fengbitou Archaeological Site|Fengbitou]]. The prehistoric [[Dabenkeng culture|Dapenkeng]], Niuchouzi, [[Tahu Culture|Dahu]], and [[Niaosung Culture|Niaosong]] civilizations were known to inhabit the region. Studies of the prehistoric ruins at Longquan Temple have shown that that civilization occurred at roughly the same times as the beginnings of the aboriginal [[Makatao people|Makatao]] civilization, suggesting a possible origin for the latter. Unlike some other archaeological sites in the area, the Longquan Temple ruins are relatively well preserved. Prehistoric artifacts discovered have suggested that the ancient Kaohsiung Harbor was originally a lagoon, with early civilizations functioning primarily as [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies. Some agricultural tools have also been discovered, suggesting that some agricultural activity was also present.\n\nThe first Chinese records of the region were written in 1603 by [[Chen Di]], a member of [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] admiral Shen You-rong's expedition to rid the waters around Taiwan and [[Penghu]] of pirates. In his report on the \"Eastern Barbarian Lands\" (Dong Fan Ji), Chen Di referred to a Ta-kau Isle:\n\n{{quote|It is unknown when the barbarians ([[Taiwanese aborigines]]) arose on this island in the ocean beyond [[Penghu]], but they are present at Keeong Harbor (nowaday's [[Budai, Chiayi]]), the bay of Galaw ([[Anping, Tainan]]), Laydwawan ([[Tainan City]]), Yaw Harbor ([[Cheting District|Cheting, Kaohsiung]]), Takau Isle (Kaohsiung City), Little Tamsui ([[Donggang, Pingtung]]), Siangkeykaw ([[Puzi]], Chiayi), Gali forest ([[Jiali District]], Tainan), the village of Sabah ([[Tamsui, Taipei]]), and Dwabangkang ([[Bali District|Bali, New Taipei City]]).}}\n\n===Dutch Formosa===\nTaiwan became a [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colony]] in 1624, after the [[Dutch East India Company]] was ejected from [[Penghu]] by [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] forces. At the time, Takau was already one of the most important fishing ports in southern Taiwan. The Dutch named the place ''Tankoya'', and the harbor ''Tancoia''. The Dutch missionary [[Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn]] named Takau Mountain \"Ape Berg\", a name that would find its way onto European navigational charts well into the 18th century. ''Tankoia'' was located north of Ape's Hill and a few hours south from Tayouan (modern-day [[Anping District|Anping, Tainan]]) by sail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=William |authorlink=William Campbell (missionary) |title=Formosa under the Dutch: described from contemporary records, with explanatory notes and a bibliography of the island |year=1903 |publisher=Kegan Paul |location=London |oclc=644323041 |ref=harv |chapter=Explanatory Notes |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/formosaunderdut01campgoog#page/n554/mode/2up |page=548}}</ref> At the time, a wide shallow bay existed there, sufficient for small vessels. However, constant [[Siltation|silting]] changed the coastline.\n\nDuring this time, Taiwan was divided into five administrative districts, with Takau belonging to the southernmost district. In 1630, the first large scale immigration of [[Han Chinese]] to Taiwan began due to famine in [[Fujian]], with merchants and traders from China seeking to purchase hunting licenses from the Dutch or hide out in aboriginal villages to escape authorities in China.\n\n===Qing dynasty===\n[[File:2010 07 \u9cf3\u5c71\u7e23\u820a\u57ce\u5357\u9580\u5713\u74b0.jpg|right|thumb|South Gate of Fengshan County]]\nIn 1684, the [[Qing dynasty]] annexed [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Taiwan]] and renamed the town Fengshan County ({{zh|c=\u9cf3\u5c71\u7e23|p=F\u00e8ngsh\u0101n Xi\u00e0n}}), considering it a part of [[Taiwan Prefecture]].

In November 1901, twenty ''ch\u014d'' were established in total; {{nihongo4||\u9cf3\u5c71\u5ef3|H\u014dzan Ch\u014d}} was established nearby. In 1909, H\u014dzan Ch\u014d was abolished, and Takow was merged into Tainan Ch\u014d.\n\nIn 1920, during the tenure of 8th Governor-General [[Den Kenjir\u014d]], districts were abolished in favor of prefectures. Thus the city was administered as {{nihongo4|Takao City|\u9ad8\u96c4\u5e02|Takao-shi}} under [[Takao Prefecture]].\n\nThe Japanese developed Takao, especially the harbor that became the foundation of Kaohsiung to be a port city. Takao was then systematically modernized and connected to the end of [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|North-South Railway]].

New industries such as refinery, machinery, shipbuilding and cementing were also introduced.\n\nBefore and during [[World War II]] it handled a growing share of Taiwan's agricultural exports to Japan, and was also a major base for Japan's campaigns in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Extremely ambitious plans for the construction of a massive modern port were drawn up. Toward the end of the war, the Japanese promoted some industrial development at Kaohsiung, establishing an aluminum industry based on the abundant [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] produced by the [[Sun Moon Lake]] project in the mountains.\n\nThe city was heavily bombed by [[Task Force 38]] and [[Far East Air Force (United States)|FEAF]] during World War II between 1944 and 1945.\n\n\n===Post-war===\n[[File:\u9f13\u5c71\u5fe0\u70c8\u7960.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kaohsiung Martyrs' Shrine]]]]\n[[File:Kaohsiung_Tuntex_Sky_Tower_Innen_Bild_2_(2).jpg|thumb|right|The restored [[Port of Kaohsiung]], which was badly damaged in [[World War II]].]]\n\nAfter control of Taiwan was [[History of Taiwan since 1945|handed over from Japan]] to the government of the [[Republic of China]] on 25 October 1945, Kaohsiung City and [[Kaohsiung County]] were established as a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] and a [[County (Taiwan)|county]] of [[Taiwan Province]] respectively on 25 December 1945. The official romanization of the name came to be \"Kaohsiung\", based on the [[Wade\u2013Giles]] romanization of the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] reading of the [[kanji]] name.<ref>[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=23064&CtNode=122 What's in changing a name?] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070630101000/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=23064&CtNode=122 |date=30 June 2007 }} Taiwan Journal Vol. XXVI No. 19 May 15, 2009 \"...while name Kaohsiung is technically the Mandarin pronunciation of the Japanese written version of a Holo Taiwanese rendition of an old aboriginal name...\"</ref> Kaohsiung City then consisted of 10 [[District (Taiwan)|districts]], which were [[Gushan District|Gushan]], [[Lingya District|Lianya]] (renamed \"Lingya\" in 1952), [[Nanzi District|Nanzi]], [[Qianjin District, Kaohsiung|Cianjin]], [[Cianjhen District|Cianjhen]], [[Qijin District, Kaohsiung|Cijin]], [[Sanmin District|Sanmin]], [[Sinsing District, Taiwan|Sinsing]], [[Yancheng District, Kaohsiung|Yancheng]], and [[Zuoying District|Zuoying]].\n\nDuring this time, Kaohsiung developed rapidly. The port, badly damaged in [[World War II]], was restored. It also became a fishing port for boats sailing to [[Philippines|Philippine]] and Indonesian waters. Largely because of its climate, Kaohsiung overtook [[Keelung]] as Taiwan's major port. Kaohsiung also surpassed Tainan to become the second largest city of Taiwan in the late 1970s and Kaohsiung City was upgraded from a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] to [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] on 1 July 1979, by the [[Executive Yuan]] with a total of 11 districts. The additional district is [[Siaogang District]], which was annexed from Siaogang Township of [[Kaohsiung County]].\n\nThe [[Kaohsiung Incident]], where the government suppressed a commemoration of International [[Human Rights Day]], occurred on 10 December 1979. Since then, Kaohsiung gradually grew into a political center of the [[Pan-Green]] population of Taiwan, in opposition to [[Taipei]] where the majority population is [[Kuomintang]] supporters.\n\nOn 25 December 2010, Kaohsiung City merged with Kaohsiung County to form a larger [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] with [[Lingya District]] and [[Fongshan District|Fengshan District]] becoming the capital city, ending the administration of Kaohsiung County.\n\nOn 31 July 2014, a series of [[2014 Kaohsiung gas explosions|gas explosions]] occurred in the [[Cianjhen District|Cianjhen]] and [[Lingya District]]s of the city, killing 31 and injuring more than 300.

The year-round warm climate allows [[coral reefs]] to grow along the coasts around [[Kaohsiung Harbor]], with [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Shoushan Mountain]] being a small mountain completely made up of coral reefs and [[calcium carbonate]], while the mountainous districts in the northeast include Taiwan's highest mountain, [[Yushan (mountain)|Yushan]]. Other notable natural attractions include the [[Mount Banping]], [[Lotus Lake]], and [[Dongsha Atoll National Park]], which is currently inaccessible by the public due to military occupation.\n\n====Historical sites====\n[[File:Former British Consulate at Takao.jpg|thumb|[[Former British Consulate at Takao]]]]\nA large number of historical sites and monuments were left in the city after the colonization of the Dutch in the 17th century, the Qing dynasty during the 18th and 19th century and the Japanese empire from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century.  The city government has protected various sites and monuments from further damage and many have been opened to the public since the early 1980s. Notable historical sites include the [[Cemetery of Zhenghaijun]], [[Former British Consulate at Takao]], [[Former Dinglinzihbian Police Station]], [[Meinong Cultural and Creative Center]], [[Former Sanhe Bank]], and the [[Cihou Lighthouse]], one of the oldest lighthouses of the city.\n\n====Museums====\n[[File:Confucius temple Kaohsiung amk.jpg|thumb|[[Confucius Temple of Kaohsiung]]]]\nKaohsiung is home to many museums, including the [[Chung Li-he Museum]], [[Cijin Shell Museum]], [[Jiasian Petrified Fossil Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Astronomical Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Hakka Cultural Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Harbor Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Kaohsiung Museum of History]], [[Kaohsiung Museum of Labor]], [[Kaohsiung Vision Museum]], [[Meinong Hakka Culture Museum]], [[National Science and Technology Museum]], [[Republic of China Air Force Museum]], [[Soya-Mixed Meat Museum]], [[Taiwan Sugar Museum (Kaohsiung)|Taiwan Sugar Museum]], [[Takao Railway Museum]] and [[YM Museum of Marine Exploration Kaohsiung]].\n\n====Parks and Zoos====\nAs the largest municipality in Taiwan, Kaohsiung has a number of newly built leisure areas and parks.

The same applies to Kaohsiung city. Kaohsiung also hosts the largest [[Buddhist temple]] in Taiwan, the [[Foguangshan]] Temple.\n\n===Taoism===\nAround 33% of the Taiwanese population are Taoist, making it the second largest religion of Taiwan. Most people who believe in Taoism also ascribe to Buddhism at the same time, as the differences and boundaries between the two religions are not always clear. Many residents of the area also worship the [[Chinese folk religion|folk]] [[sea goddess]] [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]], who is variously [[syncretized]] as a [[Taoist immortal]] or avatar of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Guanyin]]. [[Chi Jin Mazu Temple|Her temple on Cijin Island]] is the oldest in the city, with its original bamboo-and-thatch structure first opened in 1673. The area surrounding it formed the center of the city's early settlement.<ref name=herry>{{citation |contribution-url=http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/Heritage.aspx?KeyID=740a98f3-eb1e-4e3b-aca2-29561ae6cd51 |contribution=Tianhou Temple at Cihou |url=http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/index.aspx |title=Official site |year=2008 |publisher=Bureau of Cultural Affairs of the Kaohsiung City Government |location=Kaohsiung |access-date=16 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006000307/http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/index.aspx |archive-date=6 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}. {{in lang|zh}}{{nbsp}}& {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\n===Christianity===\nChristianity is a growing religion in Taiwan. It was first brought onto the island when the Dutch and Spanish colonized Taiwan during the 17th century, mostly to the aboriginals. Kaohsiung currently hosts around 56,000 Christians.\n\n===Islam===\nBesides the majority population of Buddhists and Taoists, Kaohsiung also includes a rather small population of [[Muslims]]. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], some 20,000 Muslims, mostly soldiers and civil servants, fled [[mainland China]] with the [[Kuomintang]] to Taiwan. During the 1980s, another few thousand Muslims from [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]], whom are mostly descendants of [[Nationalist Chinese|Nationalist]] soldiers who fled [[Yunnan]] as a result of the communist takeover, migrated to Taiwan in search of a better life, resulting in an increase of Muslim population within the country. More recently, with the rise of Indonesian workers working in Taiwan, an estimated number of 88,000 Indonesian Muslims currently live in the country, in addition to the existing 53,000 Taiwanese Muslims. Combining all demographics, Taiwan hosts around 140,000 Muslims, with around 25,000 living in Kaohsiung. [[Kaohsiung Mosque]] is the largest mosque in Kaohsiung and the main gathering site of Muslims within the city.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Fo Guang Shan.jpg|[[Foguangshan]] Temple\nFile:\u65d7\u5f8c\u5929\u540e\u5bae.jpg|Cijing Tianhou Temple\nFile:\u73ab\u7470\u8056\u6bcd\u4e3b\u6559\u5ea7\u5802.JPG|[[Holy Rosary Cathedral, Kaohsiung|Holy Rosary Cathedral]]\nFile:Kaohsiung Mosque.JPG|[[Kaohsiung Mosque]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Politics==\n===Government===\n{{main|Kaohsiung City Government|Kaohsiung City Council}}\n{{see also|List of mayors of Kaohsiung|List of county magistrates of Kaohsiung}}\n[[File:\u9ad8\u96c4\u5e02\u9577 \u97d3\u570b\u745c.jpg|thumb|[[Han Kuo-yu]], the incumbent [[Mayor of Kaohsiung]]]]\n\nSometimes Kaohsiung used to be seen as the political opposite Taipei. While northern Taiwan leans towards the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] in the state-level elections, southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung, leaned towards the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] since the late 1990s. [[Frank Hsieh]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was reelected twice as Mayor of Kaohsiung, where he was widely credited for transforming the city from an industrial sprawl into an attractive modern metropolis. Hsieh resigned from the office of mayor to take up the office of [[Premier of the Republic of China]] in 2005. The [[2006 Republic of China municipal elections|municipal election, held on 9 December 2006]], resulted in a victory for the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]'s candidate [[Chen Chu]], the first elected female mayor of [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] in Taiwan, defeating her [[Kuomintang]] rival and former deputy mayor, Huang Chun-ying. The current mayor of Kaohsiung City is [[Han Kuo-yu]] of the [[Kuomintang]].\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Kaohsiung City Hall (Dec 2010).JPG\n|alt1=Kaohsiung City Hall\n|[[Kaohsiung City Government]] \u2013

Cijin island lighthouse hill.]]\n\nA major port, through which pass most of Taiwan's marine imports and exports, is located at the city but is not managed by the city government. Also known as the \"Harbour Capital\" of Taiwan, Kaohsiung has always had a strong link with the ocean and maritime transportation. [[Ferries]] play a key role in everyday transportation, especially for transportation across the harbour. With five terminals and 23 berths, the ''Port of Kaohsiung'' is Taiwan's largest [[container port]] and the 13th largest in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports|title=Top 50 World Container Ports {{!}} World Shipping Council|website=www.worldshipping.org|access-date=4 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115163646/http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2007 the port reached its handling capacity with a record trade volume of {{TEU|10.2&nbsp;million|first=yes}}.<ref name=\"LLDCN\">{{cite news| last =Dale |first =Jamie |title =Kaohsiung container port hits full capacity | work =Lloyd's List Daily Commercial News | page =16 | publisher =Informa Australia | date =17 January 2008}}</ref> A new container terminal is under construction, increasing future handling capacity by {{TEU|2 million}} by 2013.<ref name=\"LLDCN\"/>\n\nThe [[Port of Kaohsiung]] is not officially a part of Kaohsiung City, instead it is administrated by Kaohsiung Port Authority, under Ministry of Transportation. There is a push for Kaohsiung City to annex the Port of Kaohsiung to facilitate better regional planning.\n\nKaohsiung is one of the biggest ports in the world for importing [[Shark finning|shark fins]], sold at high prices in the restaurants and shops of Taiwan and China. They are brought in from overseas and are placed out to dry in the sun on residential rooftops near the port.\n\n===Kaohsiung International Airport===\n[[File:\u9ad8\u96c4\u570b\u969b\u6a5f\u5834.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kaohsiung International Airport]]]]\n\nKaohsiung City is also home to Taiwan's second largest international airport, the [[Kaohsiung International Airport]], located in [[Siaogang District]] near the city's center. It one of the three major international airports of Taiwan, serving passengers of the entire southern and southeastern part of the country. However, the size of the airport is relatively small with short runways compared to other major airports of Taiwan due to its age and its location near the city center, making it impossible for large aircraft such as the [[Airbus A380]] to land at the airport. As a result, plans for runway expansion or building a new airport in replacement have been proposed.\n\n===Rapid transit===\n[[File:Kaohsiung MRT Train at World Games Station.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kaohsiung MRT]]]]\n[[File:KMRT_CAF_train_2016-08-27.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Circular Line (KMRT)|Kaohsiung Circular Light Rail]]]]\n\n[[Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit]] opened for service in March 2008.

It is classified as 'High Sufficiency' by [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]], with some of the most prominent infrastructures in Taiwan. The [[Port of Kaohsiung]] is the largest and busiest harbour in Taiwan while [[Kaohsiung International Airport]] is the second busiest airport in number of passengers. The city is well-connected to other major cities by [[Taiwan High Speed Rail|high speed]] and [[Taiwan Railways Administration|conventional]] rail, as well as several national freeways. It also hosts the [[Republic of China Navy]] fleet headquarters and its [[Republic of China Naval Academy|naval academy]].

According to another theory, the name evolved via [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] from the name of the [[Makatao people|Makatao]] tribe, who inhabited the area at the time of European and Hoklo settlement. The Makatao are considered to be part of the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colonization]] of southern Taiwan, the area was known as ''Tancoia'' to the western world for a period of about three decades.{{Specify|reason=Which three decades?|date=January 2019}} In 1662, the Dutch were expelled by the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], founded by Ming loyalists of [[Koxinga]].

In his 1903 general history of Taiwan, US Consul to Formosa [[James W.

While the new name had quite a different surface meaning, its pronunciation in Japanese sounded more or less the same as the old name spoken in [[Hokkien]].\n\nAfter Taiwan was handed to the Republic of China, the name did not change, but the official romanization became Kaohsiung ({{zh|w=Kao\u00b9-hsiung\u00b2|p=G\u0101oxi\u00f3ng}}), derived from the [[Wade-Giles]] romanization of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation for {{lang|zh|\u9ad8\u96c4}}.\n\nThe name ''Takau'' remains the official name of the city in [[Formosan languages|Austronesian languages]] of Taiwan such as [[Rukai language|Rukai]], although these are not widely spoken in the city. The name also remains popular locally in the naming of businesses, associations, and events.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Kaohsiung}}\n{{See also|History of Taiwan|North-South divide in Taiwan#Kaohsiung}}\n[[File:Harbor Takao.jpg|thumb|right|Port of Ta-kau (1893)]]\nThe written history of Kaohsiung can be traced back to the early 17th century, through archaeological studies have found signs of human activity in the region from as long as 7,000 years ago. Prior to the 17th century, the region was inhabited by the [[Makatao people|Makatao]] people of the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe, who settled on what they named Takau Isle (translated to \u6253\u72d7\u5dbc by Ming Chinese explorers); \"Takau\" meaning \"bamboo forest\" in the aboriginal language.\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Makatao.jpg|right|thumb|Sketch of the Makatao people during the [[Qing dynasty]]]]\nThe earliest evidence of human activity in the Kaohsiung area dates back to roughly 4,700\u20135,200 years ago. Most of the discovered remnants were located in the hills surrounding [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung Harbor]]. Artifacts were found at [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Shoushan]], Longquan Temple, Taoziyuan, [[Zuoying District|Zuoying]], Houjing, Fudingjin and [[Fengbitou Archaeological Site|Fengbitou]]. The prehistoric [[Dabenkeng culture|Dapenkeng]], Niuchouzi, [[Tahu Culture|Dahu]], and [[Niaosung Culture|Niaosong]] civilizations were known to inhabit the region. Studies of the prehistoric ruins at Longquan Temple have shown that that civilization occurred at roughly the same times as the beginnings of the aboriginal [[Makatao people|Makatao]] civilization, suggesting a possible origin for the latter. Unlike some other archaeological sites in the area, the Longquan Temple ruins are relatively well preserved. Prehistoric artifacts discovered have suggested that the ancient Kaohsiung Harbor was originally a lagoon, with early civilizations functioning primarily as [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies. Some agricultural tools have also been discovered, suggesting that some agricultural activity was also present.\n\nThe first Chinese records of the region were written in 1603 by [[Chen Di]], a member of [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] admiral Shen You-rong's expedition to rid the waters around Taiwan and [[Penghu]] of pirates. In his report on the \"Eastern Barbarian Lands\" (Dong Fan Ji), Chen Di referred to a Ta-kau Isle:\n\n{{quote|It is unknown when the barbarians ([[Taiwanese aborigines]]) arose on this island in the ocean beyond [[Penghu]], but they are present at Keeong Harbor (nowaday's [[Budai, Chiayi]]), the bay of Galaw ([[Anping, Tainan]]), Laydwawan ([[Tainan City]]), Yaw Harbor ([[Cheting District|Cheting, Kaohsiung]]), Takau Isle (Kaohsiung City), Little Tamsui ([[Donggang, Pingtung]]), Siangkeykaw ([[Puzi]], Chiayi), Gali forest ([[Jiali District]], Tainan), the village of Sabah ([[Tamsui, Taipei]]), and Dwabangkang ([[Bali District|Bali, New Taipei City]]).}}\n\n===Dutch Formosa===\nTaiwan became a [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colony]] in 1624, after the [[Dutch East India Company]] was ejected from [[Penghu]] by [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] forces. At the time, Takau was already one of the most important fishing ports in southern Taiwan. The Dutch named the place ''Tankoya'', and the harbor ''Tancoia''. The Dutch missionary [[Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn]] named Takau Mountain \"Ape Berg\", a name that would find its way onto European navigational charts well into the 18th century. ''Tankoia'' was located north of Ape's Hill and a few hours south from Tayouan (modern-day [[Anping District|Anping, Tainan]]) by sail.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=William |authorlink=William Campbell (missionary) |title=Formosa under the Dutch: described from contemporary records, with explanatory notes and a bibliography of the island |year=1903 |publisher=Kegan Paul |location=London |oclc=644323041 |ref=harv |chapter=Explanatory Notes |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/formosaunderdut01campgoog#page/n554/mode/2up |page=548}}</ref> At the time, a wide shallow bay existed there, sufficient for small vessels. However, constant [[Siltation|silting]] changed the coastline.\n\nDuring this time, Taiwan was divided into five administrative districts, with Takau belonging to the southernmost district. In 1630, the first large scale immigration of [[Han Chinese]] to Taiwan began due to famine in [[Fujian]], with merchants and traders from China seeking to purchase hunting licenses from the Dutch or hide out in aboriginal villages to escape authorities in China.\n\n===Qing dynasty===\n[[File:2010 07 \u9cf3\u5c71\u7e23\u820a\u57ce\u5357\u9580\u5713\u74b0.jpg|right|thumb|South Gate of Fengshan County]]\nIn 1684, the [[Qing dynasty]] annexed [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Taiwan]] and renamed the town Fengshan County ({{zh|c=\u9cf3\u5c71\u7e23|p=F\u00e8ngsh\u0101n Xi\u00e0n}}), considering it a part of [[Taiwan Prefecture]].

In November 1901, twenty ''ch\u014d'' were established in total; {{nihongo4||\u9cf3\u5c71\u5ef3|H\u014dzan Ch\u014d}} was established nearby. In 1909, H\u014dzan Ch\u014d was abolished, and Takow was merged into Tainan Ch\u014d.\n\nIn 1920, during the tenure of 8th Governor-General [[Den Kenjir\u014d]], districts were abolished in favor of prefectures. Thus the city was administered as {{nihongo4|Takao City|\u9ad8\u96c4\u5e02|Takao-shi}} under [[Takao Prefecture]].\n\nThe Japanese developed Takao, especially the harbor that became the foundation of Kaohsiung to be a port city. Takao was then systematically modernized and connected to the end of [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|North-South Railway]]. Forming a north-south regional economic corridor from Taipei to Kaohsiung in the 1930s, Japan's Southward Policy set Kaohsiung to become an industrial center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://taiwaninsight.org/2019/02/09/taiwans-cultural-plurality-and-immigration-policy/|title=Taiwan's Cultural Plurality and Immigration Policy|last=Editor|date=2019-02-09|website=Taiwan Insight|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung Harbor]] was also developed starting from 1894.

The official romanization of the name came to be \"Kaohsiung\", based on the [[Wade\u2013Giles]] romanization of the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] reading of the [[kanji]] name.<ref>[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=23064&CtNode=122 What's in changing a name?] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070630101000/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=23064&CtNode=122 |date=30 June 2007 }} Taiwan Journal Vol. XXVI No. 19 May 15, 2009 \"...while name Kaohsiung is technically the Mandarin pronunciation of the Japanese written version of a Holo Taiwanese rendition of an old aboriginal name...\"</ref> Kaohsiung City then consisted of 10 [[District (Taiwan)|districts]], which were [[Gushan District|Gushan]], [[Lingya District|Lianya]] (renamed \"Lingya\" in 1952), [[Nanzi District|Nanzi]], [[Qianjin District, Kaohsiung|Cianjin]], [[Cianjhen District|Cianjhen]], [[Qijin District, Kaohsiung|Cijin]], [[Sanmin District|Sanmin]], [[Sinsing District, Taiwan|Sinsing]], [[Yancheng District, Kaohsiung|Yancheng]], and [[Zuoying District|Zuoying]].\n\nDuring this time, Kaohsiung developed rapidly. The port, badly damaged in [[World War II]], was restored. It also became a fishing port for boats sailing to [[Philippines|Philippine]] and Indonesian waters. Largely because of its climate, Kaohsiung overtook [[Keelung]] as Taiwan's major port. Kaohsiung also surpassed Tainan to become the second largest city of Taiwan in the late 1970s and Kaohsiung City was upgraded from a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]] to [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] on 1 July 1979, by the [[Executive Yuan]] with a total of 11 districts. The additional district is [[Siaogang District]], which was annexed from Siaogang Township of [[Kaohsiung County]].\n\nThe [[Kaohsiung Incident]], where the government suppressed a commemoration of International [[Human Rights Day]], occurred on 10 December 1979. Since then, Kaohsiung gradually grew into a political center of the [[Pan-Green]] population of Taiwan, in opposition to [[Taipei]] where the majority population is [[Kuomintang]] supporters.\n\nOn 25 December 2010, Kaohsiung City merged with Kaohsiung County to form a larger [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] with [[Lingya District]] and [[Fongshan District|Fengshan District]] becoming the capital city, ending the administration of Kaohsiung County.\n\nOn 31 July 2014, a series of [[2014 Kaohsiung gas explosions|gas explosions]] occurred in the [[Cianjhen District|Cianjhen]] and [[Lingya District]]s of the city, killing 31 and injuring more than 300.

The newly developed city is also known for having a large number of [[shopping streets]], organized [[night markets]] and newly developed leisure parks such as the [[Pier-2 Art Center]], [[E-DA Theme Park]], [[Kaohsiung Metropolitan Park|Metropolitan Park]], the [[Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts]] and [[Taroko Park]].\n\nNatural attractions of the city include [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Shoushan]] (Monkey mountain), the [[Love River]], [[Qijin Island|Cijin Island]], [[Sizihwan]], the [[Dapingding Tropical Botanical Garden]] and [[Yushan National Park]] at the northeastern tip of the city. The city also features various historical attractions such as the [[Old City of Zuoying]], a historical town built during the early 17th century, the [[Former British Consulate at Takao]] built during the late 19th century, and various sugar and crop factories built during the [[Japanese occupation of Taiwan]].\n\n====Natural attractions====\nKaohsiung city includes a wide range of different natural attractions due to its large size and geographical variation, as it is bordered by the [[Central Mountain Range]] in the northeast and the warm [[South China Sea]] to the west and southwest. The year-round warm climate allows [[coral reefs]] to grow along the coasts around [[Kaohsiung Harbor]], with [[Shoushan (Kaohsiung)|Shoushan Mountain]] being a small mountain completely made up of coral reefs and [[calcium carbonate]], while the mountainous districts in the northeast include Taiwan's highest mountain, [[Yushan (mountain)|Yushan]]. Other notable natural attractions include the [[Mount Banping]], [[Lotus Lake]], and [[Dongsha Atoll National Park]], which is currently inaccessible by the public due to military occupation.\n\n====Historical sites====\n[[File:Former British Consulate at Takao.jpg|thumb|[[Former British Consulate at Takao]]]]\nA large number of historical sites and monuments were left in the city after the colonization of the Dutch in the 17th century, the Qing dynasty during the 18th and 19th century and the Japanese empire from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century.  The city government has protected various sites and monuments from further damage and many have been opened to the public since the early 1980s. Notable historical sites include the [[Cemetery of Zhenghaijun]], [[Former British Consulate at Takao]], [[Former Dinglinzihbian Police Station]], [[Meinong Cultural and Creative Center]], [[Former Sanhe Bank]], and the [[Cihou Lighthouse]], one of the oldest lighthouses of the city.\n\n====Museums====\n[[File:Confucius temple Kaohsiung amk.jpg|thumb|[[Confucius Temple of Kaohsiung]]]]\nKaohsiung is home to many museums, including the [[Chung Li-he Museum]], [[Cijin Shell Museum]], [[Jiasian Petrified Fossil Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Astronomical Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Hakka Cultural Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Harbor Museum]], [[Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts]], [[Kaohsiung Museum of History]], [[Kaohsiung Museum of Labor]], [[Kaohsiung Vision Museum]], [[Meinong Hakka Culture Museum]], [[National Science and Technology Museum]], [[Republic of China Air Force Museum]], [[Soya-Mixed Meat Museum]], [[Taiwan Sugar Museum (Kaohsiung)|Taiwan Sugar Museum]], [[Takao Railway Museum]] and [[YM Museum of Marine Exploration Kaohsiung]].\n\n====Parks and Zoos====\nAs the largest municipality in Taiwan, Kaohsiung has a number of newly built leisure areas and parks.

With the arrival of western-style [[Supermarket|supermarkets]] in the 1980s and 1990s, such markets have encountered fierce competition. In 1989, the global leader in hypermarkets, [[Carrefour]], entered Asia, opening its first store in Kaohsiung. Due to the success of its Taiwan operation, the French retailer expanded throughout the country and Asia.

Some of the elderly who grew up during the Japanese colonization of Taiwan can communicate in Japanese, while most of the younger population has basic English skills.\n\nSince the spread of Standard Chinese after the [[Chinese Civil War|Nationalist Government retreated to Taiwan in 1949]], [[Hakka Chinese]] and various [[Formosan languages]] are gradually no longer spoken with the new generation and many Formosan languages are therefore classified as [[Moribund language|moribund]] or [[endangered languages]] by the United Nations. Nowadays, only elder Hakka people mostly living in [[Meinong District|Meinong]], [[Liouguei District|Liouguei]], [[Shanlin District|Shanlin]] and [[Jiasian District|Jiasian]] districts can communicate in Hakka and elder Taiwanese aborigines living mostly in the rural districts of [[Namasia District|Namasia]] and [[Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung|Taoyuan]] can communicate with the aboriginal languages. The Taiwanese government has established special affairs committees for both the Aboriginals and the Hakkas to protect their language, culture, and minority rights.\n\n===Arts===\n[[File:FormosaBoulevardStation.JPG|thumb|right|The Dome of Light at [[Formosa Boulevard Station]] of [[Kaohsiung MRT]]]]\n\nKaohsiung has rich resources of ocean, mountains and forests which shape a unique and active multi-faceted art and cultural aesthetic in public infrastructure and transport, [[public art]], and city architecture, from MRT stations and city space to art galleries.

Kaohsiung has also 306 churches.<ref>{{cite news |author1=Lee Hsin-fang |first2=Jake |last2=Chung |date=15 July 2015 |page=5 |title=Tainan has most of nation's 12,106 temples |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/15/2003623092 |newspaper=Taipei Times |access-date=15 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715111332/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/15/2003623092 |archive-date=15 July 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Buddhism===\nBuddhism is one of the major religions in Taiwan, with over 35% of Taiwan's population identifying as Buddhist. The same applies to Kaohsiung city. Kaohsiung also hosts the largest [[Buddhist temple]] in Taiwan, the [[Foguangshan]] Temple.\n\n===Taoism===\nAround 33% of the Taiwanese population are Taoist, making it the second largest religion of Taiwan. Most people who believe in Taoism also ascribe to Buddhism at the same time, as the differences and boundaries between the two religions are not always clear. Many residents of the area also worship the [[Chinese folk religion|folk]] [[sea goddess]] [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]], who is variously [[syncretized]] as a [[Taoist immortal]] or avatar of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Guanyin]]. [[Chi Jin Mazu Temple|Her temple on Cijin Island]] is the oldest in the city, with its original bamboo-and-thatch structure first opened in 1673. The area surrounding it formed the center of the city's early settlement.<ref name=herry>{{citation |contribution-url=http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/Heritage.aspx?KeyID=740a98f3-eb1e-4e3b-aca2-29561ae6cd51 |contribution=Tianhou Temple at Cihou |url=http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/index.aspx |title=Official site |year=2008 |publisher=Bureau of Cultural Affairs of the Kaohsiung City Government |location=Kaohsiung |access-date=16 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006000307/http://heritage.khcc.gov.tw/english/index.aspx |archive-date=6 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}. {{in lang|zh}}{{nbsp}}& {{in lang|en}}</ref>\n\n===Christianity===\nChristianity is a growing religion in Taiwan. It was first brought onto the island when the Dutch and Spanish colonized Taiwan during the 17th century, mostly to the aboriginals. Kaohsiung currently hosts around 56,000 Christians.\n\n===Islam===\nBesides the majority population of Buddhists and Taoists, Kaohsiung also includes a rather small population of [[Muslims]]. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], some 20,000 Muslims, mostly soldiers and civil servants, fled [[mainland China]] with the [[Kuomintang]] to Taiwan. During the 1980s, another few thousand Muslims from [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]], whom are mostly descendants of [[Nationalist Chinese|Nationalist]] soldiers who fled [[Yunnan]] as a result of the communist takeover, migrated to Taiwan in search of a better life, resulting in an increase of Muslim population within the country. More recently, with the rise of Indonesian workers working in Taiwan, an estimated number of 88,000 Indonesian Muslims currently live in the country, in addition to the existing 53,000 Taiwanese Muslims. Combining all demographics, Taiwan hosts around 140,000 Muslims, with around 25,000 living in Kaohsiung. [[Kaohsiung Mosque]] is the largest mosque in Kaohsiung and the main gathering site of Muslims within the city.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Fo Guang Shan.jpg|[[Foguangshan]] Temple\nFile:\u65d7\u5f8c\u5929\u540e\u5bae.jpg|Cijing Tianhou Temple\nFile:\u73ab\u7470\u8056\u6bcd\u4e3b\u6559\u5ea7\u5802.JPG|[[Holy Rosary Cathedral, Kaohsiung|Holy Rosary Cathedral]]\nFile:Kaohsiung Mosque.JPG|[[Kaohsiung Mosque]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Politics==\n===Government===\n{{main|Kaohsiung City Government|Kaohsiung City Council}}\n{{see also|List of mayors of Kaohsiung|List of county magistrates of Kaohsiung}}\n[[File:\u9ad8\u96c4\u5e02\u9577 \u97d3\u570b\u745c.jpg|thumb|[[Han Kuo-yu]], the incumbent [[Mayor of Kaohsiung]]]]\n\nSometimes Kaohsiung used to be seen as the political opposite Taipei. While northern Taiwan leans towards the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] in the state-level elections, southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung, leaned towards the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] since the late 1990s. [[Frank Hsieh]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] was reelected twice as Mayor of Kaohsiung, where he was widely credited for transforming the city from an industrial sprawl into an attractive modern metropolis. Hsieh resigned from the office of mayor to take up the office of [[Premier of the Republic of China]] in 2005. The [[2006 Republic of China municipal elections|municipal election, held on 9 December 2006]], resulted in a victory for the [[Democratic Progressive Party]]'s candidate [[Chen Chu]], the first elected female mayor of [[Special municipality of Taiwan|special municipality]] in Taiwan, defeating her [[Kuomintang]] rival and former deputy mayor, Huang Chun-ying. The current mayor of Kaohsiung City is [[Han Kuo-yu]] of the [[Kuomintang]].\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Kaohsiung City Hall (Dec 2010).JPG\n|alt1=Kaohsiung City Hall\n|[[Kaohsiung City Government]] \u2013

Cijin island lighthouse hill.]]\n\nA major port, through which pass most of Taiwan's marine imports and exports, is located at the city but is not managed by the city government. Also known as the \"Harbour Capital\" of Taiwan, Kaohsiung has always had a strong link with the ocean and maritime transportation. [[Ferries]] play a key role in everyday transportation, especially for transportation across the harbour. With five terminals and 23 berths, the ''Port of Kaohsiung'' is Taiwan's largest [[container port]] and the 13th largest in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports|title=Top 50 World Container Ports {{!}} World Shipping Council|website=www.worldshipping.org|access-date=4 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115163646/http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports|archive-date=15 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2007 the port reached its handling capacity with a record trade volume of {{TEU|10.2&nbsp;million|first=yes}}.<ref name=\"LLDCN\">{{cite news| last =Dale |first =Jamie |title =Kaohsiung container port hits full capacity | work =Lloyd's List Daily Commercial News | page =16 | publisher =Informa Australia | date =17 January 2008}}</ref> A new container terminal is under construction, increasing future handling capacity by {{TEU|2 million}} by 2013.<ref name=\"LLDCN\"/>\n\nThe [[Port of Kaohsiung]] is not officially a part of Kaohsiung City, instead it is administrated by Kaohsiung Port Authority, under Ministry of Transportation. There is a push for Kaohsiung City to annex the Port of Kaohsiung to facilitate better regional planning.\n\nKaohsiung is one of the biggest ports in the world for importing [[Shark finning|shark fins]], sold at high prices in the restaurants and shops of Taiwan and China. They are brought in from overseas and are placed out to dry in the sun on residential rooftops near the port.\n\n===Kaohsiung International Airport===\n[[File:\u9ad8\u96c4\u570b\u969b\u6a5f\u5834.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kaohsiung International Airport]]]]\n\nKaohsiung City is also home to Taiwan's second largest international airport, the [[Kaohsiung International Airport]], located in [[Siaogang District]] near the city's center. It one of the three major international airports of Taiwan, serving passengers of the entire southern and southeastern part of the country. However, the size of the airport is relatively small with short runways compared to other major airports of Taiwan due to its age and its location near the city center, making it impossible for large aircraft such as the [[Airbus A380]] to land at the airport. As a result, plans for runway expansion or building a new airport in replacement have been proposed.\n\n===Rapid transit===\n[[File:Kaohsiung MRT Train at World Games Station.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kaohsiung MRT]]]]\n[[File:KMRT_CAF_train_2016-08-27.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Circular Line (KMRT)|Kaohsiung Circular Light Rail]]]]\n\n[[Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit]] opened for service in March 2008.

An eight-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], Smoltz was part of a [[Big Three (Atlanta Braves)|celebrated trio]] of [[starting pitcher]]s, along with [[Greg Maddux]] and [[Tom Glavine]], who propelled Atlanta to perennial pennant contention in the 1990s, highlighted by a championship in the [[1995 World Series]]. He won the [[National League]] (NL) [[Cy Young Award]] in 1996 after posting a [[win\u2013loss record (pitching)|record]] of 24&ndash;8, equaling the most victories by an NL pitcher since 1972. Though predominantly known as a starter, Smoltz was converted to a [[relief pitcher|reliever]] in 2001 after his recovery from [[Tommy John surgery]], and spent four years as the team's [[closer (baseball)|closer]] before returning to a starting role. In 2002, he set the NL record with 55 [[save (baseball)|saves]] and became only the second pitcher in history (joining [[Dennis Eckersley]]) to record both a 20-win season and a 50-save season. He is the only pitcher in major league history to record both 200 wins and 150 saves.\n\nSmoltz was one of the most prominent pitchers in playoff history, posting a record of 15&ndash;4 with a 2.67 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in 41 career postseason games, and was named the [[League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] of the [[1992 NLCS|1992 NL Championship Series]]; [[Andy Pettitte]] later broke his record for career postseason wins. Smoltz led the NL in wins, [[winning percentage]], [[strikeout]]s and [[innings pitched]] twice each, and his NL total of [[3,000 strikeout club|3,084 strikeouts]] ranked fifth in league history when he retired. He also holds the Braves franchise record for career strikeouts (3,011), and the record for the most career [[games pitched]] for the Braves (708) since the club's move to Atlanta in 1966; from 2004 to 2014, he held the franchise record for career saves. Smoltz left the Braves after 2008 and split his final season with the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Since retiring as a player, he has served as a [[color commentator]] and [[sports analyst|analyst]] on television. He was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2015|2015]], his first year of eligibility.\n\n==Minor leagues and trade to Atlanta==\nJohn Smoltz was an All-State baseball and football player at [[Waverly Senior High School|Waverly High School]] in [[Lansing, Michigan]], before the [[Detroit Tigers]] selected him in the 22nd round of the [[1985 Major League Baseball draft|1985 amateur draft]].<ref>Porter, David L. 2000. \"John Smoltz\" in ''The Biographical Dictionary of American Sports'', 1440\u20131441.

Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref> On August 12, 1987, he was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves]], where he played on their Class AAA Richmond Braves. The 1987 Tigers were in a three-team race, chasing the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for the [[AL East]] division lead; in need of pitching help, Detroit sent their 20-year-old prospect to the Braves for 36-year-old veteran [[Doyle Alexander]]. While Alexander did help the Tigers overtake the Blue Jays for the division title, he was out of baseball by 1989. Smoltz, on the other hand, became one of the cornerstones of the Braves franchise for the next two decades.\n\n==Major leagues==\n\n===Early years (1988\u20131997)===\nSmoltz made his major league debut on July 23, 1988. He posted poor statistics in a dozen starts, but in 1989 Smoltz blossomed. In 29 starts, he recorded a 12\u201311 record and 2.94 ERA while pitching 208 innings, and was named to the NL All-Star team. Teammate [[Tom Glavine]] also had his first good year in 1989, raising optimism about the future of Atlanta's pitching staff.\n\nOver his career, Smoltz threw a four-seam [[fastball]] that was clocked as high as 98 miles per hour, a strong, effective [[Slider (baseball)|slider]] and an 88\u201391&nbsp;mph [[split-finger fastball]] that he used as a [[strikeout]] pitch. He also used a [[curveball]] and [[change-up]] on occasion, and in 1999, he began experimenting with both a [[knuckleball]] and a [[screwball]], though he rarely used either in game situations.<ref>[[Rob Neyer|Neyer, Rob]] and [[Bill James]], ''The Neyer-James Guide to Pitchers''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7432-6158-5}}</ref> He admitted in 2016 that he neither learned to throw sliders until he reached the MLB, nor does he recommend children to throw sliders.<ref>{{Citation|last=MLB Network|title=John Smoltz On The Destruction Of A Slider On A Pitcher|date=2016-06-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb-q_tuFivE|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n\nSmoltz began the 1991 season with a 2\u201311 record. He began seeing a [[sports psychology|sports psychologist]], after which he closed out the season on a 12\u20132 pace,<ref>[http://editor.slate.com/default.aspx/id/2146635 Does sports psychology really work?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210020206/http://editor.slate.com/default.aspx/id/2146635 |date=December 10, 2007 }} by Daniel Engber \u2013 Slate Magazine</ref> helping the Braves win a tight NL West race. His winning ways continued into the [[1991 National League Championship Series]]. Smoltz won both his starts against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], capped by a complete game [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] in the seventh game, propelling the Braves to their first World Series since moving to Atlanta in 1966. Smoltz had two no-decisions against the [[Minnesota Twins]], with a 1.26 ERA. In the seventh and deciding game, he faced his former Detroit Tiger hero, [[Jack Morris]]. Both starters pitched shutout ball for seven innings, before Smoltz was removed from the 0\u20130 game during a Twins threat in the eighth. Atlanta reliever [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] pitched out of the jam, getting Smoltz off the hook, and Morris eventually pitched a 10-inning complete game victory.\n\nThe next year, Smoltz won 15 regular season games and was the MVP of the [[1992 National League Championship Series]], winning two games. He left the seventh game trailing, but ended up with a no-decision as the Braves mounted a dramatic ninth-inning comeback win. In the World Series that year, Smoltz started two of the six games in the series, with a no-decision in Game 2 and a win with the Braves facing elimination in Game 5.\n\nBefore the 1993 season, the Braves signed renowned control pitcher [[Greg Maddux]], completing \u2013 along with Smoltz and Glavine \u2013 what many consider to be the [[Atlanta Braves 1990s pitching rotation|most accomplished starting trio]] ever assembled on a single major-league team. Smoltz again won 15 games, but suffered his first postseason loss to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in the [[1993 NLCS|NLCS]] despite not allowing an [[earned run]].\n\nSmoltz had a 6\u201310 record in the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] 1994 season, and during the break, had bone chips removed from his elbow.<ref name=\"Digest199610\"/> Returning as the Braves' No. 3 starter, he posted a 12\u20137 record in 1995. Ironically, the year the Braves won their one World Series title in their long run of division titles was the one year Smoltz had shaky postseason numbers. He did avoid being tagged with any losses despite a 6.60 ERA, but his Game 3 start in that World Series was his only poor World Series start in his career, getting knocked out in the third inning. But Smoltz and the Braves won the franchise's only World Series in Atlanta, thanks in great part to Maddux and Glavine, who had begun to overshadow Smoltz. Smoltz would have been the Game 7 starter had the series gone that far. \n\nThe next season, 1996, was the best of Smoltz's career. He went 24\u20138 with a 2.94 ERA and 276 strikeouts, including winning a franchise-record 14 straight decisions from April 9 to June 19.<ref name=\"Digest199610\">{{Cite magazine|last=Whiteside|first=Larry|year=October 1996|title=Braves' John Smoltz Makes A Pitch for Cy Young Award|magazine=[[Baseball Digest]]|volume=55|issue=10|pages=22\u201325|publisher=Lakeside Publishing Co|location=United States|issn=0005-609X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ysDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q|accessdate=June 22, 2010}}</ref> He continued to pitch brilliantly in the post-season, winning a game in the Division Series, two more in the League Championship Series, and somehow ending up only 1-1 in the World Series despite a 0.64 ERA, losing Game 5 1-0 on an unearned run. He won the NL [[Cy Young Award]] with 26 of the 28 first-place votes. Smoltz's effectiveness in 1997 was only slightly less than his Cy Young season, but frugal run support limited him to a 15\u201312 record. Smoltz also received a [[Silver Slugger Award]] for his batting.\n\n===Injuries and move to the bullpen (1998\u20132004)===\nSmoltz continued to post excellent statistics in 1998 and 1999, but he was spending significant time on the disabled list and missed about a quarter of his starts. In 1999, Smoltz began experimenting with both a knuckleball and a three-quarters delivery, though he rarely used either in game situations.<ref>[[Rob Neyer|Neyer, Rob]] and [[Bill James]], ''The Neyer-James Guide to Pichers''. New York: [[Simon & Schuster]], 2004. {{ISBN|0-7432-6158-5}}</ref>\n\nHe underwent [[Tommy John surgery]] before the 2000 season, and missed the entire year.<ref name=\"Digest200007\">{{Cite magazine|last=Kuenster|first=John|year=July 2000|title=Without John Smoltz, Braves May Be Pressed To Set New Winning Record|magazine=[[Baseball Digest]]|volume=59|issue=7|page=17|publisher=Lakeside Publishing Co|location=United States|issn=0005-609X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lysDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q|accessdate=June 22, 2010}}</ref> When he was unable to perform effectively as a starter in 2001, Smoltz made a transition to the bullpen, filling a void as Atlanta's new closer down the stretch, replacing [[John Rocker]].\n\nIn 2002, his first full season as a closer, Smoltz set a National League record with 55 saves, topping the previous mark of 53 shared by [[Randy Myers]] (1993) and [[Trevor Hoffman]] (1998). Smoltz finished third in the Cy Young Award voting; [[\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9]] equaled his record a year later with the Dodgers. Injuries limited Smoltz slightly in 2003, but he still recorded 45 saves with a 1.12 ERA in 64\u2153 innings pitched. In 2004, Smoltz finished with 44 saves, but was frustrated with his inability to make an impact as a closer during another Braves' postseason loss. That year, he broke [[Gene Garber]]'s franchise record of 141 career saves; his final total of 154 saves was eventually surpassed by [[Craig Kimbrel]] in 2014.\n\nBy this point, Smoltz was all that remained of the once-dominant Atlanta Braves' rotation of the 1990s. Tom Glavine had moved on to play for the Mets, a divisional rival, while Greg Maddux returned to his old team, the [[Chicago Cubs]].\n\n===Return to the rotation (2005\u20132008)===\nAfter three years as one of baseball's most dominating closers, the team's management agreed to return Smoltz to the starting rotation before the 2005 season. His renewed career as a starter began inauspiciously. He allowed six earned runs in only 1{{fraction|2|3}} innings\u2014matching the shortest starts of his career\u2014as the Braves were blown out on Opening Day by the Marlins. Poor run support contributed to an 0\u20133 start despite stronger pitching performances by Smoltz. After these initial difficulties, though, things fell into place. At the All-Star break, Smoltz was 9\u20135 with an ERA of 2.68 and was chosen for the 2005 NL All-Star team. Smoltz gave up a solo home run to [[Miguel Tejada]] in the second inning of the American League's 7\u20135 victory and was charged with the loss. For his career, he was 1\u20132 in All-Star games, putting him in a tie for the most losses.\n\nSmoltz finished 2005 at 14\u20137, with a 3.06 ERA and 169 strikeouts while allowing less than one hit per inning. Smoltz had answered the critics who doubted he would be able to reach the 200-inning plateau after three years in the bullpen. Nonetheless, Smoltz's increased workload caused him to wear down toward the end of the season.\n\nDespite a sore shoulder, Smoltz pitched seven innings in the Braves' 7\u20131 win over the [[Houston Astros]] in Game 2 of the [[2005 NLDS|2005 NL Division Series]]; it was the only game the Braves won in the series against the eventual National League champions. The victory over Houston gave Smoltz a 13\u20134 record as a starter (15\u20134 overall) with a 2.65 ERA in the postseason. In two of those post-season losses, he surrendered only unearned runs. He has the second most postseason wins (15) behind only [[Andy Pettitte]] with 19. They are followed by Glavine (14) and Maddux (11).\n\nIn 2006, Smoltz finished the season with a record of 16\u20139, an ERA of 3.49, and 211 strikeouts. He was one of four pitchers tied for the NL lead in wins, and was third in strikeouts. He pitched more than well enough for a 20-win season, but the Braves' bullpen blew six of his leads, on their way to being the single-handed cause of the end of the team's playoff appearance streak. The number of blown saves alone by the Braves' bullpen was greater than the number of games out of first place the team finished.  \n\n[[File:JohnSmoltz.jpg|thumb|upright|Smoltz in 2007]]\nOn September 21, 2006, the Braves announced they had picked up Smoltz's $8&nbsp;million contract option for the 2007 season. On April 26, 2007, Smoltz agreed to a contract extension with the Braves. The extension includes a $14&nbsp;million salary for the 2008 season, a $12&nbsp;million vesting option for 2009 dependent on his ability to pitch 200 innings in 2008 and a $12 or $13&nbsp;million team option for 2010 dependent on his ability to pitch 200 innings in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowman|first=Mark|title=Braves give Smoltz an extension: Veteran almost certain to finish legendary career in Atlanta|publisher=MLB.com|date=April 26, 2007|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070426&content_id=1932258&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb}}</ref>\n\n2007 was a year of reunions and milestones for Smoltz. On May 9, he faced Maddux for the first time since July 10, 1992. Smoltz earned a win in a 3\u20132 victory over the [[San Diego Padres]]; Maddux received no decision. On May 24, exactly 11 years to the day after recording his 100th win, Smoltz recorded his 200th win against Glavine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowman |first=Mark |url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/wrap.jsp?ymd=20070524&content_id=1983289&vkey=wrapup2005&fext=.jsp&team=home&c_id=atl |title=The Official Site of The Atlanta Braves: News: Game Wrapup |publisher=Atlanta.braves.mlb.com |date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=October 19, 2010}}</ref> He faced Glavine three other times, faring 3\u20131 overall against him. On June 27, Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux each recorded wins on the same day. On August 19, Smoltz set the Braves strikeout record by striking out the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]' [[Mark Reynolds (baseball)|Mark Reynolds]]. It was his 2,913th strikeout, passing [[Phil Niekro]] on the club' all-time list; he struck out a season-high 12 in the game.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Lutz |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070819&content_id=2158289&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Major League Baseball News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=August 19, 2007 |accessdate=October 19, 2010}}</ref> He finished the year 14\u20138 with a 3.11 ERA and 197 strikeouts.

[[Major League Baseball]] from 1988 to 2009, all but the last year with the [[Atlanta Braves]]. An eight-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], Smoltz was part of a [[Big Three (Atlanta Braves)|celebrated trio]] of [[starting pitcher]]s, along with [[Greg Maddux]] and [[Tom Glavine]], who propelled Atlanta to perennial pennant contention in the 1990s, highlighted by a championship in the [[1995 World Series]]. He won the [[National League]] (NL) [[Cy Young Award]] in 1996 after posting a [[win\u2013loss record (pitching)|record]] of 24&ndash;8, equaling the most victories by an NL pitcher since 1972. Though predominantly known as a starter, Smoltz was converted to a [[relief pitcher|reliever]] in 2001 after his recovery from [[Tommy John surgery]], and spent four years as the team's [[closer (baseball)|closer]] before returning to a starting role. In 2002, he set the NL record with 55 [[save (baseball)|saves]] and became only the second pitcher in history (joining [[Dennis Eckersley]]) to record both a 20-win season and a 50-save season. He is the only pitcher in major league history to record both 200 wins and 150 saves.\n\nSmoltz was one of the most prominent pitchers in playoff history, posting a record of 15&ndash;4 with a 2.67 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in 41 career postseason games, and was named the [[League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] of the [[1992 NLCS|1992 NL Championship Series]]; [[Andy Pettitte]] later broke his record for career postseason wins. Smoltz led the NL in wins, [[winning percentage]], [[strikeout]]s and [[innings pitched]] twice each, and his NL total of [[3,000 strikeout club|3,084 strikeouts]] ranked fifth in league history when he retired. He also holds the Braves franchise record for career strikeouts (3,011), and the record for the most career [[games pitched]] for the Braves (708) since the club's move to Atlanta in 1966; from 2004 to 2014, he held the franchise record for career saves. Smoltz left the Braves after 2008 and split his final season with the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Since retiring as a player, he has served as a [[color commentator]] and [[sports analyst|analyst]] on television. He was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2015|2015]], his first year of eligibility.\n\n==Minor leagues and trade to Atlanta==\nJohn Smoltz was an All-State baseball and football player at [[Waverly Senior High School|Waverly High School]] in [[Lansing, Michigan]], before the [[Detroit Tigers]] selected him in the 22nd round of the [[1985 Major League Baseball draft|1985 amateur draft]].<ref>Porter, David L. 2000. \"John Smoltz\" in ''The Biographical Dictionary of American Sports'', 1440\u20131441.

Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref> On August 12, 1987, he was traded to the [[Atlanta Braves]], where he played on their Class AAA Richmond Braves. The 1987 Tigers were in a three-team race, chasing the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for the [[AL East]] division lead; in need of pitching help, Detroit sent their 20-year-old prospect to the Braves for 36-year-old veteran [[Doyle Alexander]]. While Alexander did help the Tigers overtake the Blue Jays for the division title, he was out of baseball by 1989. Smoltz, on the other hand, became one of the cornerstones of the Braves franchise for the next two decades.\n\n==Major leagues==\n\n===Early years (1988\u20131997)===\nSmoltz made his major league debut on July 23, 1988. He posted poor statistics in a dozen starts, but in 1989 Smoltz blossomed. In 29 starts, he recorded a 12\u201311 record and 2.94 ERA while pitching 208 innings, and was named to the NL All-Star team. Teammate [[Tom Glavine]] also had his first good year in 1989, raising optimism about the future of Atlanta's pitching staff.\n\nOver his career, Smoltz threw a four-seam [[fastball]] that was clocked as high as 98 miles per hour, a strong, effective [[Slider (baseball)|slider]] and an 88\u201391&nbsp;mph [[split-finger fastball]] that he used as a [[strikeout]] pitch. He also used a [[curveball]] and [[change-up]] on occasion, and in 1999, he began experimenting with both a [[knuckleball]] and a [[screwball]], though he rarely used either in game situations.<ref>[[Rob Neyer|Neyer, Rob]] and [[Bill James]], ''The Neyer-James Guide to Pitchers''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7432-6158-5}}</ref> He admitted in 2016 that he neither learned to throw sliders until he reached the MLB, nor does he recommend children to throw sliders.<ref>{{Citation|last=MLB Network|title=John Smoltz On The Destruction Of A Slider On A Pitcher|date=2016-06-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb-q_tuFivE|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n\nSmoltz began the 1991 season with a 2\u201311 record. He began seeing a [[sports psychology|sports psychologist]], after which he closed out the season on a 12\u20132 pace,<ref>[http://editor.slate.com/default.aspx/id/2146635 Does sports psychology really work?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210020206/http://editor.slate.com/default.aspx/id/2146635 |date=December 10, 2007 }} by Daniel Engber \u2013 Slate Magazine</ref> helping the Braves win a tight NL West race. His winning ways continued into the [[1991 National League Championship Series]]. Smoltz won both his starts against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], capped by a complete game [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] in the seventh game, propelling the Braves to their first World Series since moving to Atlanta in 1966. Smoltz had two no-decisions against the [[Minnesota Twins]], with a 1.26 ERA. In the seventh and deciding game, he faced his former Detroit Tiger hero, [[Jack Morris]]. Both starters pitched shutout ball for seven innings, before Smoltz was removed from the 0\u20130 game during a Twins threat in the eighth. Atlanta reliever [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] pitched out of the jam, getting Smoltz off the hook, and Morris eventually pitched a 10-inning complete game victory.\n\nThe next year, Smoltz won 15 regular season games and was the MVP of the [[1992 National League Championship Series]], winning two games. He left the seventh game trailing, but ended up with a no-decision as the Braves mounted a dramatic ninth-inning comeback win. In the World Series that year, Smoltz started two of the six games in the series, with a no-decision in Game 2 and a win with the Braves facing elimination in Game 5.\n\nBefore the 1993 season, the Braves signed renowned control pitcher [[Greg Maddux]], completing \u2013 along with Smoltz and Glavine \u2013 what many consider to be the [[Atlanta Braves 1990s pitching rotation|most accomplished starting trio]] ever assembled on a single major-league team. Smoltz again won 15 games, but suffered his first postseason loss to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in the [[1993 NLCS|NLCS]] despite not allowing an [[earned run]].\n\nSmoltz had a 6\u201310 record in the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] 1994 season, and during the break, had bone chips removed from his elbow.<ref name=\"Digest199610\"/> Returning as the Braves' No. 3 starter, he posted a 12\u20137 record in 1995. Ironically, the year the Braves won their one World Series title in their long run of division titles was the one year Smoltz had shaky postseason numbers. He did avoid being tagged with any losses despite a 6.60 ERA, but his Game 3 start in that World Series was his only poor World Series start in his career, getting knocked out in the third inning. But Smoltz and the Braves won the franchise's only World Series in Atlanta, thanks in great part to Maddux and Glavine, who had begun to overshadow Smoltz. Smoltz would have been the Game 7 starter had the series gone that far. \n\nThe next season, 1996, was the best of Smoltz's career. He went 24\u20138 with a 2.94 ERA and 276 strikeouts, including winning a franchise-record 14 straight decisions from April 9 to June 19.<ref name=\"Digest199610\">{{Cite magazine|last=Whiteside|first=Larry|year=October 1996|title=Braves' John Smoltz Makes A Pitch for Cy Young Award|magazine=[[Baseball Digest]]|volume=55|issue=10|pages=22\u201325|publisher=Lakeside Publishing Co|location=United States|issn=0005-609X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ysDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q|accessdate=June 22, 2010}}</ref> He continued to pitch brilliantly in the post-season, winning a game in the Division Series, two more in the League Championship Series, and somehow ending up only 1-1 in the World Series despite a 0.64 ERA, losing Game 5 1-0 on an unearned run. He won the NL [[Cy Young Award]] with 26 of the 28 first-place votes. Smoltz's effectiveness in 1997 was only slightly less than his Cy Young season, but frugal run support limited him to a 15\u201312 record. Smoltz also received a [[Silver Slugger Award]] for his batting.\n\n===Injuries and move to the bullpen (1998\u20132004)===\nSmoltz continued to post excellent statistics in 1998 and 1999, but he was spending significant time on the disabled list and missed about a quarter of his starts. In 1999, Smoltz began experimenting with both a knuckleball and a three-quarters delivery, though he rarely used either in game situations.<ref>[[Rob Neyer|Neyer, Rob]] and [[Bill James]], ''The Neyer-James Guide to Pichers''. New York: [[Simon & Schuster]], 2004. {{ISBN|0-7432-6158-5}}</ref>\n\nHe underwent [[Tommy John surgery]] before the 2000 season, and missed the entire year.<ref name=\"Digest200007\">{{Cite magazine|last=Kuenster|first=John|year=July 2000|title=Without John Smoltz, Braves May Be Pressed To Set New Winning Record|magazine=[[Baseball Digest]]|volume=59|issue=7|page=17|publisher=Lakeside Publishing Co|location=United States|issn=0005-609X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lysDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA17#v=onepage&q|accessdate=June 22, 2010}}</ref> When he was unable to perform effectively as a starter in 2001, Smoltz made a transition to the bullpen, filling a void as Atlanta's new closer down the stretch, replacing [[John Rocker]].\n\nIn 2002, his first full season as a closer, Smoltz set a National League record with 55 saves, topping the previous mark of 53 shared by [[Randy Myers]] (1993) and [[Trevor Hoffman]] (1998). Smoltz finished third in the Cy Young Award voting; [[\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9]] equaled his record a year later with the Dodgers. Injuries limited Smoltz slightly in 2003, but he still recorded 45 saves with a 1.12 ERA in 64\u2153 innings pitched. In 2004, Smoltz finished with 44 saves, but was frustrated with his inability to make an impact as a closer during another Braves' postseason loss. That year, he broke [[Gene Garber]]'s franchise record of 141 career saves; his final total of 154 saves was eventually surpassed by [[Craig Kimbrel]] in 2014.\n\nBy this point, Smoltz was all that remained of the once-dominant Atlanta Braves' rotation of the 1990s. Tom Glavine had moved on to play for the Mets, a divisional rival, while Greg Maddux returned to his old team, the [[Chicago Cubs]].\n\n===Return to the rotation (2005\u20132008)===\nAfter three years as one of baseball's most dominating closers, the team's management agreed to return Smoltz to the starting rotation before the 2005 season. His renewed career as a starter began inauspiciously. He allowed six earned runs in only 1{{fraction|2|3}} innings\u2014matching the shortest starts of his career\u2014as the Braves were blown out on Opening Day by the Marlins. Poor run support contributed to an 0\u20133 start despite stronger pitching performances by Smoltz. After these initial difficulties, though, things fell into place. At the All-Star break, Smoltz was 9\u20135 with an ERA of 2.68 and was chosen for the 2005 NL All-Star team. Smoltz gave up a solo home run to [[Miguel Tejada]] in the second inning of the American League's 7\u20135 victory and was charged with the loss. For his career, he was 1\u20132 in All-Star games, putting him in a tie for the most losses.\n\nSmoltz finished 2005 at 14\u20137, with a 3.06 ERA and 169 strikeouts while allowing less than one hit per inning. Smoltz had answered the critics who doubted he would be able to reach the 200-inning plateau after three years in the bullpen. Nonetheless, Smoltz's increased workload caused him to wear down toward the end of the season.\n\nDespite a sore shoulder, Smoltz pitched seven innings in the Braves' 7\u20131 win over the [[Houston Astros]] in Game 2 of the [[2005 NLDS|2005 NL Division Series]]; it was the only game the Braves won in the series against the eventual National League champions. The victory over Houston gave Smoltz a 13\u20134 record as a starter (15\u20134 overall) with a 2.65 ERA in the postseason. In two of those post-season losses, he surrendered only unearned runs. He has the second most postseason wins (15) behind only [[Andy Pettitte]] with 19. They are followed by Glavine (14) and Maddux (11).\n\nIn 2006, Smoltz finished the season with a record of 16\u20139, an ERA of 3.49, and 211 strikeouts. He was one of four pitchers tied for the NL lead in wins, and was third in strikeouts. He pitched more than well enough for a 20-win season, but the Braves' bullpen blew six of his leads, on their way to being the single-handed cause of the end of the team's playoff appearance streak. The number of blown saves alone by the Braves' bullpen was greater than the number of games out of first place the team finished.  \n\n[[File:JohnSmoltz.jpg|thumb|upright|Smoltz in 2007]]\nOn September 21, 2006, the Braves announced they had picked up Smoltz's $8&nbsp;million contract option for the 2007 season. On April 26, 2007, Smoltz agreed to a contract extension with the Braves. The extension includes a $14&nbsp;million salary for the 2008 season, a $12&nbsp;million vesting option for 2009 dependent on his ability to pitch 200 innings in 2008 and a $12 or $13&nbsp;million team option for 2010 dependent on his ability to pitch 200 innings in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowman|first=Mark|title=Braves give Smoltz an extension: Veteran almost certain to finish legendary career in Atlanta|publisher=MLB.com|date=April 26, 2007|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070426&content_id=1932258&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb}}</ref>\n\n2007 was a year of reunions and milestones for Smoltz. On May 9, he faced Maddux for the first time since July 10, 1992. Smoltz earned a win in a 3\u20132 victory over the [[San Diego Padres]]; Maddux received no decision. On May 24, exactly 11 years to the day after recording his 100th win, Smoltz recorded his 200th win against Glavine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowman |first=Mark |url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/wrap.jsp?ymd=20070524&content_id=1983289&vkey=wrapup2005&fext=.jsp&team=home&c_id=atl |title=The Official Site of The Atlanta Braves: News: Game Wrapup |publisher=Atlanta.braves.mlb.com |date=May 24, 2007 |accessdate=October 19, 2010}}</ref> He faced Glavine three other times, faring 3\u20131 overall against him. On June 27, Smoltz, Glavine and Maddux each recorded wins on the same day. On August 19, Smoltz set the Braves strikeout record by striking out the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]' [[Mark Reynolds (baseball)|Mark Reynolds]]. It was his 2,913th strikeout, passing [[Phil Niekro]] on the club' all-time list; he struck out a season-high 12 in the game.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Lutz |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070819&content_id=2158289&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Major League Baseball News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=August 19, 2007 |accessdate=October 19, 2010}}</ref> He finished the year 14\u20138 with a 3.11 ERA and 197 strikeouts.

By using [[negative feedback]], the characteristics of an op-amp circuit, its gain, input and [[output impedance]], [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] etc. are determined by external components and have little dependence on [[temperature coefficient]]s or [[engineering tolerance]] in the op-amp itself.\n\nOp-amps are among the most widely used electronic devices today, being used in a vast array of consumer, industrial, and scientific devices. Many standard IC op-amps cost only a few cents in moderate production volume; however, some integrated or hybrid operational amplifiers with special performance specifications may cost over {{Currency|amount=100|code=US}} in small quantities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apex OP PA98 |url=http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/PA98/598-1337-ND/1761961 |accessdate=8 November 2015 |quote=APEX PA98 Op Amp Modules, Selling Price: $207.51 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101094650/http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/PA98/598-1337-ND/1761961|archivedate=1 January 2016}}</ref>  Op-amps may be packaged as components or used as elements of more complex integrated circuits.\n\nThe op-amp is one type of [[differential amplifier]]. Other types of differential amplifier include the [[fully differential amplifier]] (similar to the op-amp, but with two outputs), the [[instrumentation amplifier]] (usually built from three op-amps), the [[isolation amplifier]] (similar to the instrumentation amplifier, but with tolerance to [[Common-mode signal|common-mode voltages]] that would destroy an ordinary op-amp), and [[negative-feedback amplifier]] (usually built from one or more op-amps and a resistive feedback network).\n\n==Operation==\n[[Image:Op-amp open-loop 1.svg|thumb|An op-amp without negative feedback (a comparator)]]\nThe amplifier's differential inputs consist of a non-inverting input (+) with voltage ''V''<sub>+</sub> and an inverting input (\u2013) with voltage ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub>; ideally the op-amp amplifies only the difference in voltage between the two, which is called the ''differential input voltage''. The output voltage of the op-amp ''V''<sub>out</sub> is given by the equation\n:<math>V_\\text{out} = A_\\text{OL} (V_+ - V_-),</math>\nwhere ''A''<sub>OL</sub> is the [[Electronic feedback loops|open-loop]] gain of the amplifier (the term \"open-loop\" refers to the absence of a feedback loop from the output to the input).\n\n=== Open-loop amplifier  ===\nThe magnitude of ''A''<sub>OL</sub> is typically very  large (100,000 or more for integrated circuit op-amps), and therefore even a quite small difference between ''V''<sub>+</sub> and ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> drives the amplifier output nearly to the supply voltage. Situations in which the output voltage is equal to or greater than the supply voltage are referred to as ''saturation'' of the amplifier.  The magnitude of ''A''<sub>OL</sub> is not well controlled by the manufacturing process, and so it is impractical to use an open-loop amplifier as a stand-alone [[differential amplifier]].\n\nWithout [[negative feedback amplifier|negative feedback]], and perhaps with [[positive feedback]] for [[Regenerative circuit|regeneration]], an op-amp acts as a [[comparator]]. If the inverting input is held at ground (0&nbsp;V) directly or by a resistor ''R''<sub>g</sub>, and the input voltage ''V''<sub>in</sub> applied to the non-inverting input is positive, the output will be maximum positive; if ''V''<sub>in</sub> is negative, the output will be maximum negative. Since there is no feedback from the output to either input, this is an ''[[Electronic feedback loops|open-loop]]'' circuit acting as a [[comparator]].\n\n=== Closed-loop amplifier ===\n[[Image:Operational amplifier noninverting.svg|thumb|An op-amp with negative feedback (a non-inverting amplifier)]]\nIf predictable operation is desired, negative feedback is used, by applying a portion of the output voltage to the inverting input. The ''closed-loop'' feedback greatly reduces the gain of the circuit.  When negative feedback is used, the circuit's overall gain and response becomes determined mostly by the feedback network, rather than by the op-amp characteristics. If the feedback network is made of components with values small relative to the op amp's input impedance, the value of the op-amp's open-loop response ''A''<sub>OL</sub> does not seriously affect the circuit's performance. The response of the op-amp circuit with its input, output, and feedback circuits to an input is characterized mathematically by a [[transfer function]]; designing an op-amp circuit to have a desired transfer function is in the realm of [[electrical engineering]].  The transfer functions are important in most applications of op-amps, such as in [[analog computers]]. High input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] at the input terminals and low output impedance at the output terminal(s) are particularly useful features of an op-amp.\n\nIn the non-inverting amplifier on the right, the presence of negative feedback via the [[voltage divider]] ''R''<sub>f</sub>, ''R''<sub>g</sub> determines the ''closed-loop gain'' ''A''<sub>CL</sub> = ''V''<sub>out</sub>&nbsp;/&nbsp;''V''<sub>in</sub>. Equilibrium will be established when ''V''<sub>out</sub> is just sufficient to \"reach around and pull\" the inverting input to the same voltage as ''V''<sub>in</sub>. The voltage gain of the entire circuit is thus 1 + ''R''<sub>f</sub>/''R''<sub>g</sub>.

These rules are commonly used as a good first approximation for analyzing or designing op-amp circuits.<ref name=\"AoE\"/>{{rp|177}}\n\nNone of these ideals can be perfectly realized. A real op-amp may be modeled with non-infinite or non-zero parameters using equivalent resistors and capacitors in the op-amp model. The designer can then include these effects into the overall performance of the final circuit. Some parameters may turn out to have negligible effect on the final design while others represent actual limitations of the final performance that must be evaluated.\n\n=== Real op-amps ===\nReal op-amps differ from the ideal model in various aspects.\n\n====DC imperfections====\nReal operational amplifiers suffer from several non-ideal effects:\n\n;Finite gain: [[Open-loop gain]] is infinite in the ideal operational amplifier but finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit open-loop DC gain ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. So long as the [[loop gain]] (i.e., the product of open-loop and feedback gains) is very large, the circuit gain will be determined entirely by the amount of negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of open-loop gain). In cases where [[closed-loop gain]] must be very high, the feedback gain will be very low, and the low feedback gain causes low loop gain; in these cases, the operational amplifier will cease to behave ideally.\n\n;Finite [[input impedance]]s : The ''differential input impedance'' of the operational amplifier is defined as the impedance ''between'' its two inputs; the ''common-mode input impedance'' is the impedance from each input to ground.  [[MOSFET]]-input operational amplifiers often have protection circuits that effectively short circuit any input differences greater than a small threshold, so the input impedance can appear to be very low in some tests. However, as long as these operational amplifiers are used in a typical high-gain negative feedback application, these protection circuits will be inactive.  The input bias and leakage currents described below are a more important design parameter for typical operational amplifier applications.\n\n;Non-zero [[output impedance]]: Low output impedance is important for low-impedance loads; for these loads, the voltage drop across the output impedance effectively reduces the open loop gain. In configurations with a voltage-sensing negative feedback, the output impedance of the amplifier is effectively lowered; thus, in linear applications, op-amp circuits usually exhibit a very low output impedance.\n:Low-impedance outputs typically require high [[quiescent current|quiescent (i.e., idle) current]] in the output stage and will dissipate more power, so low-power designs may purposely sacrifice low output impedance.\n\n;Input current: Due to [[biasing]] requirements or [[Leakage (semiconductors)|leakage]], a small amount of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes, nA, for [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] op-amps, tens of picoamperes, pA, for [[JFET]] input stages, and only a few pA for [[MOSFET]] input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, ''and'' the impedance looking ''out'' of ''both'' inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the ''difference'' between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect.<!-- (unless the operational amplifier has poor [[Common-mode rejection ratio|CMRR]], which is described below). CMRR is usually much better than matching of currents, so not relevant. --> It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small ''offset voltage'' (different from the input offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.\n\n;Input offset [[voltage]]: This voltage, which is what is required across the op-amp's input terminals to drive the output voltage to zero.<ref>{{cite book |first=D. F. |last=Stout |title=Handbook of Operational Amplifier Circuit Design |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1976 |isbn=0-07-061797-X |pages=1\u201311}}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">This definition hews to the convention of measuring op-amp parameters with respect to the zero voltage point in the circuit, which is usually half the total voltage between the amplifier's positive and negative power rails.</ref> In the perfect amplifier, there would be no input offset voltage. However, it exists in actual op-amps because of imperfections in the differential amplifier that constitutes the input stage of the vast majority of these devices. Input offset voltage creates two problems: First, due to the amplifier's high voltage gain, it virtually assures that the amplifier output will go into saturation if it is operated without negative feedback, even when the input terminals are wired together. Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the input offset voltage is amplified along with the signal and this may pose a problem if high precision DC amplification is required or if the input signal is very small.<ref group=\"nb\">Many older designs of operational amplifiers have offset null inputs to allow the offset to be manually adjusted away. Modern precision op-amps can have internal circuits that automatically cancel this offset using [[chopper (electronics)|chopper]]s or other circuits that measure the offset voltage periodically and subtract it from the input voltage.</ref>\n\n;Common-mode gain: A perfect operational amplifier amplifies only the voltage difference between its two inputs, completely rejecting all voltages that are common to both. However, the differential input stage of an operational amplifier is never perfect, leading to the amplification of these common voltages to some degree. The standard measure of this defect is called the [[common-mode rejection ratio]] (denoted CMRR). Minimization of common mode gain is usually important in non-inverting amplifiers (described below) that operate at high amplification.\n\n;Power-supply rejection: The output of a perfect operational amplifier will be completely independent from its power supply. Every real operational amplifier has a finite [[power supply rejection ratio]] (PSRR) that reflects how well the op-amp can reject changes in its supply voltage.\n\n;Temperature effects: All parameters change with temperature. Temperature drift of the input offset voltage is especially important.\n\n;Drift: Real op-amp parameters are subject to slow change over time and with changes in temperature, input conditions, etc.\n\n====AC imperfections====\nThe op-amp gain calculated at DC does not apply at higher frequencies. Thus, for high-speed operation, more sophisticated considerations must be used in an op-amp circuit design.\n\n;Finite [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]: All amplifiers have finite bandwidth. To a first approximation, the op-amp has the frequency response of an [[integrator]] with gain. That is, the gain of a typical op-amp is inversely proportional to frequency and is characterized by its [[gain\u2013bandwidth product]]&nbsp;(GBWP). For example, an op-amp with a GBWP of 1&nbsp;MHz would have a gain of 5 at 200&nbsp;kHz, and a gain of 1 at 1&nbsp;MHz. This dynamic response coupled with the very high DC gain of the op-amp gives it the characteristics of a first-order [[low-pass filter]] with very high DC gain and low cutoff frequency given by the GBWP divided by the DC gain.{{paragraph break}}The finite bandwidth of an op-amp can be the source of several problems, including:{{glossary}}{{term|Stability}}{{defn|Associated with the bandwidth limitation is a phase difference between the input signal and the amplifier output that can lead to [[electronic oscillation|oscillation]] in some feedback circuits. For example, a sinusoidal output signal meant to interfere destructively with an input signal of the same frequency will interfere constructively if delayed by 180 degrees forming [[positive feedback]]. In these cases, the feedback circuit can be [[BIBO stability|stabilized]] by means of [[frequency compensation]], which increases the [[Gain margin|gain or phase margin]] of the open-loop circuit. The circuit designer can implement this compensation externally with a separate circuit component. Alternatively, the compensation can be implemented within the operational amplifier with the addition of a [[Frequency compensation#Dominant-pole compensation|dominant pole]] that sufficiently attenuates the high-frequency gain of the operational amplifier. The location of this pole may be fixed internally by the manufacturer or configured by the circuit designer using methods specific to the op-amp. In general, dominant-pole frequency compensation reduces the bandwidth of the op-amp even further. When the desired closed-loop gain is high, op-amp frequency compensation is often not needed because the requisite open-loop gain is sufficiently low; consequently, applications with high closed-loop gain can make use of op-amps with higher bandwidths.}}{{term|Distortion, and other effects}}{{defn|Limited bandwidth also results in lower amounts of feedback at higher frequencies, producing higher distortion, and output impedance as the frequency increases.}}{{glossary end}}{{paragraph break}}Typical low-cost, general-purpose op-amps exhibit a GBWP of a few megahertz. Specialty and high-speed op-amps exist that can achieve a GBWP of hundreds of megahertz. For very high-frequency circuits, a [[current-feedback operational amplifier]] is often used.\n\n;Noise: Amplifiers generate random voltage at the output even when there is no signal applied. This can be due to thermal noise and flicker noise of the devices. For applications with high gain or high bandwidth, noise becomes a very important consideration.\n\n;Input [[capacitance]]: Most important for high frequency operation because it reduces input impedance and may cause phase shifts.\n\n;Common-mode gain: See DC imperfections, above.\n\n;Power-supply rejection: With increasing frequency the power-supply rejection usually gets worse. So it can be important to keep the supply clean of higher frequency ripples and signals, e.g. by the use of [[bypass capacitor]]s.\n\n====Non-linear imperfections====\n[[File:Inverting Amplifier Signal Clipping.png|thumb|The input (yellow) and output (green) of a saturated op amp in an inverting amplifier]]\n; [[Clipping (signal processing)|Saturation]]:Output voltage is limited to a minimum and maximum value close to the [[power supply]] voltages.<ref group=\"nb\">That the output cannot reach the power supply voltages is usually the result of limitations of the amplifier's output stage transistors. See [[#Output stage|Output stage]].</ref> The output of older op-amps can reach to within one or two volts of the supply rails. The output of newer so-called \"rail to rail\" op-amps can reach to within millivolts of the supply rails when providing low output currents.\n; Slewing: The amplifier's output voltage reaches its maximum rate of change, the [[slew rate]], usually specified in volts per microsecond (V/\u03bcs). When slewing occurs, further increases in the input signal have no effect on the rate of change of the output. Slewing is usually caused by the input stage saturating; the result is a constant current {{mvar|i}} driving a capacitance {{mvar|C}} in the amplifier (especially those capacitances used to implement its [[frequency compensation]]); the slew rate is limited by {{math|d''v''/d''t'' {{=}} ''i''/''C''}}.{{paragraph break}} Slewing is associated with the ''large-signal'' performance of an op-amp.  Consider, for example, an op-amp configured for a gain of 10.  Let the input be a 1{{nbsp}}V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth wave. That is, the amplitude is 1{{nbsp}}V and the period is 10 microseconds. Accordingly, the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the input is 0.1{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  After 10\u00d7 amplification, the output should be a 10{{nbsp}}V,  100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth, with a corresponding slew rate of 1{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  However, the classic 741 op-amp has a 0.5{{nbsp}}V per microsecond slew rate specification, so that its output can rise to no more than 5{{nbsp}}V in the sawtooth's 10 microsecond period. Thus, if one were to measure the output, it would be a 5{{nbsp}}V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth, rather than a 10{{nbsp}}V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth.{{paragraph break}}Next consider the same amplifier and 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth, but now the input amplitude is 100{{nbsp}}mV rather than 1{{nbsp}}V.  After 10\u00d7 amplification the output is a 1{{nbsp}}V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth with a corresponding slew rate of 0.1{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  In this instance, the 741 with its 0.5{{nbsp}}V per microsecond slew rate will amplify the input properly.{{paragraph break}} Modern high speed op-amps can have slew rates in excess of 5,000{{nbsp}}V per microsecond. However, it is more common for op-amps to have slew rates in the range 5\u2013100{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  For example, the general purpose TL081 op-amp has a slew rate of 13{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  As a general rule, low power and small bandwidth op-amps have low slew rates.  As an example, the LT1494 micropower op-amp consumes 1.5 microamp but has a 2.7&nbsp;kHz gain-bandwidth product and a 0.001{{nbsp}}V per microsecond slew rate.\n\n; Non-[[linear]] input-output relationship: The output voltage may not be accurately proportional to the difference between the input voltages. It is commonly called distortion when the input signal is a waveform. This effect will be very small in a practical circuit where substantial negative feedback is used.\n\n; Phase reversal: In some integrated op-amps, when the published common mode voltage is violated (e.g., by one of the inputs being driven to one of the supply voltages), the output may slew to the opposite polarity from what is expected in normal operation.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-036.pdf\n |title=Op Amp Output Phase-Reversal and Input Over-Voltage Protection\n |year=2009\n |publisher=Analog Devices\n |accessdate=2012-12-27\n}}</ref><ref>\n {{cite web\n |url=http://www.edn.com/contents/images/45890.pdf\n |title=Bootstrapping your op amp yields wide voltage swings\n |last1=King\n |first1=Grayson\n |last2=Watkins\n |first2=Tim\n |date=13 May 1999\n |publisher=Electronic Design News\n |accessdate=2012-12-27\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305231302/http://www.edn.com/contents/images/45890.pdf |archivedate= March 5, 2014 }}</ref>  Under such conditions, negative feedback becomes positive, likely causing the circuit to \"lock up\" in that state.\n\n====Power considerations====\n;Limited [[current limiting|output current]]: The output current must be finite. In practice, most op-amps are designed to limit the output current so as not to exceed a specified level \u2013 around 25&thinsp;mA for a type 741 IC op-amp \u2013 thus protecting the op-amp and associated circuitry from damage. Modern designs are electronically more rugged than earlier implementations and some can sustain direct [[short circuit]]s on their outputs without damage.\n\n;Output sink current: The output sink current is the maximum current allowed to sink into the output stage. Some manufacturers show the output voltage vs. the output sink current plot, which gives an idea of the output voltage when it is sinking current from another source into the output pin.\n;Limited dissipated [[electric power|power]]: The output current flows through the op-amp's internal output impedance, generating heat which must be dissipated.  If the op-amp dissipates too much power, then its temperature will increase above some safe limit. The op-amp may enter thermal shutdown, or it may be destroyed.\nModern integrated [[Field effect transistor|FET]] or [[MOSFET]] op-amps approximate more closely the ideal op-amp than bipolar ICs when it comes to input impedance and input bias currents. Bipolars are generally better when it comes to input ''voltage'' offset, and often have lower noise. Generally, at room temperature, with a fairly large signal, and limited bandwidth, FET and MOSFET op-amps now offer better performance.\n\n== Internal circuitry of 741-type op-amp  ==\n[[Image:OpAmpTransistorLevel Colored Labeled.svg|thumb|right|500px|A component-level diagram of the common 741 op-amp.

Q2) will amount to ''i''<sub>1</sub> / \u03b2; typically ~50&nbsp;nA,<!-- per National Semiconductor specification for the LM741--> implying a current gain ''h''<sub>fe</sub> \u2248 200 for Q1(Q2).\n\nThis feedback circuit tends to draw the common base node of Q3/Q4 to a voltage ''V''<sub>com</sub> \u2212 2\u202f''V''<sub>BE</sub>, where ''V''<sub>com</sub> is the input common-mode voltage. At the same time, the magnitude of the quiescent current is relatively insensitive to the characteristics of the components Q1\u2013Q4, such as ''h''<sub>fe</sub>, that would otherwise cause temperature dependence or part-to-part variations.\n\nTransistor Q7 drives Q5 and Q6 into conduction until their (equal) collector currents match that of Q1/Q3 and Q2/Q4. The quiescent current in Q7 is ''V''<sub>BE</sub> / 50&nbsp;k\u03a9, about 35&nbsp;\u03bcA, as is the quiescent current in Q15, with its matching operating point. Thus, the quiescent currents are pairwise matched in Q1/Q2, Q3/Q4, Q5/Q6, and Q7/Q15. \n<!--\nThe classical [[Differential amplifier#Long-tailed pair|emitter-coupled differential stage]] is biased from the side of the emitters by connecting a constant current source to them. The series negative feedback (the emitter degeneration) makes the transistors act as voltage stabilizers; it forces them to adjust their ''V''<sub>BE</sub> voltages so that to pass the current through their collector-emitter junctions. As a result, ''the quiescent current is \u03b2-independent''.\n\nHere, the Q3/Q4 emitters are already used as inputs. Their collectors are separated and cannot be used as inputs for the quiescent current source since they behave as current sources. So, the quiescent current can be set only from the side of the bases by connecting a constant current source to them. To make it not depend on \u03b2 as above, a negative but parallel feedback is used. For this purpose, the total quiescent current is mirrored by Q8-Q9 current mirror and the negative feedback is taken from the Q9 collector. Now it makes the transistors Q1-Q4 adjust their ''V''<sub>BE</sub> voltages so that to pass the desired quiescent current. The effect is the same as at the classical emitter-coupled pair \u2014 ''the quiescent current is \u03b2-independent''. It is interesting fact that \"to the extent that all PNP \u03b2s match, this clever circuit generates just the right \u03b2-dependent base current to produce a \u03b2-independent collector current\".<ref name=\"Lee\" /> The biasing base currents are usually provided only by the negative power supply; they should come from the ground and enter the bases. But to ensure maximum high input impedances, the biasing loops are not internally closed between the base and ground; it is expected they will be closed externally by the input sources. So, the sources have to be galvanic (DC) to ensure paths for the biasing currents and low resistive enough (tens or hundreds kilohms) to not create significant voltage drops across them. Otherwise, additional DC elements should be connected between the bases and the ground (or the positive power supply).\n\nThe quiescent current is set by the 39 k\u03a9 resistor that is common for the two current mirrors Q12-Q13 and Q10-Q11. The current determined by this resistor acts also as a reference for the other bias currents used in the chip. The [[Widlar current mirror]] built by Q10, Q11, and the 5 k\u03a9 resistor produces a very small fraction of ''I''<sub>ref</sub> at the Q10 collector. This small constant current through Q10's collector supplies the base currents for Q3 and Q4 as well as the Q9 collector current. The Q8/Q9 current mirror tries to make Q9 collector current the same as the Q3 and Q4 collector currents and succeeds with the help of the negative feedback. The Q9 collector voltage changes until the ratio between the Q3/Q4 base and collector currents becomes equal to \u03b2. Thus Q3 and Q4's combined base currents (which are of the same order as the overall chip's input currents) are a small fraction of the already small Q10 current.\n\nThus the quiescent current is set by Q10-Q11 current mirror without using a current-sensing negative feedback. The voltage-sensing negative feedback only helps this process by stabilizing Q9 collector (Q3/Q4 base) voltage.<ref group=\"nb\">This arrangement can be generalized by an equivalent circuit consisting of a constant current source loaded by a voltage source; the voltage source fixes the voltage across the current source while the current source sets the current through the voltage source. As the two heterogeneous sources provide ideal load conditions for each other, this circuit solution is widely used in [[cascode|cascode circuits]], [[Wilson current mirror]], the input part of the simple [[current mirror]], emitter-coupled and other exotic circuits.</ref> The feedback loop also isolates the rest of the circuit from [[common-mode signal]]s by making the base voltage of Q3/Q4 follow tightly 2''V''<sub>BE</sub> below the higher of the two input voltages.\n-->\n\n==== Voltage amplifier ====\n\nQuiescent currents in Q16 and Q19 are set by the current mirror Q12/Q13, which is running at ~1&nbsp;mA. Through some{{vague|date=January 2016}} mechanism, the collector current in Q19 tracks that standing current.\n\n==== Output amplifier ====\n\nIn the circuit involving Q16 (variously named [[rubber diode]] or ''V''<sub>BE</sub> multiplier), the 4.5&nbsp;k&Omega; resistor must be conducting about 100&nbsp;\u03bcA, with the Q16 ''V''<sub>BE</sub> roughly 700&nbsp;mV. Then the ''V''<sub>CB</sub> must be about 0.45&nbsp;V and ''V''<sub>CE</sub> at about 1.0&nbsp;V. Because the Q16 collector is driven by a current source and the Q16 emitter drives into the Q19 collector current sink, the Q16 transistor establishes a voltage difference between Q14 base and Q20 base of ~1&nbsp;V, regardless of the common-mode voltage of Q14/Q20 base. The standing current in Q14/Q20 will be a factor [[diode modelling|exp(100&nbsp;mV / ''V''<sub>T</sub>) \u2248 36]] smaller than the 1&nbsp;mA quiescent current in the class A portion of the op amp. This (small) standing current in the output transistors establishes the output stage in class AB operation and reduces the [[crossover distortion]] of this stage. \n<!--\n[[Image:Block Diagram for Feedback.svg|thumb|right|The circuit presented as a negative feedback amplifier with constant input voltage|250px|right]]\nThe green outlined section (based on Q16) is a voltage level shifter named ''rubber diode'', ''transistor Zener'' or ''V''<sub>BE</sub> ''multiplier''. In the circuit as shown, Q16 provides a constant voltage drop across its collector-emitter junction regardless of the current through it (it acts as a voltage stabilizer). This is achieved by introducing a negative feedback between Q16 collector and its base, i.e. by connecting a voltage divider with ratio \u03b2 = 7.5 k\u03a9 / (4.5 k\u03a9 + 7.5 k\u03a9) = 0.625 composed by the two resistors. If the base current to the transistor is assumed to be zero, the negative feedback forces the transistor to increase its collector-emitter voltage up to 1 V until its base-emitter voltage reaches 0.625 V (a typical value for a BJT in the active region). This serves to bias the two output transistors slightly into conduction reducing [[crossover distortion]] (in some discrete component amplifiers, this function is usually achieved with a string of two silicon diodes).\n\nThe circuit can be presented as a negative feedback voltage amplifier with constant input voltage of 0.625 V and a feedback ratio of \u03b2 = 0.625 (a gain of 1/\u03b2 = 1.6). The same circuit but with \u03b2 = 1 is used in the input current-setting part of the classical [[Current mirror#Basic bipolar transistor mirror|BJT current mirror]].\n-->\n\n=== Small-signal differential mode ===\nA small differential input voltage signal gives rise, through multiple stages of current amplification, to a much larger voltage signal on output.\n\n==== Input impedance ====\nThe input stage with Q1 and Q3 is similar to an emitter-coupled pair (long-tailed pair), with Q2 and Q4 adding some degenerating impedance. The input impedance is relatively high because of the small current through Q1-Q4.  A typical 741 op amp has a differential input impedance of about 2 M&Omega;.<!-- per NS LM741 data sheet -->  The common mode input impedance is even higher, as the input stage works at an essentially constant current.\n\n==== Differential amplifier ====\nA differential voltage ''V''<sub>in</sub> at the op-amp inputs (pins 3 and 2, respectively) gives rise to a small differential current in the bases of Q1 and Q2 ''i''<sub>in</sub> \u2248 ''V''<sub>in</sub> / (2''h''<sub>ie</sub>''h''<sub>fe</sub>).  This differential base current causes a change in the differential collector current in each leg by ''i''<sub>in</sub>''h''<sub>fe</sub>. Introducing the transconductance of Q1, ''g''<sub>''m''</sub> = ''h''<sub>fe</sub> / ''h''<sub>ie</sub>, the (small-signal) current at the base of Q15 (the input of the voltage gain stage) is ''V''<sub>in</sub>''g''<sub>''m''</sub> / 2.\n\nThis portion of the op amp cleverly changes a differential signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal at the base of Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3&nbsp;dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and feedthrough of power supply noise. \n<!-- The input voltage sources are connected through two \"diode\" strings, each of them consisting of two connected in series base-emitter junctions (Q1-Q3 and Q2-Q4), to the common point of Q3/Q4 bases. So, if the input voltages change slightly in opposite directions, Q3/Q4 bases stay at relatively constant voltage and the common base current does not change as well; it only vigorously steers between Q3/Q4 bases and makes the common quiescent current distribute between Q3/Q4 collectors in the same proportion.<ref group=\"nb\">If the input differential voltage changes significantly (with more than about a hundred millivolts), the base-emitter junctions of the transistors driven by the lower input voltage (e.g., Q1 and Q3) become backward biased and the total common base current flows through the other (Q2 and Q4) base-emitter junctions. However, the high breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors Q3/Q4 prevents Q1/Q2 base-emitter junctions from damaging when the input difference voltage increases up to 50 V because of the unlimited current that may flow directly through the \"diode bridge\" between the two input sources.</ref> The current mirror inverts Q3 collector current and tries to pass it through Q4. In the middle point between Q4 and Q6, the signal currents (current changes) of Q3 and Q4 are subtracted. In this case (differential input signal), they are equal and opposite. Thus, the difference is twice the individual signal currents (\u0394''I'' \u2212 (\u2212\u0394''I'') = 2\u0394''I'')<! --{{Dubious|date=June 2011}} if signals equal and opposite, their sum would be zero. Must explain the mirror's gain. -- > and the differential to single ended conversion is completed without gain losses. The open circuit signal voltage appearing at this point is given by the product of the subtracted signal currents and the total circuit impedance (the paralleled collector resistances of Q4 and Q6). Since the collectors of Q4 and Q6 appear as high differential resistances to the signal current (Q4 and Q6 behave as current sources), the open circuit voltage gain of this stage is very high.<ref group=\"nb\">This circuit (and geometrical) phenomenon can be illustrated graphically by superimposing the Q4 and Q6 output characteristics (almost parallel horizontal lines) on the same coordinate system. When the input voltages vary slightly in opposite directions, the two curves move slightly toward each other in the vertical direction but the operating (cross) point moves vigorously in the horizontal direction. The ratio between the two movements represents the high amplification.</ref>\n\nMore intuitively, the transistor Q6 can be considered as a duplicate of Q3 and the combination of Q4 and Q6 can be thought as of a varying voltage divider composed of two voltage-controlled resistors. For differential input signals, they vigorously change their instant resistances in opposite directions but the total resistance stays constant (like a potentiometer with quickly moving slider). As a result, the current stays constant as well but the voltage at the middle point changes vigorously. As the two resistance changes are equal and opposite, the effective voltage change is twice the individual change. -->\n\n==== Voltage amplifier ====\nA current signal ''i'' at Q15's base gives rise to a current in Q19 of order ''i''\u03b2<sup>2</sup> (the product of the ''h''<sub>fe</sub> of each of Q15 and Q19, which are connected in a [[Darlington pair]]). This current signal develops a voltage at the bases of output transistors Q14/Q20 proportional to the ''h''<sub>ie</sub> of the respective transistor.\n\n==== Output amplifier ====\nOutput transistors Q14 and Q20 are each configured as an emitter follower, so no voltage gain occurs there; instead, this stage provides current gain, equal to the ''h''<sub>fe</sub> of Q14 (resp. Q20).\n\nThe output impedance is not zero, as it would be in an ideal op-amp, but with negative feedback it approaches zero at low frequencies.\n\n==== Overall open-loop voltage gain ====\nThe net open-loop small-signal voltage gain of the op amp involves the product of the current gain ''h''<sub>fe</sub> of some 4 transistors. In practice, the voltage gain for a typical 741-style op amp is of order 200,000,<!-- per NS LM741 data sheet --> and the current gain, the ratio of input impedance (~2\u22126 M&Omega;) to output impedance (~50{{nbsp}}&Omega;) provides yet more (power) gain.\n\n=== Other linear characteristics ===\n\n==== Small-signal common mode gain ====\nThe ideal op amp has infinite [[common-mode rejection ratio]], or zero common-mode gain.\n\nIn the present circuit, if the input voltages change in the same direction, the negative feedback makes Q3/Q4 base voltage follow (with 2''V''<sub>BE</sub> below) the input voltage variations. Now the output part (Q10) of Q10-Q11 current mirror keeps up the common current through Q9/Q8 constant in spite of varying voltage. Q3/Q4 collector currents, and accordingly the output current at the base of Q15, remain unchanged.\n\nIn the typical 741 op amp, the common-mode rejection ratio is 90&nbsp;dB,<!-- per NS LM741 data sheet --> implying an open-loop common-mode voltage gain of about 6.<!-- 200,000 / 10^^(4.5) -->\n\n==== Frequency compensation ====\nThe innovation of the Fairchild \u03bcA741 was the introduction of [[frequency compensation]] via an on-chip (monolithic) capacitor, simplifying application of the op amp by eliminating the need for external components for this function. \nThe 30 pF capacitor stabilizes the amplifier via [[Miller effect|Miller compensation]] and functions in a manner similar to an op-amp [[integrator]] circuit. Also known as 'dominant [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] compensation' because it introduces a pole that masks (dominates) the effects of other poles into the open loop frequency response; in a 741 op amp this pole can be as low as 10&nbsp;Hz (where it causes a \u22123&nbsp;dB loss of open loop voltage gain).\n\nThis internal compensation is provided to achieve unconditional [[BIBO stability|stability]] of the amplifier in negative feedback configurations where the feedback network is non-reactive and the [[Electronic feedback loops|closed loop]] gain is [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] or higher. \nBy contrast, amplifiers requiring external compensation, such as the \u03bcA748, may require external compensation or closed-loop gains significantly higher than unity.\n\n==== Input offset voltage ====\nThe \"offset null\" pins may be used to place external resistors (typically in the form of the two ends of a potentiometer, with the slider connected to ''V''<sub>''S''\u2013</sub>) in parallel with the emitter resistors of Q5 and Q6, to adjust the balance of the Q5/Q6 current mirror. The potentiometer is adjusted such that the output is null (midrange) when the inputs are shorted together.\n\n=== Non-linear characteristics ===\n\n==== Input breakdown voltage ====\nThe transistors Q3, Q4 help to increase the reverse ''V''<sub>BE</sub> rating: the base-emitter junctions of the NPN transistors Q1 and Q2 break down at around 7{{nbsp}}V, but the PNP transistors Q3 and Q4 have ''V''<sub>BE</sub> breakdown voltages around 50{{nbsp}}V.<ref>[http://ecow.engr.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/get/ece/342/schowalter/notes/chapter10/theua741operationalamplifier.ppt The \u03bcA741 Operational Amplifier] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==== Output-stage voltage swing and current limiting ====\nVariations in the quiescent current with temperature, or between parts with the same type number, are common, so [[crossover distortion]] and [[quiescent current]] may be subject to significant variation.\n\nThe output range of the amplifier is about one volt less than the supply voltage, owing in part to ''V''<sub>BE</sub> of the output transistors Q14 and Q20.\n\nThe 25 \u03a9 resistor at the Q14 emitter, along with Q17, acts to limit Q14 current to about 25 mA; otherwise, Q17 conducts no current.\n\nCurrent limiting for Q20 is performed in the voltage gain stage: Q22 senses the voltage across Q19's emitter resistor (50{{nbsp}}&Omega;); as it turns on, it diminishes the drive current to Q15 base.\n\nLater versions of this amplifier schematic may show a somewhat different method of output current limiting.\n\n===Applicability considerations===\nWhile the 741 was historically used in audio and other sensitive equipment, such use is now rare because of the improved [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] performance of more modern op-amps. Apart from generating noticeable hiss, 741s and other older op-amps may have poor [[common-mode rejection ratio]]s and so will often introduce cable-borne mains hum and other common-mode interference, such as switch 'clicks', into sensitive equipment.\n\nThe \"741\" has come to often mean a generic op-amp IC (such as \u03bcA741, LM301, 558, LM324, TBA221 \u2014 or a more modern replacement such as the TL071).  The description of the 741 output stage is qualitatively similar for many other designs (that may have quite different input stages), except:\n* Some devices (\u03bcA748, LM301, LM308) are not internally compensated (require an external capacitor from output to some point within the operational amplifier, if used in low closed-loop gain applications).\n* Some modern devices have \"rail-to-rail output\" capability, meaning that the output can range from within a few millivolts of the positive supply voltage to within a few millivolts of the negative supply voltage.\n\n== Classification ==\nOp-amps may be classified by their construction:\n* discrete (built from individual [[transistor]]s or [[vacuum tube|tubes/valves]])\n* IC (fabricated in an [[Integrated circuit]]) \u2014 most common\n* hybrid\nIC op-amps may be classified in many ways, including:\n* Military, Industrial, or Commercial grade (for example: the LM301 is the commercial grade version of the LM101, the LM201 is the industrial version). This may define [[operating temperature]] ranges and other environmental or quality factors.\n* Classification by package type may also affect environmental hardiness, as well as manufacturing options; [[Dual in-line package|DIP]], and other through-hole packages are tending to be replaced by [[Surface-mount technology|surface-mount devices]].\n* Classification by internal compensation: op-amps may suffer from high frequency [[Nyquist stability criterion|instability]] in some [[negative feedback]] circuits unless a small compensation capacitor modifies the phase and frequency responses. Op-amps with a built-in capacitor are termed \"''compensated''\", and allow circuits above some specified [[Electronic feedback loops|closed-loop]] gain to operate stably with no external capacitor.  In particular, op-amps that are stable even with a closed loop gain of 1 are called \"unity gain compensated\".\n* Single, dual and quad versions of many commercial op-amp IC are available, meaning 1, 2 or 4 operational amplifiers are included in the same package.\n* Rail-to-rail input (and/or output) op-amps can work with input (and/or output) signals very close to the power supply rails.\n* [[CMOS]] op-amps (such as the CA3140E) provide extremely high input resistances, higher than [[JFET]]-input op-amps, which are normally higher than [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]]-input op-amps.\n* other varieties of op-amp include programmable op-amps (simply meaning the quiescent current, bandwidth and so on can be adjusted by an external resistor).\n* manufacturers often tabulate their op-amps according to purpose, such as low-noise pre-amplifiers, wide bandwidth amplifiers, and so on.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[Image:Generic 741 pinout top.png|thumb|[[Dual in-line package|DIP]] [[pinout]] for 741-type operational amplifier]]\n\n{{Main|Operational amplifier applications}}\n\n=== Use in electronics system design ===\nThe use of op-amps as circuit blocks is much easier and clearer than specifying all their individual circuit elements (transistors, resistors, etc.), whether the amplifiers used are integrated or discrete circuits. In the first approximation op-amps can be used as if they were ideal differential gain blocks; at a later stage limits can be placed on the acceptable range of parameters for each op-amp.\n\nCircuit design follows the same lines for all electronic circuits. A specification is drawn up governing what the circuit is required to do, with allowable limits. For example, the gain may be required to be 100 times, with a tolerance of 5% but drift of less than 1% in a specified temperature range; the input impedance not less than one megohm; etc.\n\nA basic [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] is designed, often with the help of circuit modeling (on a computer). Specific commercially available op-amps and other components are then chosen that meet the design criteria within the specified tolerances at acceptable cost. If not all criteria can be met, the specification may need to be modified.\n\nA prototype is then built and tested; changes to meet or improve the specification, alter functionality, or reduce the cost, may be made.\n\n=== Applications without using any feedback ===\nThat is, the op-amp is being used as a [[voltage comparator]]. Note that a device designed primarily as a comparator may be better if, for instance, speed is important or a wide range of input voltages may be found, since such devices can quickly recover from full on or full off (\"saturated\") states.\n\nA ''voltage level detector'' can be obtained if a reference voltage ''V''<sub>ref</sub> is applied to one of the op-amp's inputs. This means that the op-amp is set up as a comparator to detect a positive voltage. If the voltage to be sensed, ''E''<sub>i</sub>, is applied to op amp's (+) input, the result is a noninverting positive-level detector: when ''E''<sub>i</sub> is above ''V''<sub>ref</sub>, ''V''<sub>O</sub> equals +''V''<sub>sat</sub>; when ''E''<sub>i</sub> is below ''V''<sub>ref</sub>, ''V''<sub>O</sub> equals \u2212''V''<sub>sat</sub>. If ''E''<sub>i</sub> is applied to the inverting input, the circuit is an inverting positive-level detector: When ''E''<sub>i</sub> is above ''V''<sub>ref</sub>, ''V''<sub>O</sub> equals \u2212''V''<sub>sat</sub>.\n\nA ''zero voltage level detector'' (''E''<sub>i</sub> = 0) can convert, for example, the output of a sine-wave from a function generator into a variable-frequency square wave. If ''E''<sub>i</sub> is a sine wave, triangular wave, or wave of any other shape that is symmetrical around zero, the zero-crossing detector's output will be square.  Zero-crossing detection may also be useful in triggering [[TRIAC]]s at the best time to reduce mains interference and current spikes.\n\n===Positive-feedback applications===\n\n[[Image:Op-Amp Schmitt Trigger.svg|right|thumb|300px|Schmitt trigger implemented by a non-inverting comparator]]\n\nAnother typical configuration of op-amps is with positive feedback, which takes a fraction of the output signal back to the non-inverting input. An important application of it is the comparator with hysteresis, the [[Schmitt trigger]].  Some circuits may use ''positive'' feedback and ''negative'' feedback around the same amplifier, for example [[triangle wave|triangle-wave]] [[oscillator]]s and [[active filters]].\n\nBecause of the wide slew range and lack of positive feedback, the response of all the open-loop level detectors described [[#Applications without using any feedback|above]] will be relatively slow. External overall positive feedback may be applied, but (unlike internal positive feedback that may be applied within the latter stages of a purpose-designed comparator) this markedly affects the accuracy of the zero-crossing detection point. Using a general-purpose op-amp, for example, the frequency of ''E''<sub>i</sub> for the sine to square wave converter should probably be below 100&nbsp;Hz.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Negative-feedback applications===\n\n==== Non-inverting amplifier ====\n[[Image:Op-Amp Non-Inverting Amplifier.svg|frame|An op-amp connected in the non-inverting amplifier configuration]]\nIn a non-inverting amplifier, the output voltage changes in the same direction as the input voltage.\n\nThe gain equation for the op-amp is\n:<math>V_\\text{out} = A_\\text{OL} (V_+ - V_-).</math>\n\nHowever, in this circuit ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> is a function of ''V''<sub>out</sub> because of the negative feedback through the ''R''<sub>1</sub> ''R''<sub>2</sub> network.

When the operational amplifier's input bias currents are significant, then the DC source resistances driving the inputs should be balanced.<ref>An input bias current of 1&nbsp;&micro;A through a DC source resistance of 10&nbsp;k&Omega; produces a 10&nbsp;mV offset voltage.

Balancing the DC source resistances may not be necessary if the input bias current and source resistance product is small.</ref>  The ideal value for the feedback resistors (to give minimal offset voltage) will be such that the two resistances in parallel roughly equal the resistance to ground at the non-inverting input pin.  That ideal value assumes the bias currents are well matched, which may not be true for all op-amps.<ref>{{cite web |author=Analog Devices |title=Op Amp Input Bias Current |date=2009 |id=Tutorial MT-038 |publisher=Analog Devices |url=http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-038.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==== Inverting amplifier ====\n[[Image:Op-Amp Inverting Amplifier.svg|frame|right|An op-amp connected in the inverting amplifier configuration]]\n\nIn an inverting amplifier, the output voltage changes in an opposite direction to the input voltage.\n\nAs with the non-inverting amplifier, we start with the gain equation of the op-amp:\n\n:<math>V_\\text{out} = A_\\text{OL} (V_+ - V_-).</math>\n\nThis time, ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> is a function of both ''V''<sub>out</sub> and ''V''<sub>in</sub> due to the voltage divider formed by ''R''<sub>f</sub> and ''R''<sub>in</sub>.

That is, the capacitive component of the input impedance inserts a DC [[complex zero|zero]] and a low-frequency [[complex pole|pole]] that gives the circuit a [[bandpass]] or [[high-pass]] characteristic.\n\nThe potentials at the operational amplifier inputs remain virtually constant (near ground) in the inverting configuration.  The constant operating potential typically results in  distortion levels that are lower than those attainable with the non-inverting topology.\n\n===Other applications===\n\n* audio- and video-frequency [[preamplifier|pre-amplifiers]] and [[Buffer amplifier|buffer]]s\n* [[differential amplifier]]s\n* [[differentiator]]s and [[integrator]]s\n* [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]]s\n* [[precision rectifier]]s\n* precision [[peak detector]]s\n* voltage and current [[Voltage regulator|regulators]]\n* analog calculators\n* [[analog to digital converter|analog-to-digital converters]]\n* [[Digital to analog converter|digital-to-analog converters]]\n* [[Clamper (electronics)|Voltage clamping]]\n* [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s and [[waveform generator]]s\n* clipper\n* clamper(dc inserter or restorer)\n* LOG and ANTILOG amplifiers\n\nMost single, dual and quad op-amps available have a standardized pin-out which permits one type to be substituted for another without wiring changes. A specific op-amp may be chosen for its open loop gain, bandwidth, noise performance, input impedance, power consumption, or a compromise between any of these factors.\n\n==Historical timeline==\n'''1941: A vacuum tube op-amp.''' An op-amp, defined as a general-purpose, DC-coupled, high gain, inverting feedback [[amplifier]], is first found in {{US patent|2,401,779}} \"Summing Amplifier\" filed by [[Karl D. Swartzel Jr.]] of Bell Labs in 1941. This design used three [[vacuum tube]]s to achieve a gain of {{nowrap|90 dB}} and operated on voltage rails of {{nowrap|\u00b1350 V}}. It had a single inverting input rather than differential inverting and non-inverting inputs, as are common in today's op-amps. Throughout [[World War II]], Swartzel's design proved its value by being liberally used in the M9 [[Director (military)|artillery director]] designed at Bell Labs. This artillery director worked with the SCR584 [[radar]] system to achieve extraordinary hit rates (near 90%) that would not have been possible otherwise.<ref name=\"Jung-2004\">{{cite book |title=Op Amp Applications Handbook |page=777 |chapter=Chapter 8: Op Amp History |first=Walter G. |last=Jung |publisher=Newnes |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7506-7844-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dunqt1rt4sAC |accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:K2-w Vacuum Tube Op-amp.jpg|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's K2-W: a vacuum-tube op-amp (1953)]]\n\n'''1947: An op-amp with an explicit non-inverting input.''' In 1947, the operational amplifier was first formally defined and named in a paper<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ragazzini |first1=John R. |author1-link=John R.

Ragazzini]] of Columbia University. In this same paper a footnote mentioned an op-amp design by a student that would turn out to be quite significant. This op-amp, designed by [[Loebe Julie]], was superior in a variety of ways. It had two major innovations. Its input stage used a long-tailed [[triode]] pair with loads matched to reduce drift in the output and, far more importantly, it was the first op-amp design to have two inputs (one inverting, the other non-inverting). The differential input made a whole range of new functionality possible, but it would not be used for a long time due to the rise of the chopper-stabilized amplifier.<ref name=\"Jung-2004\"/>\n\n'''1949: A chopper-stabilized op-amp.''' In 1949, Edwin A. Goldberg designed a [[Chopper (electronics)|chopper]]-stabilized op-amp.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/39-05/Web_ChH_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007072916/http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/39-05/Web_ChH_final.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-07 }}</ref> This set-up uses a normal op-amp with an additional [[Alternating current|AC]] amplifier that goes alongside the op-amp. The chopper gets an AC signal from [[Direct current|DC]] by switching between the DC voltage and ground at a fast rate (60&nbsp;Hz or 400&nbsp;Hz). This signal is then amplified, rectified, filtered and fed into the op-amp's non-inverting input. This vastly improved the gain of the op-amp while significantly reducing the output drift and DC offset. Unfortunately, any design that used a chopper couldn't use their non-inverting input for any other purpose. Nevertheless, the much improved characteristics of the chopper-stabilized op-amp made it the dominant way to use op-amps. Techniques that used the non-inverting input regularly would not be very popular until the 1960s when op-amp [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s started to show up in the field.\n\n'''1953: A commercially available op-amp.''' In 1953, vacuum tube op-amps became commercially available with the release of the model K2-W from [[George A. Philbrick]] Researches, Incorporated.  The designation on the devices shown, GAP/R, is an acronym for the complete company name. Two nine-pin [[12AX7]] vacuum tubes were mounted in an octal package and had a model K2-P chopper add-on available that would effectively \"use up\" the non-inverting input. This op-amp was based on a descendant of Loebe Julie's 1947 design and, along with its successors, would start the widespread use of op-amps in industry.\n\n[[Image:Discrete opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's model P45: a solid-state, discrete op-amp (1961).]]\n\n'''1961: A discrete IC op-amp.''' With the birth of the [[transistor]] in 1947, and the silicon transistor in 1954, the concept of ICs became a reality. The introduction of the [[planar process]] in 1959 made transistors and ICs stable enough to be commercially useful. By 1961, solid-state, discrete op-amps were being produced. These op-amps were effectively small circuit boards with packages such as [[edge connector]]s. They usually had hand-selected resistors in order to improve things such as voltage offset and drift. The P45 (1961) had a gain of 94&nbsp;dB and ran on \u00b115&nbsp;V rails. It was intended to deal with signals in the range of {{nowrap|\u00b110 V}}.\n\n'''1961: A varactor bridge op-amp.''' There have been many different directions taken in op-amp design. [[Varactor]] bridge op-amps started to be produced in the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philbrickarchive.org/ |title=The Philbrick Archive |website=www.philbrickarchive.org |accessdate=28 April 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120907192216/http://www.philbrickarchive.org/ |archivedate=7 September 2012 }}</ref><ref>June 1961 advertisement for Philbrick P2, {{cite web |url=http://www.philbrickarchive.org/p2%20and%206033%20ad%20rsi%20vol32%20no6%20june1961.pdf |title=The all-new, all solid-state Philbrick P2 amplifier |accessdate=2011-05-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008160503/http://www.philbrickarchive.org/p2%20and%206033%20ad%20rsi%20vol32%20no6%20june1961.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-08 }}</ref> They were designed to have extremely small input current and are still amongst the best op-amps available in terms of common-mode rejection with the ability to correctly deal with hundreds of volts at their inputs.\n\n[[Image:Modular opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's model PP65: a solid-state op-amp in a potted module (1962)]]\n\n'''1962: An op-amp in a potted module.''' By 1962, several companies were producing modular potted packages that could be plugged into [[printed circuit board]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shannon|first=Robin|title=Linear Integrated Circuits|publisher=ED-Tech Press|year=2019|isbn=978-1-83947-241-1|location=United Kingdom|pages=144}}</ref> These packages were crucially important as they made the operational amplifier into a single [[black box]] which could be easily treated as a component in a larger circuit.\n\n'''1963: A monolithic IC op-amp.''' In 1963, the first monolithic IC op-amp, the \u03bcA702 designed by [[Bob Widlar]] at Fairchild Semiconductor, was released. Monolithic [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s consist of a single chip as opposed to a chip and discrete parts (a discrete IC) or multiple chips bonded and connected on a circuit board (a hybrid IC). Almost all modern op-amps are monolithic ICs; however, this first IC did not meet with much success. Issues such as an uneven supply voltage, low gain and a small dynamic range held off the dominance of monolithic op-amps until 1965 when the \u03bcA709<ref>{{cite book |first=A. P. |last=Malvino |title=Electronic Principles |edition=2nd |date=1979 |isbn=0-07-039867-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/electronicprinci00malv/page/476 476] |url=https://archive.org/details/electronicprinci00malv/page/476 }}</ref> (also designed by Bob Widlar) was released.\n\n'''1968: Release of the \u03bcA741.''' The popularity of monolithic op-amps was further improved upon the release of the LM101 in 1967, which solved a variety of issues, and the subsequent release of the \u03bcA741 in 1968. The \u03bcA741 was extremely similar to the LM101 except that Fairchild's facilities allowed them to include a 30&nbsp;pF compensation capacitor inside the chip instead of requiring external compensation. This simple difference has made the 741 ''the'' canonical op-amp and many modern amps base their pinout on the 741s. The \u03bcA741 is still in production, and has become ubiquitous in electronics\u2014many manufacturers produce a version of this classic chip, recognizable by part numbers containing ''741''. The same part is manufactured by several companies.\n\n'''1970: First high-speed, low-input current FET design.'''\nIn the 1970s high speed, low-input current designs started to be made by using [[Field-effect transistor|FET]]s. These would be largely replaced by op-amps made with [[MOSFET]]s in the 1980s. \n[[Image:Hybrid opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|ADI's HOS-050: a high speed hybrid IC op-amp (1979)]]\n\n'''1972: Single sided supply op-amps being produced.''' A single sided supply op-amp is one where the input and output voltages can be as low as the negative power supply voltage instead of needing to be at least two volts above it.  The result is that it can operate in many applications with the negative supply pin on the op-amp being connected to the signal ground, thus eliminating the need for a separate negative power supply.\n\nThe LM324 (released in 1972) was one such op-amp that came in a quad package (four separate op-amps in one package) and became an industry standard. In addition to packaging multiple op-amps in a single package, the 1970s also saw the birth of op-amps in hybrid packages. These op-amps were generally improved versions of existing monolithic op-amps. As the properties of monolithic op-amps improved, the more complex hybrid ICs were quickly relegated to systems that are required to have extremely long service lives or other specialty systems.\n\n[[Image:LM741CN.jpg|right|thumb|120px|An op-amp in a mini DIP package]]\n\n'''Recent trends.''' Recently supply voltages in analog circuits have decreased (as they have in digital logic) and low-voltage op-amps have been introduced reflecting this.  Supplies of 5&nbsp;V and increasingly 3.3&nbsp;V (sometimes as low as 1.8&nbsp;V) are common.  To maximize the signal range modern op-amps commonly have rail-to-rail output (the output signal can range from the lowest supply voltage to the highest) and sometimes rail-to-rail inputs. Recent \"boomer\" amplifiers such as the LM4871 and 8002 also have a shutdown feature, an internal power supply for biasing, and a bypass pin to connect a bypass capacitor for that power supply.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Active filter]]\n* [[Analog computer]]\n* [[Bob Widlar]]\n* [[Current conveyor]]\n* [[Current-feedback operational amplifier]]\n* [[Differential amplifier]]\n* [[George A.

Other types of differential amplifier include the [[fully differential amplifier]] (similar to the op-amp, but with two outputs), the [[instrumentation amplifier]] (usually built from three op-amps), the [[isolation amplifier]] (similar to the instrumentation amplifier, but with tolerance to [[Common-mode signal|common-mode voltages]] that would destroy an ordinary op-amp), and [[negative-feedback amplifier]] (usually built from one or more op-amps and a resistive feedback network).\n\n==Operation==\n[[Image:Op-amp open-loop 1.svg|thumb|An op-amp without negative feedback (a comparator)]]\nThe amplifier's differential inputs consist of a non-inverting input (+) with voltage ''V''<sub>+</sub> and an inverting input (\u2013) with voltage ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub>; ideally the op-amp amplifies only the difference in voltage between the two, which is called the ''differential input voltage''. The output voltage of the op-amp ''V''<sub>out</sub> is given by the equation\n:<math>V_\\text{out} = A_\\text{OL} (V_+ - V_-),</math>\nwhere ''A''<sub>OL</sub> is the [[Electronic feedback loops|open-loop]] gain of the amplifier (the term \"open-loop\" refers to the absence of a feedback loop from the output to the input).\n\n=== Open-loop amplifier  ===\nThe magnitude of ''A''<sub>OL</sub> is typically very  large (100,000 or more for integrated circuit op-amps), and therefore even a quite small difference between ''V''<sub>+</sub> and ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> drives the amplifier output nearly to the supply voltage. Situations in which the output voltage is equal to or greater than the supply voltage are referred to as ''saturation'' of the amplifier.  The magnitude of ''A''<sub>OL</sub> is not well controlled by the manufacturing process, and so it is impractical to use an open-loop amplifier as a stand-alone [[differential amplifier]].\n\nWithout [[negative feedback amplifier|negative feedback]], and perhaps with [[positive feedback]] for [[Regenerative circuit|regeneration]], an op-amp acts as a [[comparator]]. If the inverting input is held at ground (0&nbsp;V) directly or by a resistor ''R''<sub>g</sub>, and the input voltage ''V''<sub>in</sub> applied to the non-inverting input is positive, the output will be maximum positive; if ''V''<sub>in</sub> is negative, the output will be maximum negative. Since there is no feedback from the output to either input, this is an ''[[Electronic feedback loops|open-loop]]'' circuit acting as a [[comparator]].\n\n=== Closed-loop amplifier ===\n[[Image:Operational amplifier noninverting.svg|thumb|An op-amp with negative feedback (a non-inverting amplifier)]]\nIf predictable operation is desired, negative feedback is used, by applying a portion of the output voltage to the inverting input. The ''closed-loop'' feedback greatly reduces the gain of the circuit.  When negative feedback is used, the circuit's overall gain and response becomes determined mostly by the feedback network, rather than by the op-amp characteristics. If the feedback network is made of components with values small relative to the op amp's input impedance, the value of the op-amp's open-loop response ''A''<sub>OL</sub> does not seriously affect the circuit's performance. The response of the op-amp circuit with its input, output, and feedback circuits to an input is characterized mathematically by a [[transfer function]]; designing an op-amp circuit to have a desired transfer function is in the realm of [[electrical engineering]].  The transfer functions are important in most applications of op-amps, such as in [[analog computers]]. High input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] at the input terminals and low output impedance at the output terminal(s) are particularly useful features of an op-amp.\n\nIn the non-inverting amplifier on the right, the presence of negative feedback via the [[voltage divider]] ''R''<sub>f</sub>, ''R''<sub>g</sub> determines the ''closed-loop gain'' ''A''<sub>CL</sub> = ''V''<sub>out</sub>&nbsp;/&nbsp;''V''<sub>in</sub>. Equilibrium will be established when ''V''<sub>out</sub> is just sufficient to \"reach around and pull\" the inverting input to the same voltage as ''V''<sub>in</sub>. The voltage gain of the entire circuit is thus 1 + ''R''<sub>f</sub>/''R''<sub>g</sub>. As a simple example, if ''V''<sub>in</sub> = 1&nbsp;V and R<sub>f</sub> = ''R''<sub>g</sub>, ''V''<sub>out</sub> will be 2&nbsp;V, exactly the amount required to keep ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> at 1&nbsp;V. Because of the feedback provided by the ''R''<sub>f</sub>, ''R''<sub>g</sub> network, this is a ''closed-loop'' circuit.\n\nAnother way to analyze this circuit proceeds by making the following (usually valid) assumptions:<ref>{{cite book |first=Jacob |last=Millman |title=Microelectronics: Digital and Analog Circuits and Systems |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1979 |isbn=0-07-042327-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/microelectronics00mill_0/page/523 523\u2013527] |url=https://archive.org/details/microelectronics00mill_0/page/523 }}</ref>\n* When an op-amp operates in linear (i.e., not saturated) mode, the difference in voltage between the non-inverting (+) pin and the inverting (\u2212) pin is negligibly small.\n* The input impedance between (+) and (\u2212) pins is much larger than other resistances in the circuit.\n\nThe input signal ''V''<sub>in</sub> appears at both (+) and (\u2212) pins, resulting in a current ''i'' through ''R''<sub>g</sub> equal to ''V''<sub>in</sub>/''R''<sub>g</sub>:\n: <math>i = \\frac{V_\\text{in}}{R_g}.</math>\n\nSince Kirchhoff's current law states that the same current must leave a node as enter it, and since the impedance into the (\u2212) pin is near infinity, we can assume practically all of the same current ''i'' flows through ''R''<sub>f</sub>, creating an output voltage\n: <math>V_\\text{out} = V_\\text{in} + iR_f = V_\\text{in} + \\left(\\frac{V_\\text{in}}{R_g} R_f\\right) = V_\\text{in} + \\frac{V_\\text{in}R_f} {R_g} = V_\\text{in} \\left(1 + \\frac{R_f}{R_g}\\right).</math>\n\nBy combining terms, we determine the closed-loop gain ''A''<sub>CL</sub>:\n: <math>A_\\text{CL} = \\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}} = 1 + \\frac{R_f}{R_g}.</math>\n\n==Op-amp characteristics==\n\n=== Ideal op-amps ===\n[[Image:Op-Amp Internal.svg|thumb|250px|right|An equivalent circuit of an operational amplifier that models some resistive non-ideal parameters.]]\n\nAn ideal op-amp is usually considered to have the following characteristics:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/an/slaa068b/slaa068b.pdf |title=Understanding Basic Analog \u2013 Ideal Op Amps |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227060510/http://www.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/an/slaa068b/slaa068b.pdf |archivedate=2016-12-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://research.cs.tamu.edu/prism/lectures/iss/iss_l5.pdf |title=Lecture 5: The ideal operational amplifier |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123045824/http://research.cs.tamu.edu/prism/lectures/iss/iss_l5.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-23 }}</ref>\n\n* Infinite [[open-loop gain]] G = ''v''<sub>out</sub> / ''v''<sub>in</sub>\n* Infinite [[input impedance]] R<sub>in</sub>, and so zero input current \n* Zero [[input offset voltage]] \n* Infinite output voltage range\n* Infinite [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] with zero [[phase shift]] and infinite [[slew rate]] \n* Zero [[output impedance]] R<sub>out</sub>\n* Zero [[Electronic noise|noise]]\n* Infinite [[common-mode rejection ratio]] (CMRR)\n* Infinite [[power supply rejection ratio]].\n \nThese ideals can be summarized by the two \"golden rules\":{{ordered list\n| list-style-type=upper-roman\n| '''In a closed loop''' the output attempts to do whatever is necessary to make the voltage difference between the inputs zero.\n| The inputs draw no current.<ref name=AoE>\n {{Cite book\n  | last = Horowitz\n  | first = Paul\n  | authorlink =\n  |last2=Hill |first2=Winfield\n  | title = The Art of Electronics\n  | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n  | year = 1989\n  | location = Cambridge, UK\n  | page =\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177#v=onepage&q&f=false\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 0-521-37095-7\n }}</ref>{{rp|177}}\n}}\n\nThe first rule only applies in the usual case where the op-amp is used in a closed-loop design (negative feedback, where there is a signal path of some sort feeding back from the output to the inverting input).  These rules are commonly used as a good first approximation for analyzing or designing op-amp circuits.<ref name=\"AoE\"/>{{rp|177}}\n\nNone of these ideals can be perfectly realized. A real op-amp may be modeled with non-infinite or non-zero parameters using equivalent resistors and capacitors in the op-amp model. The designer can then include these effects into the overall performance of the final circuit. Some parameters may turn out to have negligible effect on the final design while others represent actual limitations of the final performance that must be evaluated.\n\n=== Real op-amps ===\nReal op-amps differ from the ideal model in various aspects.\n\n====DC imperfections====\nReal operational amplifiers suffer from several non-ideal effects:\n\n;Finite gain: [[Open-loop gain]] is infinite in the ideal operational amplifier but finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit open-loop DC gain ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. So long as the [[loop gain]] (i.e., the product of open-loop and feedback gains) is very large, the circuit gain will be determined entirely by the amount of negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of open-loop gain). In cases where [[closed-loop gain]] must be very high, the feedback gain will be very low, and the low feedback gain causes low loop gain; in these cases, the operational amplifier will cease to behave ideally.\n\n;Finite [[input impedance]]s : The ''differential input impedance'' of the operational amplifier is defined as the impedance ''between'' its two inputs; the ''common-mode input impedance'' is the impedance from each input to ground.  [[MOSFET]]-input operational amplifiers often have protection circuits that effectively short circuit any input differences greater than a small threshold, so the input impedance can appear to be very low in some tests. However, as long as these operational amplifiers are used in a typical high-gain negative feedback application, these protection circuits will be inactive.  The input bias and leakage currents described below are a more important design parameter for typical operational amplifier applications.\n\n;Non-zero [[output impedance]]: Low output impedance is important for low-impedance loads; for these loads, the voltage drop across the output impedance effectively reduces the open loop gain. In configurations with a voltage-sensing negative feedback, the output impedance of the amplifier is effectively lowered; thus, in linear applications, op-amp circuits usually exhibit a very low output impedance.\n:Low-impedance outputs typically require high [[quiescent current|quiescent (i.e., idle) current]] in the output stage and will dissipate more power, so low-power designs may purposely sacrifice low output impedance.\n\n;Input current: Due to [[biasing]] requirements or [[Leakage (semiconductors)|leakage]], a small amount of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes, nA, for [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] op-amps, tens of picoamperes, pA, for [[JFET]] input stages, and only a few pA for [[MOSFET]] input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, ''and'' the impedance looking ''out'' of ''both'' inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the ''difference'' between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect.<!-- (unless the operational amplifier has poor [[Common-mode rejection ratio|CMRR]], which is described below). CMRR is usually much better than matching of currents, so not relevant. --> It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small ''offset voltage'' (different from the input offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.\n\n;Input offset [[voltage]]: This voltage, which is what is required across the op-amp's input terminals to drive the output voltage to zero.<ref>{{cite book |first=D. F. |last=Stout |title=Handbook of Operational Amplifier Circuit Design |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1976 |isbn=0-07-061797-X |pages=1\u201311}}</ref><ref group=\"nb\">This definition hews to the convention of measuring op-amp parameters with respect to the zero voltage point in the circuit, which is usually half the total voltage between the amplifier's positive and negative power rails.</ref> In the perfect amplifier, there would be no input offset voltage. However, it exists in actual op-amps because of imperfections in the differential amplifier that constitutes the input stage of the vast majority of these devices. Input offset voltage creates two problems: First, due to the amplifier's high voltage gain, it virtually assures that the amplifier output will go into saturation if it is operated without negative feedback, even when the input terminals are wired together. Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the input offset voltage is amplified along with the signal and this may pose a problem if high precision DC amplification is required or if the input signal is very small.<ref group=\"nb\">Many older designs of operational amplifiers have offset null inputs to allow the offset to be manually adjusted away. Modern precision op-amps can have internal circuits that automatically cancel this offset using [[chopper (electronics)|chopper]]s or other circuits that measure the offset voltage periodically and subtract it from the input voltage.</ref>\n\n;Common-mode gain: A perfect operational amplifier amplifies only the voltage difference between its two inputs, completely rejecting all voltages that are common to both. However, the differential input stage of an operational amplifier is never perfect, leading to the amplification of these common voltages to some degree. The standard measure of this defect is called the [[common-mode rejection ratio]] (denoted CMRR). Minimization of common mode gain is usually important in non-inverting amplifiers (described below) that operate at high amplification.\n\n;Power-supply rejection: The output of a perfect operational amplifier will be completely independent from its power supply. Every real operational amplifier has a finite [[power supply rejection ratio]] (PSRR) that reflects how well the op-amp can reject changes in its supply voltage.\n\n;Temperature effects: All parameters change with temperature. Temperature drift of the input offset voltage is especially important.\n\n;Drift: Real op-amp parameters are subject to slow change over time and with changes in temperature, input conditions, etc.\n\n====AC imperfections====\nThe op-amp gain calculated at DC does not apply at higher frequencies. Thus, for high-speed operation, more sophisticated considerations must be used in an op-amp circuit design.\n\n;Finite [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]: All amplifiers have finite bandwidth. To a first approximation, the op-amp has the frequency response of an [[integrator]] with gain. That is, the gain of a typical op-amp is inversely proportional to frequency and is characterized by its [[gain\u2013bandwidth product]]&nbsp;(GBWP). For example, an op-amp with a GBWP of 1&nbsp;MHz would have a gain of 5 at 200&nbsp;kHz, and a gain of 1 at 1&nbsp;MHz. This dynamic response coupled with the very high DC gain of the op-amp gives it the characteristics of a first-order [[low-pass filter]] with very high DC gain and low cutoff frequency given by the GBWP divided by the DC gain.{{paragraph break}}The finite bandwidth of an op-amp can be the source of several problems, including:{{glossary}}{{term|Stability}}{{defn|Associated with the bandwidth limitation is a phase difference between the input signal and the amplifier output that can lead to [[electronic oscillation|oscillation]] in some feedback circuits. For example, a sinusoidal output signal meant to interfere destructively with an input signal of the same frequency will interfere constructively if delayed by 180 degrees forming [[positive feedback]]. In these cases, the feedback circuit can be [[BIBO stability|stabilized]] by means of [[frequency compensation]], which increases the [[Gain margin|gain or phase margin]] of the open-loop circuit. The circuit designer can implement this compensation externally with a separate circuit component. Alternatively, the compensation can be implemented within the operational amplifier with the addition of a [[Frequency compensation#Dominant-pole compensation|dominant pole]] that sufficiently attenuates the high-frequency gain of the operational amplifier. The location of this pole may be fixed internally by the manufacturer or configured by the circuit designer using methods specific to the op-amp. In general, dominant-pole frequency compensation reduces the bandwidth of the op-amp even further. When the desired closed-loop gain is high, op-amp frequency compensation is often not needed because the requisite open-loop gain is sufficiently low; consequently, applications with high closed-loop gain can make use of op-amps with higher bandwidths.}}{{term|Distortion, and other effects}}{{defn|Limited bandwidth also results in lower amounts of feedback at higher frequencies, producing higher distortion, and output impedance as the frequency increases.}}{{glossary end}}{{paragraph break}}Typical low-cost, general-purpose op-amps exhibit a GBWP of a few megahertz. Specialty and high-speed op-amps exist that can achieve a GBWP of hundreds of megahertz. For very high-frequency circuits, a [[current-feedback operational amplifier]] is often used.\n\n;Noise: Amplifiers generate random voltage at the output even when there is no signal applied. This can be due to thermal noise and flicker noise of the devices. For applications with high gain or high bandwidth, noise becomes a very important consideration.\n\n;Input [[capacitance]]: Most important for high frequency operation because it reduces input impedance and may cause phase shifts.\n\n;Common-mode gain: See DC imperfections, above.\n\n;Power-supply rejection: With increasing frequency the power-supply rejection usually gets worse. So it can be important to keep the supply clean of higher frequency ripples and signals, e.g. by the use of [[bypass capacitor]]s.\n\n====Non-linear imperfections====\n[[File:Inverting Amplifier Signal Clipping.png|thumb|The input (yellow) and output (green) of a saturated op amp in an inverting amplifier]]\n; [[Clipping (signal processing)|Saturation]]:Output voltage is limited to a minimum and maximum value close to the [[power supply]] voltages.<ref group=\"nb\">That the output cannot reach the power supply voltages is usually the result of limitations of the amplifier's output stage transistors. See [[#Output stage|Output stage]].</ref> The output of older op-amps can reach to within one or two volts of the supply rails. The output of newer so-called \"rail to rail\" op-amps can reach to within millivolts of the supply rails when providing low output currents.\n; Slewing: The amplifier's output voltage reaches its maximum rate of change, the [[slew rate]], usually specified in volts per microsecond (V/\u03bcs). When slewing occurs, further increases in the input signal have no effect on the rate of change of the output. Slewing is usually caused by the input stage saturating; the result is a constant current {{mvar|i}} driving a capacitance {{mvar|C}} in the amplifier (especially those capacitances used to implement its [[frequency compensation]]); the slew rate is limited by {{math|d''v''/d''t'' {{=}} ''i''/''C''}}.{{paragraph break}} Slewing is associated with the ''large-signal'' performance of an op-amp.  Consider, for example, an op-amp configured for a gain of 10.  Let the input be a 1{{nbsp}}V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth wave. That is, the amplitude is 1{{nbsp}}V and the period is 10 microseconds. Accordingly, the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the input is 0.1{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  After 10\u00d7 amplification, the output should be a 10{{nbsp}}V,  100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth, with a corresponding slew rate of 1{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  However, the classic 741 op-amp has a 0.5{{nbsp}}V per microsecond slew rate specification, so that its output can rise to no more than 5{{nbsp}}V in the sawtooth's 10 microsecond period. Thus, if one were to measure the output, it would be a 5{{nbsp}}V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth, rather than a 10{{nbsp}}V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth.{{paragraph break}}Next consider the same amplifier and 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth, but now the input amplitude is 100{{nbsp}}mV rather than 1{{nbsp}}V.  After 10\u00d7 amplification the output is a 1{{nbsp}}V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth with a corresponding slew rate of 0.1{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  In this instance, the 741 with its 0.5{{nbsp}}V per microsecond slew rate will amplify the input properly.{{paragraph break}} Modern high speed op-amps can have slew rates in excess of 5,000{{nbsp}}V per microsecond. However, it is more common for op-amps to have slew rates in the range 5\u2013100{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  For example, the general purpose TL081 op-amp has a slew rate of 13{{nbsp}}V per microsecond.  As a general rule, low power and small bandwidth op-amps have low slew rates.  As an example, the LT1494 micropower op-amp consumes 1.5 microamp but has a 2.7&nbsp;kHz gain-bandwidth product and a 0.001{{nbsp}}V per microsecond slew rate.\n\n; Non-[[linear]] input-output relationship: The output voltage may not be accurately proportional to the difference between the input voltages. It is commonly called distortion when the input signal is a waveform. This effect will be very small in a practical circuit where substantial negative feedback is used.\n\n; Phase reversal: In some integrated op-amps, when the published common mode voltage is violated (e.g., by one of the inputs being driven to one of the supply voltages), the output may slew to the opposite polarity from what is expected in normal operation.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-036.pdf\n |title=Op Amp Output Phase-Reversal and Input Over-Voltage Protection\n |year=2009\n |publisher=Analog Devices\n |accessdate=2012-12-27\n}}</ref><ref>\n {{cite web\n |url=http://www.edn.com/contents/images/45890.pdf\n |title=Bootstrapping your op amp yields wide voltage swings\n |last1=King\n |first1=Grayson\n |last2=Watkins\n |first2=Tim\n |date=13 May 1999\n |publisher=Electronic Design News\n |accessdate=2012-12-27\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305231302/http://www.edn.com/contents/images/45890.pdf |archivedate= March 5, 2014 }}</ref>  Under such conditions, negative feedback becomes positive, likely causing the circuit to \"lock up\" in that state.\n\n====Power considerations====\n;Limited [[current limiting|output current]]: The output current must be finite. In practice, most op-amps are designed to limit the output current so as not to exceed a specified level \u2013 around 25&thinsp;mA for a type 741 IC op-amp \u2013 thus protecting the op-amp and associated circuitry from damage. Modern designs are electronically more rugged than earlier implementations and some can sustain direct [[short circuit]]s on their outputs without damage.\n\n;Output sink current: The output sink current is the maximum current allowed to sink into the output stage. Some manufacturers show the output voltage vs. the output sink current plot, which gives an idea of the output voltage when it is sinking current from another source into the output pin.\n;Limited dissipated [[electric power|power]]: The output current flows through the op-amp's internal output impedance, generating heat which must be dissipated.  If the op-amp dissipates too much power, then its temperature will increase above some safe limit. The op-amp may enter thermal shutdown, or it may be destroyed.\nModern integrated [[Field effect transistor|FET]] or [[MOSFET]] op-amps approximate more closely the ideal op-amp than bipolar ICs when it comes to input impedance and input bias currents. Bipolars are generally better when it comes to input ''voltage'' offset, and often have lower noise. Generally, at room temperature, with a fairly large signal, and limited bandwidth, FET and MOSFET op-amps now offer better performance.\n\n== Internal circuitry of 741-type op-amp  ==\n[[Image:OpAmpTransistorLevel Colored Labeled.svg|thumb|right|500px|A component-level diagram of the common 741 op-amp.

The output sink transistor Q20 receives its base drive from the common collectors of Q15 and Q19; the level-shifter Q16 provides base drive for the output source transistor Q14. <!-- Note the similarity between the transistors Q15 and Q7 -- just accidently a similar position in the plan, not a matched pair-->\n\nThe transistor Q22 prevents this stage from delivering excessive current to Q20 and thus limits the output sink current.\n\n==== Output amplifier ====\nThe output stage (Q14, Q20, outlined in [[cyan]]) is a [[Class AB]] complementary-symmetry amplifier. It provides an output drive with impedance of ~50&Omega;, in essence, current gain. \nTransistor Q16 (outlined in [[green]]) provides the quiescent current for the output transistors, and Q17 provides output current limiting. \n<!-- The output stage (outlined in [[cyan]]) is a [[Class AB]] push-pull emitter follower (Q14, Q20) amplifier with the bias set by the ''V''<sub>BE</sub> multiplier voltage source Q16 and its base resistors.

For the typical ''V''<sub>''S''</sub> = \u00b120&nbsp;V, the standing current in Q11/Q12 (as well as in Q13) would be ~1&nbsp;mA. A supply current for a typical 741 of about 2&nbsp;mA agrees with the notion that these two bias currents dominate the quiescent supply current.<!-- per NS LM714 data sheet -->\n\nTransistors Q11 and Q10 form a [[Widlar current mirror]], with quiescent current in Q10 ''i''<sub>10</sub> such that ln(''i''<sub>11</sub> / ''i''<sub>10</sub>) = ''i''<sub>10</sub> \u00d7 5&nbsp;k\u03a9 / 28&nbsp;mV, where 5&nbsp;k\u03a9 represents the emitter resistor of Q10, and 28&nbsp;mV is ''V''<sub>T</sub>, the [[thermal voltage]] at room temperature. In this case ''i''<sub>10</sub> \u2248 20&nbsp;\u03bcA.\n\n==== Differential amplifier ====\nThe biasing circuit of this stage is set by a feedback loop that forces the collector currents of Q10 and Q9 to (nearly) match. The small difference in these currents provides the drive for the common base of Q3/Q4 (note that the base drive for input transistors Q1/Q2 is the input bias current and must be sourced externally). The summed quiescent currents of Q1/Q3 plus Q2/Q4 is mirrored from Q8 into Q9, where it is summed with the collector current in Q10, the result being applied to the bases of Q3/Q4.\n\nThe quiescent currents of  Q1/Q3 (resp., Q2/Q4) ''i''<sub>1</sub> will thus be half of ''i''<sub>10</sub>, of order ~10&nbsp;\u03bcA. Input bias current for the base of Q1 (resp. Q2) will amount to ''i''<sub>1</sub> / \u03b2; typically ~50&nbsp;nA,<!-- per National Semiconductor specification for the LM741--> implying a current gain ''h''<sub>fe</sub> \u2248 200 for Q1(Q2).\n\nThis feedback circuit tends to draw the common base node of Q3/Q4 to a voltage ''V''<sub>com</sub> \u2212 2\u202f''V''<sub>BE</sub>, where ''V''<sub>com</sub> is the input common-mode voltage. At the same time, the magnitude of the quiescent current is relatively insensitive to the characteristics of the components Q1\u2013Q4, such as ''h''<sub>fe</sub>, that would otherwise cause temperature dependence or part-to-part variations.\n\nTransistor Q7 drives Q5 and Q6 into conduction until their (equal) collector currents match that of Q1/Q3 and Q2/Q4. The quiescent current in Q7 is ''V''<sub>BE</sub> / 50&nbsp;k\u03a9, about 35&nbsp;\u03bcA, as is the quiescent current in Q15, with its matching operating point. Thus, the quiescent currents are pairwise matched in Q1/Q2, Q3/Q4, Q5/Q6, and Q7/Q15. \n<!--\nThe classical [[Differential amplifier#Long-tailed pair|emitter-coupled differential stage]] is biased from the side of the emitters by connecting a constant current source to them. The series negative feedback (the emitter degeneration) makes the transistors act as voltage stabilizers; it forces them to adjust their ''V''<sub>BE</sub> voltages so that to pass the current through their collector-emitter junctions. As a result, ''the quiescent current is \u03b2-independent''.\n\nHere, the Q3/Q4 emitters are already used as inputs. Their collectors are separated and cannot be used as inputs for the quiescent current source since they behave as current sources. So, the quiescent current can be set only from the side of the bases by connecting a constant current source to them. To make it not depend on \u03b2 as above, a negative but parallel feedback is used. For this purpose, the total quiescent current is mirrored by Q8-Q9 current mirror and the negative feedback is taken from the Q9 collector. Now it makes the transistors Q1-Q4 adjust their ''V''<sub>BE</sub> voltages so that to pass the desired quiescent current. The effect is the same as at the classical emitter-coupled pair \u2014 ''the quiescent current is \u03b2-independent''. It is interesting fact that \"to the extent that all PNP \u03b2s match, this clever circuit generates just the right \u03b2-dependent base current to produce a \u03b2-independent collector current\".<ref name=\"Lee\" /> The biasing base currents are usually provided only by the negative power supply; they should come from the ground and enter the bases. But to ensure maximum high input impedances, the biasing loops are not internally closed between the base and ground; it is expected they will be closed externally by the input sources. So, the sources have to be galvanic (DC) to ensure paths for the biasing currents and low resistive enough (tens or hundreds kilohms) to not create significant voltage drops across them. Otherwise, additional DC elements should be connected between the bases and the ground (or the positive power supply).\n\nThe quiescent current is set by the 39 k\u03a9 resistor that is common for the two current mirrors Q12-Q13 and Q10-Q11. The current determined by this resistor acts also as a reference for the other bias currents used in the chip. The [[Widlar current mirror]] built by Q10, Q11, and the 5 k\u03a9 resistor produces a very small fraction of ''I''<sub>ref</sub> at the Q10 collector. This small constant current through Q10's collector supplies the base currents for Q3 and Q4 as well as the Q9 collector current. The Q8/Q9 current mirror tries to make Q9 collector current the same as the Q3 and Q4 collector currents and succeeds with the help of the negative feedback. The Q9 collector voltage changes until the ratio between the Q3/Q4 base and collector currents becomes equal to \u03b2. Thus Q3 and Q4's combined base currents (which are of the same order as the overall chip's input currents) are a small fraction of the already small Q10 current.\n\nThus the quiescent current is set by Q10-Q11 current mirror without using a current-sensing negative feedback. The voltage-sensing negative feedback only helps this process by stabilizing Q9 collector (Q3/Q4 base) voltage.<ref group=\"nb\">This arrangement can be generalized by an equivalent circuit consisting of a constant current source loaded by a voltage source; the voltage source fixes the voltage across the current source while the current source sets the current through the voltage source. As the two heterogeneous sources provide ideal load conditions for each other, this circuit solution is widely used in [[cascode|cascode circuits]], [[Wilson current mirror]], the input part of the simple [[current mirror]], emitter-coupled and other exotic circuits.</ref> The feedback loop also isolates the rest of the circuit from [[common-mode signal]]s by making the base voltage of Q3/Q4 follow tightly 2''V''<sub>BE</sub> below the higher of the two input voltages.\n-->\n\n==== Voltage amplifier ====\n\nQuiescent currents in Q16 and Q19 are set by the current mirror Q12/Q13, which is running at ~1&nbsp;mA. Through some{{vague|date=January 2016}} mechanism, the collector current in Q19 tracks that standing current.\n\n==== Output amplifier ====\n\nIn the circuit involving Q16 (variously named [[rubber diode]] or ''V''<sub>BE</sub> multiplier), the 4.5&nbsp;k&Omega; resistor must be conducting about 100&nbsp;\u03bcA, with the Q16 ''V''<sub>BE</sub> roughly 700&nbsp;mV. Then the ''V''<sub>CB</sub> must be about 0.45&nbsp;V and ''V''<sub>CE</sub> at about 1.0&nbsp;V. Because the Q16 collector is driven by a current source and the Q16 emitter drives into the Q19 collector current sink, the Q16 transistor establishes a voltage difference between Q14 base and Q20 base of ~1&nbsp;V, regardless of the common-mode voltage of Q14/Q20 base. The standing current in Q14/Q20 will be a factor [[diode modelling|exp(100&nbsp;mV / ''V''<sub>T</sub>) \u2248 36]] smaller than the 1&nbsp;mA quiescent current in the class A portion of the op amp. This (small) standing current in the output transistors establishes the output stage in class AB operation and reduces the [[crossover distortion]] of this stage. \n<!--\n[[Image:Block Diagram for Feedback.svg|thumb|right|The circuit presented as a negative feedback amplifier with constant input voltage|250px|right]]\nThe green outlined section (based on Q16) is a voltage level shifter named ''rubber diode'', ''transistor Zener'' or ''V''<sub>BE</sub> ''multiplier''. In the circuit as shown, Q16 provides a constant voltage drop across its collector-emitter junction regardless of the current through it (it acts as a voltage stabilizer). This is achieved by introducing a negative feedback between Q16 collector and its base, i.e. by connecting a voltage divider with ratio \u03b2 = 7.5 k\u03a9 / (4.5 k\u03a9 + 7.5 k\u03a9) = 0.625 composed by the two resistors. If the base current to the transistor is assumed to be zero, the negative feedback forces the transistor to increase its collector-emitter voltage up to 1 V until its base-emitter voltage reaches 0.625 V (a typical value for a BJT in the active region). This serves to bias the two output transistors slightly into conduction reducing [[crossover distortion]] (in some discrete component amplifiers, this function is usually achieved with a string of two silicon diodes).\n\nThe circuit can be presented as a negative feedback voltage amplifier with constant input voltage of 0.625 V and a feedback ratio of \u03b2 = 0.625 (a gain of 1/\u03b2 = 1.6). The same circuit but with \u03b2 = 1 is used in the input current-setting part of the classical [[Current mirror#Basic bipolar transistor mirror|BJT current mirror]].\n-->\n\n=== Small-signal differential mode ===\nA small differential input voltage signal gives rise, through multiple stages of current amplification, to a much larger voltage signal on output.\n\n==== Input impedance ====\nThe input stage with Q1 and Q3 is similar to an emitter-coupled pair (long-tailed pair), with Q2 and Q4 adding some degenerating impedance. The input impedance is relatively high because of the small current through Q1-Q4.  A typical 741 op amp has a differential input impedance of about 2 M&Omega;.<!-- per NS LM741 data sheet -->  The common mode input impedance is even higher, as the input stage works at an essentially constant current.\n\n==== Differential amplifier ====\nA differential voltage ''V''<sub>in</sub> at the op-amp inputs (pins 3 and 2, respectively) gives rise to a small differential current in the bases of Q1 and Q2 ''i''<sub>in</sub> \u2248 ''V''<sub>in</sub> / (2''h''<sub>ie</sub>''h''<sub>fe</sub>).  This differential base current causes a change in the differential collector current in each leg by ''i''<sub>in</sub>''h''<sub>fe</sub>. Introducing the transconductance of Q1, ''g''<sub>''m''</sub> = ''h''<sub>fe</sub> / ''h''<sub>ie</sub>, the (small-signal) current at the base of Q15 (the input of the voltage gain stage) is ''V''<sub>in</sub>''g''<sub>''m''</sub> / 2.\n\nThis portion of the op amp cleverly changes a differential signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal at the base of Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3&nbsp;dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and feedthrough of power supply noise. \n<!-- The input voltage sources are connected through two \"diode\" strings, each of them consisting of two connected in series base-emitter junctions (Q1-Q3 and Q2-Q4), to the common point of Q3/Q4 bases. So, if the input voltages change slightly in opposite directions, Q3/Q4 bases stay at relatively constant voltage and the common base current does not change as well; it only vigorously steers between Q3/Q4 bases and makes the common quiescent current distribute between Q3/Q4 collectors in the same proportion.<ref group=\"nb\">If the input differential voltage changes significantly (with more than about a hundred millivolts), the base-emitter junctions of the transistors driven by the lower input voltage (e.g., Q1 and Q3) become backward biased and the total common base current flows through the other (Q2 and Q4) base-emitter junctions. However, the high breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors Q3/Q4 prevents Q1/Q2 base-emitter junctions from damaging when the input difference voltage increases up to 50 V because of the unlimited current that may flow directly through the \"diode bridge\" between the two input sources.</ref> The current mirror inverts Q3 collector current and tries to pass it through Q4. In the middle point between Q4 and Q6, the signal currents (current changes) of Q3 and Q4 are subtracted. In this case (differential input signal), they are equal and opposite. Thus, the difference is twice the individual signal currents (\u0394''I'' \u2212 (\u2212\u0394''I'') = 2\u0394''I'')<! --{{Dubious|date=June 2011}} if signals equal and opposite, their sum would be zero. Must explain the mirror's gain. -- > and the differential to single ended conversion is completed without gain losses. The open circuit signal voltage appearing at this point is given by the product of the subtracted signal currents and the total circuit impedance (the paralleled collector resistances of Q4 and Q6). Since the collectors of Q4 and Q6 appear as high differential resistances to the signal current (Q4 and Q6 behave as current sources), the open circuit voltage gain of this stage is very high.<ref group=\"nb\">This circuit (and geometrical) phenomenon can be illustrated graphically by superimposing the Q4 and Q6 output characteristics (almost parallel horizontal lines) on the same coordinate system. When the input voltages vary slightly in opposite directions, the two curves move slightly toward each other in the vertical direction but the operating (cross) point moves vigorously in the horizontal direction. The ratio between the two movements represents the high amplification.</ref>\n\nMore intuitively, the transistor Q6 can be considered as a duplicate of Q3 and the combination of Q4 and Q6 can be thought as of a varying voltage divider composed of two voltage-controlled resistors. For differential input signals, they vigorously change their instant resistances in opposite directions but the total resistance stays constant (like a potentiometer with quickly moving slider). As a result, the current stays constant as well but the voltage at the middle point changes vigorously. As the two resistance changes are equal and opposite, the effective voltage change is twice the individual change. -->\n\n==== Voltage amplifier ====\nA current signal ''i'' at Q15's base gives rise to a current in Q19 of order ''i''\u03b2<sup>2</sup> (the product of the ''h''<sub>fe</sub> of each of Q15 and Q19, which are connected in a [[Darlington pair]]). This current signal develops a voltage at the bases of output transistors Q14/Q20 proportional to the ''h''<sub>ie</sub> of the respective transistor.\n\n==== Output amplifier ====\nOutput transistors Q14 and Q20 are each configured as an emitter follower, so no voltage gain occurs there; instead, this stage provides current gain, equal to the ''h''<sub>fe</sub> of Q14 (resp. Q20).\n\nThe output impedance is not zero, as it would be in an ideal op-amp, but with negative feedback it approaches zero at low frequencies.\n\n==== Overall open-loop voltage gain ====\nThe net open-loop small-signal voltage gain of the op amp involves the product of the current gain ''h''<sub>fe</sub> of some 4 transistors. In practice, the voltage gain for a typical 741-style op amp is of order 200,000,<!-- per NS LM741 data sheet --> and the current gain, the ratio of input impedance (~2\u22126 M&Omega;) to output impedance (~50{{nbsp}}&Omega;) provides yet more (power) gain.\n\n=== Other linear characteristics ===\n\n==== Small-signal common mode gain ====\nThe ideal op amp has infinite [[common-mode rejection ratio]], or zero common-mode gain.\n\nIn the present circuit, if the input voltages change in the same direction, the negative feedback makes Q3/Q4 base voltage follow (with 2''V''<sub>BE</sub> below) the input voltage variations. Now the output part (Q10) of Q10-Q11 current mirror keeps up the common current through Q9/Q8 constant in spite of varying voltage. Q3/Q4 collector currents, and accordingly the output current at the base of Q15, remain unchanged.\n\nIn the typical 741 op amp, the common-mode rejection ratio is 90&nbsp;dB,<!-- per NS LM741 data sheet --> implying an open-loop common-mode voltage gain of about 6.<!-- 200,000 / 10^^(4.5) -->\n\n==== Frequency compensation ====\nThe innovation of the Fairchild \u03bcA741 was the introduction of [[frequency compensation]] via an on-chip (monolithic) capacitor, simplifying application of the op amp by eliminating the need for external components for this function. \nThe 30 pF capacitor stabilizes the amplifier via [[Miller effect|Miller compensation]] and functions in a manner similar to an op-amp [[integrator]] circuit. Also known as 'dominant [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] compensation' because it introduces a pole that masks (dominates) the effects of other poles into the open loop frequency response; in a 741 op amp this pole can be as low as 10&nbsp;Hz (where it causes a \u22123&nbsp;dB loss of open loop voltage gain).\n\nThis internal compensation is provided to achieve unconditional [[BIBO stability|stability]] of the amplifier in negative feedback configurations where the feedback network is non-reactive and the [[Electronic feedback loops|closed loop]] gain is [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] or higher. \nBy contrast, amplifiers requiring external compensation, such as the \u03bcA748, may require external compensation or closed-loop gains significantly higher than unity.\n\n==== Input offset voltage ====\nThe \"offset null\" pins may be used to place external resistors (typically in the form of the two ends of a potentiometer, with the slider connected to ''V''<sub>''S''\u2013</sub>) in parallel with the emitter resistors of Q5 and Q6, to adjust the balance of the Q5/Q6 current mirror. The potentiometer is adjusted such that the output is null (midrange) when the inputs are shorted together.\n\n=== Non-linear characteristics ===\n\n==== Input breakdown voltage ====\nThe transistors Q3, Q4 help to increase the reverse ''V''<sub>BE</sub> rating: the base-emitter junctions of the NPN transistors Q1 and Q2 break down at around 7{{nbsp}}V, but the PNP transistors Q3 and Q4 have ''V''<sub>BE</sub> breakdown voltages around 50{{nbsp}}V.<ref>[http://ecow.engr.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/get/ece/342/schowalter/notes/chapter10/theua741operationalamplifier.ppt The \u03bcA741 Operational Amplifier] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==== Output-stage voltage swing and current limiting ====\nVariations in the quiescent current with temperature, or between parts with the same type number, are common, so [[crossover distortion]] and [[quiescent current]] may be subject to significant variation.\n\nThe output range of the amplifier is about one volt less than the supply voltage, owing in part to ''V''<sub>BE</sub> of the output transistors Q14 and Q20.\n\nThe 25 \u03a9 resistor at the Q14 emitter, along with Q17, acts to limit Q14 current to about 25 mA; otherwise, Q17 conducts no current.\n\nCurrent limiting for Q20 is performed in the voltage gain stage: Q22 senses the voltage across Q19's emitter resistor (50{{nbsp}}&Omega;); as it turns on, it diminishes the drive current to Q15 base.\n\nLater versions of this amplifier schematic may show a somewhat different method of output current limiting.\n\n===Applicability considerations===\nWhile the 741 was historically used in audio and other sensitive equipment, such use is now rare because of the improved [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] performance of more modern op-amps. Apart from generating noticeable hiss, 741s and other older op-amps may have poor [[common-mode rejection ratio]]s and so will often introduce cable-borne mains hum and other common-mode interference, such as switch 'clicks', into sensitive equipment.\n\nThe \"741\" has come to often mean a generic op-amp IC (such as \u03bcA741, LM301, 558, LM324, TBA221 \u2014 or a more modern replacement such as the TL071).  The description of the 741 output stage is qualitatively similar for many other designs (that may have quite different input stages), except:\n* Some devices (\u03bcA748, LM301, LM308) are not internally compensated (require an external capacitor from output to some point within the operational amplifier, if used in low closed-loop gain applications).\n* Some modern devices have \"rail-to-rail output\" capability, meaning that the output can range from within a few millivolts of the positive supply voltage to within a few millivolts of the negative supply voltage.\n\n== Classification ==\nOp-amps may be classified by their construction:\n* discrete (built from individual [[transistor]]s or [[vacuum tube|tubes/valves]])\n* IC (fabricated in an [[Integrated circuit]]) \u2014 most common\n* hybrid\nIC op-amps may be classified in many ways, including:\n* Military, Industrial, or Commercial grade (for example: the LM301 is the commercial grade version of the LM101, the LM201 is the industrial version). This may define [[operating temperature]] ranges and other environmental or quality factors.\n* Classification by package type may also affect environmental hardiness, as well as manufacturing options; [[Dual in-line package|DIP]], and other through-hole packages are tending to be replaced by [[Surface-mount technology|surface-mount devices]].\n* Classification by internal compensation: op-amps may suffer from high frequency [[Nyquist stability criterion|instability]] in some [[negative feedback]] circuits unless a small compensation capacitor modifies the phase and frequency responses. Op-amps with a built-in capacitor are termed \"''compensated''\", and allow circuits above some specified [[Electronic feedback loops|closed-loop]] gain to operate stably with no external capacitor.  In particular, op-amps that are stable even with a closed loop gain of 1 are called \"unity gain compensated\".\n* Single, dual and quad versions of many commercial op-amp IC are available, meaning 1, 2 or 4 operational amplifiers are included in the same package.\n* Rail-to-rail input (and/or output) op-amps can work with input (and/or output) signals very close to the power supply rails.\n* [[CMOS]] op-amps (such as the CA3140E) provide extremely high input resistances, higher than [[JFET]]-input op-amps, which are normally higher than [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]]-input op-amps.\n* other varieties of op-amp include programmable op-amps (simply meaning the quiescent current, bandwidth and so on can be adjusted by an external resistor).\n* manufacturers often tabulate their op-amps according to purpose, such as low-noise pre-amplifiers, wide bandwidth amplifiers, and so on.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[Image:Generic 741 pinout top.png|thumb|[[Dual in-line package|DIP]] [[pinout]] for 741-type operational amplifier]]\n\n{{Main|Operational amplifier applications}}\n\n=== Use in electronics system design ===\nThe use of op-amps as circuit blocks is much easier and clearer than specifying all their individual circuit elements (transistors, resistors, etc.), whether the amplifiers used are integrated or discrete circuits. In the first approximation op-amps can be used as if they were ideal differential gain blocks; at a later stage limits can be placed on the acceptable range of parameters for each op-amp.\n\nCircuit design follows the same lines for all electronic circuits. A specification is drawn up governing what the circuit is required to do, with allowable limits. For example, the gain may be required to be 100 times, with a tolerance of 5% but drift of less than 1% in a specified temperature range; the input impedance not less than one megohm; etc.\n\nA basic [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] is designed, often with the help of circuit modeling (on a computer). Specific commercially available op-amps and other components are then chosen that meet the design criteria within the specified tolerances at acceptable cost. If not all criteria can be met, the specification may need to be modified.\n\nA prototype is then built and tested; changes to meet or improve the specification, alter functionality, or reduce the cost, may be made.\n\n=== Applications without using any feedback ===\nThat is, the op-amp is being used as a [[voltage comparator]]. Note that a device designed primarily as a comparator may be better if, for instance, speed is important or a wide range of input voltages may be found, since such devices can quickly recover from full on or full off (\"saturated\") states.\n\nA ''voltage level detector'' can be obtained if a reference voltage ''V''<sub>ref</sub> is applied to one of the op-amp's inputs. This means that the op-amp is set up as a comparator to detect a positive voltage. If the voltage to be sensed, ''E''<sub>i</sub>, is applied to op amp's (+) input, the result is a noninverting positive-level detector: when ''E''<sub>i</sub> is above ''V''<sub>ref</sub>, ''V''<sub>O</sub> equals +''V''<sub>sat</sub>; when ''E''<sub>i</sub> is below ''V''<sub>ref</sub>, ''V''<sub>O</sub> equals \u2212''V''<sub>sat</sub>. If ''E''<sub>i</sub> is applied to the inverting input, the circuit is an inverting positive-level detector: When ''E''<sub>i</sub> is above ''V''<sub>ref</sub>, ''V''<sub>O</sub> equals \u2212''V''<sub>sat</sub>.\n\nA ''zero voltage level detector'' (''E''<sub>i</sub> = 0) can convert, for example, the output of a sine-wave from a function generator into a variable-frequency square wave. If ''E''<sub>i</sub> is a sine wave, triangular wave, or wave of any other shape that is symmetrical around zero, the zero-crossing detector's output will be square.  Zero-crossing detection may also be useful in triggering [[TRIAC]]s at the best time to reduce mains interference and current spikes.\n\n===Positive-feedback applications===\n\n[[Image:Op-Amp Schmitt Trigger.svg|right|thumb|300px|Schmitt trigger implemented by a non-inverting comparator]]\n\nAnother typical configuration of op-amps is with positive feedback, which takes a fraction of the output signal back to the non-inverting input. An important application of it is the comparator with hysteresis, the [[Schmitt trigger]].  Some circuits may use ''positive'' feedback and ''negative'' feedback around the same amplifier, for example [[triangle wave|triangle-wave]] [[oscillator]]s and [[active filters]].\n\nBecause of the wide slew range and lack of positive feedback, the response of all the open-loop level detectors described [[#Applications without using any feedback|above]] will be relatively slow. External overall positive feedback may be applied, but (unlike internal positive feedback that may be applied within the latter stages of a purpose-designed comparator) this markedly affects the accuracy of the zero-crossing detection point. Using a general-purpose op-amp, for example, the frequency of ''E''<sub>i</sub> for the sine to square wave converter should probably be below 100&nbsp;Hz.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Negative-feedback applications===\n\n==== Non-inverting amplifier ====\n[[Image:Op-Amp Non-Inverting Amplifier.svg|frame|An op-amp connected in the non-inverting amplifier configuration]]\nIn a non-inverting amplifier, the output voltage changes in the same direction as the input voltage.\n\nThe gain equation for the op-amp is\n:<math>V_\\text{out} = A_\\text{OL} (V_+ - V_-).</math>\n\nHowever, in this circuit ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> is a function of ''V''<sub>out</sub> because of the negative feedback through the ''R''<sub>1</sub> ''R''<sub>2</sub> network.  ''R''<sub>1</sub> and ''R''<sub>2</sub> form a [[voltage divider]], and as ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> is a high-impedance input, it does not load it appreciably.  Consequently\n:<math>V_- = \\beta V_\\text{out},</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\beta = \\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}.</math>\n\nSubstituting this into the gain equation, we obtain\n:<math>V_\\text{out} = A_\\text{OL} (V_\\text{in} - \\beta V_\\text{out}).</math>\n\nSolving for <math>V_\\text{out}</math>:\n:<math>V_\\text{out} = V_\\text{in} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta + \\frac{1}{A_\\text{OL}}} \\right).</math>\n\nIf <math>A_\\text{OL}</math> is very large, this simplifies to\n:<math>\n  V_\\text{out} \\approx \\frac{V_\\text{in}}{\\beta}\n                     = \\frac{V_\\text{in}}{\\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}}\n                     = V_\\text{in} \\left(1 + \\frac{R_2}{R_1}\\right).\n</math>\n\nThe non-inverting input of the operational amplifier needs a path for DC to ground; if the signal source does not supply a DC path, or if that source requires a given load impedance, then the circuit will require another resistor from the non-inverting input to ground. When the operational amplifier's input bias currents are significant, then the DC source resistances driving the inputs should be balanced.<ref>An input bias current of 1&nbsp;&micro;A through a DC source resistance of 10&nbsp;k&Omega; produces a 10&nbsp;mV offset voltage. If the other input bias current is the same and sees the same source resistance, then the two input offset voltages will cancel out.  Balancing the DC source resistances may not be necessary if the input bias current and source resistance product is small.</ref>  The ideal value for the feedback resistors (to give minimal offset voltage) will be such that the two resistances in parallel roughly equal the resistance to ground at the non-inverting input pin.  That ideal value assumes the bias currents are well matched, which may not be true for all op-amps.<ref>{{cite web |author=Analog Devices |title=Op Amp Input Bias Current |date=2009 |id=Tutorial MT-038 |publisher=Analog Devices |url=http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-038.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==== Inverting amplifier ====\n[[Image:Op-Amp Inverting Amplifier.svg|frame|right|An op-amp connected in the inverting amplifier configuration]]\n\nIn an inverting amplifier, the output voltage changes in an opposite direction to the input voltage.\n\nAs with the non-inverting amplifier, we start with the gain equation of the op-amp:\n\n:<math>V_\\text{out} = A_\\text{OL} (V_+ - V_-).</math>\n\nThis time, ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> is a function of both ''V''<sub>out</sub> and ''V''<sub>in</sub> due to the voltage divider formed by ''R''<sub>f</sub> and ''R''<sub>in</sub>.  Again, the op-amp input does not apply an appreciable load, so\n\n:<math>V_- = \\frac{1}{R_\\text{f} + R_\\text{in}} \\left( R_\\text{f} V_\\text{in} + R_\\text{in} V_\\text{out} \\right).</math>\n\nSubstituting this into the gain equation and solving for <math>V_\\text{out}</math>:\n\n:<math>V_\\text{out} = - V_\\text{in} \\frac{A_\\text{OL} R_\\text{f}}{R_\\text{f} + R_\\text{in} + A_\\text{OL} R_\\text{in}}.</math>\n\nIf <math>A_\\text{OL}</math> is very large, this simplifies to\n\n:<math>\nV_\\text{out} \\approx -V_\\text{in} \\frac{R_\\text{f}}{R_\\text{in}}.\n</math>\n\nA resistor is often inserted between the non-inverting input and ground (so both inputs \"see\" similar resistances), reducing the [[input offset voltage]] due to different voltage drops due to [[bias current]], and may reduce distortion in some op-amps.\n\nA [[Capacitive coupling|DC-blocking]] [[capacitor]] may be inserted in series with the input resistor when a [[frequency response]] down to DC is not needed and any DC voltage on the input is unwanted. That is, the capacitive component of the input impedance inserts a DC [[complex zero|zero]] and a low-frequency [[complex pole|pole]] that gives the circuit a [[bandpass]] or [[high-pass]] characteristic.\n\nThe potentials at the operational amplifier inputs remain virtually constant (near ground) in the inverting configuration.  The constant operating potential typically results in  distortion levels that are lower than those attainable with the non-inverting topology.\n\n===Other applications===\n\n* audio- and video-frequency [[preamplifier|pre-amplifiers]] and [[Buffer amplifier|buffer]]s\n* [[differential amplifier]]s\n* [[differentiator]]s and [[integrator]]s\n* [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]]s\n* [[precision rectifier]]s\n* precision [[peak detector]]s\n* voltage and current [[Voltage regulator|regulators]]\n* analog calculators\n* [[analog to digital converter|analog-to-digital converters]]\n* [[Digital to analog converter|digital-to-analog converters]]\n* [[Clamper (electronics)|Voltage clamping]]\n* [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s and [[waveform generator]]s\n* clipper\n* clamper(dc inserter or restorer)\n* LOG and ANTILOG amplifiers\n\nMost single, dual and quad op-amps available have a standardized pin-out which permits one type to be substituted for another without wiring changes. A specific op-amp may be chosen for its open loop gain, bandwidth, noise performance, input impedance, power consumption, or a compromise between any of these factors.\n\n==Historical timeline==\n'''1941: A vacuum tube op-amp.''' An op-amp, defined as a general-purpose, DC-coupled, high gain, inverting feedback [[amplifier]], is first found in {{US patent|2,401,779}} \"Summing Amplifier\" filed by [[Karl D. Swartzel Jr.]] of Bell Labs in 1941. This design used three [[vacuum tube]]s to achieve a gain of {{nowrap|90 dB}} and operated on voltage rails of {{nowrap|\u00b1350 V}}. It had a single inverting input rather than differential inverting and non-inverting inputs, as are common in today's op-amps. Throughout [[World War II]], Swartzel's design proved its value by being liberally used in the M9 [[Director (military)|artillery director]] designed at Bell Labs. This artillery director worked with the SCR584 [[radar]] system to achieve extraordinary hit rates (near 90%) that would not have been possible otherwise.<ref name=\"Jung-2004\">{{cite book |title=Op Amp Applications Handbook |page=777 |chapter=Chapter 8: Op Amp History |first=Walter G. |last=Jung |publisher=Newnes |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7506-7844-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dunqt1rt4sAC |accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:K2-w Vacuum Tube Op-amp.jpg|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's K2-W: a vacuum-tube op-amp (1953)]]\n\n'''1947: An op-amp with an explicit non-inverting input.''' In 1947, the operational amplifier was first formally defined and named in a paper<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ragazzini |first1=John R. |author1-link=John R.

Ragazzini]] of Columbia University. In this same paper a footnote mentioned an op-amp design by a student that would turn out to be quite significant. This op-amp, designed by [[Loebe Julie]], was superior in a variety of ways. It had two major innovations. Its input stage used a long-tailed [[triode]] pair with loads matched to reduce drift in the output and, far more importantly, it was the first op-amp design to have two inputs (one inverting, the other non-inverting). The differential input made a whole range of new functionality possible, but it would not be used for a long time due to the rise of the chopper-stabilized amplifier.<ref name=\"Jung-2004\"/>\n\n'''1949: A chopper-stabilized op-amp.''' In 1949, Edwin A. Goldberg designed a [[Chopper (electronics)|chopper]]-stabilized op-amp.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/39-05/Web_ChH_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007072916/http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/39-05/Web_ChH_final.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-07 }}</ref> This set-up uses a normal op-amp with an additional [[Alternating current|AC]] amplifier that goes alongside the op-amp. The chopper gets an AC signal from [[Direct current|DC]] by switching between the DC voltage and ground at a fast rate (60&nbsp;Hz or 400&nbsp;Hz). This signal is then amplified, rectified, filtered and fed into the op-amp's non-inverting input. This vastly improved the gain of the op-amp while significantly reducing the output drift and DC offset. Unfortunately, any design that used a chopper couldn't use their non-inverting input for any other purpose. Nevertheless, the much improved characteristics of the chopper-stabilized op-amp made it the dominant way to use op-amps. Techniques that used the non-inverting input regularly would not be very popular until the 1960s when op-amp [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s started to show up in the field.\n\n'''1953: A commercially available op-amp.''' In 1953, vacuum tube op-amps became commercially available with the release of the model K2-W from [[George A. Philbrick]] Researches, Incorporated.  The designation on the devices shown, GAP/R, is an acronym for the complete company name. Two nine-pin [[12AX7]] vacuum tubes were mounted in an octal package and had a model K2-P chopper add-on available that would effectively \"use up\" the non-inverting input. This op-amp was based on a descendant of Loebe Julie's 1947 design and, along with its successors, would start the widespread use of op-amps in industry.\n\n[[Image:Discrete opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's model P45: a solid-state, discrete op-amp (1961).]]\n\n'''1961: A discrete IC op-amp.''' With the birth of the [[transistor]] in 1947, and the silicon transistor in 1954, the concept of ICs became a reality. The introduction of the [[planar process]] in 1959 made transistors and ICs stable enough to be commercially useful. By 1961, solid-state, discrete op-amps were being produced. These op-amps were effectively small circuit boards with packages such as [[edge connector]]s. They usually had hand-selected resistors in order to improve things such as voltage offset and drift. The P45 (1961) had a gain of 94&nbsp;dB and ran on \u00b115&nbsp;V rails. It was intended to deal with signals in the range of {{nowrap|\u00b110 V}}.\n\n'''1961: A varactor bridge op-amp.''' There have been many different directions taken in op-amp design. [[Varactor]] bridge op-amps started to be produced in the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philbrickarchive.org/ |title=The Philbrick Archive |website=www.philbrickarchive.org |accessdate=28 April 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120907192216/http://www.philbrickarchive.org/ |archivedate=7 September 2012 }}</ref><ref>June 1961 advertisement for Philbrick P2, {{cite web |url=http://www.philbrickarchive.org/p2%20and%206033%20ad%20rsi%20vol32%20no6%20june1961.pdf |title=The all-new, all solid-state Philbrick P2 amplifier |accessdate=2011-05-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008160503/http://www.philbrickarchive.org/p2%20and%206033%20ad%20rsi%20vol32%20no6%20june1961.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-08 }}</ref> They were designed to have extremely small input current and are still amongst the best op-amps available in terms of common-mode rejection with the ability to correctly deal with hundreds of volts at their inputs.\n\n[[Image:Modular opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's model PP65: a solid-state op-amp in a potted module (1962)]]\n\n'''1962: An op-amp in a potted module.''' By 1962, several companies were producing modular potted packages that could be plugged into [[printed circuit board]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These packages were crucially important as they made the operational amplifier into a single [[black box]] which could be easily treated as a component in a larger circuit.\n\n'''1963: A monolithic IC op-amp.''' In 1963, the first monolithic IC op-amp, the \u03bcA702 designed by [[Bob Widlar]] at Fairchild Semiconductor, was released. Monolithic [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s consist of a single chip as opposed to a chip and discrete parts (a discrete IC) or multiple chips bonded and connected on a circuit board (a hybrid IC). Almost all modern op-amps are monolithic ICs; however, this first IC did not meet with much success. Issues such as an uneven supply voltage, low gain and a small dynamic range held off the dominance of monolithic op-amps until 1965 when the \u03bcA709<ref>{{cite book |first=A. P. |last=Malvino |title=Electronic Principles |edition=2nd |date=1979 |isbn=0-07-039867-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/electronicprinci00malv/page/476 476] |url=https://archive.org/details/electronicprinci00malv/page/476 }}</ref> (also designed by Bob Widlar) was released.\n\n'''1968: Release of the \u03bcA741.''' The popularity of monolithic op-amps was further improved upon the release of the LM101 in 1967, which solved a variety of issues, and the subsequent release of the \u03bcA741 in 1968. The \u03bcA741 was extremely similar to the LM101 except that Fairchild's facilities allowed them to include a 30&nbsp;pF compensation capacitor inside the chip instead of requiring external compensation. This simple difference has made the 741 ''the'' canonical op-amp and many modern amps base their pinout on the 741s. The \u03bcA741 is still in production, and has become ubiquitous in electronics\u2014many manufacturers produce a version of this classic chip, recognizable by part numbers containing ''741''. The same part is manufactured by several companies.\n\n'''1970: First high-speed, low-input current FET design.'''\nIn the 1970s high speed, low-input current designs started to be made by using [[Field-effect transistor|FET]]s. These would be largely replaced by op-amps made with [[MOSFET]]s in the 1980s. \n[[Image:Hybrid opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|ADI's HOS-050: a high speed hybrid IC op-amp (1979)]]\n\n'''1972: Single sided supply op-amps being produced.''' A single sided supply op-amp is one where the input and output voltages can be as low as the negative power supply voltage instead of needing to be at least two volts above it.  The result is that it can operate in many applications with the negative supply pin on the op-amp being connected to the signal ground, thus eliminating the need for a separate negative power supply.\n\nThe LM324 (released in 1972) was one such op-amp that came in a quad package (four separate op-amps in one package) and became an industry standard. In addition to packaging multiple op-amps in a single package, the 1970s also saw the birth of op-amps in hybrid packages. These op-amps were generally improved versions of existing monolithic op-amps. As the properties of monolithic op-amps improved, the more complex hybrid ICs were quickly relegated to systems that are required to have extremely long service lives or other specialty systems.\n\n[[Image:LM741CN.jpg|right|thumb|120px|An op-amp in a mini DIP package]]\n\n'''Recent trends.''' Recently supply voltages in analog circuits have decreased (as they have in digital logic) and low-voltage op-amps have been introduced reflecting this.  Supplies of 5&nbsp;V and increasingly 3.3&nbsp;V (sometimes as low as 1.8&nbsp;V) are common.  To maximize the signal range modern op-amps commonly have rail-to-rail output (the output signal can range from the lowest supply voltage to the highest) and sometimes rail-to-rail inputs. Recent \"boomer\" amplifiers such as the LM4871 and 8002 also have a shutdown feature, an internal power supply for biasing, and a bypass pin to connect a bypass capacitor for that power supply.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Active filter]]\n* [[Analog computer]]\n* [[Bob Widlar]]\n* [[Current conveyor]]\n* [[Current-feedback operational amplifier]]\n* [[Differential amplifier]]\n* [[George A.
