Is not the reader a little astonished at the proposal of an American representation from that quarter [of Grenville's]? It is proposed merely as a project of speculative improvement; not from the necessity in the case, not to add any thing to the authority of parliament: but that we may afford a greater attention to the concerns of the Americans, and give them a better opportunity of stating their grievances, and of obtaining redress. I am glad to find the author has at length discovered that we have not given a sufficient attention to their concerns, or a proper redress to their grievances. His great friend [Grenville] would once have been exceedingly displeased with any person, who should tell him, that he did not attend sufficiently to those concerns. He thought he did so, when he regulated the colonies over and over again: he thought he did so, when he formed two general systems of revenue; one of port-duties, and the other of internal taxation. These systems supposed, or ought to suppose, the greatest attention to, and the most detailed information of, all their affairs. However, by contending for the American representation, he seems at last driven virtually to admit, that great caution ought to be used in the exercise of all our legislative rights over an object so remote from our eye, and so little connected with our immediate feelings; that in prudence we ought not to be quite so ready with our taxes, until we can secure the desired representation in parliament. Perhaps it may be some time before this hopeful scheme can be brought to perfect maturity; although the author seems to be no wise aware of any obstructions that lie in the way of it.<ref name=\"quod.lib.umich.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004899151.0001.000?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=american+representatives |title=The political tracts and speeches: of Edmund Burke, Esq.

But, Sir, your ancestors thought this sort of virtual representation, however ample, to be totally insufficient for the freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are so near, and comparatively so inconsiderable. How, then, can I think it sufficient for those which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote?  You will now, Sir, perhaps imagine that I am on the point of proposing to you a scheme for a representation of the colonies in Parliament. Perhaps I might be inclined to entertain some such thought; but a great flood stops me in my course. Opposuit Natura. I cannot remove the eternal barriers of the creation. The thing, in that mode, I do not know to be possible. As I meddle with no theory, I do not absolutely assert the impracticability of such a representation; but I do not see my way to it; and those who have been more confident have not been more successful ... My resolutions, therefore, mean to establish the equity and justice of a taxation of America by grant, and not by imposition; to mark the legal competency of the colony assemblies for the support of their government in peace, and for public aids in time of war; to acknowledge that this legal competency has had a dutiful and beneficial exercise, and that experience has shown the benefit of their grants, and the futility of Parliamentary taxation, as a method of supply.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm#AMERICAN_TAXATION |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Burke's Writings and Speeches, Volume the Second, by Edmund Burke |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Burke apparently qualified such remarks concerning America by stating in the same speech that: <blockquote>The Parliament of Great Britain ... is never to intrude into the place of the [provincial legislatures], whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution. But in order to enable [Parliamentary] ... superintendence, her powers must be boundless. The gentlemen who think the powers of Parliament limited may please themselves to talk of requisitions. But suppose the requisitions are not obeyed? What! shall there be no reserved power in the empire, to supply a deficiency which may weaken, divide, and dissipate the whole? We are engaged in war,\u2014the Secretary of State calls upon the colonies to contribute,\u2014some would do it, I think most would cheerfully furnish whatever is demanded,\u2014one or two, suppose, hang back, and, easing themselves, let the stress of the draft lie on the others,\u2014surely it is proper that some authority might legally say, 'Tax yourselves for the common Supply, or Parliament will do it for you.' This backwardness was, as I am told, actually the case of Pennsylvania for some short time towards the beginning of the last war, owing to some internal dissensions in that colony. But whether the fact were so or otherwise, the case is equally to be provided for by a competent sovereign power. But then this ought to be no ordinary power, nor ever used in the first instance. This is what I meant, when I have said, at various times, that I consider the power of taxing in Parliament as an instrument of empire, and not as a means of supply.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== William Pitt the Elder ====\nThe views of Knox, Grenville and Burke did not go unchallenged: [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] was amongst those who disputed that a Parliamentary right or power existed to levy \"internal\" taxes \"for the purposes of raising a revenue\" without the consent of actual representatives of the \"Commons of America\".<ref name=\"bartleby.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/3/23.html |title=II.

But if it was thought hard that charter privileges should be taken away by act of parliament, is it not much harder to be in part, or in whole, disfranchised of rights, that have been always thought inherent to a British subject, namely, to be free from all taxes, but what he consents to in person, or by his representative? This right, if it could be traced no higher than Magna Charta, is part of the common law, part of a British subjects birthright, and as inherent and perpetual, as the duty of allegiance; both which have been brought to these colonies, and have been hitherto held sacred and inviolable, and I hope and trust ever will.

I shall not consider the Declaratory Bill now lying on your table; for to what purpose, but loss of time, to consider the particulars of a Bill, the very existence of which is illegal, absolutely illegal, contrary to the fundamental laws of nature, contrary to the fundamental laws of this constitution? A constitution grounded on the eternal and immutable laws of nature; a constitution whose foundation and centre is liberty, which sends liberty to every individual who may happen to be within any part of its ample circumference. Nor, my Lords, is the doctrine new, it is as old as the constitution; it grew up with it; indeed it is its support; taxation and representation are inseparably united; God hath joined them, no British parliament can separate them; to endeavour to do it, is to stab our very vitals. ... My position is this\u2014I repeat it\u2014I will maintain it to my last hour,\u2014taxation and representation are inseparable; this position is founded on the laws of nature; it is more, it is itself an eternal law of nature; for whatever is a man's own, is absolutely his own; no man has a right to take it from him without his consent, either expressed by himself or representative; whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury; whoever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down and destroys the distinction between liberty and slavery. Taxation and representation are coeval with and essential to the constitution. ... [T]here is not a blade of grass growing in the most obscure corner of this kingdom, which is not, which was not ever, represented since the constitution began; there is not a blade of grass, which when taxed, was not taxed by the consent of the proprietor. ... I can never give my assent to any bill for taxing the American colonies, while they remain unrepresented; for as to the distinction of a virtual representation, it is so absurd as not to deserve an answer; I therefore pass it over with contempt. The forefathers of the Americans did not leave their native country, and subject themselves to every danger and distress, to be reduced to a state of slavery: they did not give up their rights; they looked for protection, and not for chains, from their mother country; by her they expected to be defended in the possession of their property, and not to be deprived of it: for, should the present power continue, there is nothing which they can call their own; or, to use the words of Mr. Locke, 'What property have they in that, which another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to himself?'\"<ref>16 Parliamentary History of England, London: Hansard, 1813, pp. 177-81.</ref></blockquote>In an appearance before Parliament in January 1766, former Prime Minister [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] stated:\n<blockquote>The idea of a virtual representation of America in this House is the most contemptible that ever entered into the head of a man.

Soon after she began this movement, the Worcester city tax collector sued Wall for refusing to pay taxes, and the case reached the [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]] in 1863. In \"Wheeler v. Wall,\" the court ruled against Wall and held that despite not having the right to vote, women are still obligated to meet their tax burden. Even still, Wall refused to cooperate with the collector, and as a result, officers seized and sold her property in order to raise the money necessary to meet her tax obligation. After several years, Wall's inexorability eventually prevailed, as the collector began to ignore Wall and allow her to abstain from paying taxes.<ref name=UMKC>{{cite web|title=Address of Susan B.

Is not the reader a little astonished at the proposal of an American representation from that quarter [of Grenville's]? It is proposed merely as a project of speculative improvement; not from the necessity in the case, not to add any thing to the authority of parliament: but that we may afford a greater attention to the concerns of the Americans, and give them a better opportunity of stating their grievances, and of obtaining redress. I am glad to find the author has at length discovered that we have not given a sufficient attention to their concerns, or a proper redress to their grievances. His great friend [Grenville] would once have been exceedingly displeased with any person, who should tell him, that he did not attend sufficiently to those concerns. He thought he did so, when he regulated the colonies over and over again: he thought he did so, when he formed two general systems of revenue; one of port-duties, and the other of internal taxation. These systems supposed, or ought to suppose, the greatest attention to, and the most detailed information of, all their affairs. However, by contending for the American representation, he seems at last driven virtually to admit, that great caution ought to be used in the exercise of all our legislative rights over an object so remote from our eye, and so little connected with our immediate feelings; that in prudence we ought not to be quite so ready with our taxes, until we can secure the desired representation in parliament. Perhaps it may be some time before this hopeful scheme can be brought to perfect maturity; although the author seems to be no wise aware of any obstructions that lie in the way of it.<ref name=\"quod.lib.umich.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004899151.0001.000?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=american+representatives |title=The political tracts and speeches: of Edmund Burke, Esq.

But, Sir, your ancestors thought this sort of virtual representation, however ample, to be totally insufficient for the freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are so near, and comparatively so inconsiderable. How, then, can I think it sufficient for those which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote?  You will now, Sir, perhaps imagine that I am on the point of proposing to you a scheme for a representation of the colonies in Parliament. Perhaps I might be inclined to entertain some such thought; but a great flood stops me in my course. Opposuit Natura. I cannot remove the eternal barriers of the creation. The thing, in that mode, I do not know to be possible. As I meddle with no theory, I do not absolutely assert the impracticability of such a representation; but I do not see my way to it; and those who have been more confident have not been more successful ... My resolutions, therefore, mean to establish the equity and justice of a taxation of America by grant, and not by imposition; to mark the legal competency of the colony assemblies for the support of their government in peace, and for public aids in time of war; to acknowledge that this legal competency has had a dutiful and beneficial exercise, and that experience has shown the benefit of their grants, and the futility of Parliamentary taxation, as a method of supply.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm#AMERICAN_TAXATION |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Burke's Writings and Speeches, Volume the Second, by Edmund Burke |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Burke apparently qualified such remarks concerning America by stating in the same speech that: <blockquote>The Parliament of Great Britain ... is never to intrude into the place of the [provincial legislatures], whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution. But in order to enable [Parliamentary] ... superintendence, her powers must be boundless. The gentlemen who think the powers of Parliament limited may please themselves to talk of requisitions. But suppose the requisitions are not obeyed? What! shall there be no reserved power in the empire, to supply a deficiency which may weaken, divide, and dissipate the whole? We are engaged in war,\u2014the Secretary of State calls upon the colonies to contribute,\u2014some would do it, I think most would cheerfully furnish whatever is demanded,\u2014one or two, suppose, hang back, and, easing themselves, let the stress of the draft lie on the others,\u2014surely it is proper that some authority might legally say, 'Tax yourselves for the common Supply, or Parliament will do it for you.' This backwardness was, as I am told, actually the case of Pennsylvania for some short time towards the beginning of the last war, owing to some internal dissensions in that colony. But whether the fact were so or otherwise, the case is equally to be provided for by a competent sovereign power. But then this ought to be no ordinary power, nor ever used in the first instance. This is what I meant, when I have said, at various times, that I consider the power of taxing in Parliament as an instrument of empire, and not as a means of supply.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== William Pitt the Elder ====\nThe views of Knox, Grenville and Burke did not go unchallenged: [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] was amongst those who disputed that a Parliamentary right or power existed to levy \"internal\" taxes \"for the purposes of raising a revenue\" without the consent of actual representatives of the \"Commons of America\".<ref name=\"bartleby.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/3/23.html |title=II.

This right, if it could be traced no higher than Magna Charta, is part of the common law, part of a British subjects birthright, and as inherent and perpetual, as the duty of allegiance; both which have been brought to these colonies, and have been hitherto held sacred and inviolable, and I hope and trust ever will. It is humbly conceived, that the British colonists (except only the conquered, if any) are, by Magna Charta, as well entitled to have a voice in their taxes, as the subjects within the realm.

But she must so rule it as not to contradict the fundamental principles that are common to both ... let the sovereign authority of this country over the colonies be asserted in as strong terms as can be devised, and be made to extend to every point of legislation whatsoever; that we may bind their trade, confine their manufactures, and exercise every power whatsoever, except that of taking their money out of their pockets without their consent.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/cbo/chatham/chat08.htm#N_5_ |author=Earl of Chatham|title=Right of Taxing America|date=January 14, 1766 |publisher=Classicpersuasion.org |accessdate=2015-05-12}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his first speeches in Parliament, Lord Camden vigorously attacked the declaratory act which was proposed to mollify the crown on the repeal of the Stamp Tax.

I shall not consider the Declaratory Bill now lying on your table; for to what purpose, but loss of time, to consider the particulars of a Bill, the very existence of which is illegal, absolutely illegal, contrary to the fundamental laws of nature, contrary to the fundamental laws of this constitution? A constitution grounded on the eternal and immutable laws of nature; a constitution whose foundation and centre is liberty, which sends liberty to every individual who may happen to be within any part of its ample circumference. Nor, my Lords, is the doctrine new, it is as old as the constitution; it grew up with it; indeed it is its support; taxation and representation are inseparably united; God hath joined them, no British parliament can separate them; to endeavour to do it, is to stab our very vitals. ... My position is this\u2014I repeat it\u2014I will maintain it to my last hour,\u2014taxation and representation are inseparable; this position is founded on the laws of nature; it is more, it is itself an eternal law of nature; for whatever is a man's own, is absolutely his own; no man has a right to take it from him without his consent, either expressed by himself or representative; whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury; whoever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down and destroys the distinction between liberty and slavery.

The forefathers of the Americans did not leave their native country, and subject themselves to every danger and distress, to be reduced to a state of slavery: they did not give up their rights; they looked for protection, and not for chains, from their mother country; by her they expected to be defended in the possession of their property, and not to be deprived of it: for, should the present power continue, there is nothing which they can call their own; or, to use the words of Mr. Locke, 'What property have they in that, which another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to himself?'\"<ref>16 Parliamentary History of England, London: Hansard, 1813, pp. 177-81.</ref></blockquote>In an appearance before Parliament in January 1766, former Prime Minister [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] stated:\n<blockquote>The idea of a virtual representation of America in this House is the most contemptible that ever entered into the head of a man.

The population of the village Lauterbrunnen is less than that of Wengen, but larger than that of the others.\n\n==Toponymy==\nLauterbrunnen was first mentioned in 1240 as ''\"in claro fonte\"'', a [[Romance language]] place name meaning \"clear spring\".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} By 1253, it was known to [[German language|German]] speakers as ''Liuterbrunnon''; the town had an alternate spelling of ''Luterbrunnen'' by 1268.<ref name=HDS/> While the meaning of ''brunnen'' is undoubtedly [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] or fountain, there is some dispute about the meaning of ''lauter''. Some translate it as clear, clean or bright (which compares to the earlier Romance language meaning of the place mentioned above), while others translate it as \"many\" or \"louder\". A local explanation is that the name Lauterbrunnen means \"many springs\", using a modern meaning of the word ''lauter'' in German; however, this could be an example of a [[folk etymology]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sommer, Giorgio (1834-1914) - n. 12816 - Lauterbrunnenthal.jpg|thumb|left|Lauterbrunnen Valley in the late 19th or early 20th century.]]\n[[File:Jungfraubahn Bohrarbeiten um 1900 (01).jpg|thumb|left|Miners working on the Jungfraubahn]]\nLauterbrunnen is first mentioned in 1240 as ''in claro fonte''. In 1304 it was mentioned as ''Luterbrunnen''.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe oldest trace of a settlement in the area is a single [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman]] coin which was discovered in the Blumental.\n\nWhen the Lauterbrunnen Valley first appears in the historic record, during the 13th century, it was owned by the [[Freiherr]] of W\u00e4denswil. In 1240 the Freiherr of W\u00e4denswil sold the Sefinen Valley to [[Interlaken Monastery]]. Over the following century, the Monastery and other local lords began to expand their power in the Lauterbrunnen and neighboring valleys. However, around 1300, the Lord of Turn began to settle his [[Walser German|Walser]] speaking people in the nearby L\u00f6tschen Valley and into the highlands of the Lauterbrunnen Valley. By 1346, the Walser villages of Lauterbrunnen, Gimmelwald, M\u00fcrren, Sichellauenen and Trachsellauenen all had village governments and a certain amount of independence from the Monastery. Three years later, much of the [[Bernese Oberland]] unsuccessfully rose up against Monastery. When the Monastery suppressed the rebellion, the Walser villages bore the brunt of the Monastery's wrath.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nBy the 15th century, the villages of the valley were part of the large [[parish]] of Gsteig bei Interlaken (now part of [[Gsteigwiler]]). In 1487-88 the villagers in Lauterbrunnen built a [[filial church]] of the parish. In 1506, the parish appointed a full-time priest for Lauterbrunnen. In 1528, the city of [[Bern]] adopted the new faith of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and began imposing it on the [[Bernese Oberland]]. Lauterbrunnen joined many other villages and the Monastery in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed its will on the Oberland, they secularized the Monastery and annexed all the Monastery lands. Lauterbrunnen became the center of a new Reformed parish.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nMines were built in the Trachsellauenen area in the upper valley beginning in the late 16th century. An iron [[smelter]] was built in Zweil\u00fctschinen (now part of [[G\u00fcndlischwand]]) in 1715 to process the iron ore from Trachsellauenen. However most of the money from the mines went to the noble landowners. The villagers remained very poor. In the 17th and 18th centuries the poverty was so widespread that many of the villagers joined mercenary regiments or emigrated. A majority of the emigrants moved to the Carolinas in the United States. Beginning in the late 18th century, foreign mountain climbers began to use Lauterbrunnen as a starting point for their expeditions into the nearby Alps. Initially the climbers stayed in the village [[rectory]]. However, as Lauterbrunnen's fame grew and with the completion of a road from Interlaken in 1834 and the 1890 [[Bernese Oberland Railway]], more hotels were needed for tourists. As new hotels were built, other tourist infrastructure was also built in the village. They built cable cars to M\u00fcrren in 1891 and to Wengen in 1893. But the most significant piece of infrastructure was the [[Jungfrau railway]] which was built in 1912. The Jungfrau [[rack railway]] runs {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Kleine Scheidegg]] to the highest railway station in Europe at [[Jungfraujoch]]. The railway runs almost entirely within a tunnel built into the [[Eiger]] and [[M\u00f6nch]] mountains and contains two stations in the middle of the tunnel, where passengers can disembark to observe the neighboring mountains through windows built into the mountainside. In 1909 the English brothers Walter and Arnold Lunn popularized skiing, curling and bobsledding at Lauterbrunnen. These winter sports provided a whole new group of winter tourists and converted the summer tourist industry into a year-round business. The tourist economy of Lauterbrunnen was devastated due to World War I and II and the [[Great Depression]]. However, following the end of World War II, tourism rebounded. Many new vacation homes and chalets were built along with ski lifts, chair lifts and a heliport.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nOn 1 January 1973 the former municipality of Isenfluh merged into the municipality of Lauterbrunnen. On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Interlaken, the municipality's former district, was dissolved. On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created Verwaltungskreis Interlaken-Oberhasli.<ref name=Mutation>[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/02.html Nomenklaturen \u2013 Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] {{in lang|de}} accessed 9 February 2013</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:LauterbrunnenValley.jpg|thumb|right|View of the valley from the [[M\u00e4nnlichen]]]]\nLauterbrunnen lies at the bottom of a U-shaped valley that extends south and then south-westwards from the village to meet the {{convert|8|km|mi|sp=us}} [[Lauterbrunnen Wall]]. The Lauterbrunnen Valley (''Lauterbrunnental'') is one of the deepest in the Alpine chain when compared with the height of the mountains that rise directly on either side. It is a true cleft, rarely more than one kilometre in width, between limestone precipices, sometimes quite perpendicular, everywhere of extreme steepness. It is to this form of the valley that it owes the numerous waterfalls from which it derives its name. The streams descending from the adjoining mountains, on reaching the verge of the rocky walls of the valley, form cascades so high that they are almost lost in spray before they reach the level of the valley. The most famous of these is [[Staubbach Falls]], less than one kilometre from the village of Lauterbrunnen. The M\u00fcrrenbachfall with a fall height of 417 metres and the Buchenbachfall with a fall height of 380 metres are the two highest waterfalls in Switzerland. With 297 metres is the Staubbachfall the highest free falling waterfall in Switzerland. With its 840 metres, the Mattenbach waterfall is just behind the Vinnufallet and Skorga Europe\u2019s third and worldwide eighth tallest waterfall.\n\n''[[L\u00fctschine|Weisse L\u00fctschine]]'' river flows through Lauterbrunnen and overflows its banks about once a year. The source of the river comes from melting snow high in the mountains, thus making it a very pure and clean source of water. It is common practice in camp sites to chill drinks in the water. [[Trummelbach Falls]] is {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Lauterbrunnen, connected by bus from the station.<ref>Trummelbach Falls tourist literature</ref>\n\nThe municipality of Lauterbrunnen extends a considerable distance beyond the village and valley, with an area of {{Swiss area|0584|mi=on}}. It reaches as far as the peaks of the [[Eiger]], [[M\u00f6nch]] and [[Jungfrau]] to the east, the [[Gletscherhorn]], [[Mittaghorn]], [[Grosshorn]], [[Breithorn (Lauterbrunnen)|Breithorn]] and [[Tschingelhorn]] to the south, and the [[Gspaltenhorn]] and [[Schilthorn]] to the west. The [[Kleine Scheidegg Pass]] crosses over to [[Grindelwald]] to the east, whilst the [[Sefinenfurgge Pass]] crosses to [[Griesalp]] and [[Reichenbach im Kandertal]] to the west. Both passes carry hiking trails that form part of the [[Alpine Pass Route]], a long-distance hiking trail across Switzerland between [[Sargans]] and [[Montreux]]. Besides the village of Lauterbrunnen, the municipality also includes the villages of Wengen, M\u00fcrren, Gimmelwald, Stechelberg, and Isenfluh.{{Swiss area data|0584|QUELLE}}<!--164.56 - 164.41 km2--><ref name=swtopo>{{cite map | publisher = Swiss Confederation | title = map.geo.admin.ch | url = http://map.geo.admin.ch/?zoom=5&X=155891.76&Y=634169.32&lang=en&topic=ech&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&catalogNodes=457,510&layers=ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-gemeinde-flaeche.fill | accessdate = 2015-05-18}}</ref><ref name=tita10>{{cite book | title = Trekking in the Alps | first = Kev | last = Reynolds | pages = 124\u2013135 | chapter = Trek 10 - Alpine Pass Route | publisher = Cicerone | year = 2011 | isbn = 978 1 85284 600 8}}</ref>\n\nOf the municipal area, {{convert|36.79|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 22.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|28.84|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 17.5% is forested.

The population of the village Lauterbrunnen is less than that of Wengen, but larger than that of the others.\n\n==Toponymy==\nLauterbrunnen was first mentioned in 1240 as ''\"in claro fonte\"'', a [[Romance language]] place name meaning \"clear spring\".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} By 1253, it was known to [[German language|German]] speakers as ''Liuterbrunnon''; the town had an alternate spelling of ''Luterbrunnen'' by 1268.<ref name=HDS/> While the meaning of ''brunnen'' is undoubtedly [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] or fountain, there is some dispute about the meaning of ''lauter''. Some translate it as clear, clean or bright (which compares to the earlier Romance language meaning of the place mentioned above), while others translate it as \"many\" or \"louder\". A local explanation is that the name Lauterbrunnen means \"many springs\", using a modern meaning of the word ''lauter'' in German; however, this could be an example of a [[folk etymology]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sommer, Giorgio (1834-1914) - n. 12816 - Lauterbrunnenthal.jpg|thumb|left|Lauterbrunnen Valley in the late 19th or early 20th century.]]\n[[File:Jungfraubahn Bohrarbeiten um 1900 (01).jpg|thumb|left|Miners working on the Jungfraubahn]]\nLauterbrunnen is first mentioned in 1240 as ''in claro fonte''. In 1304 it was mentioned as ''Luterbrunnen''.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe oldest trace of a settlement in the area is a single [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman]] coin which was discovered in the Blumental.\n\nWhen the Lauterbrunnen Valley first appears in the historic record, during the 13th century, it was owned by the [[Freiherr]] of W\u00e4denswil. In 1240 the Freiherr of W\u00e4denswil sold the Sefinen Valley to [[Interlaken Monastery]]. Over the following century, the Monastery and other local lords began to expand their power in the Lauterbrunnen and neighboring valleys. However, around 1300, the Lord of Turn began to settle his [[Walser German|Walser]] speaking people in the nearby L\u00f6tschen Valley and into the highlands of the Lauterbrunnen Valley. By 1346, the Walser villages of Lauterbrunnen, Gimmelwald, M\u00fcrren, Sichellauenen and Trachsellauenen all had village governments and a certain amount of independence from the Monastery. Three years later, much of the [[Bernese Oberland]] unsuccessfully rose up against Monastery. When the Monastery suppressed the rebellion, the Walser villages bore the brunt of the Monastery's wrath.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nBy the 15th century, the villages of the valley were part of the large [[parish]] of Gsteig bei Interlaken (now part of [[Gsteigwiler]]). In 1487-88 the villagers in Lauterbrunnen built a [[filial church]] of the parish. In 1506, the parish appointed a full-time priest for Lauterbrunnen. In 1528, the city of [[Bern]] adopted the new faith of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and began imposing it on the [[Bernese Oberland]]. Lauterbrunnen joined many other villages and the Monastery in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed its will on the Oberland, they secularized the Monastery and annexed all the Monastery lands. Lauterbrunnen became the center of a new Reformed parish.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nMines were built in the Trachsellauenen area in the upper valley beginning in the late 16th century. An iron [[smelter]] was built in Zweil\u00fctschinen (now part of [[G\u00fcndlischwand]]) in 1715 to process the iron ore from Trachsellauenen. However most of the money from the mines went to the noble landowners. The villagers remained very poor. In the 17th and 18th centuries the poverty was so widespread that many of the villagers joined mercenary regiments or emigrated. A majority of the emigrants moved to the Carolinas in the United States. Beginning in the late 18th century, foreign mountain climbers began to use Lauterbrunnen as a starting point for their expeditions into the nearby Alps. Initially the climbers stayed in the village [[rectory]]. However, as Lauterbrunnen's fame grew and with the completion of a road from Interlaken in 1834 and the 1890 [[Bernese Oberland Railway]], more hotels were needed for tourists. As new hotels were built, other tourist infrastructure was also built in the village. They built cable cars to M\u00fcrren in 1891 and to Wengen in 1893. But the most significant piece of infrastructure was the [[Jungfrau railway]] which was built in 1912. The Jungfrau [[rack railway]] runs {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Kleine Scheidegg]] to the highest railway station in Europe at [[Jungfraujoch]]. The railway runs almost entirely within a tunnel built into the [[Eiger]] and [[M\u00f6nch]] mountains and contains two stations in the middle of the tunnel, where passengers can disembark to observe the neighboring mountains through windows built into the mountainside. In 1909 the English brothers Walter and Arnold Lunn popularized skiing, curling and bobsledding at Lauterbrunnen. These winter sports provided a whole new group of winter tourists and converted the summer tourist industry into a year-round business. The tourist economy of Lauterbrunnen was devastated due to World War I and II and the [[Great Depression]]. However, following the end of World War II, tourism rebounded. Many new vacation homes and chalets were built along with ski lifts, chair lifts and a heliport.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nOn 1 January 1973 the former municipality of Isenfluh merged into the municipality of Lauterbrunnen. On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Interlaken, the municipality's former district, was dissolved. On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created Verwaltungskreis Interlaken-Oberhasli.<ref name=Mutation>[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/02.html Nomenklaturen \u2013 Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] {{in lang|de}} accessed 9 February 2013</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:LauterbrunnenValley.jpg|thumb|right|View of the valley from the [[M\u00e4nnlichen]]]]\nLauterbrunnen lies at the bottom of a U-shaped valley that extends south and then south-westwards from the village to meet the {{convert|8|km|mi|sp=us}} [[Lauterbrunnen Wall]]. The Lauterbrunnen Valley (''Lauterbrunnental'') is one of the deepest in the Alpine chain when compared with the height of the mountains that rise directly on either side. It is a true cleft, rarely more than one kilometre in width, between limestone precipices, sometimes quite perpendicular, everywhere of extreme steepness. It is to this form of the valley that it owes the numerous waterfalls from which it derives its name. The streams descending from the adjoining mountains, on reaching the verge of the rocky walls of the valley, form cascades so high that they are almost lost in spray before they reach the level of the valley. The most famous of these is [[Staubbach Falls]], less than one kilometre from the village of Lauterbrunnen. The height of the cascade is between {{convert|800|and|900|ft|m|order=flip}}, one of the highest in Europe formed of a single unbroken fall.<ref>[[John Ball (naturalist)|John Ball]], ''The Alpine guide, Central Alps'', p. 75, 1866, London</ref>\n\n''[[L\u00fctschine|Weisse L\u00fctschine]]'' river flows through Lauterbrunnen and overflows its banks about once a year. The source of the river comes from melting snow high in the mountains, thus making it a very pure and clean source of water. It is common practice in camp sites to chill drinks in the water. [[Trummelbach Falls]] is {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Lauterbrunnen, connected by bus from the station.<ref>Trummelbach Falls tourist literature</ref>\n\nThe municipality of Lauterbrunnen extends a considerable distance beyond the village and valley, with an area of {{Swiss area|0584|mi=on}}. It reaches as far as the peaks of the [[Eiger]], [[M\u00f6nch]] and [[Jungfrau]] to the east, the [[Gletscherhorn]], [[Mittaghorn]], [[Grosshorn]], [[Breithorn (Lauterbrunnen)|Breithorn]] and [[Tschingelhorn]] to the south, and the [[Gspaltenhorn]] and [[Schilthorn]] to the west. The [[Kleine Scheidegg Pass]] crosses over to [[Grindelwald]] to the east, whilst the [[Sefinenfurgge Pass]] crosses to [[Griesalp]] and [[Reichenbach im Kandertal]] to the west. Both passes carry hiking trails that form part of the [[Alpine Pass Route]], a long-distance hiking trail across Switzerland between [[Sargans]] and [[Montreux]]. Besides the village of Lauterbrunnen, the municipality also includes the villages of Wengen, M\u00fcrren, Gimmelwald, Stechelberg, and Isenfluh.{{Swiss area data|0584|QUELLE}}<!--164.56 - 164.41 km2--><ref name=swtopo>{{cite map | publisher = Swiss Confederation | title = map.geo.admin.ch | url = http://map.geo.admin.ch/?zoom=5&X=155891.76&Y=634169.32&lang=en&topic=ech&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&catalogNodes=457,510&layers=ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-gemeinde-flaeche.fill | accessdate = 2015-05-18}}</ref><ref name=tita10>{{cite book | title = Trekking in the Alps | first = Kev | last = Reynolds | pages = 124\u2013135 | chapter = Trek 10 - Alpine Pass Route | publisher = Cicerone | year = 2011 | isbn = 978 1 85284 600 8}}</ref>\n\nOf the municipal area, {{convert|36.79|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 22.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|28.84|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 17.5% is forested.

He described his first two releases, saying: {{cquote|''Trilogy'' was more of a claustrophobic body of work, before it was released I hadn't left my city for 21 years, and I had never been on a plane, not once. I spent my entire life in one setting, that's probably why pieces of the album feel like one long track, because that's what my life felt like. It felt like one long song. ''Kiss Land'' is the story after ''Trilogy'' {{ndash}} it's pretty much the second chapter of my life. The narrative takes place after my first flight; it's very foreign, very Asian-inspired.

He described his first two releases, saying: {{cquote|''Trilogy'' was more of a claustrophobic body of work, before it was released I hadn't left my city for 21 years, and I had never been on a plane, not once. I spent my entire life in one setting, that's probably why pieces of the album feel like one long track, because that's what my life felt like. It felt like one long song. ''Kiss Land'' is the story after ''Trilogy'' {{ndash}} it's pretty much the second chapter of my life. The narrative takes place after my first flight; it's very foreign, very Asian-inspired. When people ask me, \"Why Japan?\" I simply tell them it's the furthest I've ever been from home.
