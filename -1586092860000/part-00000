It follows the life of the Stevenses, a family living in suburban [[Sacramento, California]], mainly focusing on the clashing personalities of its two younger children, Ren and Louis.\n\nThe series was produced by [[Brookwell McNamara Entertainment]]. It is often recognized as launching [[Shia LaBeouf]]'s breakout career as an actor. The show also features [[Time-lapse photography|fast motion]] photography, which it employs in every episode.\n\nThe feature-length [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] based on the series, ''[[The Even Stevens Movie]]'', premiered on June 13, 2003, and serves as the series finale. The show was cancelled after reaching the 65 episode limit that Disney Channel had at the time.\n\n==Premise==\nThe Stevens family live in a small area in suburban Sacramento, [[Elk Grove, California]], where the two younger children in the family, Ren and Louis, who have opposing personalities, often clash.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Even Stevens episodes}}\n{{:List of Even Stevens episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Louis Anthony Stevens ([[Shia LaBeouf]]) \u2013 Louis, the youngest Stevens sibling, is viewed as immature, rude, lazy, boisterous, selfish, carefree, and extremely mischievous. His entire family is viewed as perfect next to him. He is always pulling jokes with best friend Alan Twitty and is described as ruining everyone's lives. He never seems to change with time. His parents seem to favor his sister Ren and brother Donnie because of the great successes both have achieved, but his parents do love him dearly and try to defend him. Louis tends to do unattractive things (saying nasty words, picking nose, etc.), though everything is presented to the audience in endearing ways. Tawny Dean becomes his girlfriend at the end of the series. His birthday is on June 27 as shown in episode 33.\n* Ren Stevens ([[Christy Carlson Romano]]) \u2013 An intelligent, well-behaved, perfectionist 8th-grader, Ren is the middle sibling and only daughter. She is the classic overachiever, constantly running for hall monitor and class president while trying to keep Louis's schemes from becoming disasters. She is the head newscaster for \"The Wombat Report\" and spent a few weeks on her school's cheerleading squad. Ren is the editor of the school newspaper and the yearbook, a straight-A student, and Principal Wexler's highly-valued assistant. Despite her top-student ranking, Ren got sentenced to, and served, detention on at least one occasion. Ren's favorite color is purple.\n* Donnie Stevens ([[Nick Spano]]) \u2013 Ren and Louis' athletic big brother. Donnie is highly concerned with his appearance. His popularity, good looks, and superb athletic skills made him a heartthrob and legend at their school, even after his graduation. Although he excels in many sports, he's an airhead.\n* Steve Stevens ([[Tom Virtue]]) \u2013 A quirky lawyer. He played [[college football]] for [[Michigan State University]] with the nickname \"Stiffie\" Stevens. He used to be a wrestler for his school. He is the father of Donnie, Ren, and Louis.\n* Eileen Stevens ([[Donna Pescow]]) \u2013 A successful, no-nonsense, [[American Jews|Jewish American]] [[state senator]] who launched a campaign for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 2002 and was narrowly defeated. She is the mother of Donnie, Ren, and Louis.\n* Alan Twitty ([[A.J. Trauth]]) \u2013 Louis' closest best friend. Twitty is similar to Louis but usually isn't as extreme and often has to get Louis out of situations. Referred to as \"Twitty\" by his friends, he is on the basketball team and the baseball team, plays guitar, and also has success with girls. Twitty's catch phrases are \"Dude\" and \"Sweet\". He's the [[Shawn Hunter]] to Louis' [[Cory Matthews]]\n* Tawny Dean ([[Margo Harshman]]) \u2013 Louis' female best friend, and eventually his girlfriend. Tawny, at first, has no friends and is an outsider, until she meets Louis. Tawny usually dresses in [[Goth subculture|goth]] clothing, unlike her classmates, and refuses to conform with others' trivial pursuits.\n* Ruby Mendel ([[Lauren Frost]]) \u2013 Ren's best friend who loves to gossip about crushes and dating couples. She once had a crush on Louis (while under the spell of a lucky penny), in the same episode that she had a crush on the boy band [[BBMak]]. Ruby speaks with a heavy Brooklyn accent.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Thomas \"Tom\" Gribalski ([[Fred Meyers]]) \u2013 Louis' nerdy best friend. When Louis cooks up a scheme, Tom usually tries to talk Louis out of it and usually doesn't play along. Also, Tom speaks in a very scientific, philosophical, and intelligent manner. He is commonly the victim of many pranks by Louis and Twitty. He calls his mother by her name (Doris). In season 3, Doris is seen playing the piano when Tom auditions for SACCY, a performing arts school.\n* Monique Taylor (Kenya Williams) \u2013 Ren's other best friend. Monique is a perky cheerleader. Monique takes many things to extreme limits. She has a strong [[Southern American English|Southern accent]].\n* Nelson Minkler ([[Gary LeRoi Gray]]) \u2013 Ren's childhood best friend who seems to be allergic to everything and overprotects himself when he's outside. He is usually with Ren, and at times Donnie, but has spoken to Louis only once. He is fluent in French. Nelson was also Gray's character's name on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' as a child.\n* Bernard \"Beans\" Aranguren ([[Steven Anthony Lawrence]]) \u2013 The Stevens' extremely annoying neighbor, who comes into their home uninvited, makes himself at home, and refuses to leave. His love for bacon is a recurring theme, and in \"Little Mr. Sacktown\" he visits a bacon shack. He eventually turns into a sidekick for Louis and Twitty's schemes, usually double-crossing the two.\n* Lawrence Anthony \"Larry\" Beale (Eric \"Ty\" Hodges) \u2013 Ren's nasty, equally-popular, charismatic, know-it-all rival in school. Larry hates Ren and always tries to destroy her reputation, but his schemes usually backfire. His favorite victim is Ren, but he occasionally tries to ruin Louis as well. Larry is secretly jealous of Ren and considers Louis a threat, but will never admit it.<!--If he never admits any of this, how do we know this about him?--> Larry is an Army brat. In the movie, he hinted he might even have romantic feelings for her, as he shows a bit of jealousy when it showed that Ren was sharing a kiss with an actor.\n* Coach Terry Tugnut ([[Jim Wise]]) \u2013 The gym coach who is always tough on Louis but crazy about Donnie, Larry, and food. He loves to eat. Once he weighed over 300&nbsp;lbs. He is frequently the victim of Louis' pranks. Coach Tugnut often serves as Wexler's enforcer/sidekick. He is obsessed with dodgeball and with the three \"major points\" (arm, head, stomach). A running gag throughout the series is Coach Tugnut shouting, \"Stevens!\" when Louis causes trouble.\n* Conrad Wexler (George Anthony Bell) \u2013 The principal of Lawrence Jr High. Principal Wexler favors Ren over the other students. They have had arguments, but they're good friends. Ren is his student assistant, while Louis drives him crazy. He usually makes Ren do his dirty work.\n* Carla and Marla ([[Lisa Foiles]] and Krysten Leigh Jones) \u2013 Two girls who look up to Ren. Carla and Marla are both on the newspaper staff with Ren and Ruby. After the episode \"Quest for Coolness\", Carla and Marla are never seen or mentioned again.\n* Bobby Deaver (Brandon Davis) \u2013 Ren's middle-school boyfriend; he appeared in seven episodes. Ren broke up with Bobby after Louis told her that he was cheating on her by dating Mandy Sanchez, a rival of Ren's.\n* Ivan ([[Eric Jungmann]]) \u2013 Larry Beale's yes-man sidekick in the first season, although he occasionally serves as a yes-man for other popular kids, such as Blake Thompson in the episode \"Louis in the Middle\".\n\n==Production==\nThe show was originally produced as a show called ''Spivey's Kid Brother''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hogan|first1=Mike|title=Landing in Hollywood|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/08/labeouf200708|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=April 14, 2017|date=August 2007}}</ref> A pilot was filmed in July 1999, and was later picked up by [[Disney Channel]] as ''Even Stevens''. In the pilot episode, Disney had to dub out the name \"Spivey\" to \"Stevens\". In fact, in the gym class scene, a banner is visible in the background reading, \"Home of Spivey and the Wild Wombats.\"\n\nIn the theme song of the show, clay animations of Louis and Ren turn their [[remote control]]s into [[lightsaber]]s, alluding to ''[[Star Wars]]''. Prior to this, Ren reads a TV guide with live-action photos of Christy Carlson Romano and Shia LaBeouf on the cover.\n\nLawrence Junior High is apparently a standard three-grade junior high school.  Although the show lasted three seasons, the timeline of the show is only two school years, with Louis and his friends remaining in the 7th grade until some point after the middle of the second season. In several third season episodes there are subtle references to an advance in the timeline that puts Ren and her friends in the 9th grade and Louis in the 8th grade. Ren finally graduates in ''[[The Even Stevens Movie]]''.\n\nShia LaBeouf and Christy Carlson Romano are the only two actors to appear in all 65 episodes of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teen.com/2015/03/22/television/even-stevens-fun-facts-trivia/|title=8 Things You Need to Know About Even Stevens ASAP|first=|last=|website=Teen.com|date=March 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe series reran on Disney Channel from June 2, 2003 to September 4, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvschedulearchive.com/disney-channel/2007/070207.txt|title=Nick & More!

She once had a crush on Louis (while under the spell of a lucky penny), in the same episode that she had a crush on the boy band [[BBMak]]. Ruby speaks with a heavy Brooklyn accent.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Thomas \"Tom\" Gribalski ([[Fred Meyers]]) \u2013 Louis' nerdy best friend. When Louis cooks up a scheme, Tom usually tries to talk Louis out of it and usually doesn't play along. Also, Tom speaks in a very scientific, philosophical, and intelligent manner. He is commonly the victim of many pranks by Louis and Twitty. He calls his mother by her name (Doris). In season 3, Doris is seen playing the piano when Tom auditions for SACCY, a performing arts school.\n* Monique Taylor (Kenya Williams) \u2013 Ren's other best friend. Monique is a perky cheerleader. Monique takes many things to extreme limits. She has a strong [[Southern American English|Southern accent]].\n* Nelson Minkler ([[Gary LeRoi Gray]]) \u2013 Ren's childhood best friend who seems to be allergic to everything and overprotects himself when he's outside. He is usually with Ren, and at times Donnie, but has spoken to Louis only once. He is fluent in French. Nelson was also Gray's character's name on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' as a child.\n* Bernard \"Beans\" Aranguren ([[Steven Anthony Lawrence]]) \u2013 The Stevens' extremely annoying neighbor, who comes into their home uninvited, makes himself at home, and refuses to leave. His love for bacon is a recurring theme, and in \"Little Mr. Sacktown\" he visits a bacon shack. He eventually turns into a sidekick for Louis and Twitty's schemes, usually double-crossing the two.\n* Lawrence Anthony \"Larry\" Beale (Eric \"Ty\" Hodges) \u2013 Ren's nasty, equally-popular, charismatic, know-it-all rival in school. Larry hates Ren and always tries to destroy her reputation, but his schemes usually backfire. His favorite victim is Ren, but he occasionally tries to ruin Louis as well. Larry is secretly jealous of Ren and considers Louis a threat, but will never admit it.<!--If he never admits any of this, how do we know this about him?--> Larry is an Army brat. In the movie, he hinted he might even have romantic feelings for her, as he shows a bit of jealousy when it showed that Ren was sharing a kiss with an actor.\n* Coach Terry Tugnut ([[Jim Wise]]) \u2013 The gym coach who is always tough on Louis but crazy about Donnie, Larry, and food. He loves to eat. Once he weighed over 300&nbsp;lbs. He is frequently the victim of Louis' pranks. Coach Tugnut often serves as Wexler's enforcer/sidekick. He is obsessed with dodgeball and with the three \"major points\" (arm, head, stomach). A running gag throughout the series is Coach Tugnut shouting, \"Stevens!\" when Louis causes trouble.\n* Conrad Wexler (George Anthony Bell) \u2013 The principal of Lawrence Jr High. Principal Wexler favors Ren over the other students. They have had arguments, but they're good friends. Ren is his student assistant, while Louis drives him crazy. He usually makes Ren do his dirty work.\n* Carla and Marla ([[Lisa Foiles]] and Krysten Leigh Jones) \u2013 Two girls who look up to Ren. Carla and Marla are both on the newspaper staff with Ren and Ruby. After the episode \"Quest for Coolness\", Carla and Marla are never seen or mentioned again.\n* Bobby Deaver (Brandon Davis) \u2013 Ren's middle-school boyfriend; he appeared in seven episodes. Ren broke up with Bobby after Louis told her that he was cheating on her by dating Mandy Sanchez, a rival of Ren's.\n* Ivan ([[Eric Jungmann]]) \u2013 Larry Beale's yes-man sidekick in the first season, although he occasionally serves as a yes-man for other popular kids, such as Blake Thompson in the episode \"Louis in the Middle\".\n\n==Production==\nThe show was originally produced as a show called ''Spivey's Kid Brother''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hogan|first1=Mike|title=Landing in Hollywood|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/08/labeouf200708|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=April 14, 2017|date=August 2007}}</ref> A pilot was filmed in July 1999, and was later picked up by [[Disney Channel]] as ''Even Stevens''. In the pilot episode, Disney had to dub out the name \"Spivey\" to \"Stevens\". In fact, in the gym class scene, a banner is visible in the background reading, \"Home of Spivey and the Wild Wombats.\"\n\nIn the theme song of the show, clay animations of Louis and Ren turn their [[remote control]]s into [[lightsaber]]s, alluding to ''[[Star Wars]]''. Prior to this, Ren reads a TV guide with live-action photos of Christy Carlson Romano and Shia LaBeouf on the cover.\n\nLawrence Junior High is apparently a standard three-grade junior high school.  Although the show lasted three seasons, the timeline of the show is only two school years, with Louis and his friends remaining in the 7th grade until some point after the middle of the second season. In several third season episodes there are subtle references to an advance in the timeline that puts Ren and her friends in the 9th grade and Louis in the 8th grade. Ren finally graduates in ''[[The Even Stevens Movie]]''.\n\nShia LaBeouf and Christy Carlson Romano are the only two actors to appear in all 65 episodes of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teen.com/2015/03/22/television/even-stevens-fun-facts-trivia/|title=8 Things You Need to Know About Even Stevens ASAP|first=|last=|website=Teen.com|date=March 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe series reran on Disney Channel from June 2, 2003 to September 4, 2006.

For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter.

There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits.

Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents\u2014a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is. \"And so we boldly go \u2014 into the whirling knives,\" as the superintelligent AI takes a \"treacherous turn\" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows.

The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars.

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August).

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This would mean that \"[if] a human society were highly motivated to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail.\"<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> Armstrong notes that this and similar statements \"seem extraordinarily strong claims to make\".<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}} Full text available [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf here].</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation.

This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want. A highly capable decision maker \u2014 especially one connected through the Internet to all the world's information and billions of screens and most of our infrastructure \u2014 can have an irreversible impact on humanity.\n\nThis is not a minor difficulty.

Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

He suggests that this can be done by implementing a utility function designed to always satisfy Haidt\u2019s functionality and aim to generally increase  (but not maximize)  the capabilities of self,  other individuals and society as a whole as suggested by [[John Rawls]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Designing, Implementing and Enforcing a Coherent System of Laws, Ethics and Morals for Intelligent Machines (Including Humans)|last = Waser|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Procedia Computer Science|doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.213|pmid = |pages = 106\u2013111|type = Print |volume=71}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=needs source with [[WP:WEIGHT]]|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Difficulties of modifying goal specification after launch===\n{{further|AI takeover|Instrumental convergence#Goal-content integrity}}\n\nWhile current goal-based AI programs are not intelligent enough to think of resisting programmer attempts to modify it, a sufficiently advanced, rational, \"self-aware\" AI might resist any changes to its goal structure, just as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] would not want to take a pill that makes him want to kill people.

If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This would mean that \"[if] a human society were highly motivated to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail.\"<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> Armstrong notes that this and similar statements \"seem extraordinarily strong claims to make\".<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}} Full text available [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf here].</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation.\" Musk states the first step would be for the government to gain \"insight\" into the actual status of current research, warning that \"Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid{{nbsp}}...

It is bordered by two different oxygenation and glacial events, but the Boring Billion itself had very low oxygen levels and no evidence of glaciation.\n\nThe oceans may have been oxygen- and nutrient-poor and sulfidic ([[euxinia]]), populated by mainly [[anoxygenic photosynthesis|anoxygenic]] [[cyanobacteria]], a type of photosynthetic bacteria which uses [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) instead of water and produces [[sulfur]] instead of oxygen. This is known as a [[Canfield ocean]]. Such composition may have caused the oceans to be black- and milky-turquoise instead of blue.\n\nDespite such adverse conditions, [[eukaryote]]s may have evolved around the beginning of the Boring Billion, and adopted several novel adaptations, such as various [[organelle]]s and possibly [[evolution of sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]], and diversified into [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]]. Such advances may have been important precursors to the evolution of large, complex life later in the [[Cambrian explosion]]. However, [[prokaryotic]] cyanobacteria were the dominant lifeforms during this time, and likely supported an energy-poor [[food-web]] with a small number of [[protist]]s at the [[apex predator|apex level]]. The land was likely inhabited by prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic proto-[[lichen]]s, the latter more successful here probably due to the greater availability of nutrients than offshore ocean waters.\n\n==Description==\nIn 1995, geologists [[Roger Buick]], [[Davis Des Marais]], and [[Andrew Knoll]] reviewed the apparent lack of major biological, geological, and climatic events during the [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[era]] 1.6 to 1 billion years ago (Gya), and, thus, described it as \"the dullest time in Earth's history\".<ref name=Buick1995>{{Cite journal|title = Stable isotopic compositions of carbonates from the Mesoproterozoic Bangemall group, northwestern Australia|journal = Chemical Geology|year=1995|pages = 153\u2013171|volume = 123|issue = 1\u20134|doi = 10.1016/0009-2541(95)00049-R|pmid = 11540130|first = R.|last = Buick|first2 = D.

[[Sulfate-reducing microorganisms]] converted this to [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S), dividing the ocean into a somewhat oxic surface layer, and a sulfidic layer beneath, with [[anoxygenic photosynthesis|anoxygenic]] bacteria living at the border, metabolizing the H<sub>2</sub>S and creating sulfur as a waste product.

It is bordered by two different oxygenation and glacial events, but the Boring Billion itself had very low oxygen levels and no evidence of glaciation.\n\nThe oceans may have been oxygen- and nutrient-poor and sulfidic ([[euxinia]]), populated by mainly [[anoxygenic photosynthesis|anoxygenic]] [[cyanobacteria]], a type of photosynthetic bacteria which uses [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) instead of water and produces [[sulfur]] instead of oxygen. This is known as a [[Canfield ocean]]. Such composition may have caused the oceans to be black- and milky-turquoise instead of blue.\n\nDespite such adverse conditions, [[eukaryote]]s may have evolved around the beginning of the Boring Billion, and adopted several novel adaptations, such as various [[organelle]]s and possibly [[evolution of sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]], and diversified into [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]].

It has been nicknamed \"'''Spur's Defeat'''\", which is thought to refer to the [[spur]]s used by the soldiers to drive their horses away from the battle as quickly as possible.  The campaign is sometimes referred to as the '''Second Battle of Tippecanoe'''.<ref name=Dyer>Dyer \u2013 link below</ref>\n\n==Second Tippecanoe campaign==\nFollowing several defeats and massacres in 1812, notably the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn|Fort Dearborn Massacre]] and the [[Pigeon Roost Massacre]], a joint punitive campaign was sent to [[Illinois Territory]] under the commands of Major General [[Samuel Hopkins (congressman)|Samuel Hopkins]] and Colonel [[William Russell (Kentucky)|William Russell]].  Russell, coming from the [[Siege of Fort Harrison]], led a force of Illinois militia and [[Indiana Rangers]], and [[Illinois Territory in the War of 1812|was successful]] in destroying a hostile Kickapoo village on [[Peoria Lake]].  Russell had to retreat to [[Cahokia]], however, when he could not locate the forces under Hopkins.  Hopkins could not get his Kentucky militia to engage, and had been driven back to [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] when the Kickapoo started a [[Grass fire|prairie grass fire]].<ref>Allison, 192</ref>\n\nHopkins was humiliated by his loss, and discharged the Kentucky militia under his command.  He then raised a new army, consisting of three regiments of Kentucky Infantry, one company of the [[7th Infantry Regiment (United States)|7th Infantry]] under Major [[Zachary Taylor]], a troop of Indiana Rangers, and a company of scouts.<ref name=A193>Allison, 193</ref>  Hopkins left Vincennes on 11 November 1812 and marched north, following the same route [[William Henry Harrison]] had taken in 1811.\n\nWhen the army reached the site of the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]], they found that some of the United States' dead had been [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and [[Scalping|scalped]].

It has been nicknamed \"'''Spur's Defeat'''\", which is thought to refer to the [[spur]]s used by the soldiers to drive their horses away from the battle as quickly as possible.  The campaign is sometimes referred to as the '''Second Battle of Tippecanoe'''.<ref name=Dyer>Dyer \u2013 link below</ref>\n\n==Second Tippecanoe campaign==\nFollowing several defeats and massacres in 1812, notably the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn|Fort Dearborn Massacre]] and the [[Pigeon Roost Massacre]], a joint punitive campaign was sent to [[Illinois Territory]] under the commands of Major General [[Samuel Hopkins (congressman)|Samuel Hopkins]] and Colonel [[William Russell (Kentucky)|William Russell]].  Russell, coming from the [[Siege of Fort Harrison]], led a force of Illinois militia and [[Indiana Rangers]], and [[Illinois Territory in the War of 1812|was successful]] in destroying a hostile Kickapoo village on [[Peoria Lake]].  Russell had to retreat to [[Cahokia]], however, when he could not locate the forces under Hopkins.  Hopkins could not get his Kentucky militia to engage, and had been driven back to [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] when the Kickapoo started a [[Grass fire|prairie grass fire]].<ref>Allison, 192</ref>\n\nHopkins was humiliated by his loss, and discharged the Kentucky militia under his command.  He then raised a new army, consisting of three regiments of Kentucky Infantry, one company of the [[7th Infantry Regiment (United States)|7th Infantry]] under Major [[Zachary Taylor]], a troop of Indiana Rangers, and a company of scouts.<ref name=A193>Allison, 193</ref>  Hopkins left Vincennes on 11 November 1812 and marched north, following the same route [[William Henry Harrison]] had taken in 1811.\n\nWhen the army reached the site of the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]], they found that some of the United States' dead had been [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and scalped.
