federal  [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]] in [[Ontario]], Canada, that has been represented in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] since 1997.\n\nThe district includes all of [[Middlesex County, Ontario|Middlesex County]] except the City of [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Thames Centre|Thames Centre Township]], all of the [[Chatham-Kent|Municipality of Chatham-Kent]] north of the [[Thames River, Ontario|Thames River]], and excluding the former City of Chatham, and the Municipalities of [[Lambton Shores]], [[Brooke-Alvinston|Brooke-Alvinston Township]], [[Dawn-Euphemia|Dawn Euphemia Township]], [[Warwick, Ontario|Warwick Township]] and the Indian reserves of [[Kettle Point 44, Ontario|Kettle Point]] and [[Walpole Island]] in the [[Lambton County|County of Lambton]]. The population in 2001 was 105,291, and the area is 5,277&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n\n==History==\nIt was created in 1996 from [[Kent (Ontario electoral district)|Kent]] and [[Lambton\u2014Middlesex]]. It was renamed \"Middlesex\u2014Kent\u2014Lambton\" briefly in 2003 to 2004. The retirement of longtime MP [[Rose-Marie Ur]] in 2006 allowed [[Bev Shipley]], her [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] opponent in 2004, to seize the riding. Shipley has held it ever since, and easily held it in 2015 in the face of the Liberal surge that swept through Ontario.\n\nThis riding lost a fraction of territory to [[Chatham-Kent\u2014Leamington]] and gained a fraction from [[Chatham-Kent\u2014Essex]] during the [[Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012|2012 electoral redistribution]].\n\n==Members of Parliament==\nThis riding has
