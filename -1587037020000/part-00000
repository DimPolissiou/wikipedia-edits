Living from the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] in New Brunswick all the way to the [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]] in Florida. Currently, shortnose sturgeon can be found in 41 bays and rivers along the East Coast. Their distribution across this range is broken up, with a large gap of about 250 miles separating the northern and mid-Atlantic metapopulations from the southern metapopulation. <ref | name=sturgeon_b>National Marine Fisheries Service. (2020) [https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/shortnose-sturgeon]. </ref> There has been a shift slightly with lower sturgeon levels in river systems particularly further south. Modern spawning locations for the sturgeon include areas such as the Saint John River, [[Bay of Fundy]], and the [[Altamaha River]] with noticeable absences in North Carolina rivers. \n\nThe southern metapopulations of shortnose sturgeon are currently found in the Great Pee Dee, Waccamaw, Edisto, Cooper, Santee, Altamaha, Ogeechee, and Savannah rivers. They may also be found in the Black, Sampit, Ashley, Roanoke, and Cape Fear rivers. Shortnose sturgeon were considered extinct in the Satilla, St. Marys, and the St. Johns rivers, but were recently found again in both the Satilla and St. Marys rivers.\n \nIn the northern and mid-Atlantic metapopulations, shortnose sturgeon are currently found in Saint John (Canada), Penobscot, Kennebec, Androscoggin, Piscataqua, Merrimack, Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Potomac rivers. They have also been spotted foraging and transiting in the St. George, Medomak, Damariscotta, Sheepscot, Saco, Deerfield, East, and Susquehanna rivers. On rare occasions, they have been seen in the Narraguagus, Presumpscot, Westfield, Housatonic, Schuylkill, Rappahannock, and James rivers.<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_c>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Because shortnose sturgeon are [[amphidromous]] fish, after spawning most of their time is spent in estuaries and rivers. Shortnose sturgeon rarely spend time in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. However, if the sturgeon do enter marine waters to feed or migrate they stay close to the shore. Shortnose sturgeon are more likely to move through all areas of a river system. Times they remain at sites for an extended period of time include resting and feeding periods.<ref | name=Occurrence_and_distribution_of_shortnose sturgeon_Acipenser_brevirostrum_,_in_the_upper_tidal_Delaware_River> Estuaries. (1987) [https://doi.org/10.2307/1351892] |title=Shortnose Sturgeon |author=Hastings, R.W. |author=O\u2019Herron, J.C. |author=Schick, K. </ref>\n\n[[Critical habitat]] has not been designated for the shortnose sturgeon. This is an area of the conservation plan that is essential to the conservation of the species. Research needs to be done to identify what habitats are critical to ensure the protection of each life stage.\n \nOne area of research for discovering and designating critical habitat of shortnose sturgeon will be the study of foraging ecology and growth of the various life stages, as well as defining the [[benthic]] habitats that support preferred prey. To enhance this understanding, results on the mapping of the benthic organisms will be needed to better define both the available and preferred diets of sturgeon. Probabilistic or generalized linear models or similar approaches used to map benthic habitat should be constructed to help identify the distribution of shortnose sturgeon density. Additionally, obtaining information on nursery areas and characterization of nursery habitat is a major priority.\n\n==Description==\nThe shortnose sturgeon is the smallest of three sturgeon species that are present in the eastern seaboard of North America. It has a cylindrical body and compared to the Atlantic sturgeon, its head and snout are relatively small. Younger shortnose sturgeons tend to have longer snouts compared to their older counterparts. Adult sturgeons have bony plates along their [[esophagus]] that help them crush hard items instead of having teeth.\n \nShortnose sturgeon are cartilaginous with bones only in the skull, jaw and pectoral girdle. It is a [[physostome]] fish, so its swim bladder is connected to the intestinal tract by a special duct. This duct allows for gas pressure regulation through swallowing air or releasing air through the gut. The intestines for shortnose sturgeon are dark and have a spiral valve (important for nutrient absorption), similar to that of sharks and rays. As seen in the image, these sturgeons tend to be generally dark brown to olive/black on the dorsal surface.\n \nShortnose sturgeon tend to consume small [[bivalves]], [[gastropods]], [[polychaetes]], and small benthic fishes based on studies of their gut contents. The most common prey are amphipods, while Atlantic sturgeon primarily consume polychaetes. Some reports have found that female adult shortnose sturgeon feed throughout the year, but a study from the Saint John River found that pre-spawning females rarely had food in their stomachs and likely stopped feeding about eight months prior to spawning while ripening males generally had full stomachs.\n \nSturgeon are often called \"living fossils\", due to their ancient lineage and a fossil record that points to a holarctic distribution. With the earliest reported remains of North American sturgeon dating to the late [[Cretaceous period]]. Sturgeons have bony plates called scutes that extend from the skull to the caudal peduncle and are divided into five rows on the body: one dorsal row, then two lateral and ventral rows respectively. The fins on the shortnose sturgeon are located far back on the body. The pectoral fins are positioned low, while the pelvic fins are along with the abdominal position. Prominent features of the shortnose sturgeon are the scutes, protractile tube-like mouth, and chemosensory barbels. Sturgeon tend to be long-lived, slow-maturing, and spawn infrequently, which have served the species well through evolutionary time but poorly to anthropogenic impacts like overharvesting, habitat loss, and degradation. \n \nPotential predators of the shortnose sturgeon include alligators, sharks, and other large fish such as [[catfish]]. Other known ones include [[sea lampreys]] gar, [[striped bass]], [[common carp]], [[northern pikeminnow]], [[channel catfish]], smallmouth bass, [[yellow perch]], walleye, grey seal, [[fallfish]], and [[sea lions]].<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_d>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17811 Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (''Acipenser brevirostrum'')].\u2029</ref>\n\n==Behavior==\nThe life history of shortnose sturgeon beings with adults that lay their eggs in freshwater and then return to saltwater. The eggs are left to fend for themselves after spawning. As they age, the young fish slowly move to more saline water. Living in fresh or brackish water until they are at least a year old. Males can live up to around 30 years old while females can live to be close to 70 years old.\n \nShortnose sturgeon spawn in moving freshwater water, over rubble or gravel bottoms. Time of spawning varies by latitude and is likely based on water temperatures in the range from 6.5\u201315 \u00b0C; this may be as early as January in South Carolina or as late as May in Canada. The eggs hatch after 13 days, into 7\u2013 to 11-mm-long hatchlings with a large yolk sac, minimal sight, minimal swimming ability, and a strong tendency to seek cover. After another 9\u201312 days, they mature to a swimming larval stage at about 15 mm in length, resembling a miniature adult by the time they reach 20 mm in length and begin feeding. They then drift downstream in the deep channels of the river, remaining in freshwater for the first year of their lives. Juveniles, up to 18 in long, generally move to brackish water, and move with it through the tidal cycle.\n \nAdults mature sexually around 18 to 22 inches in length. Males mature after 2\u20133 years in their warmest habitats or 10\u201314 years in colder climates, and females mature between 6 and 17 years of age (again, earlier in southern rivers). Adults continue to grow to between 3 and 4 ft in length. A male may breed every year or every other year and seldom lives beyond age 30. Females usually breed every third to the fifth year, lying between 40,000 and 200,000 eggs when they breed and can live to age 67. Females spend multiple years with reduced feeding and growth while they are producing the gonadal material needed for spawning.\n \nBehavioral information has been collected and demonstrated differences in the innate dispersal patterns in early life stages of shortnose sturgeon from the [[Connecticut River]] versus those of [[Savannah River]] origin. This research suggested that shortnose sturgeon are likely behaviorally adapted to unique features of their watershed.\n\n==Major Threats to Species and Human Impact==\n\nAlthough there are now about 12,000 adult shortnose sturgeon living within the Delaware River estuary, the population faces serious human-induced threats.<ref | name=Shortnose_Sturgeon_The_Delaware_River> Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey. (2020) [http://www.conservewildlifenj.org/species/spotlight/sturgeon/] |author=Bowers-Altman, Jeanette </ref> Water quality contaminants such as endocrine distributing chemicals (EDCs) have been linked to reproductive and developmental disorders in many fish species. These contaminants were found in shortnose sturgeon tissue collected in 2001 and include PCDDs/TCDFs, DDE, PCBs, and cadmium. Other threats to Delaware River shortnose sturgeon include heavy industrialization and waterfront development. This destruction of habitat can affect the Sturgeon\u2019s ability to travel to freshwater and spawn or can degrade the quality of the habitat.<ref | name=sturgeon_c>The Red List of Threatened Species. (2004) [https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/222/13036088] |title=Shortnose Sturgeon |author= Friedland, K.D. |author= Kynard, B. |accessdate=2020-04-15 |year=2004 </ref> For example, some dams impede sturgeon travel back and forth between salt and fresh water, resulting in the disruption of natural spawning cycles and preventing the reproduction of the already struggling species.\n \nMore human-induced threats include ship/boat strikes, [[poaching]], mortality from commercial and recreational fishing (bycatch) due to high sensitivity to being caught, injury to early life stages from water intake systems, instream construction projects within the spawning area, and dredging, including the ongoing Delaware River deepening project.<ref | name=Sensitivity_of_North_American_sturgeons_and_paddlefish_to_fishing_mortality> Sturgeon Biodiversity and Conservation. (1996) [https://doi.org/10.1007/0-306-46854-9_28] |author= Boreman J. </ref> Additional research has been done to prove that [[algal blooms]], which can be caused by increased nitrogen levels in runoff or other anthropogenic factors, sometimes result in Shortnose Sturgeon die-offs.<ref | name=Saxitoxin_exposure> Marine Ecology Progress Series. (2012) [https://doi.org/10.3354/meps09768] |author=Fire, Spencer E. </ref>Overall, the combination of human-induced destruction of habitat and overconsumption have devastated many species along the Atlantic Coast. The future effects of climate change are not fully understood, however, these could potentially exacerbate many of these struggling populations even further.\n\n==Current Conservation Efforts==\nConservation efforts for the shortnose sturgeon include removing outdated dams from their habitats. The most recent recovery plan was enacted in December 1998,  for the National Marine Fisheries Service National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The stated goal of this plan is to recover populations to levels of abundance at which they no longer require protection under the ESA. For each population segment, the minimum population size will be large enough to maintain genetic diversity and avoid extinction.<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_e>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17811 Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (''Acipenser brevirostrum'')].\u2029</ref>NOAA Fisheries work with conservation organizations, energy companies, states, tribes, and citizens to evaluate barriers\u2014big and small\u2014to improve upon fish passage.\n \nBreeding programs are currently being used to help the dwindling sturgeon populations. The fish are captured and bred to help provide important insight into the physical, chemical, and biological parameters necessary for the optimal growth, survival, and reproduction of shortnose sturgeon in the wild. Captive-bred animals are also used in permanent educational displays that promote public awareness of the plight of the species.\n \nEfforts are also being made to educate the public on the shortnose sturgeon. Scientists are working with students and teachers to learn more about the movements, behavior, and threats to sturgeons. An example of this initiative is the SCUTES program\u2014Students Collaborating to Undertake Tracking Efforts for Sturgeon. It provides lesson plans, educational kits, and an opportunity for classrooms to adopt a tagged sturgeon.\n\n==Original Recovery Plan==\nAfter listing the Shortnose Sturgeon as an endangered species in 1967, the 1998 Recovery Plan was enacted. The goal was to delist shortnose sturgeon populations throughout their range. The plan listed actions that if followed could restore the populations by the year 2024. Each of the population segments could become a candidate for downlisting when it reached a minimum population size that: 1) is large enough to prevent extinction, and 2) will make the loss of genetic diversity unlikely.  This minimum population size for each population segment had not yet been determined.<ref | name=Final_recovery_plan> National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. (1998) [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/15971] </ref>\nTo achieve and preserve minimum population sizes for each population segment, essential habitats were identified and maintained, and mortality, monitored and minimized. This plan has since been outdated and replaced. \n\n==5-Year Reviews==\nA Shortnose Sturgeon Status Review Team collected data and presented a \u201cA Biological Assessment of Shortnose Sturgeon\u201d to the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2010. In their assessment, the team identified aspects of Shortnose sturgeon ecology which requires continued research. Continuing research is needed in areas such as determining population size and structure, modelling larval distribution to identify effects of river manipulation by humans, and enhancing the effectiveness of mass rearing.\n \nThe team suggested the following research projects to be conducted in order to improve understanding of the shortnose sturgeons\u2019 status. Firstly, continue the survey and tracking of adults to gather additional tissue samples and detect changes in population status (abundance, residency ranges, winter ecology, and spawning success). Secondly, determine status of juveniles (an indication of recruitment) and characterize ecology and habitat use. \n \nThis review concluded that the shortnose sturgeon still requires conservation efforts to support populations. The species is still at high risk under the IUCN and ESA listings.<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_f>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010).

Their distribution across this range is broken up, with a large gap of about 250 miles separating the northern and mid-Atlantic metapopulations from the southern metapopulation. <ref | name=sturgeon_b>National Marine Fisheries Service. (2020) [https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/shortnose-sturgeon]. </ref> There has been a shift slightly with lower sturgeon levels in river systems particularly further south. Modern spawning locations for the sturgeon include areas such as the Saint John River, [[Bay of Fundy]], and the [[Altamaha River]] with noticeable absences in North Carolina rivers. \n\nThe southern metapopulations of shortnose sturgeon are currently found in the Great Pee Dee, Waccamaw, Edisto, Cooper, Santee, Altamaha, Ogeechee, and Savannah rivers. They may also be found in the Black, Sampit, Ashley, Roanoke, and Cape Fear rivers. Shortnose sturgeon were considered extinct in the Satilla, St. Marys, and the St. Johns rivers, but were recently found again in both the Satilla and St. Marys rivers.\n \nIn the northern and mid-Atlantic metapopulations, shortnose sturgeon are currently found in Saint John (Canada), Penobscot, Kennebec, Androscoggin, Piscataqua, Merrimack, Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Potomac rivers. They have also been spotted foraging and transiting in the St. George, Medomak, Damariscotta, Sheepscot, Saco, Deerfield, East, and Susquehanna rivers. On rare occasions, they have been seen in the Narraguagus, Presumpscot, Westfield, Housatonic, Schuylkill, Rappahannock, and James rivers.<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_c>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  (2010). [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17811 Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (''Acipenser brevirostrum'')].</ref>\n\n==Habitat==\nShortnose sturgeon live in rivers and coastal waters that run from Canada to Florida. Because shortnose sturgeon are [[amphidromous]] fish, after spawning most of their time is spent in estuaries and rivers. Shortnose sturgeon rarely spend time in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. However, if the sturgeon do enter marine waters to feed or migrate they stay close to the shore. Shortnose sturgeon are more likely to move through all areas of a river system. Times they remain at sites for an extended period of time include resting and feeding periods.<ref | name=Occurrence_and_distribution_of_shortnose sturgeon_Acipenser_brevirostrum_,_in_the_upper_tidal_Delaware_River> Estuaries. (1987) [https://doi.org/10.2307/1351892] |title=Shortnose Sturgeon |author=Hastings, R.W. |author=O\u2019Herron, J.C. |author=Schick, K. </ref>\n\n[[Critical habitat]] has not been designated for the shortnose sturgeon. This is an area of the conservation plan that is essential to the conservation of the species. Research needs to be done to identify what habitats are critical to ensure the protection of each life stage.\n \nOne area of research for discovering and designating critical habitat of shortnose sturgeon will be the study of foraging ecology and growth of the various life stages, as well as defining the [[benthic]] habitats that support preferred prey. To enhance this understanding, results on the mapping of the benthic organisms will be needed to better define both the available and preferred diets of sturgeon. Probabilistic or generalized linear models or similar approaches used to map benthic habitat should be constructed to help identify the distribution of shortnose sturgeon density. Additionally, obtaining information on nursery areas and characterization of nursery habitat is a major priority.\n\n==Description==\nThe shortnose sturgeon is the smallest of three sturgeon species that are present in the eastern seaboard of North America. It has a cylindrical body and compared to the Atlantic sturgeon, its head and snout are relatively small. Younger shortnose sturgeons tend to have longer snouts compared to their older counterparts. Adult sturgeons have bony plates along their [[esophagus]] that help them crush hard items instead of having teeth.\n \nShortnose sturgeon are cartilaginous with bones only in the skull, jaw and pectoral girdle. It is a [[physostome]] fish, so its swim bladder is connected to the intestinal tract by a special duct. This duct allows for gas pressure regulation through swallowing air or releasing air through the gut. The intestines for shortnose sturgeon are dark and have a spiral valve (important for nutrient absorption), similar to that of sharks and rays. As seen in the image, these sturgeons tend to be generally dark brown to olive/black on the dorsal surface.\n \nShortnose sturgeon tend to consume small [[bivalves]], [[gastropods]], [[polychaetes]], and small benthic fishes based on studies of their gut contents. The most common prey are amphipods, while Atlantic sturgeon primarily consume polychaetes. Some reports have found that female adult shortnose sturgeon feed throughout the year, but a study from the Saint John River found that pre-spawning females rarely had food in their stomachs and likely stopped feeding about eight months prior to spawning while ripening males generally had full stomachs.\n \nSturgeon are often called \"living fossils\", due to their ancient lineage and a fossil record that points to a holarctic distribution. With the earliest reported remains of North American sturgeon dating to the late [[Cretaceous period]]. Sturgeons have bony plates called scutes that extend from the skull to the caudal peduncle and are divided into five rows on the body: one dorsal row, then two lateral and ventral rows respectively. The fins on the shortnose sturgeon are located far back on the body. The pectoral fins are positioned low, while the pelvic fins are along with the abdominal position. Prominent features of the shortnose sturgeon are the scutes, protractile tube-like mouth, and chemosensory barbels. Sturgeon tend to be long-lived, slow-maturing, and spawn infrequently, which have served the species well through evolutionary time but poorly to anthropogenic impacts like overharvesting, habitat loss, and degradation. \n \nPotential predators of the shortnose sturgeon include alligators, sharks, and other large fish such as [[catfish]]. Other known ones include [[sea lampreys]] gar, [[striped bass]], [[common carp]], [[northern pikeminnow]], [[channel catfish]], smallmouth bass, [[yellow perch]], walleye, grey seal, [[fallfish]], and [[sea lions]].<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_d>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17811 Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (''Acipenser brevirostrum'')].\u2029</ref>\n\n==Behavior==\nThe life history of shortnose sturgeon beings with adults that lay their eggs in freshwater and then return to saltwater. The eggs are left to fend for themselves after spawning. As they age, the young fish slowly move to more saline water. Living in fresh or brackish water until they are at least a year old. Males can live up to around 30 years old while females can live to be close to 70 years old.\n \nShortnose sturgeon spawn in moving freshwater water, over rubble or gravel bottoms. Time of spawning varies by latitude and is likely based on water temperatures in the range from 6.5\u201315 \u00b0C; this may be as early as January in South Carolina or as late as May in Canada. The eggs hatch after 13 days, into 7\u2013 to 11-mm-long hatchlings with a large yolk sac, minimal sight, minimal swimming ability, and a strong tendency to seek cover. After another 9\u201312 days, they mature to a swimming larval stage at about 15 mm in length, resembling a miniature adult by the time they reach 20 mm in length and begin feeding. They then drift downstream in the deep channels of the river, remaining in freshwater for the first year of their lives. Juveniles, up to 18 in long, generally move to brackish water, and move with it through the tidal cycle.\n \nAdults mature sexually around 18 to 22 inches in length. Males mature after 2\u20133 years in their warmest habitats or 10\u201314 years in colder climates, and females mature between 6 and 17 years of age (again, earlier in southern rivers). Adults continue to grow to between 3 and 4 ft in length. A male may breed every year or every other year and seldom lives beyond age 30. Females usually breed every third to the fifth year, lying between 40,000 and 200,000 eggs when they breed and can live to age 67. Females spend multiple years with reduced feeding and growth while they are producing the gonadal material needed for spawning.\n \nBehavioral information has been collected and demonstrated differences in the innate dispersal patterns in early life stages of shortnose sturgeon from the [[Connecticut River]] versus those of [[Savannah River]] origin. This research suggested that shortnose sturgeon are likely behaviorally adapted to unique features of their watershed.\n\n==Major Threats to Species and Human Impact==\n\nAlthough there are now about 12,000 adult shortnose sturgeon living within the Delaware River estuary, the population faces serious human-induced threats.<ref | name=Shortnose_Sturgeon_The_Delaware_River> Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey. (2020) [http://www.conservewildlifenj.org/species/spotlight/sturgeon/] |author=Bowers-Altman, Jeanette </ref> Water quality contaminants such as endocrine distributing chemicals (EDCs) have been linked to reproductive and developmental disorders in many fish species. These contaminants were found in shortnose sturgeon tissue collected in 2001 and include PCDDs/TCDFs, DDE, PCBs, and cadmium. Other threats to Delaware River shortnose sturgeon include heavy industrialization and waterfront development. This destruction of habitat can affect the Sturgeon\u2019s ability to travel to freshwater and spawn or can degrade the quality of the habitat.<ref | name=sturgeon_c>The Red List of Threatened Species. (2004) [https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/222/13036088] |title=Shortnose Sturgeon |author= Friedland, K.D. |author= Kynard, B. |accessdate=2020-04-15 |year=2004 </ref> For example, some dams impede sturgeon travel back and forth between salt and fresh water, resulting in the disruption of natural spawning cycles and preventing the reproduction of the already struggling species.\n \nMore human-induced threats include ship/boat strikes, [[poaching]], mortality from commercial and recreational fishing (bycatch) due to high sensitivity to being caught, injury to early life stages from water intake systems, instream construction projects within the spawning area, and dredging, including the ongoing Delaware River deepening project.<ref | name=Sensitivity_of_North_American_sturgeons_and_paddlefish_to_fishing_mortality> Sturgeon Biodiversity and Conservation. (1996) [https://doi.org/10.1007/0-306-46854-9_28] |author= Boreman J. </ref> Additional research has been done to prove that [[algal blooms]], which can be caused by increased nitrogen levels in runoff or other anthropogenic factors, sometimes result in Shortnose Sturgeon die-offs.<ref | name=Saxitoxin_exposure> Marine Ecology Progress Series. (2012) [https://doi.org/10.3354/meps09768] |author=Fire, Spencer E. </ref>Overall, the combination of human-induced destruction of habitat and overconsumption have devastated many species along the Atlantic Coast. The future effects of climate change are not fully understood, however, these could potentially exacerbate many of these struggling populations even further.\n\n==Current Conservation Efforts==\nConservation efforts for the shortnose sturgeon include removing outdated dams from their habitats. The most recent recovery plan was enacted in December 1998,  for the National Marine Fisheries Service National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The stated goal of this plan is to recover populations to levels of abundance at which they no longer require protection under the ESA. For each population segment, the minimum population size will be large enough to maintain genetic diversity and avoid extinction.<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_e>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010). [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17811 Five Year Plan for the Shortnose Sturgeon (''Acipenser brevirostrum'')].\u2029</ref>NOAA Fisheries work with conservation organizations, energy companies, states, tribes, and citizens to evaluate barriers\u2014big and small\u2014to improve upon fish passage.\n \nBreeding programs are currently being used to help the dwindling sturgeon populations. The fish are captured and bred to help provide important insight into the physical, chemical, and biological parameters necessary for the optimal growth, survival, and reproduction of shortnose sturgeon in the wild. Captive-bred animals are also used in permanent educational displays that promote public awareness of the plight of the species.\n \nEfforts are also being made to educate the public on the shortnose sturgeon. Scientists are working with students and teachers to learn more about the movements, behavior, and threats to sturgeons. An example of this initiative is the SCUTES program\u2014Students Collaborating to Undertake Tracking Efforts for Sturgeon. It provides lesson plans, educational kits, and an opportunity for classrooms to adopt a tagged sturgeon.\n\n==Original Recovery Plan==\nAfter listing the Shortnose Sturgeon as an endangered species in 1967, the 1998 Recovery Plan was enacted. The goal was to delist shortnose sturgeon populations throughout their range. The plan listed actions that if followed could restore the populations by the year 2024. Each of the population segments could become a candidate for downlisting when it reached a minimum population size that: 1) is large enough to prevent extinction, and 2) will make the loss of genetic diversity unlikely.  This minimum population size for each population segment had not yet been determined.<ref | name=Final_recovery_plan> National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. (1998) [https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/15971] </ref>\nTo achieve and preserve minimum population sizes for each population segment, essential habitats were identified and maintained, and mortality, monitored and minimized. This plan has since been outdated and replaced. \n\n==5-Year Reviews==\nA Shortnose Sturgeon Status Review Team collected data and presented a \u201cA Biological Assessment of Shortnose Sturgeon\u201d to the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2010. In their assessment, the team identified aspects of Shortnose sturgeon ecology which requires continued research. Continuing research is needed in areas such as determining population size and structure, modelling larval distribution to identify effects of river manipulation by humans, and enhancing the effectiveness of mass rearing.\n \nThe team suggested the following research projects to be conducted in order to improve understanding of the shortnose sturgeons\u2019 status. Firstly, continue the survey and tracking of adults to gather additional tissue samples and detect changes in population status (abundance, residency ranges, winter ecology, and spawning success). Secondly, determine status of juveniles (an indication of recruitment) and characterize ecology and habitat use. \n \nThis review concluded that the shortnose sturgeon still requires conservation efforts to support populations. The species is still at high risk under the IUCN and ESA listings.<ref | name=2020_biological_assessment_of_shortnose_sturgeon_f>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2010).

The largest of the islets include Palmerston, North Island, Lee To Us, Leicester, Primrose, Toms, and Cooks. The total land area of the islets is approximately {{convert|1|sqmi}}. The coral reef covers about {{convert|3600|acre|km2}}. The [[lagoon]] is some {{convert|7|mi}} across, covering an area of {{convert|56|km2}}. There are several small passages through the reef for [[boats]], though there is no safe entry for large [[ships]]. At a latitude of [[18th parallel south|18 degrees south]], Palmerston enjoys a [[tropical]] [[climate]] but is exposed to severe [[tropical cyclone]]s. A particularly destructive series of storms occurred during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nAll the islets are wooded with [[coconut]] palms, [[pandanus]], and native [[tree]]s. There is some natural ground water on Palmerston but water captured from rainfall is preferred for drinking. [[Shellfish]] inhabit the reef, and [[fish]] are abundant although there are concerns about [[overfishing]]. 62 people live in Palmerston,<ref name= Martienssen/> all but three descended from [[English people|English]] sailor [[William Marsters]].<ref name= Martienssen>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25430383 | title=Palmerston: The island at the end of the earth | work=[[BBC News]] | date=30 December 2013 | accessdate=30 December 2013 | author=Martienssen, Thomas}}</ref>\n\nThe economy is based on [[fishing]], [[tourism]], [[copra]], and [[feather|bird feathers]], though Palmerston\u2019s extreme remoteness makes a [[cash]] [[Market (economics)|market]] difficult to maintain; in fact it is more like the subsistence ways of life in the northern atolls.

The show is a full-colour version of Laura Ingalls Wilder's series of Little House books.\n\nThe regular series was preceded by the [[Little House on the Prairie (film)|two-hour pilot movie]], which first aired on March 30, 1974. The series began on the NBC network on September 11, 1974, and ended on May 10, 1982. Then it was renewed for a ninth season better known as ''Little House: A New Beginning'' from September 27, 1982 to March 21, 1983\n\nThe majority of the episodes run approximately 50 minutes (not counting commercials, they have since been edited for syndication to accommodate more commercial time). Expanded episodes (90 minutes to 2 hours) have been indicated as such; many of these may not currently be shown in determined areas due to their length.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color1     = #2B640D\n| link1      = <includeonly>List of Little House on the Prairie episodes</includeonly>#Season 1 (1974\u201375)\n| episodes1  = 24\n| start1     = {{Start date|1974|9|11}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1975|5|7}}\n\n| color2     = #B3CF17\n| link2      = <includeonly>List of Little House on the Prairie episodes</includeonly>#Season 2 (1975\u201376)\n| episodes2  = 22\n| start2     = {{Start date|1975|9|10}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1976|3|31}}\n\n| color3     = #7D32B3\n| link3      = <includeonly>List of Little House on the Prairie episodes</includeonly>#Season 3 (1976\u201377)\n| episodes3  = 22\n| start3     = {{Start date|1976|9|27}}\n| end3       = {{End date|1977|4|4}}\n\n| color4     = #005E80\n| link4      = <includeonly>List of Little House on the Prairie episodes</includeonly>#Season 4 (1977\u201378)\n| episodes4  = 22\n| start4     = {{Start date|1977|9|12}}\n| end4       = {{End date|1978|3|13}}\n\n| color5     = #4C1B76\n| link5      = <includeonly>List of Little House on the Prairie episodes</includeonly>#Season 5 (1978\u201379)\n| episodes5  = 24\n| start5     = {{Start date|1978|9|11}}\n| end5       = {{End date|1979|3|19}}\n\n| color6     = #A7005A\n| link6      = <includeonly>List of Little House on the Prairie episodes</includeonly>#Season 6 (1979\u201380)\n| episodes6  = 24\n| start6     = {{Start date|1979|9|17}}\n| end6       = {{End date|1980|5|12}}\n\n| color7     = #AC2102\n| link7      = <includeonly>List of Little House on the Prairie episodes</includeonly>#Season 7 (1980\u201381)\n| episodes7  = 22\n| start7     = {{Start date|1980|9|22}}\n| end7       = {{End date|1981|5|11}}\n\n| color8     = #D98719\n| link8      = <includeonly>List of Little House on the Prairie episodes</includeonly>#Season 8 (1981\u201382)\n| episodes8  = 22\n| start8     = {{Start date|1981|10|5}}\n| end8       = {{End date|1982|5|10}}\n\n| color9     = #F3CC06\n| link9      = <includeonly>List of Little House on the Prairie episodes</includeonly>#Season 9: A New Beginning (1982\u201383)\n| episodes9  = 22\n| start9     = {{Start date|1982|9|27}}\n| end9       = {{End date|1983|3|21}}\n\n| color10S     = #1C1C1C\n| link10S      = <includeonly>List of Little House on the Prairie episodes</includeonly>#Post-series movie specials (1983\u201384)\n| linkT10S     = Movies\n| episodes10S  = 3\n| start10S     = {{Start date|1983|12|12}}\n| end10S       = {{End date|1984|2|6}}\n\n\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Pilot movie premiere (1974)==\n{{Episode table\n|background=#1C1C1C\n|title=30\n|writer=19\n|director=15\n|airdate=20\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|DirectedBy=[[Michael Landon]]\n|WrittenBy=Blanche Hanalis\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1974|3|30}}\n|RTitle= ''Little House on the Prairie''\n|ShortSummary= Charles and Caroline Ingalls ([[Michael Landon]] and [[Karen Grassle]]) move with their three young daughters, Mary, Laura, and Carrie ([[Melissa Sue Anderson]], [[Melissa Gilbert]], and [[Lindsay Greenbush]]) from the big woods of [[Wisconsin]] to the open prairies of [[Kansas]].

Charles and Jonathan unexpectedly win the freighting contract, but, as they celebrate and make big plans, they realize that it would involve them not seeing their families for long stretches of time, so they refuse the contract. When Laura's new strategy does not work, her Ma persuades her that she should be true to her real self. Eventually, Jimmy does notice her as a girl, and Laura has her first kiss with a boy.\n \n''Note'': Michael Landon appears with a pronounced limp and a dressing on his left foot.

Meanwhile, Charles gives Albert a different lesson in cheating...cheating within the heart, as he is trying to barely pass or make just fair/satisfactory grades in school to be more popular. Andy, though, does improve his grades abruptly by cheating, but Laura sees him doing so during a test. Soon after, Laura walks into Andy's house and catches him red-handed stealing his mom's test while the parents are away at Sleepy Eye to shop. Laura keeps the secret from his parents, but tells her dad, Charles. He takes Andy fishing and in a friendly manner talks him into owning up to what he did. Andy confesses in front of the entire class and Mrs. Olesen (who walked in on the class and is on the school board and insists on offering an award to the best student, whom she presumes will be her daughter Nellie).

When Lassiter arrives to claim the town, he finds all the town buildings dynamited, and the townsfolk leave to start new lives elsewhere, as many of them have done before. He is forced to relent, however, when he is told that the leaders and businessmen of other nearby towns, having heard what happened in Walnut Grove, announce they will do the same thing.

Nellie does not help him learn to study but instead shows him an even \"better\" way to succeed by cheating, which she has also been doing. Meanwhile, Charles gives Albert a different lesson in cheating...cheating within the heart, as he is trying to barely pass or make just fair/satisfactory grades in school to be more popular. Andy, though, does improve his grades abruptly by cheating, but Laura sees him doing so during a test. Soon after, Laura walks into Andy's house and catches him red-handed stealing his mom's test while the parents are away at Sleepy Eye to shop. Laura keeps the secret from his parents, but tells her dad, Charles. He takes Andy fishing and in a friendly manner talks him into owning up to what he did. Andy confesses in front of the entire class and Mrs. Olesen (who walked in on the class and is on the school board and insists on offering an award to the best student, whom she presumes will be her daughter Nellie). Class is dismissed and everyone but Andy and his mom leave, but a moment later, Laura walks back in and speaks up about what Nellie had done to Andy. The next day for the final exams, Mrs. Garvey forces Nellie to remove her jacket she uses to hide cheat sheets. Nellie passes but not with the excellent grades she and her mom are used to her having. Andy also does pretty well on the final on his own with a higher grade than Nellie. Mrs Olesen meanwhile was awarding a blue ribbon to the best student that she expected to be her daughter Nellie, but Albert wins it instead. Mrs. Olesen is upset and Mrs. Garvey reveals why Nellie's final exam was so much lower than her other work. When Mrs. Olesen finds out Nellie had been cheating a funny ending happens as she chases Nellie out of the schoolhouse with the other kids as well as Mrs. Garvey getting the last laugh. \n|LineColor=4C1B76\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=102\n|EpisodeNumber2=12\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1978|11|27}}\n|WrittenBy={{StoryTeleplay|t= John T.

The blind school either has to find a new location or has to close. The congregation members in Walnut Grove agree to the Reverend's suggestion that the house become a new school for the blind. The school was to merge with another blind school in Kansas which would not bring their small staff but would still retain their matron, a woman by the name of Mrs. Terhune.
