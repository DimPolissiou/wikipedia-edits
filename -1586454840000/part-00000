The architect was Alexander Longfellow, a nephew of the poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. Also involved in the library's construction was John Coombs, father of George and Albert. Despite the occasional flood, town offices were eventually established in the library's basement.<ref>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.41</ref> The flooding was partly caused by the blockage of Cleaves Brook (where today's police station is) \u2014 which formerly drained the whole center of town \u2014 when Brickyard Hollow was filled in.\n\nDirectly across the street from the library stood the Dumphy house and barn. These were auctioned off in 1921, creating more public space in Centervale.<ref>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M.

On the left (number 146) is formerly that of Captain Joseph Drinkwater and his wife, Anna. The house was built in 1844, and his family owned it until 1873. Captain Sumner Drinkwater purchased it in 1902, and it remained in his family until 1979, ending 107 consecutive years of Drinkwater ownership.<ref name=gaertner/> Next, on the right, is 161, once the home of Samuel Allen Prince.

Upon Reuben's death, the house passed to his son, Harlan, and remained in his family until his death.

First, an 1817-built house on the left, is formerly that of Mrs. Drinkwater. Next, beyond Burbank Lane, at 38 Larrabee's Landing Road, is the former home of Mrs. Bucknam. The original part of the house dates from 1835 and is believed to have been expanded by William Bucknam for his mother. It later became the home of New Hampshire natives Nelson and Fannie Burbank, for whom Burbank Lane was built. They owned and operated Burbank Farm from 1913 to 1936. The house of Charles Bucknam, at number 68, is the final home before Royall Point Road. It was built in 1835. \n\nThe only house originally on Royall Point Road was the [[farmhouse]] at the current number 70. Nearby Callen Point was where Captain Walter Gendall (d. 1688),<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002070890232;view=1up;seq=37 \"Captain Walter Gendall: A Biographical Sketch\"] - Doctor Charles E.

For several years it had become a favorite camping spot for the villagers and the inhabitants of the inland parts of the town who came here for [[clam bake]]s and picnics. The town road ended at the John Allen Drinkwater barn, and here a large gate opened into the pasture which included the two points now known as Princes and Sunset Points. Captain Rotheus Drinkwater also had a home a stone's throw away. Captain John Cleaves fenced off a spot on his farm, at today's number 581, for the same purpose.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nThe first cottage was built in 1884. It was later known as Battery Point Cottage. Others soon built nearby, including Dr. Herbert A. Merrill, Leone R. Cook, George H. Jefferds, Thomas and Nellie Johnston and Wilfred W. Dunn. The first to take up a lot on the western promontory now known as Sunset Point was Samuel O. Carruthers.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1894 a wharf was built, and the steamer ''Madeline'' made two trips daily from Portland, stopping off at the Cumberland and Falmouth Foresides. The short-lived electric railroad running the same route forced the discontinuation of the service.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1899, a four-story hotel of about thirty rooms, named Gem of the Bay, was built on Princes Point by Cornelius Harris.<ref name=rowe1936/> It was destroyed by fire in October 1900 after two seasons in business.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\n==Drinkwater Point==\nNamed for Captain Theophilus Drinkwater, son of Allen and Hannah Drinkwater.

Bucknam wed Caroline Pierce Drinkwater in 1843 and they had five children together \u2014 Nicholas, Clarence Leland, Caroline Augusta, Clarence Loraine and James M., Jr. They were married for 26 years, until 1869, Caroline's death.

The oldest remaining church, the [[North Yarmouth and Freeport Baptist Meetinghouse]], was built in 1796.\n\nThree of these historic churches are located on Main Street; they are (from east to west):\n\n===First Universalist===\n[[Image:Central_Parish_Yarmouth.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Central Parish Church|First Universalist]]]]\n\nThe [[Central Parish Church|First Universalist]] (formerly known as the Central Parish Church) is located at 97 Main Street. It was built in 1860 for an Orthodox Congregational parish, and is one of the state's few surviving churches designed by architect Thomas Holt. It became its current denomination ([[Unitarian Universalist Association]]) in 1886. It became listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> The site was formerly occupied by Jenks's Tavern.\n\n===First Parish Congregational===\n[[File:First Parish Yarmouth Maine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[First Parish Congregational Church]]]]\n\nThe [[First Parish Congregational Church|First Parish Congregational]], at 116 Main Street, was built in 1867. It was designed by Portland architect [[George M. Harding]], and it is the third incarnation of churches built for the town's Congregationalists. [[Charles Augustus Aiken]] was ordained a pastor here in 1854.\n\nThe First Parish Congregational was originally known as the Meeting House Under the Ledge and was located facing [[Casco Bay]] at the intersection of Route 88 and Gilman Road. It was built from material floated down the Royal River from the First Falls and hauled up by [[ox]]en from Larrabee's Landing (named for Benjamin and Thomas Larrabee, two brothers who settled there in the 1720s), further down Gilman Road towards Cousins Island. The path down to the water still exists. The landing was one of the most important in Yarmouth up until the late 1870s, when erosion caused the whole thing to slide into the channel. The Ledge church, which was founded on November 18, 1730, was torn down in 1836<!--Images of America: Yarmouth states it was 1833-->, sixteen years after it was abandoned by the Parish. Yarmouth's early [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] fired one minister because he suggested that many people are worthy of salvation. [[Reverend]] Tristram Gilman, on the other hand, declared in a sermon that [[Thomas Jefferson]] was the [[Antichrist]].<ref name=\"Hall\"/> Of a settlement that originally contained a school, a tavern and a cemetery of Indian fighters, only the cemetery and the ledge doorstep of the church remain. The weathervane, which was the final addition to the steeple, was mounted in 1838 as a shipping guide on an iron rod atop the ledge overlooking the \"Old Ledge\" Meeting House by a group of Yarmouth residents. They had raised funds to buy the weathervane from Solomon Winslow, who had removed it from the site after the building's demolition. The weathervane is now on display at the Yarmouth History Center, but its old supports still exist up in the woods beside Route 88. They are passed by the [[West Side Trail]].<ref>[http://www.yarmouthmehistory.org/about-the-weathervane/ \"About the Weathervane\"] - Yarmouth Historical Society's website</ref> A second, larger cemetery, known as Ledge Cemetery, was established in 1770.\n\nTristram Gilman died in 1809. [[Francis Brown (1784\u20131820)|Francis Brown]], an 1805 graduate of [[Dartmouth College]] and later its president, was invited to preach before the Congregational church. Brown accepted the position of pastor, with the proviso that the church, which had been in use for nearly eighty years, be discontinued.<ref name=Aldredge>''Yarmouth Revisited'', Amy Aldredge</ref> The second church (known as ''Old Sloop'') was built in 1818, at the eastern corner of Main and Bridge Streets (at present-day 121 Main Street), but it was abandoned in 1868 and torn down in 1879. (Lorenzo L. Shaw later lived here in a carriage house, but it burned down in a fire in 1967.) Brown married Elizabeth Gilman, the eldest daughter of his predecessor. Their son was [[Samuel Gilman Brown]]. Samuel's son, another [[Francis Brown (theologian)|Francis Brown]], was a [[theologian]].\n\nThose who were against the building of the new church incorporated themselves as the Chapel Religious Society.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\nThe present church was built on the other side of Main Street in 1867 and [[dedication|dedicated]] the following year.

It has been twice altered: by Samuel Melcher in 1825 and by Anthony Raymond twelve years later. It ceased being used as a church in 1889, when its congregation moved to the structure now on Main Street. The 1805 bell was transferred to the new home. The meeting house was unused for less than a year. It was purchased for $1,000 and converted into the town's first library and antiquarian society and known as Yarmouth Memorial Hall. It was donated to the town in 1910 and used for town meetings until 1946, at which point they were moved to the Log Cabin on Main Street. During [[World War II]], the [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]] was used an airplane-spotting outlook post in the [[Civil defense|Civil Defense System]]. Twelve townsfolk per day manned the tower in two-hour shifts. In 1946, the Village Improvement Society (founded in 1911) agreed to maintain the interior of the meeting house. In 2001, the town and the society restored the building, from its granite foundation to the barrel-vaulted ceiling.

Despite the occasional flood, town offices were eventually established in the library's basement.<ref>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M.

(Cutter was succeeded in the role by Englishman Nicholas Loring, who is buried in the Ledge cemetery.) Perez B. Loring lived there in the mid-19th century.

Its barn is mid-19th century.<ref name=gaertner/>\n\nMoving east, crossing Princes Point Road, eight historic homes exist in the stretch leading up to Cousins Island. On the left (number 146) is formerly that of Captain Joseph Drinkwater and his wife, Anna. The house was built in 1844, and his family owned it until 1873. Captain Sumner Drinkwater purchased it in 1902, and it remained in his family until 1979, ending 107 consecutive years of Drinkwater ownership.<ref name=gaertner/> Next, on the right, is 161, once the home of Samuel Allen Prince.

Upon Reuben's death, the house passed to his son, Harlan, and remained in his family until his death. Arthur and Josie Fels bought the homestead in 1907.\n\n==Larrabee's Landing==\n[[File:Charles_Bucknam_House.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|The former home of Charles Bucknam at 68 Larrabee's Landing]]\n[[File:Larrabees_Landing.jpeg|thumb|150px|right|Larrabee's Landing looking east, with Callen Point on the right]]\nThree homes exist around the Gilman and Larrabee's Landing Road triangle. First, an 1817-built house on the left, is formerly that of Mrs. Drinkwater. Next, beyond Burbank Lane, at 38 Larrabee's Landing Road, is the former home of Mrs. Bucknam. The original part of the house dates from 1835 and is believed to have been expanded by William Bucknam for his mother. It later became the home of New Hampshire natives Nelson and Fannie Burbank, for whom Burbank Lane was built. They owned and operated Burbank Farm from 1913 to 1936. The house of Charles Bucknam, at number 68, is the final home before Royall Point Road. It was built in 1835. \n\nThe only house originally on Royall Point Road was the [[farmhouse]] at the current number 70. Nearby Callen Point was where Captain Walter Gendall (d. 1688),<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002070890232;view=1up;seq=37 \"Captain Walter Gendall: A Biographical Sketch\"] - Doctor Charles E.

For several years it had become a favorite camping spot for the villagers and the inhabitants of the inland parts of the town who came here for [[clam bake]]s and picnics. The town road ended at the John Allen Drinkwater barn, and here a large gate opened into the pasture which included the two points now known as Princes and Sunset Points. Captain Rotheus Drinkwater also had a home a stone's throw away. Captain John Cleaves fenced off a spot on his farm, at today's number 581, for the same purpose.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nThe first cottage was built in 1884. It was later known as Battery Point Cottage. Others soon built nearby, including Dr. Herbert A. Merrill, Leone R. Cook, George H. Jefferds, Thomas and Nellie Johnston and Wilfred W. Dunn. The first to take up a lot on the western promontory now known as Sunset Point was Samuel O. Carruthers.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1894 a wharf was built, and the steamer ''Madeline'' made two trips daily from Portland, stopping off at the Cumberland and Falmouth Foresides. The short-lived electric railroad running the same route forced the discontinuation of the service.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1899, a four-story hotel of about thirty rooms, named Gem of the Bay, was built on Princes Point by Cornelius Harris.<ref name=rowe1936/> It was destroyed by fire in October 1900 after two seasons in business.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\n==Drinkwater Point==\nNamed for Captain Theophilus Drinkwater, son of Allen and Hannah Drinkwater.

Bucknam wed Caroline Pierce Drinkwater in 1843 and they had five children together \u2014 Nicholas, Clarence Leland, Caroline Augusta, Clarence Loraine and James M., Jr. They were married for 26 years, until 1869, Caroline's death.

The oldest remaining church, the [[North Yarmouth and Freeport Baptist Meetinghouse]], was built in 1796.\n\nThree of these historic churches are located on Main Street; they are (from east to west):\n\n===First Universalist===\n[[Image:Central_Parish_Yarmouth.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Central Parish Church|First Universalist]]]]\n\nThe [[Central Parish Church|First Universalist]] (formerly known as the Central Parish Church) is located at 97 Main Street. It was built in 1860 for an Orthodox Congregational parish, and is one of the state's few surviving churches designed by architect Thomas Holt. It became its current denomination ([[Unitarian Universalist Association]]) in 1886. It became listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> The site was formerly occupied by Jenks's Tavern.\n\n===First Parish Congregational===\n[[File:First Parish Yarmouth Maine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[First Parish Congregational Church]]]]\n\nThe [[First Parish Congregational Church|First Parish Congregational]], at 116 Main Street, was built in 1867. It was designed by Portland architect [[George M. Harding]], and it is the third incarnation of churches built for the town's Congregationalists. [[Charles Augustus Aiken]] was ordained a pastor here in 1854.\n\nThe First Parish Congregational was originally known as the Meeting House Under the Ledge and was located facing [[Casco Bay]] at the intersection of Route 88 and Gilman Road. It was built from material floated down the Royal River from the First Falls and hauled up by [[ox]]en from Larrabee's Landing (named for Benjamin and Thomas Larrabee, two brothers who settled there in the 1720s), further down Gilman Road towards Cousins Island. The path down to the water still exists. The landing was one of the most important in Yarmouth up until the late 1870s, when erosion caused the whole thing to slide into the channel. The Ledge church, which was founded on November 18, 1730, was torn down in 1836<!--Images of America: Yarmouth states it was 1833-->, sixteen years after it was abandoned by the Parish. Yarmouth's early [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] fired one minister because he suggested that many people are worthy of salvation. [[Reverend]] Tristram Gilman, on the other hand, declared in a sermon that [[Thomas Jefferson]] was the [[Antichrist]].<ref name=\"Hall\"/> Of a settlement that originally contained a school, a tavern and a cemetery of Indian fighters, only the cemetery and the ledge doorstep of the church remain. The weathervane, which was the final addition to the steeple, was mounted in 1838 as a shipping guide on an iron rod atop the ledge overlooking the \"Old Ledge\" Meeting House by a group of Yarmouth residents. They had raised funds to buy the weathervane from Solomon Winslow, who had removed it from the site after the building's demolition. The weathervane is now on display at the Yarmouth History Center, but its old supports still exist up in the woods beside Route 88. They are passed by the [[West Side Trail]].<ref>[http://www.yarmouthmehistory.org/about-the-weathervane/ \"About the Weathervane\"] - Yarmouth Historical Society's website</ref> A second, larger cemetery, known as Ledge Cemetery, was established in 1770.\n\nTristram Gilman died in 1809. [[Francis Brown (1784\u20131820)|Francis Brown]], an 1805 graduate of [[Dartmouth College]] and later its president, was invited to preach before the Congregational church. Brown accepted the position of pastor, with the proviso that the church, which had been in use for nearly eighty years, be discontinued.<ref name=Aldredge>''Yarmouth Revisited'', Amy Aldredge</ref> The second church (known as ''Old Sloop'') was built in 1818, at the eastern corner of Main and Bridge Streets (at present-day 121 Main Street), but it was abandoned in 1868 and torn down in 1879. (Lorenzo L. Shaw later lived here in a carriage house, but it burned down in a fire in 1967.) Brown married Elizabeth Gilman, the eldest daughter of his predecessor. Their son was [[Samuel Gilman Brown]]. Samuel's son, another [[Francis Brown (theologian)|Francis Brown]], was a [[theologian]].\n\nThose who were against the building of the new church incorporated themselves as the Chapel Religious Society.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\nThe present church was built on the other side of Main Street in 1867 and [[dedication|dedicated]] the following year.

It has been twice altered: by Samuel Melcher in 1825 and by Anthony Raymond twelve years later. It ceased being used as a church in 1889, when its congregation moved to the structure now on Main Street. The 1805 bell was transferred to the new home. The meeting house was unused for less than a year. It was purchased for $1,000 and converted into the town's first library and antiquarian society and known as Yarmouth Memorial Hall. It was donated to the town in 1910 and used for town meetings until 1946, at which point they were moved to the Log Cabin on Main Street. During [[World War II]], the [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]] was used an airplane-spotting outlook post in the [[Civil defense|Civil Defense System]]. Twelve townsfolk per day manned the tower in two-hour shifts. In 1946, the Village Improvement Society (founded in 1911) agreed to maintain the interior of the meeting house. In 2001, the town and the society restored the building, from its granite foundation to the barrel-vaulted ceiling. A [[non-denominational]] church service is held here during the town's [[Yarmouth Clam Festival|Clam Festival]].<ref>[http://www.pressherald.com/2011/09/22/steeplejacks-nail-high-spire-act-in-yarmouth_2011-09-22/ \"Steeplejacks nail high spire act\"] - ''Portland Press Herald'', September 22, 2011</ref> The building is owned by the Yarmouth Village Improvement Society and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<ref name=NRHP>[http://www.yarmouthmehistory.org/the-national-register-of-historic-places/ Yarmouth Historical Society: The National Register of Historic Places]</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:37_and_33_South_Street.jpeg|37 and 33 South Street.
