The species often arise from thiation of ketones and aldehydes.  The incipient [[thioketone]]s and [[thioaldehyde]]s undergo [[Trimer (chemistry)|trimer]]ization. One example is [[2,2,4,4,6,6-hexamethyl-1,3,5-trithiane]], or trithioacetone, the trimer of [[thioacetone]] (propane-2-thione).  \n\nThe conformation of trithianes has been well investigated.<ref>{{cite book|title=Multi-Sulfur and Sulfur and Oxygen Five- and Six-Membered Heterocycles, Part 2|volume=21|editor=\nDavid S.
