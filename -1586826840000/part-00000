From there it flows northeasterly to cross the Pennsylvania border just west of north [[Cheat Lake]] on its [[Cheat River]] tributary. Then it flows northerly across southwestern Pennsylvania, taking a bit of a detour northeast 10 miles south of Pittsburgh to approach Pittsburgh from the southeast and its confluence with the [[Allegheny River]] to form the [[Forks of the Ohio]] at \"The Point\" of [[Point State Park]] in [[Downtown Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Geology==\nPrior to early Pleistocene regional glaciation, more than 780,000 years ago, the ancestral Monongahela River (a.k.a. the Pittsburgh River) flowed northward from present-day north-central West Virginia, across western [[Pennsylvania]] and northwestern Ohio, and into the [[Saint Lawrence River]] watershed. One (or more) extensive ice sheet advance dammed the old north-flowing drainage and created a vast lake\u2014known as [[Lake Monongahela]]\u2014stretching from an unknown point north of present-day [[Beaver, Pennsylvania]] for ~{{convert|200|mi|km}} south to [[Weston, West Virginia]]. A river-lake with many narrow bays, its maximum water surface rose to {{convert|1100|ft|m}} above sea level.

The mean depth is about 20&nbsp;ft.\n\nIn southwestern Pennsylvania, the Monongahela is met by two major [[tributary|tributaries]]: the [[Cheat River]], which joins at [[Point Marion, Pennsylvania|Point Marion]], and the [[Youghiogheny River]], which joins at [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]].\n\nMajor tributaries include: [[Becks Run]], [[Big Sandy Creek (Cheat River tributary)|Big Sandy Creek]], [[Buffalo Creek (Monongahela River tributary)|Buffalo Creek]], [[Cheat River]], [[Crooked Run (Monongahela River tributary)|Crooked Run]], [[Deckers Creek]], [[Dunkard Creek]], [[Lick Run (Peters Creek tributary)|Lick Run]], [[Middle Fork River]], [[Paw Paw Creek]], [[Peters Creek (Pennsylvania)|Peters Creek]], [[Streets Run]], [[Turtle Creek (Monongahela River tributary)|Turtle Creek]], [[Tygart Valley River]], [[West Fork River]], [[Youghiogheny River]].\n\n===Locks and dams===\n{{see also|List of dams and reservoirs in Pennsylvania}}\nThe river is navigable its entire length with a series of locks and dams that maintain a minimum depth of {{convert|9|ft|m|1}} to accommodate coal-laden barges.

One (or more) extensive ice sheet advance dammed the old north-flowing drainage and created a vast lake\u2014known as [[Lake Monongahela]]\u2014stretching from an unknown point north of present-day [[Beaver, Pennsylvania]] for ~{{convert|200|mi|km}} south to [[Weston, West Virginia]]. A river-lake with many narrow bays, its maximum water surface rose to {{convert|1100|ft|m}} above sea level.

The mean depth is about 20&nbsp;ft.\n\nIn southwestern Pennsylvania, the Monongahela is met by two major [[tributary|tributaries]]: the [[Cheat River]], which joins at [[Point Marion, Pennsylvania|Point Marion]], and the [[Youghiogheny River]], which joins at [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]].\n\nMajor tributaries include: [[Becks Run]], [[Big Sandy Creek (Cheat River tributary)|Big Sandy Creek]], [[Buffalo Creek (Monongahela River tributary)|Buffalo Creek]], [[Cheat River]], [[Crooked Run (Monongahela River tributary)|Crooked Run]], [[Deckers Creek]], [[Dunkard Creek]], [[Lick Run (Peters Creek tributary)|Lick Run]], [[Middle Fork River]], [[Paw Paw Creek]], [[Peters Creek (Pennsylvania)|Peters Creek]], [[Streets Run]], [[Turtle Creek (Monongahela River tributary)|Turtle Creek]], [[Tygart Valley River]], [[West Fork River]], [[Youghiogheny River]].\n\n===Locks and dams===\n{{see also|List of dams and reservoirs in Pennsylvania}}\nThe river is navigable its entire length with a series of locks and dams that maintain a minimum depth of {{convert|9|ft|m|1}} to accommodate coal-laden barges.

It resulted in a sharp defeat for two thousand [[British Empire|British]] and [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonial]] forces against those of the [[France|French]] and their [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] allies.\n\nIn 1817, the Pennsylvania legislature authorized the Monongahela Navigation Company to build 16 dams with bypass [[lock (water transport)|locks]] to create a river transportation system between Pittsburgh and the area that would later become West Virginia.<ref>[http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead&cc=ascead&rgn=main&view=text&didno=US-PPiU-dar193741 Monongahela Navigation Company Copybook], 1840-1897, DAR.1937.41, [[The Darlington Collection]], Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh</ref> Originally planned to run as far south as the Cheat River, the system was extended to Fairmont, and [[bituminous coal]] from West Virginia was the chief product transported downstream. After a [[Pennsylvania Canal Tunnel|canal tunnel through Grant's Hill]] in Pittsburgh was completed in 1832, boats could travel between the Monongahela River and the Western Division Canal of Pennsylvania's principal east-west canal and railroad system, the [[Main Line of Public Works]]. In 1897, the federal government took possession of the Monongahela Navigation through [[eminent domain|condemnation]] proceedings. Later, the dam-lock combinations were increased in size and reduced in number.<ref name=shank>{{cite book | last = Shank | first = William H. | title = The Amazing Pennsylvania Canals, 150th Anniversary Edition | publisher = American Canal and Transportation Center | year = 1986 | page = 76 | location = York, Pennsylvania | isbn=0-933788-37-1}}</ref>\n\nBriefly linked to the Monongahela Navigation was the Youghiogheny Navigation, a slack water system of {{convert|18.5|mi|km|1}} between McKeesport and [[West Newton, Pennsylvania|West Newton]]. It had two dam-locks overcoming a change in elevation of about {{convert|27|ft|m|}}. Opening in 1850, it was destroyed by a flood in 1865.<ref name=shank />\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Monongahela was heavily used by [[industry]], and several [[U.S. Steel]] plants, including the [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]] Works, site of the [[Homestead Strike]] of 1892, were built along its banks. Following the killing of several workers in the course of the strike, anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] wrote: \"Words had lost their meaning in the face of the innocent blood spilled on the banks of the Monongahela.\"\n\n===20th century===\nThree ships in the [[United States Navy]] have been named [[USS Monongahela|''Monongahela'']] after the river.\nIn October 1930, severe drought caused the river flow to drop below 10cfs, and in some places, it was possible to walk across the river bottom.{{Citation needed|reason=not clear where this info comes from|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe river was the site of a [[List of accidents and incidents involving military aircraft (1955\u20131959)#1956|famous airplane crash]] that has become the subject of numerous [[urban legend]]s and [[conspiracy theories]].
