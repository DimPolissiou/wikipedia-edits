The type was retired in the early 1960s, after 3,970 had been built.\n\nA few were used as flying television transmitters by the [[Stratovision]] company. The [[Royal Air Force]] flew the B-29 as the ''Washington'' until 1954.\n\nThe B-29 was the progenitor of a series of Boeing-built bombers, transports, tankers, reconnaissance aircraft and trainers. The re-engined [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress|B-50 Superfortress]] became [[Lucky Lady II|the first aircraft to fly around the world non-stop]], during a 94-hour flight in 1949. The [[Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter]] airlifter, first flown in 1944, was followed in 1947 by its commercial airliner variant, the Boeing [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser|Model 377 Stratocruiser]]. This bomber-to-airliner derivation was similar to the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]]/[[Boeing 307|Model 307]] evolution. In 1948, Boeing introduced the [[Boeing KB-29|KB-29]] tanker, followed in 1950 by the Model 377-derivative [[Boeing KC-97 Stratotanker|KC-97]].

AAF-contracted modification centers and its own air depot system struggled to handle the scope of the requirements. Some facilities lacked hangars capable of housing the giant B-29, requiring outdoor work in freezing cold weather, further delaying necessary modification.

Interim measures included cuffs placed on propeller blades to divert a greater flow of cooling air into the intakes which had baffles installed to direct a stream of air onto the exhaust valves. Oil flow to the valves was also increased, [[asbestos]] baffles installed around rubber [[push rod]] fittings to prevent oil loss, thorough [[pre-flight inspection]]s made to detect unseated valves, and frequent replacement of the uppermost five cylinders (every 25 hours of engine time) and the entire engines (every 75 hours).{{refn|As efforts were made to eradicate the problems a succession of engine models were fitted to B-29s.

[[Radial engine]]s need airflow to keep them cool, and failure to get up to speed as soon as possible could result in an engine failure and risk of fire. One useful technique was to check the magnetos while already on takeoff roll rather than during a conventional static engine-runup before takeoff.<ref name=\"gardiner\">Gardner, Fred Carl [http://www.oregoncounsel.com/FAAACE/Superfortress.html \"A Year in the B-29 Superfortress.\"] ''Fred Carl Gardner's website'', updated 1 May 2005.

Each was large enough to eventually accommodate a bomb wing consisting of four bomb groups, giving a total of 180 B-29s per airfield.<ref name=\"Peacock1 p87\"/> These bases could be supplied by ship, and unlike the bases in China, were not vulnerable to attacks by Japanese ground forces.  The bases became the launch sites for the large B-29 raids against Japan in the final year of the war.

From then on, the raids intensified, being launched regularly until the end of the war. The attacks succeeded in devastating most large Japanese cities (with the exception of Kyoto and several others), and they gravely damaged Japan's war industries. Although less publicly appreciated, the mining of Japanese ports and shipping routes ([[Operation Starvation]]) carried out by B-29s from April 1945 reduced Japan's ability to support its population and move its troops.\n\n====The atomic bombs====\nPerhaps the most famous B-29s were the sixty-five examples of the [[Silverplate]] series, which were modified to drop [[nuclear weapon|atomic bombs]]. They were also stripped of all guns, except for those on the tail, in order to have a lighter aircraft. The Silverplate aircraft were handpicked by Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Tibbets for the mission, straight off the assembly line at the [[Offutt Air Force Base#Glenn L. Martin Bomber Plant|Omaha plant]] that was to become [[Offutt Air Force Base]]. The Silverplate bombers differed from other B-29s then in service by having [[fuel injection]] and [[Variable-pitch propeller|reversible props]]. Pilot Charles Sweeney credits the reversible props for saving ''Bockscar'' after making an emergency landing on Okinawa following the Nagasaki bombing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n''[[Enola Gay]]'', flown by Tibbets, dropped the first bomb, called [[Little Boy]], on [[Hiroshima]] on 6 August 1945.

Named in allusion to its predecessor, the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]], the Superfortress was designed for high-altitude [[strategic bomber|strategic bombing]] but also excelled in low-altitude night [[incendiary bomb]]ing, and in dropping [[naval mine]]s to blockade Japan. B-29s also dropped the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], becoming the only bomber to ever use [[nuclear weapon]]ry in [[combat]].\n\nOne of the largest aircraft of World War II, the B-29 had [[state of the art|state-of-the-art]] technology, including a [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized cabin]]; dual-wheeled, tricycle landing gear; and an [[analog computer]]-controlled [[fire-control system]] that allowed one gunner and a fire-control officer to direct four remote machine gun turrets.

Budge|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe B-29's advanced design allowed it to remain in service in various roles throughout the 1950s. The type was retired in the early 1960s, after 3,970 had been built.\n\nA few were used as flying television transmitters by the [[Stratovision]] company. The [[Royal Air Force]] flew the B-29 as the ''Washington'' until 1954.\n\nThe B-29 was the progenitor of a series of Boeing-built bombers, transports, tankers, reconnaissance aircraft and trainers. The re-engined [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress|B-50 Superfortress]] became [[Lucky Lady II|the first aircraft to fly around the world non-stop]], during a 94-hour flight in 1949. The [[Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter]] airlifter, first flown in 1944, was followed in 1947 by its commercial airliner variant, the Boeing [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser|Model 377 Stratocruiser]]. This bomber-to-airliner derivation was similar to the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]]/[[Boeing 307|Model 307]] evolution. In 1948, Boeing introduced the [[Boeing KB-29|KB-29]] tanker, followed in 1950 by the Model 377-derivative [[Boeing KC-97 Stratotanker|KC-97]]. A line of outsized-cargo variants of the Stratocruiser is the [[Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy|Guppy]]{{\\}}[[Aero Spacelines Mini Guppy|Mini Guppy]]{{\\}}[[Aero Spacelines Super Guppy|Super Guppy]], which remain in service with [[NASA]] and other operators.\n\nThe Soviet Union produced an unlicensed [[reverse-engineered]] copy, the [[Tupolev Tu-4]].\n\nMore than twenty B-29s remain as static displays but only two, [[FIFI (aircraft)|''Fifi'']] and [[Doc (aircraft)|''Doc'']], still fly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mcconnell.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/842055/b-29-doc-takes-to-the-skies-from-mcconnell/|title=B-29 'Doc' takes to the skies from McConnell|last=Waller|first=Staff Sgt.

Boeing's design study for the Model 334 was a pressurized derivative of the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] with [[tricycle landing gear|nosewheel undercarriage]]. Although the Air Corps did not have money to pursue the design, Boeing continued development with its own funds as a private venture.<ref name=\"Bowers Boeing p318\">Bowers 1989, p. 318.</ref> In April 1939, [[Charles Lindbergh]] convinced general [[Henry H.

The need for pressurization in the cockpit area also led to the B-29 being one of very few American combat aircraft of World War II to have a [[Stepless (aircraft)|stepless]] cockpit design, without a separate windscreen for the pilots.\n\nManufacturing the B-29 was a complex task. It involved four main-assembly factories: a pair of Boeing operated plants at [[Renton, Washington]] ([[Boeing Renton Factory|Boeing Renton]]), and [[Wichita, Kansas]] (now [[Spirit AeroSystems]]), a [[Bell Aircraft Corporation|Bell]] plant at [[Marietta, Georgia]] near [[Atlanta]] (\"Bell-Atlanta\"), and a [[Glenn L.

AAF-contracted modification centers and its own air depot system struggled to handle the scope of the requirements. Some facilities lacked hangars capable of housing the giant B-29, requiring outdoor work in freezing cold weather, further delaying necessary modification. By the end of 1943, although almost 100 aircraft had been delivered, only 15 were airworthy.<ref name=\"iapr22 p144\">Willis 2007, p. 144.</ref><ref name=\"Peacock1 p76\">Peacock ''Air International'' August 1989, p. 76.</ref> This prompted an intervention by General [[Henry H.

This problem was not fully cured until the aircraft was fitted with the more powerful [[Pratt & Whitney Wasp Major|Pratt & Whitney R-4360 \"Wasp Major\"]] in the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants#B-29|B-29D]]/B-50 program, which arrived too late for [[World War II]]. Interim measures included cuffs placed on propeller blades to divert a greater flow of cooling air into the intakes which had baffles installed to direct a stream of air onto the exhaust valves. Oil flow to the valves was also increased, [[asbestos]] baffles installed around rubber [[push rod]] fittings to prevent oil loss, thorough [[pre-flight inspection]]s made to detect unseated valves, and frequent replacement of the uppermost five cylinders (every 25 hours of engine time) and the entire engines (every 75 hours).{{refn|As efforts were made to eradicate the problems a succession of engine models were fitted to B-29s. B-29 production started with the \u221223, which were all modified to the \"war engine\" \u221223A.

[[Radial engine]]s need airflow to keep them cool, and failure to get up to speed as soon as possible could result in an engine failure and risk of fire. One useful technique was to check the magnetos while already on takeoff roll rather than during a conventional static engine-runup before takeoff.<ref name=\"gardiner\">Gardner, Fred Carl [http://www.oregoncounsel.com/FAAACE/Superfortress.html \"A Year in the B-29 Superfortress.\"] ''Fred Carl Gardner's website'', updated 1 May 2005.

From then on, the raids intensified, being launched regularly until the end of the war. The attacks succeeded in devastating most large Japanese cities (with the exception of Kyoto and several others), and they gravely damaged Japan's war industries. Although less publicly appreciated, the mining of Japanese ports and shipping routes ([[Operation Starvation]]) carried out by B-29s from April 1945 reduced Japan's ability to support its population and move its troops.\n\n====The atomic bombs====\nPerhaps the most famous B-29s were the sixty-five examples of the [[Silverplate]] series, which were modified to drop [[nuclear weapon|atomic bombs]].

Tibbets for the mission, straight off the assembly line at the [[Offutt Air Force Base#Glenn L. Martin Bomber Plant|Omaha plant]] that was to become [[Offutt Air Force Base]]. The Silverplate bombers differed from other B-29s then in service by having [[fuel injection]] and [[Variable-pitch propeller|reversible props]].

Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama: USAF Historical Division, 1956, p. 62.</ref>\n\nA Superfortress of the [[91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron]] flew the last B-29 mission of the war on 27 July 1953.\n\nOver the course of the war, B-29s flew 20,000 sorties and dropped 200,000 tonnes (180,000 tons) of bombs. B-29 gunners were credited with shooting down 27 enemy aircraft.<ref name=\"Futrell\">Futrell et al. 1976.</ref> In turn 78 B-29 were lost; 57 B-29 and reconnaissance variants were lost in action and 21 were non-combat losses.<ref>[https://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/Stats/USAF_Losses_Korea.htm USAF losses during the Korean War. USAF Statistical Digest FY1953]</ref>\n\nSoviet records show that one MiG-15 jet fighter was shot down by a B-29 during the war. This occurred on 6 December 1950, when a B-29 shot down Lieutenant N. Serikov.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130604071241/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_315.shtml</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of the mammoth [[Convair B-36]], the B-29 was reclassified as a medium bomber by the Air Force. However, the later [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress|B-50 Superfortress]] variant (initially designated [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants#B-29|B-29D]]) was good enough to handle auxiliary roles such as [[air-sea rescue]], electronic intelligence gathering, [[Aerial refueling|air-to-air refueling]], and [[weather reconnaissance]].\n\nThe B-50D was replaced in its primary role during the early 1950s by the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]], which in turn was replaced by the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]. The final active-duty KB-50 and WB-50 variants were phased out in the mid-1960s, with the final example retired in 1965. A total of 3,970 B-29s were built.\n\n==Variants==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2017}}<!--only one reference-->\n{{Main|Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants}}\n[[File:Bell X-1 in the belly of a B-29.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bell X-1]] and its B-29 mother ship]]\nThe variants of the B-29 were outwardly similar in appearance but were in fact built around different wing center sections that affected the wingspan dimensions. The wing of the Renton built B-29A-BN used a different subassembly process and was a foot longer in span. The Georgia built B-29B-BA weighed less through armament reduction. A planned C series with more reliable R-3350s was not built.\n\nMoreover, engine packages changed; including the type of propellers and range of the variable pitch. A notable example were the eventual 65 airframes (up to 1947's end) for the [[Silverplate]] and successor-name \"Saddletree\" specifications; built for the [[Manhattan Project]] with Curtiss Electric reversible pitch propellers.\n\nThe other differences came about through added equipment for varied mission roles. These roles included cargo carriers (CB); rescue aircraft (SB); weather ships (WB); and trainers (TB); and aerial tankers (KB).\n\nSome were used for odd purposes such as flying relay television transmitters under the name of [[Stratovision]].\n[[File:Boeing WB-29A 53 WRS 1954.jpg|thumb|right|WB-29A of the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron in 1954 showing the fuselage-top observation station]]\n\nThe B-29D led progressively to the XB-44, and the family of '''[[B-50 Superfortress]]''' (which was powered by four {{convert|3500|hp|abbr=on}} [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360]]-35 Wasp Major engines).\n\nAnother role was as a mothership. This included being rigged for carrying the experimental [[parasite fighter]] aircraft, such as the [[McDonnell XF-85 Goblin]] and [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet]]s as in flight lock on and offs. It was also used to develop the [[Airborne Early Warning]] program; it was the ancestor of various modern radar picket aircraft. A B-29 with the original Wright Duplex Cyclone powerplants was used to air-launch the famous [[Bell X-1]] supersonic research rocket aircraft, as well as [[Cherokee (rocket)|Cherokee]] rockets for the testing of ejection seats.<ref name=\"Ala\">Shinabery, Michael.

Several converted B-29s were used to experiment with [[aerial refueling]] and re-designated as '''[[Boeing KB-29|KB-29s]]'''. Perhaps the most important tests were conducted by the '''XB-29G'''; it carried prototype [[jet engine]]s in its bomb bay, and lowered them into the air stream to conduct measurements.\n\n==Operators==\n{{Main|List of B-29 Superfortress operators}}\n\n;{{AUS}}\n* [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (two former RAF aircraft for trials)\n;{{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]] (87 loaned from the USAF as the Washington B.1)\n;{{flag|United States|1912}}\n* [[United States Army Air Forces]]\n* [[United States Air Force]]\n* [[United States Navy]] (four former USAF aircraft designated as [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress variants#Navy P2B patrol bomber|P2B patrol bombers]])\n;{{Flagcountry|Soviet Union|1936|size=23px}}\n* [[Soviet Air Forces]] (three USAAF B-29s made emergency landings in the USSR during WWII, and were never returned; they were reverse-engineered to make the Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-4]] \"Bull\" bomber.)\n\n==Surviving aircraft==\n{{Main|List of surviving Boeing B-29 Superfortresses}}\n[[File:FIFI and Doc.jpg|thumb|right|The two remaining flyable B-29s: [[FIFI (aircraft)|''FIFI'']] (top) and [[Doc (aircraft)|''Doc'']] (bottom)]]\nTwenty-two B-29s are preserved at various museums worldwide, including two flying examples; [[FIFI (aircraft)|''FIFI'']], which belongs to the [[Commemorative Air Force]], and [[Doc (aircraft)|''Doc'']], which belongs to Doc's Friends.

Mayo managed thirteen points to Donegal's two goals and eleven, only got on the scoresheet after sixteen minutes when already two goals behind and never led during the match.<ref name=despair_cannot_last_forever>{{cite news|first=Eamonn|last=Sweeney|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/despair-cannot-last-forever-3237022.html|title=Despair cannot last forever|newspaper=Sunday Independent|publisher=Independent News & Media|date=23 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Lyle|last=Jackson|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/northern-ireland/19693260|title=Donegal 2-11 0-13 Mayo|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=23 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=O'Keeffe|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2012/0924/1224324325933.html|title=Donegal's bite was early, deep and fatal|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=24 September 2012|accessdate=24 September 2012|quote=...

[[2016 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|2016]] likewise, a single point against Dublin, though this time after a replay; the drawn game featuring two own goals by Mayo players. In the 2017 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final after a thrilling final, Mayo yet again lost to Dublin by a single point. Mayo have now lost 9 finals since 1989 and have not won the All-Ireland since 1951. They are classed as one of the best modern era GAA teams that failed to win an All-Ireland Football Final.\n\n==Crest, colours and supporters==\n{{dablink|For the current season see [[2016 Mayo football season]].}}\nThe team's traditional colours are green and red. The Mayo jersey will commonly be mostly green, with a thick horizontal red stripe just below chest level. These colours are inspired by \"The Green Above The Red\", a [[Irish rebel music|rebel song]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Spirit of the Nation: Ballads and Songs by the Writers of \"The Nation\" |first=Thomas Osborne |last=Davis |authorlink=Thomas Davis (Young Irelander) |pages=264\u20135 |chapter=The Green above the Red |publisher=James Duffy |location=[[Dublin]] |year=1845 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:COA of County Mayo.png|150px|left|County Mayo coat of arms]]\n\nMayo's current crest is based on the county's coat of arms, which is shown on the left. It features four crosses, each representing a [[diocese]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in Mayo. The Patriarchal or 'double' cross represents the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam|Archdiocese of Tuam]], while the three smaller Passion crosses represent [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Achonry|Achonry]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Killala|Killala]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora|Galway/Kilmacduagh/Kilfenora]]. The [[Irish language|Irish]] root word of the county, ''Maigh Eo'', means \"plain of the yew trees\", and the trees that surround the crest represent this. As well as this, the number of trees is significant, with the nine trees representing the number of [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] in the county. The sailing ship represents the county's maritime history, while the red sea below the green hills represents the traditional \"green above the red\" motif of the county.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.resources.teachnet.ie/vmcmahon/history/crests.htm | work=teachnet.ie | title=History Around You: Crests and Coats of Arms | accessdate=28 July 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729043105/http://www.resources.teachnet.ie/vmcmahon/history/crests.htm | archivedate=29 July 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Mayo GAA crest also features the Irish words ''Cr\u00edost Linn'', which translates to \"Christ be with us\".\n\nMayo's current sponsors are Irish sports store chain [[Elverys Sports]].

Between them, the two teams have more than three quarters of the [[Connacht Senior Football Championship|Connacht titles]] that have been contested.\n\nMayo have an unequalled number of consecutive [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] titles. The Mayo team were champions in 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939.\n\n====Early years \u2013 Mayo's first All-Ireland====\nOne of the great turning points in GAA history west of the Shannon was the 1935 [[Connacht Senior Football Championship|Connacht Final]] when 26,000 turned out to see [[National Football League (Ireland)|National League Champions]] Mayo beat the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland champions]] [[Galway GAA|Galway]] in [[Dr. Hyde Park|Roscommon]]. In the 1936 [[Connacht Senior Football Championship|Connacht Final]] Mayo were leading by a goal in the last minute when Brendan Nestor scored an equalising goal for [[Galway GAA|Galway]] \u2013 he raised the flag himself and caused a riot. However, Mayo won the replay and went on to capture their first [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Title]], beating [[Laois GAA|Laois]] by 4\u201311 (23) to 0\u20135 (5) in the final. The following year, 1937, they were the victim of a Louis Blessing last-minute goal in the All Ireland Semi-Final against [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] in another match that featured a pitch invasion. It ended Mayo's run of 57 matches without defeat. Mayo dominated the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] for six years, but pulled out of the 1939\u201340 league in a grievance over the 1939 semi-final, a bad-tempered draw and replay with [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]. Mayo returned to the competition to win their seventh [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] title in 1941. Unfortunately, due to World War II, the league was suspended for four seasons until 1946, and Mayo were unable to add to these successes.\n\n====1940s and 1950s \u2013 Mayo's greatest ever team====\nFollowing Mayo's 1939 [[Connacht Senior Football Championship|Connacht Final]] victory, it took the team nine years to emerge from [[Connacht Senior Football Championship|Connacht]] again, but they narrowly lost the 1948 [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Final]] to [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] and 1949 semi-final to [[Meath GAA|Meath]]. However, they returned to Croke Park in 1950 to win an extraordinary [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Title]] when [[Louth GAA|Louth]]'s Sean Boyle had his kick-out charged down and Mick Flanagan broke through for a freak winning goal, Mayo winning the game by 2\u20135 (11) to 1\u20136 (9). In 1951 Mayo retained the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Title]], winning their third title overall, with three late points from [[P\u00e1draig Carney]] (known as the flying doctor because he had returned from the United States to play the game) giving Mayo a 2\u20138 (14) to 0\u20139 (9) win over [[Meath GAA|Meath]]. During this period, Mayo also won the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] in 1949 and 1954, their eight and ninth titles in this competition. Eight wides and a one-point defeat in the replayed 1955 [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] Semi-Final against [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] brought this particular era to an end.\n\nMayo went 12 years without winning another Connacht Championship title, until the Mayo team of the late 1960s won the Connacht Championship in 1967 (destroying Galway's 4-in-a-row All-Ireland hopes in the process) and again in 1969. Mayo also added their tenth National League Title to their collection in 1970, beating Down in the final on a scoreline of 4\u20137 (19) to 0\u201310 (10). Despite this success, the 1970s was arguably the least successful decade in the history of Mayo football, as the team failed to win a Connacht Championship title throughout the decade, coming closest when losing the 1975 final to [[Sligo GAA|Sligo]] following a replay.\n\n====1980\u201389: Mayo's return to regional prominence====\nWhile the team had not won an All-Ireland title since 1951, nor even qualified for the final, the 1980s saw a marked improvement in the team's fortunes. A twelve-year gap was finally bridged in [[1981 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1981]] when [[Sligo GAA|Sligo]] were defeated in the Connacht Final on a scoreline of 0-12 to 0-4 at McHale Park, which was followed by a heavy defeat to a great [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] side, 1-6 to 2-19.\n\nNext year, [[1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1982]], brought a heavy Connacht Final defeat at the hands of Galway in [[St Jarlath's Park|Tuam]], and a rematch of the final the [[1983 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|following year]] in Castlebar again saw Galway run out the victors, this time by three points. Mayo had at this stage dropped to Division 2 of the NFL and lost a promotion playoff to Roscommon in early 1984. For the third consecutive [[1984 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|year]], Galway and Mayo met in the Connacht Final, this time in [[Pearse Stadium]], [[Galway]]. The result remained the same, with Galway completing the three-in-a-row, 2-13 to 2-9.\n\nMayo were on the opposite side of the draw to Galway in [[1985 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1985]], and easy victories over [[Leitrim GAA|Leitrim]] (semi-final) and Roscommon in the final, saw them claim the Nestor Cup. The final was notable as it saw the retirement of Roscommon great [[Dermot Earley, Snr]], who was chaired from the pitch by the Mayo players at the end of the match. Dublin lay in wait in the All-Ireland Semi-Final, and Mayo's first championship meeting with the Dubs since 1955 ended in a draw 1-13 to 1-13. The first match saw Mayo player John Finn's jaw broken in mysterious circumstances and tension was high for the replay. However, despite a goal from Padraig Brogan, Dublin made easy work of Mayo in the end, running out winners by eight points, 2-12 to 1-7. Despite this, the year marked as close as Mayo had come to an All Ireland Final since 1955. [[Dermot Flanagan]], [[Willie Joe Padden]] and [[Kevin McStay]] received [[GAA GPA All Stars Awards|All Stars]] in recognition of their performances during the year.\n\nAlthough 1986 saw promotion to Division 1 of the league, the [[1986 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|championship]] campaign ended in disappointment with a Connacht Semi-Final defeat to Roscommon at McHale Park. The [[1987 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|following year]] saw Mayo reach the Connacht Final, going down on this occasion to Galway in a low scoring match, 0-7 to 0-8. [[1988 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1988]] saw the team slide to Division 2, but Connacht wins over Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon in the final saw them reach another All-Ireland Semi-Final. Reigning All-Ireland champions Meath proved too strong for Mayo, running out 0-16 to 2-5 winners, and then going on to defend their title.\n\nThe 1989 season saw former player [[John O'Mahony (Mayo politician)|John O'Mahony]] take over as manager, and after mixed results in the league, an epic [[1989 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|championship]] ensued. After a draw in the Connacht Semi-Final against Galway in Tuam, Mayo won the replay 2-13 to 1-8 in Castlebar, with goals from [[Liam McHale]] and Anthony 'Larry' Finnerty. The final was played in Castlebar against Roscommon and this too resulted in a draw, 0-12 to 1-9. A further 70 minutes in [[Dr. Hyde Park]] a week later also could not separate the teams, with Mayo eventually running out winners 3-14 to 2-13 after extra time. A scrappy game in the All-Ireland semi-final against [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] ended with Mayo as winners 0-12 to 1-6, and was made famous by the iconic image of a bandaged Willie Joe Padden. Mayo's first [[1989 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|All-Ireland Final]] appearance in 38 years was against [[Cork GAA|Cork]], runners up from the previous two seasons. Cork's experience told in the final, and despite a goal by substitute Finnerty in the middle of the second half, Cork ran out winners on a scoreline of 0\u201317 to 1\u201311. All Stars followed that year for [[Gabriel Irwin]], [[Jimmy Browne]], [[Dermot Flanagan]], Willie Joe Padden and [[Noel Durkin]].\n\n====1990\u201399: Fall and rise====\nDespite winning Connacht titles in 1992 and 1993, the early 1990s was a largely unsuccessful period for Mayo, as Connacht football in general suffered a severe drop in standards between 1990 and 1995.\n\nMayo suffered from a hangover of sorts in [[1990 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1990]], and the championship campaign amounted to just one outing, a 2-11 to 1-12 defeat to Galway in Tuam. The [[1990 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|following season]] proved little better, as after big wins over London and Galway, Mayo faced Roscommon in the Connacht Final. A last minute free from long range by Roscommon's Derek Duggan led to a replay in Dr. Hyde Park, which saw Mayo go down by a single point, 0-13 to 1-9. John O'Mahony stepped down as manager at the end of the season, following a dispute between O'Mahony and the County Board over appointment of team selectors.\n\nFormer Dublin player Brian McDonald took over as manager for the [[1992 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1992]] season, which proved more successful for Mayo. Following a first round replay victory over Galway, Mayo got the better of Sligo in the Connacht semi-final and then Roscommon in the final. This set up a first ever meeting with [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]] in the All-Ireland Semi-Final. In what is widely regarded as one of the worst semi-finals of modern times, Donegal beat Mayo on a scoreline of 0-13 to 0-9, before going on to shock Dublin in the All-Ireland Final. TJ Kilgallon was awarded an All Star at midfield at the end of year awards. A player revolt ultimately saw McDonald pushed out, over allegations concerning his training methods, which were said to include pushing a car around a car park.\n\nFormer Kerry legend [[Jack O'Shea]] took over from McDonald as manager for [[1993 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1993]]. Back-to-back Connacht titles were secured in a poor game against Roscommon, which finished 1-5 to 0-7. Humiliation followed in the All-Ireland Semi-Final against Cork, where Mayo went down by 20 points, 5-15 to 0-10. Kevin O'Neill was a rare bright spot for Mayo, and the young forward ended the year with an All Star. Despite the result, O'Shea remained in place for [[1994 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1994]], a campaign that culminated in defeat in the Connacht final by a Leitrim side now managed by John O'Mahony. This was only Leitrim's second ever Connacht title, and prompted O'Shea to step down.\n\nAnthony Egan took over from O'Shea as manager but [[1995 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1995]] proved a low point for Mayo, with relegation to Division 3 of the NFL followed by an unsuccessful championship which culminated in a defeat in the Connacht final to Galway by 7 points in Tuam.\n\n[[John Maughan]], who had achieved some notable successes as manager of [[Clare GAA|Clare]] including a 1992 [[Munster Senior Football Championship|Munster Championship]] title win, was brought in as manager in an effort to improve the team's standing. Maughan was a former Mayo player and [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] officer. He was renowned for the physical fitness regime he imposed on his teams, and the improvements were swift. Mayo won Division 3 of the National League in [[1996 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1996]] before going on to win their third Connacht title of the decade, overcoming Galway in the final. Maughan's side produced their performance of the year in the All-Ireland Semi-Final against [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]], winning by 2\u201313 to 1\u201310, a lobbed goal from 40 metres by [[James Horan (Gaelic footballer)|James Horan]] in the last minute of the game sealing the victory. This was Mayo's first victory against Kerry in the championship since 1951.\n\nIn the All-Ireland Final against [[Meath GAA|Meath]] Ray Dempsey's 45th-minute goal gave Mayo a lead of six points; however a [[Meath GAA|Meath]] comeback, culminating in a last-minute Colm Coyle long-range point, saw the game end in a draw on a scoreline of 1\u20139 to 0\u201312. During a bad-tempered replay \u2013 which included a brawl in which Coyle and [[Liam McHale]], one of Mayo's most influential players, was sent off \u2013 Mayo led by four points at half-time only to succumb to a Tommy Dowd goal, losing the game by one-point on a scoreline of 2\u20139 to 1\u201311. Mayo's efforts saw [[Kenneth Mortimer (Gaelic footballer)|Kenneth Mortimer]], Pat Holmes, [[James Nallen]], Liam McHale and James Horan secure All Stars.\n\nMayo retained the Connacht title in [[1997 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1997]], beating Galway, Leitrim and Sligo in the final. The Galway win was notable as it was Mayo's first victory in Tuam in over 30 years. Mayo went on to reach their second successive All-Ireland Final following a 0\u201313 to 0\u20137 victory over the Leinster Champions, [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]]. However, Mayo again lost out in the final, losing by 0\u201313 to 1\u20137 to [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in a poor game illuminated by the skill of Kerry forward [[Maurice Fitzgerald (footballer)|Maurice Fitzgerald]]. Mortimer was again honoured with an All Star, with only Pat Fallon joining him from the ranks of the Mayo team.\n\nMayo entered the [[1998 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1998]] Connacht Championship as hot favourites, but once more the spectre of John O'Mahony returned to haunt them as his Galway side ambushed Mayo in the preliminary round in Castlebar. Two goals from [[Ciar\u00e1n McDonald]] couldn't prevent a 2-6 to 1-13 defeat.\n\nIn [[1999 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1999]] Mayo returned to Division 1 of the National Football League and another Connacht title (Mayo's fifth of the decade) followed, after wins over [[New York GAA|New York]], Roscommon and Galway in the final. However, Mayo failed to reach another All-Ireland Final falling to Cork 2-12 to 0-12 in the semi-final. James Horan secured and All Star and manager John Maughan resigned after four tumultuous seasons.\n\n====2000\u201309: Success and failure====\nPat Holmes came on board as manager for the [[2000 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2000]] season, but his managerial career got off to a poor start with a first round defeat in the Connacht Championship against Sligo. The National Football League provided some relief however, and when the matches resumed in the spring of 2001 Mayo won their eleventh National Football League title, beating archrivals Galway in the final on a scoreline of 0\u201313 to 0\u201312 courtesy of a late point from substitute Marty McNicholas, in what was the only national final played between the two western rivals. This was Mayo's first national title since the NFL victory in 1970. Unfortunately, league success did not transfer to the championship and Mayo lost the Connacht Final to Roscommon following a last minute goal by Gerry Lohan. The introduction of the qualifier system that year meant Mayo got a second chance against Westmeath. This also ended in defeat for Mayo, albeit after extra time, on a scoreline of 1-14 to 0-16.\n\nThe [[2002 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2002]] Championship again got off to a bad start for Mayo, with defeat in their first game against Galway. Into the qualifiers once more, Mayo fared better this time with wins over Roscommon, Limerick and Tipperary, facing the latter duo for the first time in the championship. In the All-Ireland Quarter Final (the quarter final stage having been added to the championship in 2001), Cork again provided the opposition, Mayo again losing out 0-16 to 1-10.\n\nMayo's failure to win a Connacht title under Holmes and his departure at the end of the 2002 season paved the way for John Maughan's return for a second stint as manager of the team. His first [[2003 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|season]] in charge was not particularly successful however, with Mayo eventually falling to Fermanagh in the last 12 of the championship following a Connacht Final defeat to Galway.\n\nIn [[2004 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2004]], Mayo regained the Connacht title with ease following facile wins over [[New York GAA|New York]], [[Galway GAA|Galway]] and [[Roscommon GAA|Roscommon]], with none of these teams able to finish their matches within five points of Mayo. Mayo followed this success with a surprise victory over reigning All-Ireland Champions Tyrone in the All-Ireland Quarter Final on a scoreline of 0\u201316 to 1\u201309. However, Mayo's form rapidly deteriorated following this win, and the team struggled to see off surprise semi-finalists [[Fermanagh GAA|Fermanagh]] following a replay before losing the All-Ireland Final to Kerry by eight points on a scoreline of 1\u201320 to 2\u20139. James Nallen and Ciar\u00e1n McDonald made the All Stars team that year.\n\nMayo failed to retain their Connacht title in [[2005 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2005]] losing to Galway in the final. A three-point victory over [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] in the qualifiers led to a three-point All-Ireland Quarter-Final defeat to Kerry, bringing to an end Maughan's second spell as manager.\n\nIn [[2006 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2006]], [[Mickey Moran]] became Mayo's first manager from outside the county since Jack O'Shea managed the team in the early 1990s. Moran guided the team to another Connacht title, beating Galway by a point in the final. Following an unconvincing replay victory over [[Laois GAA|Laois]] in the All-Ireland Quarter-Final, in the Semi-Final against Dublin Mayo produced arguably their greatest performance since the defeat of Kerry ten years previously. Even before the game started tensions were raised by Mayo warming up into the [[Hill 16]] end. They were soon joined by Dublin, and some jostling occurred between players and management teams. The match itself was of high quality and resulted in Mayo coming from seven points behind with 20 minutes remaining to defeat favourites Dublin on a scoreline of 1\u201316 to 2\u201312. Ciar\u00e1n McDonald's winning point from under the [[Croke Park|Hogan Stand]] was a particular highlight. [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] again awaited Mayo in the All Ireland Final and for the third time in 10 years they defeated Mayo, this time on a scoreline of 4\u201315 to 3\u20135. [[Alan Dillon]] won his first All Star award, as did [[Conor Mortimer]], joining his brother Kenneth as an award winner. Despite the relative success of the 2006 season, rumours persisted of divisions between Moran and the Mayo County Board and Moran was not retained as manager for the 2007 season.\n\nIn [[2007 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2007]], [[John O'Mahony (Mayo politician)|John O'Mahony]] returned as Mayo manager following a 16-year absence during which he had won a Connacht title with [[Leitrim GAA|Leitrim]] (1994) as well as two All-Ireland titles with [[Galway GAA|Galway]] (1998 and 2001) and in his first season led the team to the National League Final, where they were defeated by [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]]. Well beaten by Galway in the Connacht Final, they exited the Championship in the second round of the Qualifiers at the hands of [[Derry GAA|Derry]] in [[Celtic Park, Derry]], a game in which Ciar\u00e1n McDonald made his final appearance for Mayo off the bench.\n\nIn [[2008 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2008]], after losing the Connacht final by a point once more to Galway, they were narrowly beaten by eventual All Ireland Champions Tyrone in the Qualifiers, 0-13 to 1-9. An injury time point by Peader Gardiner saw Mayo win their first Connacht title since O'Mahony's return, and their 42nd title overall, when they beat Galway in the [[2009 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2009]] Connacht Final on a scoreline of 2\u201312 to 1\u201314. However, defeat to Meath followed in the All-Ireland Quarter Final, 2-15 to 1-15.\n\n====2010\u20132019: Unsuccessful championship pursuits====\n[[File:MacHale Park, Castlebar, Ireland, November 2016.jpg|300px|thumb|MacHale Park in November 2016]]\n[[2010 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2010]] was a nadir for Mayo; despite reaching the National League Final, they were beaten by Cork, and defeat in the Connacht Championship first round by Sligo was followed up by an All-Ireland Qualifier Round 1 loss to [[Longford GAA|Longford]]. John O'Mahony immediately stepped down as Mayo manager following the game. The return of 'Johnno' had promised much, but only a single Connacht title was won in that tenure, and the county suffered a number of poor defeats in the Qualifiers.\n\nO'Mahony was replaced by James Horan for the [[2011 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2011]] campaign. Horan had won a [[Mayo Senior Football Championship]] with [[Ballintubber GAA|Ballintubber]] as manager the previous year. After suffering a scare in London in the first round of the 2011 Connacht Championship, Mayo won that years Championship by beating Roscommon in a rain sodden Dr. Hyde Park. Mayo were underdogs going into the  All-Ireland Quarter Final against reigning All-Ireland Champions Cork, but won by four points. The Championship ended at the Semi-Final stage with a nine-point defeat to Kerry, but the improved performances augured well for the future.\n<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2008/0804/1217628486219.html \"Old habits stand to Tyrone in endgame\"]. ''The Irish Times'' (8 August 2008).</ref> [[Andy Moran]] was subsequently selected at full-forward on the All Stars team.\n\nMayo reached the final of the National Football League in [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2012]], but lost out to Cork 2-10 to 0-11. Mayo retained the Connacht title with wins over Leitrim and Sligo before defeating [[Down GAA|Down]] in the Quarter Final. Facing reigning champions Dublin in the Semi Final, Mayo survived a Dublin fightback to win 0-19 to 0-16 and reach their first final since 2006. Conceding two goals in the first eleven minutes, Mayo lost the [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]] to Donegal by 2-11 to 0-13. Four Mayo players earned All Stars, first timers [[Ger Cafferkey]], [[Keith Higgins]] and [[Lee Keegan]] being joined by Alan Dillon for his second.\n\nIn [[2013 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2013]], Mayo easily won their third consecutive Connacht Championship, defeating Galway by 17 points, Roscommon by 12 points and London by 16 points, in what was a novel final. They gained revenge against Donegal for the previous year in the Quarter Final, running out winners 4-17 to 1-10. A 6-point win over Tyrone saw Mayo return to the [[2013 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]], this time to face Dublin. A close game saw Dublin win by a single point on a scoreline of 2-12 to 1-14.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/gaelic-games/24196065|title=Dublin beat Mayo by a point in All-Ireland football final|work=BBC Sport|date=22 September 2013|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> Higgins and Keegan won their second All Stars, along with a first for [[Colm Boyle]] and [[Aidan O'Shea (Mayo footballer)|Aidan O'Shea]].\n\nEntering his [[2014 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|fourth year]] as manager, Horan guided Mayo to another Connacht title after wins over New York, Roscommon and a final victory over Galway, 3-14 to 0-16. A one-point win over Cork led to Semi-Final match up against Kerry. A fantastic second half performance led to Mayo leading by 5 points going into the last five minutes, however a Kieren Donaghy goal saw the game end in a draw, 1-16 apiece. Controversially, the replay was fixed for Limerick's [[Gaelic Grounds]] due to the unavailability of Croke Park owing to an American Football game taking place there. Another epic match ensued, with the sides once more all square after 70 minutes. Kerry managed to pull away in extra-time, eventually winning 3-16 to 3-13. James Horan stepped down immediately afterwards, having done much to restore the pride to Mayo football, albeit falling just short of winning the All-Ireland. Keith Higgins won his third All Star in a row, with Colm Boyle taking his second and [[Cillian O'Connor]] his first.\n\nMayo began [[2015 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2015]] with new joint managers Pat Holmes and [[Noel Connelly]]. Defeating Galway in the semi-final, a 6-25 to 2-11 win over Sligo saw Mayo win a record-breaking fifth consecutive Connacht title. Another Quarter Final defeat of Donegal saw Mayo matched once more against Dublin in the semi-final. Seven points down with five minutes to go, a Cillian O'Connor penalty helped Mayo force a draw, 1-15 to 2-12. The replay was played at a high tempo, but after an even first half, Dublin pulled away in the second half to win by 7 points, 3-15 to 1-14. Lee Keegan was selected for his third All Star, and Aidan O'Shea for his second. The winter again saw controversy envelop Mayo, as a player protest against the management led to the resignation of the management team of Holmes and Connelly.\n[[File:Flag of County Mayo.jpg|thumb|right|Mayo county flag flying on the day of the [[2017 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|All-Ireland final in 2017]]|280px]]\n[[Stephen Rochford]] was selected as Mayo manager for [[2016 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2016]], and a poor league campaign nonetheless saw the side stay in Division 1 of the league for an 18th consecutive year. Going for a sixth successive Connacht title, hot favourites Mayo were shocked in the semi-final by Galway, who ran out winners 0-12 to 1-12. However, Mayo battled through the Qualifiers with unconvincing wins against Fermanagh, [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] and Westmeath to reach a Quarter Final against Tyrone. In a tight game, Mayo won by a point 0-13 to 0-12. Surprise packets [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] awaited in the Semi-Final, which Mayo won 2-13 to 0-14 to set up an All-Ireland Final meeting with Dublin. The game ended in a draw, Mayo battled back after conceding two unfortunate own goals from Kevin McLoughlin and Colm Boyle. Cillian O'Connor got a 77th minute equalising point to bring it to a replay, the game finishing 0-15 to 2-09\nThe replay ended yet another All-Ireland Final defeat by a single point. Cillian O'Connor had the chance with a free to bring the game to extra time in the 76th minute he missed it. It finished 1-15 to 1-14.\n\nIt took them eight games to get to the [[2017 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|All-Ireland final in 2017]]. A bad start turned into a roller coaster, and after their loss to [[Galway GAA|Galway]] would need extra time in two matches to ultimately end up in the final. After a quick concession of a goal to [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]], Mayo took grip of the final and were in control for most of the first half, leading by a point at half time. However Dublin bounced back and a late free deep into extra time would see Dublin edge out winners, on a score line of 1-17 to 1-16, beating Mayo by a point for the second year in a row.\n\nAnother poor league campaign in 2018 put Mayo to the pin of their collar when a last gasp point by Kevin McLoughlin salvaged a draw against a Donegal side who were relegated in the process by not winning the game. Mayo pressed on towards the Connacht championship, which saw them beaten again by Connacht rivals Galway. Mayo had to take the qualifier route yet again, and despite ruthlessly punishing a very poor Limerick side in Round One, Mayo had to earn a hard-fought win over Tipperary to secure their place in the next draw against Kildare.\n\nIn recent years, Mayo's ability to bounce back from heartbreak would become enough to help them navigate through the qualifiers, but it simply wasn't enough against a rejuvenated Kildare side who won the game 0-21 to 0-19 winners. Stephen Rochford had stepped down not long after the defeat, citing that he \"didn't have the backing of the board\". With a vacant position up for grabs, the process had begun in finding the next Mayo manager for 2019.\n\n'''2019: James Horan's return to the managerial position'''\n\n===1951 curse===\nSince the 1990s, a [[sports-related curses|sports curse]] story has circulated that Mayo will not win another All-Ireland until all members of the 1951 team have died.<ref name=\"it3214371\"/> The supposed cause was that the 1951 champions, returning through [[Foxford]] in a coach or lorry, passed a [[funeral cort\u00e8ge]] without respectfully suspending their boisterous celebrations, and were cursed by either the priest, the bereaved spouse, or a [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]].<ref name=\"it3214371\"/> Folklorist Arlene Crampsie, who conducted interviews in Mayo for the 2008\u20132012 GAA [[Oral History]] Project, found that participants had no interest in the story and regarded it as \"recently contrived nonsense\" spread by the media in the wake of multiple recent near-misses.<ref name=\"it3214371\">{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/the-people-of-mayo-know-the-all-ireland-curse-is-a-contrived-nonsense-1.3214371|title=The people of Mayo know the All-Ireland curse is a contrived nonsense|last=Crampsie|first=Arlene|date=9 Sep 2017|work=[[The Irish Times]]|pages=Sports p.2 |nopp=y|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref> In a 2016 [[TG4]] documentary, the two surviving 1951 players, Paddy Prendergast and Padraig Carney, dismissed the story.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/mayo-all-ireland-winner-in-1950-and-1951-passes-away-1.2518388|title=Mayo All-Ireland winner in 1950 and 1951 passes away|date=2 Feb 2016|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref> Padraig Carney died on June 9, 2019\u2014leaving only Paddy Prendergast as the sole surviving member of that 1951 team.\n\n===Supporters===\nRespected columnist [[Colm O'Rourke]] has likened the Mayo supporters to [[locust]]s\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Colm|last=O'Rourke|authorlink=Colm O'Rourke|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/colm-orourke-lets-start-looking-down-under-for-way-to-raise-our-game-38079557.html|title= 'Let's start looking down under for way to raise our game'|work=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|date=5 May 2019|quote=...Mayo supporters will descend like locusts on the South Bronx, and some mightn't even see the game...}}</ref>\n\n===Player Awards===\n\n====All Stars====\nThe annual [[GAA GPA All Stars Awards|GAA All Stars Awards]] recognise the players considered to be the best in their selected positions in the country in any given year. The awards were instituted in 1971 and Mayo's John Carey was among the inaugural selection in that year. Despite winning only two awards in total during their unsuccessful 1970s period, Mayo have been one of the most successful teams nationally in terms of All Star awards gained, with Mayo players winning 42 awards to date. [[Willie Joe Padden]] and Dermot Flanagan became the first Mayo players to win multiple awards, both winning their second awards in 1989. Kenneth Mortimer achieved the same feat in 1997, as did James Horan in 1999 and James Nallen in 2004. Mortimer became the first Mayo player to win back to back awards, winning in both 1996 and 1997, a feat matched by Colm Boyle (2013, 2014 and again, 2016, 2017),  Lee Keegan (2012, 2013, and again, 2015, 2016) and David Clarke (2016, 2017), and exceeded by Keith Higgins, who completed three-in-a-row in 2014. Kenneth and Conor Mortimer became the first Mayo siblings to win awards when Conor won an All Star in 2006.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Player !!

around [[Ballyhaunis]] and Tooreen. There are 4 Senior hurling clubs in Mayo, who compete for the TJ Tyrell Senior Hurling Championship each year. These 4 clubs are [[Tooreen Hurling Club|Tooreen]], [[Ballyhaunis GAA|Ballyhaunis]], [[Castlebar Mitchels GAA|Castlebar Mitchels]], Westport. [[Ballyhaunis GAA|Ballyhaunis]] are the reigning Senior Champions and have 6 senior titles, while Tooreen hold the most titles with 26.\n\nThese 4 clubs provide the players to the Mayo Senior hurling panel, who take part in the National Hurling League and in the All-Ireland Christy Ring (Tier 2) Cup. Mayo's best performances in the Christy Ring Cup came in 2008 and 2009, when the Mayo side fell at the semi-final stage to Carlow and Down respectively. The Mayo U-21 hurling team compete in the Connacht U-21B hurling championship each year along with Roscommon, Sligo and Leitrim.\n\nHurling at underage level is also expanding in Mayo, with 10 clubs competing in underage leagues and championships in the county. As well as the 6 adult sides named above, 4 other underage clubs have formed in recent years. These clubs are Ballyvary, Moytura, Caiseal Gaels and Claremorris. These 10 clubs provide the players for the Mayo underage hurling development panels. Mayo have development panels at U14, U15, U16 and Minor age-groups, and compete in the All-Ireland 'B' competitions each year.\n\nMayo's most famous hurlers are Joe Henry (Tooreen), who won Railway Cup medals with Connacht in the 1980s, and current dual player Keith Higgins (Ballyhaunis) who played for the Mayo football team in the All-Ireland football final in 2006, 2012, 2103 and 2016.\n\nHurling in Mayo is administered by the Mayo GAA Hurling Committee, which is a sub-committee of the Mayo GAA County Board.\nIn 2016 Mayo won the Nicky Rackard cup beating Armagh 2-16 to 1-15 in Croke Park\n\n===Current hurling squad===\n*[[Manager (Gaelic games)|Manager]]: Derek Walsh\n{{GAA squad start}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=1|pos=Goalkeeper|name=Martin Parsons|club=[[Castlebar

Mayo have in recent times become known for reaching All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Finals only to fall at the ultimate hurdle.

Then, in the eleventh minute, [[Colm McFadden]] seized the ball from the grasp of Kevin Keane and slid it into the net for a second Donegal goal.

[[2016 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|2016]] likewise, a single point against Dublin, though this time after a replay; the drawn game featuring two own goals by Mayo players. In the 2017 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final after a thrilling final, Mayo yet again lost to Dublin by a single point. Mayo have now lost 9 finals since 1989 and have not won the All-Ireland since 1951. They are classed as one of the best modern era GAA teams that failed to win an All-Ireland Football Final.\n\n==Crest, colours and supporters==\n{{dablink|For the current season see [[2016 Mayo football season]].}}\nThe team's traditional colours are green and red. The Mayo jersey will commonly be mostly green, with a thick horizontal red stripe just below chest level. These colours are inspired by \"The Green Above The Red\", a [[Irish rebel music|rebel song]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Spirit of the Nation: Ballads and Songs by the Writers of \"The Nation\" |first=Thomas Osborne |last=Davis |authorlink=Thomas Davis (Young Irelander) |pages=264\u20135 |chapter=The Green above the Red |publisher=James Duffy |location=[[Dublin]] |year=1845 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:COA of County Mayo.png|150px|left|County Mayo coat of arms]]\n\nMayo's current crest is based on the county's coat of arms, which is shown on the left. It features four crosses, each representing a [[diocese]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in Mayo. The Patriarchal or 'double' cross represents the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tuam|Archdiocese of Tuam]], while the three smaller Passion crosses represent [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Achonry|Achonry]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Killala|Killala]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora|Galway/Kilmacduagh/Kilfenora]]. The [[Irish language|Irish]] root word of the county, ''Maigh Eo'', means \"plain of the yew trees\", and the trees that surround the crest represent this. As well as this, the number of trees is significant, with the nine trees representing the number of [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] in the county. The sailing ship represents the county's maritime history, while the red sea below the green hills represents the traditional \"green above the red\" motif of the county.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.resources.teachnet.ie/vmcmahon/history/crests.htm | work=teachnet.ie | title=History Around You: Crests and Coats of Arms | accessdate=28 July 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729043105/http://www.resources.teachnet.ie/vmcmahon/history/crests.htm | archivedate=29 July 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Mayo GAA crest also features the Irish words ''Cr\u00edost Linn'', which translates to \"Christ be with us\".\n\nMayo's current sponsors are Irish sports store chain [[Elverys Sports]].

Between them, the two teams have more than three quarters of the [[Connacht Senior Football Championship|Connacht titles]] that have been contested.\n\nMayo have an unequalled number of consecutive [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] titles. The Mayo team were champions in 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939.\n\n====Early years \u2013 Mayo's first All-Ireland====\nOne of the great turning points in GAA history west of the Shannon was the 1935 [[Connacht Senior Football Championship|Connacht Final]] when 26,000 turned out to see [[National Football League (Ireland)|National League Champions]] Mayo beat the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland champions]] [[Galway GAA|Galway]] in [[Dr. Hyde Park|Roscommon]]. In the 1936 [[Connacht Senior Football Championship|Connacht Final]] Mayo were leading by a goal in the last minute when Brendan Nestor scored an equalising goal for [[Galway GAA|Galway]] \u2013 he raised the flag himself and caused a riot. However, Mayo won the replay and went on to capture their first [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Title]], beating [[Laois GAA|Laois]] by 4\u201311 (23) to 0\u20135 (5) in the final. The following year, 1937, they were the victim of a Louis Blessing last-minute goal in the All Ireland Semi-Final against [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] in another match that featured a pitch invasion. It ended Mayo's run of 57 matches without defeat. Mayo dominated the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] for six years, but pulled out of the 1939\u201340 league in a grievance over the 1939 semi-final, a bad-tempered draw and replay with [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]. Mayo returned to the competition to win their seventh [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] title in 1941. Unfortunately, due to World War II, the league was suspended for four seasons until 1946, and Mayo were unable to add to these successes.\n\n====1940s and 1950s \u2013 Mayo's greatest ever team====\nFollowing Mayo's 1939 [[Connacht Senior Football Championship|Connacht Final]] victory, it took the team nine years to emerge from [[Connacht Senior Football Championship|Connacht]] again, but they narrowly lost the 1948 [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Final]] to [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] and 1949 semi-final to [[Meath GAA|Meath]]. However, they returned to Croke Park in 1950 to win an extraordinary [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Title]] when [[Louth GAA|Louth]]'s Sean Boyle had his kick-out charged down and Mick Flanagan broke through for a freak winning goal, Mayo winning the game by 2\u20135 (11) to 1\u20136 (9). In 1951 Mayo retained the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Title]], winning their third title overall, with three late points from [[P\u00e1draig Carney]] (known as the flying doctor because he had returned from the United States to play the game) giving Mayo a 2\u20138 (14) to 0\u20139 (9) win over [[Meath GAA|Meath]]. During this period, Mayo also won the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] in 1949 and 1954, their eight and ninth titles in this competition. Eight wides and a one-point defeat in the replayed 1955 [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland]] Semi-Final against [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] brought this particular era to an end.\n\nMayo went 12 years without winning another Connacht Championship title, until the Mayo team of the late 1960s won the Connacht Championship in 1967 (destroying Galway's 4-in-a-row All-Ireland hopes in the process) and again in 1969. Mayo also added their tenth National League Title to their collection in 1970, beating Down in the final on a scoreline of 4\u20137 (19) to 0\u201310 (10). Despite this success, the 1970s was arguably the least successful decade in the history of Mayo football, as the team failed to win a Connacht Championship title throughout the decade, coming closest when losing the 1975 final to [[Sligo GAA|Sligo]] following a replay.\n\n====1980\u201389: Mayo's return to regional prominence====\nWhile the team had not won an All-Ireland title since 1951, nor even qualified for the final, the 1980s saw a marked improvement in the team's fortunes. A twelve-year gap was finally bridged in [[1981 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1981]] when [[Sligo GAA|Sligo]] were defeated in the Connacht Final on a scoreline of 0-12 to 0-4 at McHale Park, which was followed by a heavy defeat to a great [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] side, 1-6 to 2-19.\n\nNext year, [[1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1982]], brought a heavy Connacht Final defeat at the hands of Galway in [[St Jarlath's Park|Tuam]], and a rematch of the final the [[1983 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|following year]] in Castlebar again saw Galway run out the victors, this time by three points. Mayo had at this stage dropped to Division 2 of the NFL and lost a promotion playoff to Roscommon in early 1984. For the third consecutive [[1984 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|year]], Galway and Mayo met in the Connacht Final, this time in [[Pearse Stadium]], [[Galway]]. The result remained the same, with Galway completing the three-in-a-row, 2-13 to 2-9.\n\nMayo were on the opposite side of the draw to Galway in [[1985 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1985]], and easy victories over [[Leitrim GAA|Leitrim]] (semi-final) and Roscommon in the final, saw them claim the Nestor Cup. The final was notable as it saw the retirement of Roscommon great [[Dermot Earley, Snr]], who was chaired from the pitch by the Mayo players at the end of the match. Dublin lay in wait in the All-Ireland Semi-Final, and Mayo's first championship meeting with the Dubs since 1955 ended in a draw 1-13 to 1-13. The first match saw Mayo player John Finn's jaw broken in mysterious circumstances and tension was high for the replay. However, despite a goal from Padraig Brogan, Dublin made easy work of Mayo in the end, running out winners by eight points, 2-12 to 1-7. Despite this, the year marked as close as Mayo had come to an All Ireland Final since 1955. [[Dermot Flanagan]], [[Willie Joe Padden]] and [[Kevin McStay]] received [[GAA GPA All Stars Awards|All Stars]] in recognition of their performances during the year.\n\nAlthough 1986 saw promotion to Division 1 of the league, the [[1986 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|championship]] campaign ended in disappointment with a Connacht Semi-Final defeat to Roscommon at McHale Park. The [[1987 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|following year]] saw Mayo reach the Connacht Final, going down on this occasion to Galway in a low scoring match, 0-7 to 0-8. [[1988 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1988]] saw the team slide to Division 2, but Connacht wins over Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon in the final saw them reach another All-Ireland Semi-Final. Reigning All-Ireland champions Meath proved too strong for Mayo, running out 0-16 to 2-5 winners, and then going on to defend their title.\n\nThe 1989 season saw former player [[John O'Mahony (Mayo politician)|John O'Mahony]] take over as manager, and after mixed results in the league, an epic [[1989 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|championship]] ensued. After a draw in the Connacht Semi-Final against Galway in Tuam, Mayo won the replay 2-13 to 1-8 in Castlebar, with goals from [[Liam McHale]] and Anthony 'Larry' Finnerty. The final was played in Castlebar against Roscommon and this too resulted in a draw, 0-12 to 1-9. A further 70 minutes in [[Dr. Hyde Park]] a week later also could not separate the teams, with Mayo eventually running out winners 3-14 to 2-13 after extra time. A scrappy game in the All-Ireland semi-final against [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] ended with Mayo as winners 0-12 to 1-6, and was made famous by the iconic image of a bandaged Willie Joe Padden. Mayo's first [[1989 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|All-Ireland Final]] appearance in 38 years was against [[Cork GAA|Cork]], runners up from the previous two seasons. Cork's experience told in the final, and despite a goal by substitute Finnerty in the middle of the second half, Cork ran out winners on a scoreline of 0\u201317 to 1\u201311. All Stars followed that year for [[Gabriel Irwin]], [[Jimmy Browne]], [[Dermot Flanagan]], Willie Joe Padden and [[Noel Durkin]].\n\n====1990\u201399: Fall and rise====\nDespite winning Connacht titles in 1992 and 1993, the early 1990s was a largely unsuccessful period for Mayo, as Connacht football in general suffered a severe drop in standards between 1990 and 1995.\n\nMayo suffered from a hangover of sorts in [[1990 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1990]], and the championship campaign amounted to just one outing, a 2-11 to 1-12 defeat to Galway in Tuam. The [[1990 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|following season]] proved little better, as after big wins over London and Galway, Mayo faced Roscommon in the Connacht Final. A last minute free from long range by Roscommon's Derek Duggan led to a replay in Dr. Hyde Park, which saw Mayo go down by a single point, 0-13 to 1-9. John O'Mahony stepped down as manager at the end of the season, following a dispute between O'Mahony and the County Board over appointment of team selectors.\n\nFormer Dublin player Brian McDonald took over as manager for the [[1992 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1992]] season, which proved more successful for Mayo. Following a first round replay victory over Galway, Mayo got the better of Sligo in the Connacht semi-final and then Roscommon in the final. This set up a first ever meeting with [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]] in the All-Ireland Semi-Final. In what is widely regarded as one of the worst semi-finals of modern times, Donegal beat Mayo on a scoreline of 0-13 to 0-9, before going on to shock Dublin in the All-Ireland Final. TJ Kilgallon was awarded an All Star at midfield at the end of year awards. A player revolt ultimately saw McDonald pushed out, over allegations concerning his training methods, which were said to include pushing a car around a car park.\n\nFormer Kerry legend [[Jack O'Shea]] took over from McDonald as manager for [[1993 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1993]]. Back-to-back Connacht titles were secured in a poor game against Roscommon, which finished 1-5 to 0-7. Humiliation followed in the All-Ireland Semi-Final against Cork, where Mayo went down by 20 points, 5-15 to 0-10. Kevin O'Neill was a rare bright spot for Mayo, and the young forward ended the year with an All Star. Despite the result, O'Shea remained in place for [[1994 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1994]], a campaign that culminated in defeat in the Connacht final by a Leitrim side now managed by John O'Mahony. This was only Leitrim's second ever Connacht title, and prompted O'Shea to step down.\n\nAnthony Egan took over from O'Shea as manager but [[1995 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1995]] proved a low point for Mayo, with relegation to Division 3 of the NFL followed by an unsuccessful championship which culminated in a defeat in the Connacht final to Galway by 7 points in Tuam.\n\n[[John Maughan]], who had achieved some notable successes as manager of [[Clare GAA|Clare]] including a 1992 [[Munster Senior Football Championship|Munster Championship]] title win, was brought in as manager in an effort to improve the team's standing. Maughan was a former Mayo player and [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] officer. He was renowned for the physical fitness regime he imposed on his teams, and the improvements were swift. Mayo won Division 3 of the National League in [[1996 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1996]] before going on to win their third Connacht title of the decade, overcoming Galway in the final. Maughan's side produced their performance of the year in the All-Ireland Semi-Final against [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]], winning by 2\u201313 to 1\u201310, a lobbed goal from 40 metres by [[James Horan (Gaelic footballer)|James Horan]] in the last minute of the game sealing the victory. This was Mayo's first victory against Kerry in the championship since 1951.\n\nIn the All-Ireland Final against [[Meath GAA|Meath]] Ray Dempsey's 45th-minute goal gave Mayo a lead of six points; however a [[Meath GAA|Meath]] comeback, culminating in a last-minute Colm Coyle long-range point, saw the game end in a draw on a scoreline of 1\u20139 to 0\u201312. During a bad-tempered replay \u2013 which included a brawl in which Coyle and [[Liam McHale]], one of Mayo's most influential players, was sent off \u2013 Mayo led by four points at half-time only to succumb to a Tommy Dowd goal, losing the game by one-point on a scoreline of 2\u20139 to 1\u201311. Mayo's efforts saw [[Kenneth Mortimer (Gaelic footballer)|Kenneth Mortimer]], Pat Holmes, [[James Nallen]], Liam McHale and James Horan secure All Stars.\n\nMayo retained the Connacht title in [[1997 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1997]], beating Galway, Leitrim and Sligo in the final. The Galway win was notable as it was Mayo's first victory in Tuam in over 30 years. Mayo went on to reach their second successive All-Ireland Final following a 0\u201313 to 0\u20137 victory over the Leinster Champions, [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]]. However, Mayo again lost out in the final, losing by 0\u201313 to 1\u20137 to [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in a poor game illuminated by the skill of Kerry forward [[Maurice Fitzgerald (footballer)|Maurice Fitzgerald]]. Mortimer was again honoured with an All Star, with only Pat Fallon joining him from the ranks of the Mayo team.\n\nMayo entered the [[1998 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1998]] Connacht Championship as hot favourites, but once more the spectre of John O'Mahony returned to haunt them as his Galway side ambushed Mayo in the preliminary round in Castlebar. Two goals from [[Ciar\u00e1n McDonald]] couldn't prevent a 2-6 to 1-13 defeat.\n\nIn [[1999 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1999]] Mayo returned to Division 1 of the National Football League and another Connacht title (Mayo's fifth of the decade) followed, after wins over [[New York GAA|New York]], Roscommon and Galway in the final. However, Mayo failed to reach another All-Ireland Final falling to Cork 2-12 to 0-12 in the semi-final. James Horan secured and All Star and manager John Maughan resigned after four tumultuous seasons.\n\n====2000\u201309: Success and failure====\nPat Holmes came on board as manager for the [[2000 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2000]] season, but his managerial career got off to a poor start with a first round defeat in the Connacht Championship against Sligo. The National Football League provided some relief however, and when the matches resumed in the spring of 2001 Mayo won their eleventh National Football League title, beating archrivals Galway in the final on a scoreline of 0\u201313 to 0\u201312 courtesy of a late point from substitute Marty McNicholas, in what was the only national final played between the two western rivals. This was Mayo's first national title since the NFL victory in 1970. Unfortunately, league success did not transfer to the championship and Mayo lost the Connacht Final to Roscommon following a last minute goal by Gerry Lohan. The introduction of the qualifier system that year meant Mayo got a second chance against Westmeath. This also ended in defeat for Mayo, albeit after extra time, on a scoreline of 1-14 to 0-16.\n\nThe [[2002 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2002]] Championship again got off to a bad start for Mayo, with defeat in their first game against Galway. Into the qualifiers once more, Mayo fared better this time with wins over Roscommon, Limerick and Tipperary, facing the latter duo for the first time in the championship. In the All-Ireland Quarter Final (the quarter final stage having been added to the championship in 2001), Cork again provided the opposition, Mayo again losing out 0-16 to 1-10.\n\nMayo's failure to win a Connacht title under Holmes and his departure at the end of the 2002 season paved the way for John Maughan's return for a second stint as manager of the team. His first [[2003 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|season]] in charge was not particularly successful however, with Mayo eventually falling to Fermanagh in the last 12 of the championship following a Connacht Final defeat to Galway.\n\nIn [[2004 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2004]], Mayo regained the Connacht title with ease following facile wins over [[New York GAA|New York]], [[Galway GAA|Galway]] and [[Roscommon GAA|Roscommon]], with none of these teams able to finish their matches within five points of Mayo. Mayo followed this success with a surprise victory over reigning All-Ireland Champions Tyrone in the All-Ireland Quarter Final on a scoreline of 0\u201316 to 1\u201309. However, Mayo's form rapidly deteriorated following this win, and the team struggled to see off surprise semi-finalists [[Fermanagh GAA|Fermanagh]] following a replay before losing the All-Ireland Final to Kerry by eight points on a scoreline of 1\u201320 to 2\u20139. James Nallen and Ciar\u00e1n McDonald made the All Stars team that year.\n\nMayo failed to retain their Connacht title in [[2005 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2005]] losing to Galway in the final. A three-point victory over [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] in the qualifiers led to a three-point All-Ireland Quarter-Final defeat to Kerry, bringing to an end Maughan's second spell as manager.\n\nIn [[2006 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2006]], [[Mickey Moran]] became Mayo's first manager from outside the county since Jack O'Shea managed the team in the early 1990s. Moran guided the team to another Connacht title, beating Galway by a point in the final. Following an unconvincing replay victory over [[Laois GAA|Laois]] in the All-Ireland Quarter-Final, in the Semi-Final against Dublin Mayo produced arguably their greatest performance since the defeat of Kerry ten years previously. Even before the game started tensions were raised by Mayo warming up into the [[Hill 16]] end. They were soon joined by Dublin, and some jostling occurred between players and management teams. The match itself was of high quality and resulted in Mayo coming from seven points behind with 20 minutes remaining to defeat favourites Dublin on a scoreline of 1\u201316 to 2\u201312. Ciar\u00e1n McDonald's winning point from under the [[Croke Park|Hogan Stand]] was a particular highlight. [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] again awaited Mayo in the All Ireland Final and for the third time in 10 years they defeated Mayo, this time on a scoreline of 4\u201315 to 3\u20135. [[Alan Dillon]] won his first All Star award, as did [[Conor Mortimer]], joining his brother Kenneth as an award winner. Despite the relative success of the 2006 season, rumours persisted of divisions between Moran and the Mayo County Board and Moran was not retained as manager for the 2007 season.\n\nIn [[2007 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2007]], [[John O'Mahony (Mayo politician)|John O'Mahony]] returned as Mayo manager following a 16-year absence during which he had won a Connacht title with [[Leitrim GAA|Leitrim]] (1994) as well as two All-Ireland titles with [[Galway GAA|Galway]] (1998 and 2001) and in his first season led the team to the National League Final, where they were defeated by [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]]. Well beaten by Galway in the Connacht Final, they exited the Championship in the second round of the Qualifiers at the hands of [[Derry GAA|Derry]] in [[Celtic Park, Derry]], a game in which Ciar\u00e1n McDonald made his final appearance for Mayo off the bench.\n\nIn [[2008 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2008]], after losing the Connacht final by a point once more to Galway, they were narrowly beaten by eventual All Ireland Champions Tyrone in the Qualifiers, 0-13 to 1-9. An injury time point by Peader Gardiner saw Mayo win their first Connacht title since O'Mahony's return, and their 42nd title overall, when they beat Galway in the [[2009 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2009]] Connacht Final on a scoreline of 2\u201312 to 1\u201314. However, defeat to Meath followed in the All-Ireland Quarter Final, 2-15 to 1-15.\n\n====2010\u20132019: Unsuccessful championship pursuits====\n[[File:MacHale Park, Castlebar, Ireland, November 2016.jpg|300px|thumb|MacHale Park in November 2016]]\n[[2010 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2010]] was a nadir for Mayo; despite reaching the National League Final, they were beaten by Cork, and defeat in the Connacht Championship first round by Sligo was followed up by an All-Ireland Qualifier Round 1 loss to [[Longford GAA|Longford]]. John O'Mahony immediately stepped down as Mayo manager following the game. The return of 'Johnno' had promised much, but only a single Connacht title was won in that tenure, and the county suffered a number of poor defeats in the Qualifiers.\n\nO'Mahony was replaced by James Horan for the [[2011 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2011]] campaign. Horan had won a [[Mayo Senior Football Championship]] with [[Ballintubber GAA|Ballintubber]] as manager the previous year. After suffering a scare in London in the first round of the 2011 Connacht Championship, Mayo won that years Championship by beating Roscommon in a rain sodden Dr. Hyde Park. Mayo were underdogs going into the  All-Ireland Quarter Final against reigning All-Ireland Champions Cork, but won by four points. The Championship ended at the Semi-Final stage with a nine-point defeat to Kerry, but the improved performances augured well for the future.\n<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2008/0804/1217628486219.html \"Old habits stand to Tyrone in endgame\"]. ''The Irish Times'' (8 August 2008).</ref> [[Andy Moran]] was subsequently selected at full-forward on the All Stars team.\n\nMayo reached the final of the National Football League in [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2012]], but lost out to Cork 2-10 to 0-11. Mayo retained the Connacht title with wins over Leitrim and Sligo before defeating [[Down GAA|Down]] in the Quarter Final. Facing reigning champions Dublin in the Semi Final, Mayo survived a Dublin fightback to win 0-19 to 0-16 and reach their first final since 2006. Conceding two goals in the first eleven minutes, Mayo lost the [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]] to Donegal by 2-11 to 0-13. Four Mayo players earned All Stars, first timers [[Ger Cafferkey]], [[Keith Higgins]] and [[Lee Keegan]] being joined by Alan Dillon for his second.\n\nIn [[2013 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2013]], Mayo easily won their third consecutive Connacht Championship, defeating Galway by 17 points, Roscommon by 12 points and London by 16 points, in what was a novel final. They gained revenge against Donegal for the previous year in the Quarter Final, running out winners 4-17 to 1-10. A 6-point win over Tyrone saw Mayo return to the [[2013 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]], this time to face Dublin. A close game saw Dublin win by a single point on a scoreline of 2-12 to 1-14.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/gaelic-games/24196065|title=Dublin beat Mayo by a point in All-Ireland football final|work=BBC Sport|date=22 September 2013|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> Higgins and Keegan won their second All Stars, along with a first for [[Colm Boyle]] and [[Aidan O'Shea (Mayo footballer)|Aidan O'Shea]].\n\nEntering his [[2014 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|fourth year]] as manager, Horan guided Mayo to another Connacht title after wins over New York, Roscommon and a final victory over Galway, 3-14 to 0-16. A one-point win over Cork led to Semi-Final match up against Kerry. A fantastic second half performance led to Mayo leading by 5 points going into the last five minutes, however a Kieren Donaghy goal saw the game end in a draw, 1-16 apiece. Controversially, the replay was fixed for Limerick's [[Gaelic Grounds]] due to the unavailability of Croke Park owing to an American Football game taking place there. Another epic match ensued, with the sides once more all square after 70 minutes. Kerry managed to pull away in extra-time, eventually winning 3-16 to 3-13. James Horan stepped down immediately afterwards, having done much to restore the pride to Mayo football, albeit falling just short of winning the All-Ireland. Keith Higgins won his third All Star in a row, with Colm Boyle taking his second and [[Cillian O'Connor]] his first.\n\nMayo began [[2015 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2015]] with new joint managers Pat Holmes and [[Noel Connelly]]. Defeating Galway in the semi-final, a 6-25 to 2-11 win over Sligo saw Mayo win a record-breaking fifth consecutive Connacht title. Another Quarter Final defeat of Donegal saw Mayo matched once more against Dublin in the semi-final. Seven points down with five minutes to go, a Cillian O'Connor penalty helped Mayo force a draw, 1-15 to 2-12. The replay was played at a high tempo, but after an even first half, Dublin pulled away in the second half to win by 7 points, 3-15 to 1-14. Lee Keegan was selected for his third All Star, and Aidan O'Shea for his second. The winter again saw controversy envelop Mayo, as a player protest against the management led to the resignation of the management team of Holmes and Connelly.\n[[File:Flag of County Mayo.jpg|thumb|right|Mayo county flag flying on the day of the [[2017 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|All-Ireland final in 2017]]|280px]]\n[[Stephen Rochford]] was selected as Mayo manager for [[2016 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|2016]], and a poor league campaign nonetheless saw the side stay in Division 1 of the league for an 18th consecutive year. Going for a sixth successive Connacht title, hot favourites Mayo were shocked in the semi-final by Galway, who ran out winners 0-12 to 1-12. However, Mayo battled through the Qualifiers with unconvincing wins against Fermanagh, [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] and Westmeath to reach a Quarter Final against Tyrone. In a tight game, Mayo won by a point 0-13 to 0-12. Surprise packets [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] awaited in the Semi-Final, which Mayo won 2-13 to 0-14 to set up an All-Ireland Final meeting with Dublin. The game ended in a draw, Mayo battled back after conceding two unfortunate own goals from Kevin McLoughlin and Colm Boyle. Cillian O'Connor got a 77th minute equalising point to bring it to a replay, the game finishing 0-15 to 2-09\nThe replay ended yet another All-Ireland Final defeat by a single point. Cillian O'Connor had the chance with a free to bring the game to extra time in the 76th minute he missed it. It finished 1-15 to 1-14.\n\nIt took them eight games to get to the [[2017 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|All-Ireland final in 2017]]. A bad start turned into a roller coaster, and after their loss to [[Galway GAA|Galway]] would need extra time in two matches to ultimately end up in the final. After a quick concession of a goal to [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]], Mayo took grip of the final and were in control for most of the first half, leading by a point at half time. However Dublin bounced back and a late free deep into extra time would see Dublin edge out winners, on a score line of 1-17 to 1-16, beating Mayo by a point for the second year in a row.\n\nAnother poor league campaign in 2018 put Mayo to the pin of their collar when a last gasp point by Kevin McLoughlin salvaged a draw against a Donegal side who were relegated in the process by not winning the game. Mayo pressed on towards the Connacht championship, which saw them beaten again by Connacht rivals Galway. Mayo had to take the qualifier route yet again, and despite ruthlessly punishing a very poor Limerick side in Round One, Mayo had to earn a hard-fought win over Tipperary to secure their place in the next draw against Kildare.\n\nIn recent years, Mayo's ability to bounce back from heartbreak would become enough to help them navigate through the qualifiers, but it simply wasn't enough against a rejuvenated Kildare side who won the game 0-21 to 0-19 winners. Stephen Rochford had stepped down not long after the defeat, citing that he \"didn't have the backing of the board\". With a vacant position up for grabs, the process had begun in finding the next Mayo manager for 2019.\n\n'''2019: James Horan's return to the managerial position'''\n\n===1951 curse===\nSince the 1990s, a [[sports-related curses|sports curse]] story has circulated that Mayo will not win another All-Ireland until all members of the 1951 team have died.<ref name=\"it3214371\"/> The supposed cause was that the 1951 champions, returning through [[Foxford]] in a coach or lorry, passed a [[funeral cort\u00e8ge]] without respectfully suspending their boisterous celebrations, and were cursed by either the priest, the bereaved spouse, or a [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]].<ref name=\"it3214371\"/> Folklorist Arlene Crampsie, who conducted interviews in Mayo for the 2008\u20132012 GAA [[Oral History]] Project, found that participants had no interest in the story and regarded it as \"recently contrived nonsense\" spread by the media in the wake of multiple recent near-misses.<ref name=\"it3214371\">{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/the-people-of-mayo-know-the-all-ireland-curse-is-a-contrived-nonsense-1.3214371|title=The people of Mayo know the All-Ireland curse is a contrived nonsense|last=Crampsie|first=Arlene|date=9 Sep 2017|work=[[The Irish Times]]|pages=Sports p.2 |nopp=y|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref> In a 2016 [[TG4]] documentary, the two surviving 1951 players, Paddy Prendergast and Padraig Carney, dismissed the story.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/mayo-all-ireland-winner-in-1950-and-1951-passes-away-1.2518388|title=Mayo All-Ireland winner in 1950 and 1951 passes away|date=2 Feb 2016|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=23 September 2017}}</ref> Padraig Carney died on June 9, 2019\u2014leaving only Paddy Prendergast as the sole surviving member of that 1951 team.\n\n===Supporters===\nRespected columnist [[Colm O'Rourke]] has likened the Mayo supporters to [[locust]]s\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Colm|last=O'Rourke|authorlink=Colm O'Rourke|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/colm-orourke-lets-start-looking-down-under-for-way-to-raise-our-game-38079557.html|title= 'Let's start looking down under for way to raise our game'|work=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|date=5 May 2019|quote=...Mayo supporters will descend like locusts on the South Bronx, and some mightn't even see the game...}}</ref>\n\n===Player Awards===\n\n====All Stars====\nThe annual [[GAA GPA All Stars Awards|GAA All Stars Awards]] recognise the players considered to be the best in their selected positions in the country in any given year. The awards were instituted in 1971 and Mayo's John Carey was among the inaugural selection in that year. Despite winning only two awards in total during their unsuccessful 1970s period, Mayo have been one of the most successful teams nationally in terms of All Star awards gained, with Mayo players winning 42 awards to date. [[Willie Joe Padden]] and Dermot Flanagan became the first Mayo players to win multiple awards, both winning their second awards in 1989. Kenneth Mortimer achieved the same feat in 1997, as did James Horan in 1999 and James Nallen in 2004. Mortimer became the first Mayo player to win back to back awards, winning in both 1996 and 1997, a feat matched by Colm Boyle (2013, 2014 and again, 2016, 2017),  Lee Keegan (2012, 2013, and again, 2015, 2016) and David Clarke (2016, 2017), and exceeded by Keith Higgins, who completed three-in-a-row in 2014. Kenneth and Conor Mortimer became the first Mayo siblings to win awards when Conor won an All Star in 2006.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Player !!

around [[Ballyhaunis]] and Tooreen. There are 4 Senior hurling clubs in Mayo, who compete for the TJ Tyrell Senior Hurling Championship each year. These 4 clubs are [[Tooreen Hurling Club|Tooreen]], [[Ballyhaunis GAA|Ballyhaunis]], [[Castlebar Mitchels GAA|Castlebar Mitchels]], Westport. [[Ballyhaunis GAA|Ballyhaunis]] are the reigning Senior Champions and have 6 senior titles, while Tooreen hold the most titles with 26.\n\nThese 4 clubs provide the players to the Mayo Senior hurling panel, who take part in the National Hurling League and in the All-Ireland Christy Ring (Tier 2) Cup. Mayo's best performances in the Christy Ring Cup came in 2008 and 2009, when the Mayo side fell at the semi-final stage to Carlow and Down respectively. The Mayo U-21 hurling team compete in the Connacht U-21B hurling championship each year along with Roscommon, Sligo and Leitrim.\n\nHurling at underage level is also expanding in Mayo, with 10 clubs competing in underage leagues and championships in the county. As well as the 6 adult sides named above, 4 other underage clubs have formed in recent years. These clubs are Ballyvary, Moytura, Caiseal Gaels and Claremorris. These 10 clubs provide the players for the Mayo underage hurling development panels. Mayo have development panels at U14, U15, U16 and Minor age-groups, and compete in the All-Ireland 'B' competitions each year.\n\nMayo's most famous hurlers are Joe Henry (Tooreen), who won Railway Cup medals with Connacht in the 1980s, and current dual player Keith Higgins (Ballyhaunis) who played for the Mayo football team in the All-Ireland football final in 2006, 2012, 2103 and 2016.\n\nHurling in Mayo is administered by the Mayo GAA Hurling Committee, which is a sub-committee of the Mayo GAA County Board.\nIn 2016 Mayo won the Nicky Rackard cup beating Armagh 2-16 to 1-15 in Croke Park\n\n===Current hurling squad===\n*[[Manager (Gaelic games)|Manager]]: Derek Walsh\n{{GAA squad start}}\n{{GAA squad player|no=1|pos=Goalkeeper|name=Martin Parsons|club=[[Castlebar

''The Periodic Table: Its Story ad Its Significance''; New York City, New York; Oxford University Press.</ref> Around 330 BCE, the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more ''roots'', an idea that had originally been suggested by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]]. The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as [[Indian philosophy]].\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the [[Timeline of chemical elements discoveries|discovery of the chemical elements]]. The first person in history to discover a new element was [[Hennig Brand]], a [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] [[Germans|German]] merchant. Brand tried to discover the [[Philosopher's Stone]]\u2014a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base [[metal]]s into gold. In 1669 (or later), his experiments with [[Distillation|distilled]] human [[urine]] resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \"cold fire\" (''kaltes Feuer'').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/discoveryoftheel002045mbp#page/n135/mode/2up|title=Discovery of the Elements|last1=Weeks|first1=Mary|date=1956|publisher=Journal of Chemical Education|edition=6th|location=Easton, Pennsylvania, USA|page=122}}</ref> He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]] rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\n\n[[File:Dalton's symbols of the elements. 1806 Wellcome M0004592.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[John Dalton|Dalton]] (1806): listing the known elements by atomic weight]]\n\nIn 1815, British physician and chemist [[William Prout]] noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.<ref>See:\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=November 1815|title=On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744812;view=1up;seq=351|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=6|pages=321\u2013330}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=February 1816|title=Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744820;view=1up;seq=135|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=7|pages=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, German physicist [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]] began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|issue=7|pages=331\u2013334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18170560709|bibcode=1817AnP....56..331.}} Here, D\u00f6bereiner found that strontium's properties were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.</ref> In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.

Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death.

The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predictions]] for three elements, which he termed eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicium. In 1871, he expanded his predictions further as well as named a few more elements, although he noted that the principles described for those three elements can be used to describe other missing elements, noting that he wouldn't for that reason describe the elements himself.{{Efn|1=Those elements Mendeleev explicitly mentioned, saying he would be most interested to see them discovered were: eka-caesium, dvi-caesium, eka-niobium, eka-tantalum, eka-manganese, tri-manganese, as well as he noted a missing \"entire ninth row and even almost a whole big period (starting with Ce = 140)\".|name=|group=}}\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]], and the five rare earths\u2014[[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow him to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=159}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=174\u2013175}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements, which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Van den Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Van den Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>). This finding was accepted as an explanation of the fixed lengths of periods and led to repositioning of the noble gases from the left edge of the table to the right.<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Unwillingness of the noble gases to engage in chemical reaction was explained in the alluded stability of closed noble gas electron configurations; from this notion emerged the [[octet rule]].<ref name=\"Trifonov\" /> Among the notable works that established the importance of the periodicity of eight were the [[valence bond theory]], published in 1916 by American chemist [[Gilbert N.

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\n\n[[File:Dalton's symbols of the elements. 1806 Wellcome M0004592.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[John Dalton|Dalton]] (1806): listing the known elements by atomic weight]]\n\nIn 1815, British physician and chemist [[William Prout]] noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.<ref>See:\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=November 1815|title=On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744812;view=1up;seq=351|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=6|pages=321\u2013330}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=February 1816|title=Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744820;view=1up;seq=135|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=7|pages=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, German physicist [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]] began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|issue=7|pages=331\u2013334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18170560709|bibcode=1817AnP....56..331.}} Here, D\u00f6bereiner found that strontium's properties were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.</ref> In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.

Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=\"pastfuture\" />\n\nEven as Mendeleev corrected positions of some elements, he thought that some relationships that he could find in his grand scheme of periodicity could not be found because some elements were still undiscovered, and thus he believed these elements that were still undiscovered would have properties that could be deduced from the expected relationships with other elements. In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predictions]] for three elements, which he termed eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicium. In 1871, he expanded his predictions further as well as named a few more elements, although he noted that the principles described for those three elements can be used to describe other missing elements, noting that he wouldn't for that reason describe the elements himself.{{Efn|1=Those elements Mendeleev explicitly mentioned, saying he would be most interested to see them discovered were: eka-caesium, dvi-caesium, eka-niobium, eka-tantalum, eka-manganese, tri-manganese, as well as he noted a missing \"entire ninth row and even almost a whole big period (starting with Ce = 140)\".|name=|group=}}\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]], and the five rare earths\u2014[[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow him to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=159}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=174\u2013175}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements, which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Van den Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Van den Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively.

Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period.\n\nDespite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law. In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at [[University of California, Berkeley]] observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5. More recent experiments on [[copernicium]] and [[flerovium]] have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas [[radon]] rather than mercury and lead, their respective [[congener (chemistry)|congener]]s.

Each campus is headed by an Executive Officer (CEO) except in Andrews Campus where the [[University President]] concurrently acts as the CEO. The seat of governance of the university is at the Andrews Campus, where the central administration holds office.\n\nThe university offers courses in [[liberal arts]], [[social sciences]], [[law]], [[medicine]] and allied professions, [[business education|business]] and [[economics]], [[natural sciences]], [[engineering]], [[technology]], [[agriculture]] and [[fisheries]] and [[teaching]], among others. It offers the most graduate and undergraduate courses of all the universities in the province of [[Cagayan]].\n\nIn March 2012, Dr. Romeo R. Quilang, former President of the [[Isabela State University]] (ISU), was elected by the CSU [[Board of Regents]] to serve as the CSU System's fourth president.\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:Csu2.jpg|left|thumb|The CSU central administration building at Andrews Campus, Tuguegarao City]]\n\n==Administration==\n\n===Board of Regents===\n\nThe governance of the University is vested in the Board of Regents of the Cagayan State University (or ''Lupon ng mga Rehente'' in [[Filipino language|Filipino]]) and commonly abbreviated as BOR. The board, with its 12 members, is the highest decision-making body of the CSU system.\n[[File:Cagayan State University - Carig Campus.png|thumb|Cagayan State University \u2014 Carig Campus]]\nA Commissioner of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) serves as the Board's Chairperson while the President of the Cagayan State University is the Vice-Chairperson.

It has\u00df shared its historic contribution to the development of tertiary education in the Philippines.\n\nPresidential Decree 1436, signed on June 11, 1978 created the Cagayan State University by merging two existing state colleges: the Cagayan Valley College of Arts & Trades (CVCAT) at Tuguegarao and the Northern Luzon State College of Agriculture (NLSCA) at Piat.\n\nRationalized on the issues of efficiency and effectiveness, college courses of other smaller institutions that were under the supervision and control of the former Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS) were made an integral part of the university system. These were the Aparri Institute of Technology (AIT), Bukig National Agricultural and Technical School (BNATS), Aparri School of Arts and Trades (ASAT), Cagayan Valley Agricultural College (CVAC), Sanchez Mira Rural Vocational School (SMRVS), Western Cagayan School of Arts and Trades (WCSAT) and Gonzaga National Agricultural and Technical School (GNATS).\n\nThese nine pre-existing state institutions were distributed throughout the entire length and breath of the province of Cagayan. Their founding years and laws passed signifying their original establishment. It may be noted that the various merger schools began as elementary or technical secondary schools reflecting the stage of educational needs of the communities where and when they are located and originally established at the time.\n\nOn January 3, 1979, Dr. Manuel T. Corpus of the University of the Philippines- Davao City assumed as President of the University. Then, on January 5, 1979, the first staff meeting was held where the AD HOC Committee was organized as nuclei for the University Administration. Various officers were designated in acting capacities, who were drawn out from the two state colleges (CVCAT and NLSCA).\n\nThe CSU Central Administration Office was established in the CVCAT unit until the Gonzaga unit was developed as a main campus where operation was centralized. The AD HOC committee met and the monthly regular staff meeting was launched in the BNATS unit.\n\nTo uplift the educational qualifications of the faculty, the Faculty and Staff Development Program was set up in the form of graduate programs effective summer of 1979. The come-on was fifty per cent discount in tuition fee.\n\nOn April 1\u20134, 1979, the First Academic Council Work - Conference was conducted in Aparri Institute of Technology (ATI). The council designed the following policies: curricula for various courses; proposed courses to be offered in each unit; policies on recruitment, employment and promotion of faculty; guidelines for faculty benefits, rules on discipline and leaves; guidelines on faculty load and faculty development; requirements for admission and scholarship of students, research and extension programs.\n\n[[File:CSUMAP.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Map showing the location of CSU campuses in Cagayan]]\nOn Sept. 29, 1979, the Board of Regents authorized the transfer of college courses of Aparri School of Arts & Trades (ASAT) to AIT campus. This reduced the number of campuses from nine to eight. These campuses adopted the nomenclature approved by the Board on February 25, 1980 as follows:\n\n* VCAT-CSU Tuguegarao City\n* SMRVS-CSU Sanchez Mira\n* WCSAT-CSU Lasam\n* BNATS-CSU Bukig\n* GNATS-CSU Gonzaga\n* NLSCA-CSU Piat\n* CVAC-CSU Lallo\n* AIT-CSU Aparri\n\nThe first organizational chart of CSU took effect on October 26, 1981 upon the approval of the Board of Regents. This policy decision made possible the re-organization of the colleges and the approval of the designation of officials in the Central Administration, campus and college levels.\n\nOn July 11, 1983, Dr. Joselito Jara was appointed as the first Vice-President for Academic Affairs. Then on July 27, 1983 the approval of the proposal to open the College of Medicine in the University by the Board of Regents marked a milestone in the curricular development of CSU. The Board directed the administration to make arrangements with the then Cagayan Valley Regional Hospital (CVRH), now Cagayan Valley Medical Center (CVMC) to become the laboratory of the proposed college. The transfer of Central Administration from Caritan campus to the Carig campus, the new site of CSU at Tuguegarao, was undertaken on June 11, 1984. The old administration building in Caritan became the Graduate School and the College of Arts and Sciences Building. Another milestone was the implementation of the integration into the university system of the secondary departments of CSU at Gonzaga, CSU at Lallo, CSU at Sanchez Mira and CSU at Aparri on July 10, 1984. MECS Regional Director, Magdalena Castillo turned over formally to President Manuel T. Corpus, the four high schools on December 20, 1984. The President of the Philippines approved the integration on March 17, 1983.\n\nOn May 8, 1989, Honorable [[Lourdes Quisumbing]], the then Secretary of the Department of Education Culture and Sports (DECS) swore into office Dr. Armando Cortes as the first Cagayano President of CSU. Professor Monserrat G. Babaran was also appointed as the second Vice-President for Academic Affairs in June 1992 after Dr. Jara\u2019s term . On March 1, 1996 to December 30, 1998, Father Ranhillo C. Aquino became the Vice President of the University.\n\nIn June 1992, the Office of the Dean of the College of Medicine was set up in preparation for its opening in school year 1993-1994. Dr. Gilbert Gamez, erstwhile Dean of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) College of Medicine, was appointed as the first dean of the college. As the university programs expand, a university-wide reorganization was undertaken in July 1992.\n\nOn May 5, 1995, Dr. Armando B. Cortes was reappointed as President of the University. The reorganization of the top administration took place on February 27, 1996. On this same year, the governing Board of the University resolved to suspend the operation of CSU at Bukig in Western Aparri because of the low enrolment that made non-feasible continued operation. This aspect of the history of the University is of particular importance relative to the evaluation of efficiency and effective performance.\n\nOn February 23, 1999, the Board granted the university Administration the authority to offer Bachelor of Laws and Letters (LLB) to commence School Year 1999-2000.\n\nIn response to the thrust and vision of Region 02 and to provide leadership in livestock development, the Board granted the University Administration the offering of Veterinary Medicine and Medical Technology courses effective School Year 1999- 2000.\n\nOn May 7, 2001, the then Vice President for Academic Affairs, Dr. Eleuterio C. De Leon, was appointed by the Board of Regents as the Officer \u2013 In \u2013 Charge of the University. During his term, the Board approved the University\u2019s decision to phase down the enrollment in the high school department and to limit the admission of first year high school students in Piat, Lallo and Gonzaga campuses to 500 students only.\n\nA reorganization of top administration took place that paved the way to the search for the different campus deans, now the Campus Executive Officers.\n\nOn March 8, 2004, through Resolution No. 151, s. 2004, the Board appointed Dr. Roger P. Perez, as the 3rd University President. On March 15, 2004, Dr. Perez assumed official duty at the Central Administration with all the powers, rights, privileges and responsibilities accorded him. Another organizational structure which would readily respond to the actual needs of the university and attuned to the relevance of its existence and thrust of the new administration was then conceptualized.\n\nRationalizing its intent for a lean but mean organization. The structure has maintained three vice president positions with the third important vice president position having an added program under its domain, the Business Affairs Program. The new structure also proposed the creation of the positions of internal auditors under the Office of the President. The Office of the Deputy Dean of Instruction was likewise created to implement the virtualization of curricular offerings.\n\nTo further rationalize the structure of the organization which is in consonance with a lean but mean operation, the administration has cut the number of Vice-Presidents from three to two, that of the Vice-President for instruction, research, and extension and Vice-President for Administration and Business.\n\nAt present there are eight campuses under the university system. All campuses continue to operate as complementary satellites of the University. Although difficult at times, the unique arrangement of a multi-campus institution, which has prevailed over an ideal compact-university being located in one site, is succeeding in terms of providing educational access and equity to its rural communities. On the other hand, owing to the peculiarities of the geographical diversity and multi-ethnicity of its people and socio-economic, educational and political conditions obtaining in its catchment\u2019s areas, the CSU institutional structures and arrangement are functioning well.\n\nToday, CSU is present in six sites outside Tuguegarao which is located at Sanchez Mira, Lasam, Aparri, Lallo, Gonzaga, and Piat so that the original intent of providing democratized tertiary education in the countryside is felt in the whole region specifically in Cagayan.\n\n==Amenities==\n\n===Infrastructure===\n\nThe current school year was a witness to constructive changes and infrastructure developments across the different campuses of Cagayan State University. A series of \"circa 50\" buildings, which serve not only as institutional facilities but as aesthetic icons, representing the university motto: \"Educating for the Best\", are now in the final phase of their construction process.\n\nMoreover, other physical facilities in the university are facing major rehabilitation specifically in CSU Andrews being the \"show window\" of CSU.\n\nPhysical improvement within the eight campuses of the university is evident and is geared at developing and encouraging higher aspirations among its poor students. Modern buildings and comfort rooms were put up to deliver the necessary service to students all over CSU.\n\n===Electronic Library===\nWith the vision of President Perez, the University decided to subscribe to Academic OneFile for its E-Library making it the first university in the region to have such facility. It was inaugurated on February 14, 2011.\n\n==Students==\nA key institution in the university is the strong Mass Communication program of the university that is responsible for the production of radio and television programs giving public viewership to the university's activities, furnishing the public regularly with information on the university and is the source of the information in this article.  Inspired by Dr. Roger Matalang, the Mass Communication program has been one of the most distinguished programs of the university.\n\nThe university currently has an enormous population of 32,000 in its eight campuses. One distinctive feature of the university is the innovative scheme introduced by Dr. Perez: rationalized fees.  Under this scheme, students pay no tuition fees.  They pay however fiduciary fees that range from two thousand to three thousand pesos per semester, allocated for specific purposes such as library, laboratory facilities, infrastructure development, etc.  The university also boasts of WiFi access to all its students and professors as well as an e-Library to which all students and professors whether in or out of campus can gain access.\n\nIt has speech laboratories in the Andrews, Carig and Aparri campuses.  Although it is still completing its engineering laboratories, acquisitions in this area have already been considerable.\n\n===Organizations, fraternities and sororities===\n* The CSU Communicator - the official student publication of Cagayan State University Andrews\n*LFS - a progressive nationalist student organization\n* ''Rodeo Club Philippines'' - a college based student organization exclusively for veterinary medicine students.\n\n== Culture, sports and traditions ==\nIt is the only university (Tuguegarao Campuses) that has its own extensive system of [[jeepney]] transportation owing to its geographic location. Alongside the use of Jeepney is the use of tricycles.\n\nThe Cagayan State University Chorale Ensemble, under the direction of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs, Fr. Aquino, has gone places including Malaysia, Macau, Busan City in South Korea and Rome.  It has also performed in concerts throughout the country and has performed with the University of Santo Tomas Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe Athena Dance Troupe and the Athena Rondalla, under the direction of Dr. Chita Ramos, have gained popularity and are frequently invited for performances.  They feature indigenous Filipino and regional dances as well as music produced by local instruments.\n\nThe Tanghalang CSU is directed by Dr. Shamon Abraham, University Director of Culture and the Arts, at one time member of the Filipinescas.  He was formerly cultural director at the University of Saint Louis Tuguegarao.\n\n==Affiliations==\nCSU is a member of the [[Philippine Association of State Universities and Colleges]] (PASUC) and its athletic Association, the [[State Colleges and Universities Athletic Association]] (SCUAA) and participates in all events.

The University was established through [[Presidential Decree]] 1436, later amended by [[Republic Act]] 8292 by the integration of all publicly supported higher education institutions in the province of [[Cagayan]].\n[[File:Cagayan State University \u2013 Andrews Campus, Tuguegarao City.jpg|thumb|Athena Grounds, Cagayan State University, Tuguegarao City.]]\nThe university is composed of eight(8) campuses in the growth areas in the three [[Congress of the Philippines|congressional districts]] of Cagayan; the [[Aparri, Cagayan|Aparri]], [[Lal-lo, Cagayan|Lal-Lo]] and [http://e-csug.net.ph Gonzaga] campuses in the 1st District; the [[Piat, Cagayan|Piat]], [[Lasam, Cagayan|Lasam]] and [[Sanchez-Mira, Cagayan|Sanchez-Mira]] campuses in the 2nd District; and in the 3rd District, the Andrews and Carig campuses in [[Tuguegarao City]]. Each campus is headed by an Executive Officer (CEO) except in Andrews Campus where the [[University President]] concurrently acts as the CEO. The seat of governance of the university is at the Andrews Campus, where the central administration holds office.\n\nThe university offers courses in [[liberal arts]], [[social sciences]], [[law]], [[medicine]] and allied professions, [[business education|business]] and [[economics]], [[natural sciences]], [[engineering]], [[technology]], [[agriculture]] and [[fisheries]] and [[teaching]], among others. It offers the most graduate and undergraduate courses of all the universities in the province of [[Cagayan]].\n\nIn March 2012, Dr. Romeo R. Quilang, former President of the [[Isabela State University]] (ISU), was elected by the CSU [[Board of Regents]] to serve as the CSU System's fourth president.\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:Csu2.jpg|left|thumb|The CSU central administration building at Andrews Campus, Tuguegarao City]]\n\n==Administration==\n\n===Board of Regents===\n\nThe governance of the University is vested in the Board of Regents of the Cagayan State University (or ''Lupon ng mga Rehente'' in [[Filipino language|Filipino]]) and commonly abbreviated as BOR.

It has\u00df shared its historic contribution to the development of tertiary education in the Philippines.\n\nPresidential Decree 1436, signed on June 11, 1978 created the Cagayan State University by merging two existing state colleges: the Cagayan Valley College of Arts & Trades (CVCAT) at Tuguegarao and the Northern Luzon State College of Agriculture (NLSCA) at Piat.\n\nRationalized on the issues of efficiency and effectiveness, college courses of other smaller institutions that were under the supervision and control of the former Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS) were made an integral part of the university system. These were the Aparri Institute of Technology (AIT), Bukig National Agricultural and Technical School (BNATS), Aparri School of Arts and Trades (ASAT), Cagayan Valley Agricultural College (CVAC), Sanchez Mira Rural Vocational School (SMRVS), Western Cagayan School of Arts and Trades (WCSAT) and Gonzaga National Agricultural and Technical School (GNATS).\n\nThese nine pre-existing state institutions were distributed throughout the entire length and breath of the province of Cagayan. Their founding years and laws passed signifying their original establishment. It may be noted that the various merger schools began as elementary or technical secondary schools reflecting the stage of educational needs of the communities where and when they are located and originally established at the time.\n\nOn January 3, 1979, Dr. Manuel T. Corpus of the University of the Philippines- Davao City assumed as President of the University. Then, on January 5, 1979, the first staff meeting was held where the AD HOC Committee was organized as nuclei for the University Administration. Various officers were designated in acting capacities, who were drawn out from the two state colleges (CVCAT and NLSCA).\n\nThe CSU Central Administration Office was established in the CVCAT unit until the Gonzaga unit was developed as a main campus where operation was centralized. The AD HOC committee met and the monthly regular staff meeting was launched in the BNATS unit.\n\nTo uplift the educational qualifications of the faculty, the Faculty and Staff Development Program was set up in the form of graduate programs effective summer of 1979. The come-on was fifty per cent discount in tuition fee.\n\nOn April 1\u20134, 1979, the First Academic Council Work - Conference was conducted in Aparri Institute of Technology (ATI). The council designed the following policies: curricula for various courses; proposed courses to be offered in each unit; policies on recruitment, employment and promotion of faculty; guidelines for faculty benefits, rules on discipline and leaves; guidelines on faculty load and faculty development; requirements for admission and scholarship of students, research and extension programs.\n\n[[File:CSUMAP.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Map showing the location of CSU campuses in Cagayan]]\nOn Sept. 29, 1979, the Board of Regents authorized the transfer of college courses of Aparri School of Arts & Trades (ASAT) to AIT campus. This reduced the number of campuses from nine to eight. These campuses adopted the nomenclature approved by the Board on February 25, 1980 as follows:\n\n* VCAT-CSU Tuguegarao City\n* SMRVS-CSU Sanchez Mira\n* WCSAT-CSU Lasam\n* BNATS-CSU Bukig\n* GNATS-CSU Gonzaga\n* NLSCA-CSU Piat\n* CVAC-CSU Lallo\n* AIT-CSU Aparri\n\nThe first organizational chart of CSU took effect on October 26, 1981 upon the approval of the Board of Regents. This policy decision made possible the re-organization of the colleges and the approval of the designation of officials in the Central Administration, campus and college levels.\n\nOn July 11, 1983, Dr. Joselito Jara was appointed as the first Vice-President for Academic Affairs. Then on July 27, 1983 the approval of the proposal to open the College of Medicine in the University by the Board of Regents marked a milestone in the curricular development of CSU. The Board directed the administration to make arrangements with the then Cagayan Valley Regional Hospital (CVRH), now Cagayan Valley Medical Center (CVMC) to become the laboratory of the proposed college. The transfer of Central Administration from Caritan campus to the Carig campus, the new site of CSU at Tuguegarao, was undertaken on June 11, 1984. The old administration building in Caritan became the Graduate School and the College of Arts and Sciences Building. Another milestone was the implementation of the integration into the university system of the secondary departments of CSU at Gonzaga, CSU at Lallo, CSU at Sanchez Mira and CSU at Aparri on July 10, 1984. MECS Regional Director, Magdalena Castillo turned over formally to President Manuel T. Corpus, the four high schools on December 20, 1984. The President of the Philippines approved the integration on March 17, 1983.\n\nOn May 8, 1989, Honorable [[Lourdes Quisumbing]], the then Secretary of the Department of Education Culture and Sports (DECS) swore into office Dr. Armando Cortes as the first Cagayano President of CSU. Professor Monserrat G. Babaran was also appointed as the second Vice-President for Academic Affairs in June 1992 after Dr. Jara\u2019s term . On March 1, 1996 to December 30, 1998, Father Ranhillo C. Aquino became the Vice President of the University.\n\nIn June 1992, the Office of the Dean of the College of Medicine was set up in preparation for its opening in school year 1993-1994. Dr. Gilbert Gamez, erstwhile Dean of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) College of Medicine, was appointed as the first dean of the college. As the university programs expand, a university-wide reorganization was undertaken in July 1992.\n\nOn May 5, 1995, Dr. Armando B. Cortes was reappointed as President of the University. The reorganization of the top administration took place on February 27, 1996. On this same year, the governing Board of the University resolved to suspend the operation of CSU at Bukig in Western Aparri because of the low enrolment that made non-feasible continued operation. This aspect of the history of the University is of particular importance relative to the evaluation of efficiency and effective performance.\n\nOn February 23, 1999, the Board granted the university Administration the authority to offer Bachelor of Laws and Letters (LLB) to commence School Year 1999-2000.\n\nIn response to the thrust and vision of Region 02 and to provide leadership in livestock development, the Board granted the University Administration the offering of Veterinary Medicine and Medical Technology courses effective School Year 1999- 2000.\n\nOn May 7, 2001, the then Vice President for Academic Affairs, Dr. Eleuterio C. De Leon, was appointed by the Board of Regents as the Officer \u2013 In \u2013 Charge of the University. During his term, the Board approved the University\u2019s decision to phase down the enrollment in the high school department and to limit the admission of first year high school students in Piat, Lallo and Gonzaga campuses to 500 students only.\n\nA reorganization of top administration took place that paved the way to the search for the different campus deans, now the Campus Executive Officers.\n\nOn March 8, 2004, through Resolution No. 151, s. 2004, the Board appointed Dr. Roger P. Perez, as the 3rd University President. On March 15, 2004, Dr. Perez assumed official duty at the Central Administration with all the powers, rights, privileges and responsibilities accorded him. Another organizational structure which would readily respond to the actual needs of the university and attuned to the relevance of its existence and thrust of the new administration was then conceptualized.\n\nRationalizing its intent for a lean but mean organization. The structure has maintained three vice president positions with the third important vice president position having an added program under its domain, the Business Affairs Program. The new structure also proposed the creation of the positions of internal auditors under the Office of the President. The Office of the Deputy Dean of Instruction was likewise created to implement the virtualization of curricular offerings.\n\nTo further rationalize the structure of the organization which is in consonance with a lean but mean operation, the administration has cut the number of Vice-Presidents from three to two, that of the Vice-President for instruction, research, and extension and Vice-President for Administration and Business.\n\nAt present there are eight campuses under the university system. All campuses continue to operate as complementary satellites of the University. Although difficult at times, the unique arrangement of a multi-campus institution, which has prevailed over an ideal compact-university being located in one site, is succeeding in terms of providing educational access and equity to its rural communities. On the other hand, owing to the peculiarities of the geographical diversity and multi-ethnicity of its people and socio-economic, educational and political conditions obtaining in its catchment\u2019s areas, the CSU institutional structures and arrangement are functioning well.\n\nToday, CSU is present in six sites outside Tuguegarao which is located at Sanchez Mira, Lasam, Aparri, Lallo, Gonzaga, and Piat so that the original intent of providing democratized tertiary education in the countryside is felt in the whole region specifically in Cagayan.\n\n==Amenities==\n\n===Infrastructure===\n\nThe current school year was a witness to constructive changes and infrastructure developments across the different campuses of Cagayan State University. A series of \"circa 50\" buildings, which serve not only as institutional facilities but as aesthetic icons, representing the university motto: \"Educating for the Best\", are now in the final phase of their construction process.\n\nMoreover, other physical facilities in the university are facing major rehabilitation specifically in CSU Andrews being the \"show window\" of CSU.\n\nPhysical improvement within the eight campuses of the university is evident and is geared at developing and encouraging higher aspirations among its poor students. Modern buildings and comfort rooms were put up to deliver the necessary service to students all over CSU.\n\n===Electronic Library===\nWith the vision of President Perez, the University decided to subscribe to Academic OneFile for its E-Library making it the first university in the region to have such facility. It was inaugurated on February 14, 2011.\n\n==Students==\nA key institution in the university is the strong Mass Communication program of the university that is responsible for the production of radio and television programs giving public viewership to the university's activities, furnishing the public regularly with information on the university and is the source of the information in this article.  Inspired by Dr. Roger Matalang, the Mass Communication program has been one of the most distinguished programs of the university.\n\nThe university currently has an enormous population of 32,000 in its eight campuses. One distinctive feature of the university is the innovative scheme introduced by Dr. Perez: rationalized fees.  Under this scheme, students pay no tuition fees.  They pay however fiduciary fees that range from two thousand to three thousand pesos per semester, allocated for specific purposes such as library, laboratory facilities, infrastructure development, etc.  The university also boasts of WiFi access to all its students and professors as well as an e-Library to which all students and professors whether in or out of campus can gain access.\n\nIt has speech laboratories in the Andrews, Carig and Aparri campuses.  Although it is still completing its engineering laboratories, acquisitions in this area have already been considerable.\n\n===Organizations, fraternities and sororities===\n* The CSU Communicator - the official student publication of Cagayan State University Andrews\n*LFS - a progressive nationalist student organization\n* ''Rodeo Club Philippines'' - a college based student organization exclusively for veterinary medicine students.\n\n== Culture, sports and traditions ==\nIt is the only university (Tuguegarao Campuses) that has its own extensive system of [[jeepney]] transportation owing to its geographic location. Alongside the use of Jeepney is the use of tricycles.\n\nThe Cagayan State University Chorale Ensemble, under the direction of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs, Fr. Aquino, has gone places including Malaysia, Macau, Busan City in South Korea and Rome.  It has also performed in concerts throughout the country and has performed with the University of Santo Tomas Symphony Orchestra.\n\nThe Athena Dance Troupe and the Athena Rondalla, under the direction of Dr. Chita Ramos, have gained popularity and are frequently invited for performances.  They feature indigenous Filipino and regional dances as well as music produced by local instruments.\n\nThe Tanghalang CSU is directed by Dr. Shamon Abraham, University Director of Culture and the Arts, at one time member of the Filipinescas.  He was formerly cultural director at the University of Saint Louis Tuguegarao.\n\n==Affiliations==\nCSU is a member of the [[Philippine Association of State Universities and Colleges]] (PASUC) and its athletic Association, the [[State Colleges and Universities Athletic Association]] (SCUAA) and participates in all events.
