It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

A panoramic view of a brightly-lit city is displayed, panning inside a confined apartment containing Janet Jackson and an AIBO. Jackson sings on top of the bed as objects in the room are individually displayed, including a descending glass shelf, a digital alarm clock, a magazine container, a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. During the chorus, Jackson grabs a beverage from the fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four women appear outside the door as Jackson exits her room, when the room darkens.\n\nThe five women dance through the apartment hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform. Beginning from the song's breakdown, the women perform a choreographed dance routine on the platform while it tilts in different directions. The scenes are interspersed with Jackson drawing an orange swirl towards the camera and the AIBO watching the film in the apartment, while in the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], various people are seen drawing orange swirls. Jackson is positioned inside the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from the film are displayed as a reflection in the front window.

It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over US$2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

A panoramic view of a brightly-lit city is displayed, panning inside a confined apartment containing Janet Jackson and an AIBO. Jackson sings on top of the bed as objects in the room are individually displayed, including a descending glass shelf, a digital alarm clock, a magazine container, a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. During the chorus, Jackson grabs a beverage from the fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four women appear outside the door as Jackson exits her room, when the room darkens.\n\nThe five women dance through the apartment hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform. Beginning from the song's breakdown, the women perform a choreographed dance routine on the platform while it tilts in different directions. The scenes are interspersed with Jackson drawing an orange swirl towards the camera and the AIBO watching the film in the apartment, while in the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], various people are seen drawing orange swirls. Jackson is positioned inside the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from the film are displayed as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto the bed, with the AIBO resting in front.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

Beery appeared in some 250 films during a 36-year career. His contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] stipulated in 1932 that he would be paid $1 more than any other contract player at the studio. This made Beery the highest-paid film actor in the world during the early 1930s. He was the brother of actor [[Noah Beery Sr.]] and uncle of actor [[Noah Beery Jr.]]\n\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Beery was posthumously inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] with a motion pictures star in 1960. His star is located at 7001 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref name=hwof>[http://www.walkoffame.com/wallace-beery Walk of Fame Stars-Wallace Beery]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBeery was born the youngest of three boys in 1885 in [[Clay County, Missouri]], near [[Smithville, Missouri|Smithville]].<ref name=\"Missouri Biography 1999\">''Dictionary of Missouri Biography'', Lawrence O. Christensen, University of Missouri Press, 1999.</ref> The Beery family left the farm in the 1890s and moved to nearby [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where the father was a police officer.\n\nWallace Beery attended the Chase School in Kansas City and took piano lessons as well, but showed little love for academic matters. He ran away from home twice, the first time returning after a short time, quitting school and working in the Kansas City [[Classification yard|train yards]] as an [[Wiper (occupation)|engine wiper]].<ref name=\"Missouri Biography 1999\"/> Beery ran away from home a second time at age 16, and joined the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus|Ringling Brothers Circus]] as an assistant [[elephant]] trainer. He left two years later, after being clawed by a [[leopard]].\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Wallace Beery (circa 1914).jpg|left|thumb|<center>Wallace Beery circa 1914</center>]]\n[[File:Dreamy Sweedy (cinema 1914) (3109252361).jpg|thumb|upright|Beery as [[Sweedie]] the Swedish maid (1914)]]\n\n===Early career===\nWallace Beery joined his older brother Noah in New York City in 1904, finding work in comic opera as a baritone and began to appear on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as well as [[summer stock theatre]]. He appeared in ''The Belle of the West'' in 1905. His most notable early role came in 1907 when he starred in ''The Yankee Tourist'' to good reviews.<ref>https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/the-yankee-tourist-6354</ref>\n\n===Comedy film star - Essanay Studios===\nIn 1913, he moved to Chicago to work for [[Essanay Studios]]. His first movie was likely a comedy short, ''[[His Athletic Wife]]'' (1913).\n\nBeery was then cast as [[Sweedie]], a Swedish maid character he played in [[Drag queen|drag]] in a series of short comedy films from 1914\u201316. ''[[Sweedie Learns to Swim]]'' (1914) co-starred [[Ben Turpin]]. ''[[Sweedie Goes to College]]'' (1915) starred [[Gloria Swanson]], whom Beery married the following year.<ref name=\"Sonneborn 2002\" />\n\nOther Beery films (mostly shorts) from this period included ''[[In and Out (1914 film)|In and Out]]'' (1914), ''[[The Ups and Downs (1914 film)|The Ups and Downs]]'' (1914), ''[[Cheering a Husband]]'' (1914), ''[[Madame Double X]]'' (1914), ''[[Ain't It the Truth (film)|Ain't It the Truth]]'' (1915), ''[[Two Hearts That Beat as Ten]]'' (1915), and ''[[The Fable of the Roistering Blades]]'' (1915).\n\n''[[The Slim Princess (1915 film)|The Slim Princess]]'' (1915), with [[Francis X. Bushman]], was one of the earliest feature-length films. Beery also did ''[[The Broken Pledge]]'' (1915) and ''[[A Dash of Courage]]'' (1916), both with Swanson.\n\nBeery was a German soldier in ''[[The Little American]]'' (1917) with [[Mary Pickford]], directed by [[Cecil B. De Mille]]. He did some comedies for [[Mack Sennett]], ''[[Maggie's First False Step]]'' (1917) and ''[[Teddy at the Throttle]]'' (1917), but he would gradually leave that genre and specialize in portrayals of villains prior to becoming a major leading man during the sound era.\n\n===Villainous roles===\nIn 1917 Beery portrayed [[Pancho Villa]] in ''[[Patria (1917 film)|Patria]]'' at a time when Villa was still active in [[Mexico]]. (Beery reprised the role 17 years later in ''[[Viva Villa!]]''.)\n\nBeery was a villainous German in ''[[The Unpardonable Sin]]'' (1919) with [[Blanche Sweet]]. For Paramount he did ''[[The Love Burglar]]'' (1919) with [[Wallace Reid]]; ''[[Victory (1919 film)|Victory]]'' (1919), with Jack Holt; ''[[Behind the Door (film)|Behind the Door]]'' (1919), as another villainous German; and ''[[The Life Line]]'' (1919) with Holt.\n\nBeery was the villain in five major releases in 1920: ''[[813 (film)|813]]''; ''[[The Virgin of Stamboul]]'' for director [[Tod Browning]]; ''[[The Mollycoddle]]'' with [[Douglas Fairbanks]], in which Fairbanks and Beery fistfought as they tumbled down a steep mountain (see the photograph in the gallery below); and in the non-comedic [[Western (genre)|Western]] ''[[The Round-Up (1920 film)|The Round-Up]]'' starring [[Roscoe Arbuckle]] as an obese cowboy in a well-received serious film with the tagline \"Nobody loves a fat man.\" Beery continued his villainy cycle that year with ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1920 American film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'', playing Magua.\n\nBeery had a supporting part in ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'' (1920) with [[Rudolph Valentino]]. He was a villainous Tong leader in ''[[A Tale of Two Worlds]]'' (1921) and was the bad guy again in ''[[Sleeping Acres]]'' (1922), ''[[Wild Honey (1922 film)|Wild Honey]]'' (1922), and ''[[I Am the Law (1922 film)|I Am the Law]]'' (1922), which also featured his brother Noah Beery Sr..\n\n===Historical films===\nBeery had a large then-rare heroic part as [[King Richard I]] (Richard the Lion-Hearted) in ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1922), starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]] as [[Robin Hood]]. The lavish movie was a huge success and spawned a sequel the following year starring Beery in the title role of ''[[Richard the Lion-Hearted (1923 film)|Richard the Lion-Hearted]]''.\n\nBeery had an important unbilled cameo as \"the Ape-Man\" in ''[[A Blind Bargain]]'' (1922) starring [[Lon Chaney]] (Beery is seen crouching, in full ape-man make-up, in the background of some of the movie's posters), and a supporting role in ''[[The Flame of Life]]'' (1923). He played another historical king, [[Philip IV of Spain|King Philip IV]] of Spain in ''[[The Spanish Dancer]]'' (1923) with [[Pola Negri]].\n\nBeery starred in an action melodrama, ''[[Stormswept]]'' (1923) for [[FBO Films]] alongside his elder brother, [[Noah Beery Sr.]]. The tagline on the movie's posters was \"Wallace and Noah Beery - The Two Greatest Character Actors on the American Screen.\"\n\nBeery played his third royal, the [[Duc de Tours]], in ''[[Ashes of Vengeance]]'' (1923) with [[Norma Talmadge]], then did ''[[Drifting (1923 film)|Drifting]]'' (1923) with [[Priscilla Dean]] for director Browning.\n\nBeery had the titular role in ''[[Bavu]]'' (1923), about [[Bolsheviks]] and the [[Russian Revolution]]. He co-starred with [[Buster Keaton]] in the comedy ''[[Three Ages]]'' (1923), the first feature Keaton wrote, produced, directed and starred in.\n\nBeery was a villain in ''[[The Eternal Struggle (film)|The Eternal Struggle]]'' (1923), a [[Northwest Mounted Police|Mountie]] drama, produced by [[Louis B. Mayer]], who would eventually become crucial to Beery's career. He was reunited with Dean and Browning in ''[[White Tiger (1923 film)|White Tiger]]'' (1923), then played the title role in the aforementioned ''[[Richard the Lion-Hearted (1923 film)|Richard the Lion-Hearted]]'' (1923), a sequel to ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'' based on [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Talisman (Scott novel)|The Talisman]]''.\n\nBeery was in ''[[The Drums of Jeopardy (1923 film)|The Drums of Jeopardy]]'' (1923) and had a supporting role in ''[[The Sea Hawk (1924 film)|The Sea Hawk]]'' (1924) for director Frank Lloyd. He also appeared in a supporting role for [[Clarence Brown]]'s ''[[The Signal Tower]]'' (1925) starring [[Virginia Valli]] and  [[Rockliffe Fellowes]].\n\n===Paramount===\nBeery signed a contract with Paramount Pictures. He had a support role in ''[[Adventure (1925 film)|Adventure]]'' (1925) directed by [[Victor Fleming]].\n\nAt First National, he was given the star role of [[Professor Challenger]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s dinosaur epic ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925), arguably his silent performance most frequently screened in the modern era. Beery was top billed in Paramount's ''[[The Devil's Cargo]]'' (1925) for Victor Fleming, and supported in ''[[The Night Club]]'' (1925), ''[[The Pony Express (1925 film)|The Pony Express]]'' (1925) for [[James Cruze]], and ''[[The Wanderer (1925 film)|The Wanderer]]'' (1925) for [[Raoul Walsh]].\n\nBeery starred in a comedy with [[Raymond Hatton]], ''[[Behind the Front (film)|Behind the Front]]'' (1926) and he was a villain in ''[[Volcano! (1926 film)|Volcano!]]'' (1926). He was a bos'n in ''[[Old Ironsides (film)|Old Ironsides]]'' (1926) for director James Cruze, with [[Charles Farrell]] in the romantic lead.\n\nBeery had the title role in the baseball movie ''[[Casey at the Bat (1927 film)|Casey at the Bat]]'' (1927). He was reunited with Hatton in ''[[Fireman, Save My Child (1927 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1927) and ''[[Now We're in the Air]]'' (1927). The latter also featured [[Louise Brooks]] who was Beery's co star in ''[[Beggars of Life]]'' (1928), directed by [[William Wellman]], which was Paramount's first part-talkie movie.\n\nThere was a fourth comedy with Hatton, ''[[Wife Savers]]'' (1929), then Beery starred in ''[[Chinatown Nights (1929 film)|Chinatown Nights]]'' (1929) for Wellman, produced by a young [[David O. Selznick]]. This film was shot silent with the voices dubbed in by the actors afterward, which worked spectacularly well with Beery's resonant voice, although the technique was not used again during the silent era for another full-length feature. Beery then played in ''[[Stairs of Sand]]'' (1929), a [[Western (genre)|Western]] also starring [[Jean Arthur]] (who would play the leading lady in the Western film ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' twenty-four years later) before being fired by Paramount.\n\n===MGM===\n[[File:The-Big-House-1930.jpg|thumb|[[Chester Morris]] and Wallace Beery in ''[[The Big House (1930 film)|The Big House]]'' (1930)]]\n[[File:DresslerBeeryJordanMinBill1930Trailer.jpg|right|thumb|With [[Marie Dressler]] in ''[[Min and Bill]]'' (1930)]]\n[[File:The Champ (1931) trailer 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jackie Cooper]], [[Edward Brophy]], and Wallace Beery in ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]'' (1931)]]\n[[File:Tugboat Annie 1933.jpg|thumb|''[[Tugboat Annie]]'' (1933)]]\n[[Irving Thalberg]] signed Beery to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] as a character actor. The association began well when Beery played the savage convict \"Butch,\" a role originally intended for [[Lon Chaney Sr.]] (who died that same year), in the highly successful 1930 prison film ''[[The Big House (1930 film)|The Big House]]'', directed by [[George W. Hill]]; Beery was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\nBeery's second film for MGM was also a huge success: ''[[Billy the Kid (1930 film)|Billy the Kid]]'' (1930), an early [[widescreen]] picture in which he played [[Pat Garrett]]. He supported [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] in ''[[Way for a Sailor]]'' (1930) and [[Grace Moore]] in ''[[A Lady's Morals]]'' (1930), portraying [[P.T. Barnum]] in the latter.\n\n===Stardom===\nBeery was well established as a leading man and top rank character actor. What really made him one of the cinema's foremost stars was ''[[Min and Bill]]'' (1930) opposite [[Marie Dressler]] and directed by [[George W. Hill]], a sensational success.<ref name=\"scott\">Scott Eyman, ''Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer'', Robson, 2005, p. 191 {{ISBN|9781861058928}}</ref>\n\nBeery made a third film with Hill, ''[[The Secret Six]]'' (1931), a gangster movie with [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Clark Gable]] in key supporting roles. The picture was popular but was surpassed at the box office by ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]'', which Beery made with [[Jackie Cooper]] for director [[King Vidor]]. The film, especially written for Beery, was another box office sensation. Beery shared the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] with [[Fredric March]].  Though March received one vote more than Beery, Academy rules at the time\u2014since rescinded\u2014defined results within one vote of each other as \"ties\".<ref>History of the Academy Awards: The Fifth Academy Awards, 1931/32. [http://history1900s.about.com/od/fadsfashion/a/1931awards.htm About.com archive]. Retrieved April 2, 2015.</ref>\n\nBeery's career went from strength to strength. ''[[Hell Divers]]'' (1932), a naval airplane epic also starring a young [[Clark Gable]] billed under Beery, was a big hit. So too was the all-star ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), in which Beery was billed fourth, under [[Greta Garbo]], [[John Barrymore]], and [[Joan Crawford]], one of the very few times he would not be top billed for the rest of his career. In 1932 his contract with MGM stipulated that he be paid a dollar more than any other contract player at the studio, making him the world's highest-paid actor.\n\nBeery was a German wrestler in ''[[Flesh (1932 film)|Flesh]]'' (1932), a hit directed by [[John Ford]] but Ford removed his directorial credit before the film opened, so the picture screened with no director listed despite being labeled \"A John Ford Production\" in the opening title card. Next Beery was in another all-star ensemble blockbuster, ''[[Dinner at Eight (1933 film)|Dinner at Eight]]'' (1933), with Jean Harlow holding her own as Beery's comically bickering wife. This time Beery was billed third, under [[Marie Dressler]] and [[John Barrymore]].\n\nBeery was loaned out to the new [[Twentieth Century Pictures]] for the boisterously fast-paced comedy/drama ''[[The Bowery (film)|The Bowery]]'' (1933), also starring [[George Raft]], Jackie Cooper and [[Fay Wray]], and featuring [[Pert Kelton]], under the direction of [[Raoul Walsh]]. The picture was a smash hit.\n\nBack at MGM he played the title role of [[Pancho Villa]] in ''[[Viva Villa!]]'' (1933) and was reunited with Dressler in ''[[Tugboat Annie]]'' (1933), a massive hit. He was [[Long John Silver]] in ''[[Treasure Island (1934 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1934), described as a box office \"disappointment\"<ref>THE YEAR IN HOLLYWOOD: 1984 May Be Remembered as the Beginning of the Sweetness-and-Light Era\nBy DOUGLAS W. CHURCHILL.HOLLYWOOD.. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 30 Dec 1934: X5.</ref> despite being MGM's third largest hit of the season, and remains currently viewed as featuring one of Beery's iconic performances.\n\nBeery returned to Twentieth Century Productions for ''[[The Mighty Barnum]]'' (1934) in which he played [[P.T. Barnum]] again. Back at MGM he was a kindly sergeant in ''[[West Point of the Air]]'' (1935) and was in an all-star spectacular, ''[[China Seas (film)|China Seas]]'' (1935), this time billed beneath Clark Gable.\n\n''[[O'Shaughnessy's Boy]]'' (1935) reunited Beery and Jackie Cooper. He had the lead as the drunken uncle in MGM's adaptation of ''[[Ah, Wilderness! (film)|Ah, Wilderness!]]'' (1936) and went back to Twentieth Century - now [[20th Century Fox]] - for ''[[A Message to Garcia (1936 film)|A Message to Garcia]]'' (1936).\n\nAt MGM he was in ''[[Old Hutch]]'' (1936) and ''[[The Good Old Soak]]'' (1937) then he was back at Fox for ''[[Slave Ship (1937 film)|Slave Ship]]'' (1937), taking second billing under [[Warner Baxter]], a rarity for Beery after ''Min and Bill'' catapulted his career into the stratosphere in 1931, during which he received top billing in all but six films (''Min and Bill'', ''Grand Hotel'', ''Tugboat Annie'', ''Dinner at Eight'', ''China Seas'' and ''Slave Ship'').\n\n===Decline===\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2019}}\nThe status of Beery's films went into a decline, possibly due to a scandal in which Beery was implicated in the death of [[Ted Healy]] in 1937, which was apparently kept out of the newspapers by the studio's \"fixer\" [[Eddie Mannix]], who eventually became head of MGM. After an abrupt European vacation, Beery was in ''[[The Bad Man of Brimstone]]'' (1938) with [[Dennis O'Keefe]] (and Noah Beery Sr. in a cameo role as a bartender), ''[[Port of Seven Seas]]'' (1938) with [[Maureen O'Sullivan]], ''[[Stablemates]]'' (1938) with [[Mickey Rooney]], ''[[Stand Up and Fight (film)|Stand Up and Fight]]'' (1939) with [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], ''[[Sergeant Madden]]'' (1939) with [[Tom Brown (actor)|Tom Brown]], ''[[Thunder Afloat]]'' (1939) with [[Chester Morris]], ''[[The Man from Dakota]]'' (1940) with [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and ''[[20 Mule Team]]'' (1940) with [[Marjorie Rambeau]], [[Anne Baxter]] and [[Noah Beery Jr.]], enjoying top billing in all of them.\n\n''[[Wyoming (1940 film)|Wyoming]]'' (1940) teamed Beery with [[Marjorie Main]]. After ''[[The Bad Man (1941 film)|The Bad Man]]'' (1941), which also stars [[Lionel Barrymore]] and future US president [[Ronald Reagan]], and was the remake of a [[Walter Huston]] picture, MGM reunited Beery and Main in ''[[Barnacle Bill (1941 film)|Barnacle Bill]]'' (1941), ''[[The Bugle Sounds]]'' (1941), and ''[[Jackass Mail]]'' (1942).\n\nBeery did a war film, ''[[Salute to the Marines]]'' (1943) then was back with Main in ''[[Rationing (film)|Rationing]]'' (1944). ''[[Barbary Coast Gent]]'' (1944), a broad Western comedy in which Beery played a bombastic con man, teamed him with [[Binnie Barnes]]. He did another war film, ''[[This Man's Navy]]'' (1945), then made another Western with Main, ''[[Bad Bascomb (film)|Bad Bascomb]]'' (1946), a huge hit, helped by [[Margaret O'Brien]]'s casting.\n\n''[[The Mighty McGurk]]'' (1947) put Beery with another child star of the studio, [[Dean Stockwell]]. ''[[Alias a Gentleman]]'' (1947) was the first of Beery's movies to lose money during the sound era.

Mayer sighed and said, 'Yes, Howard, Beery's a son of a bitch.  But he's ''our'' son of a bitch.'  Strickling got the point.  A family has to be tolerant of its black sheep, particularly if they brought a lot of money into the family fold, which Beery certainly did.\"<ref>Rooney, M. ''Life is Too Short''.

Smith; 1916\u20131989) filed a paternity suit against Beery. Beery, through his lawyer, Norman Ronald Tyre (1910\u20132002), initially offered $6,000 as a settlement, but denied being the father.  Gloria had given birth on February 7, 1948, to Johan Richard Wallace Schumm.  Gloria, in 1924, divorced Stuttgart-born Hollywood actor [[Hans Schumm]] ''(n\u00e9'' Johann Josef Eugen Schumm; 1896\u20131990), but remarried him August 21, 1947, after realizing that she was pregnant.  Prior to remarrying [[Hans Schumm]], Gloria, on August 4, 1947, met with Beery at his home, where he gave her the name and address of a physician to submit an examination.<ref name=\"Long-Beach-Independent 1948 Apr 29\" />  At or around that time, she also asked Beery to marry her to ''legitimatize the expected child'' (her words), which Beery refused.\n\nAccording to newspapers, Gloria claimed to have been intimate with Wallace Beery on or about May 1, 1947, at his home in [[Beverly Hills]] (in the court proceedings, however, she claimed to have been intimate with Beery on May 17, 1947).  Beery conceded that he had known Gloria for about 15 years and that, under the pseudonym \"Gloria Whitney,\" she had played [[bit role]]s in 6 films that he starred in.  She again separated from [[Hans Schumm]] April 15, 1948.\n\n=== Death, estate, and continuing paternity suit ===\n[[File:Wallace Beery Grave.JPG|thumb|150px|Grave at Forest Lawn Glendale]]\nBeery died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on April 15, 1949 (14 months, 1 week, and 1 day after Johan Schumm's birth) \u2014 while the suit was pending.  Beery had been reading a newspaper at his [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] home when he collapsed.<ref>http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-wallace-beery-19490417-story.html</ref>  His body was interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]].  The inscription on his grave reads, \"No man is indispensable but some are irreplaceable.\"\n\nBeery died [[intestate]].  In the paternity suit, Gloria Schumm's attorneys demanded $104,135 against Beery's $2,220,000 estate.  In February 1952, Judge Newcomb Condee approved a $26,750 settlement from the estate.  Gloria Schumm accepted the settlement, and Beery's paternity of Johan Schumm was not acknowledged.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nWhen Mickey Rooney's [[Joe Yule|father]] died less than a year later, Rooney arranged to have him buried next to his old friend.  \"I thought it was fitting that these two comedians should rest in peace, side by side,\" he wrote.<ref>Rooney, M. ''Life is Too Short''. Villard Books (1991), p. 239. {{ISBN|0679401954}}.</ref>\n\n=== Enduring case law ===\nThe paternity suit, and subsequent suits \u2013 including appeals \u2013 extended through about 1952 and were internationally publicized, particularly in [[gossip columnist|gossip columns]] and [[Gossip magazine|tabloids]]. The litigation has endured as [[case law]] with, among other things, treatises addressing the rights of [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] offspring against [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]] heirs in races for [[inheritance]].<ref name=\"Schumm-v-Berg\" /><ref name=\"Johann-Schumm-photos 1952\" /><ref name=\"Miller 2002\" /><ref name=\"Drennan 2016 Schumm v. Berg\" /><ref name=\"George-Korobkin 2017\" />\n\nThe upshot was that Schumm's paternity suit against Beery's estate put would-be half-siblings and other would-be family [[legatees]], including a would-be uncle, [[Noah Beery, Sr.]], in the position as ''[[de facto]]'' defendants.  Phyllis Ann Riley was not named in Beery's will.  Part of plaintiff's claim, initially, hinged on whether an oral agreement was binding. Gloria had claimed that Beery, while alive, agreed to provide for the child.  However, on November 17, 1949, Judge William B. McKesson (1895\u20131967) threw out Gloria's claim. The judge reasoned that any oral agreement between the two, specifically any that was intended to provide for maintenance and care of a minor, was not binding because the amount allegedly agreed upon was in excess of $500, which must be made in writing.<ref name=\"LATimes 1949 Nov 18\" />\n\nAnother matter in the case hinged on a \"[[Peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]]\" rule. That is, in order for any agreement, oral or written, between Wallace and Gloria to be binding, there must be [[consideration]].  The court, initially, found that Beery agreed to an oral contract where Gloria would (i) include the name \"Wallace\" in the child's name if a male, or \"Wally\" if a female, and (ii) refrain from filing a paternity suit that both agreed would damage Beery's \"social and professional standing as a prominent motion picture star.\"\n\nGenerally, under California state law at the time, a father who neither marries the mother nor acknowledges paternity does not have a right to name the child.  That right belongs to the mother. In exchange for Gloria's promise to name the child \"Wallace\" or \"Wally\" (the promise representing a form of [[consideration]]), Wallace Beery agreed to arrange for the payment of $100 per week to the child (as a [[third-party beneficiary]] under the contract), plus a lump sum of $25,000 to the child when he or she attained age 21, in addition to the customary obligation to pay for the \"maintenance, support and education according to the station in life and standard of living of Wallace Beery.\"<ref name=\"Drennan 2016 Schumm v. Berg\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Wallace Beery posthumously received a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1960. His star is located at 7001 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref name=hwof/>\n\nBeery is mentioned in the film ''[[Barton Fink]]'', in which the lead character has been hired to write a wrestling screenplay to star Beery.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/movies/film-he-s-nobody-important-really-just-a-movie-writer.html|title=FILM; He's Nobody Important, Really.

Beery appeared in some 250 films during a 36-year career. His contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] stipulated in 1932 that he would be paid $1 more than any other contract player at the studio. This made Beery the highest-paid film actor in the world during the early 1930s. He was the brother of actor [[Noah Beery Sr.]] and uncle of actor [[Noah Beery Jr.]]\n\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Beery was posthumously inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] with a motion pictures star in 1960. His star is located at 7001 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref name=hwof>[http://www.walkoffame.com/wallace-beery Walk of Fame Stars-Wallace Beery]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBeery was born the youngest of three boys in 1885 in [[Clay County, Missouri]], near [[Smithville, Missouri|Smithville]].<ref name=\"Missouri Biography 1999\">''Dictionary of Missouri Biography'', Lawrence O. Christensen, University of Missouri Press, 1999.</ref> The Beery family left the farm in the 1890s and moved to nearby [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where the father was a police officer.\n\nWallace Beery attended the Chase School in Kansas City and took piano lessons as well, but showed little love for academic matters. He ran away from home twice, the first time returning after a short time, quitting school and working in the Kansas City [[Classification yard|train yards]] as an [[Wiper (occupation)|engine wiper]].<ref name=\"Missouri Biography 1999\"/> Beery ran away from home a second time at age 16, and joined the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus|Ringling Brothers Circus]] as an assistant [[elephant]] trainer. He left two years later, after being clawed by a [[leopard]].\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Wallace Beery (circa 1914).jpg|left|thumb|<center>Wallace Beery circa 1914</center>]]\n[[File:Dreamy Sweedy (cinema 1914) (3109252361).jpg|thumb|upright|Beery as [[Sweedie]] the Swedish maid (1914)]]\n\n===Early career===\nWallace Beery joined his older brother Noah in New York City in 1904, finding work in comic opera as a baritone and began to appear on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as well as [[summer stock theatre]]. He appeared in ''The Belle of the West'' in 1905. His most notable early role came in 1907 when he starred in ''The Yankee Tourist'' to good reviews.<ref>https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/the-yankee-tourist-6354</ref>\n\n===Comedy film star - Essanay Studios===\nIn 1913, he moved to Chicago to work for [[Essanay Studios]]. His first movie was likely a comedy short, ''[[His Athletic Wife]]'' (1913).\n\nBeery was then cast as [[Sweedie]], a Swedish maid character he played in [[Drag queen|drag]] in a series of short comedy films from 1914\u201316. ''[[Sweedie Learns to Swim]]'' (1914) co-starred [[Ben Turpin]]. ''[[Sweedie Goes to College]]'' (1915) starred [[Gloria Swanson]], whom Beery married the following year.<ref name=\"Sonneborn 2002\" />\n\nOther Beery films (mostly shorts) from this period included ''[[In and Out (1914 film)|In and Out]]'' (1914), ''[[The Ups and Downs (1914 film)|The Ups and Downs]]'' (1914), ''[[Cheering a Husband]]'' (1914), ''[[Madame Double X]]'' (1914), ''[[Ain't It the Truth (film)|Ain't It the Truth]]'' (1915), ''[[Two Hearts That Beat as Ten]]'' (1915), and ''[[The Fable of the Roistering Blades]]'' (1915).\n\n''[[The Slim Princess (1915 film)|The Slim Princess]]'' (1915), with [[Francis X. Bushman]], was one of the earliest feature-length films. Beery also did ''[[The Broken Pledge]]'' (1915) and ''[[A Dash of Courage]]'' (1916), both with Swanson.\n\nBeery was a German soldier in ''[[The Little American]]'' (1917) with [[Mary Pickford]], directed by [[Cecil B. De Mille]]. He did some comedies for [[Mack Sennett]], ''[[Maggie's First False Step]]'' (1917) and ''[[Teddy at the Throttle]]'' (1917), but he would gradually leave that genre and specialize in portrayals of villains prior to becoming a major leading man during the sound era.\n\n===Villainous roles===\nIn 1917 Beery portrayed [[Pancho Villa]] in ''[[Patria (1917 film)|Patria]]'' at a time when Villa was still active in [[Mexico]]. (Beery reprised the role 17 years later in ''[[Viva Villa!]]''.)\n\nBeery was a villainous German in ''[[The Unpardonable Sin]]'' (1919) with [[Blanche Sweet]]. For Paramount he did ''[[The Love Burglar]]'' (1919) with [[Wallace Reid]]; ''[[Victory (1919 film)|Victory]]'' (1919), with Jack Holt; ''[[Behind the Door (film)|Behind the Door]]'' (1919), as another villainous German; and ''[[The Life Line]]'' (1919) with Holt.\n\nBeery was the villain in five major releases in 1920: ''[[813 (film)|813]]''; ''[[The Virgin of Stamboul]]'' for director [[Tod Browning]]; ''[[The Mollycoddle]]'' with [[Douglas Fairbanks]], in which Fairbanks and Beery fistfought as they tumbled down a steep mountain (see the photograph in the gallery below); and in the non-comedic [[Western (genre)|Western]] ''[[The Round-Up (1920 film)|The Round-Up]]'' starring [[Roscoe Arbuckle]] as an obese cowboy in a well-received serious film with the tagline \"Nobody loves a fat man.\" Beery continued his villainy cycle that year with ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1920 American film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'', playing Magua.\n\nBeery had a supporting part in ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'' (1920) with [[Rudolph Valentino]]. He was a villainous Tong leader in ''[[A Tale of Two Worlds]]'' (1921) and was the bad guy again in ''[[Sleeping Acres]]'' (1922), ''[[Wild Honey (1922 film)|Wild Honey]]'' (1922), and ''[[I Am the Law (1922 film)|I Am the Law]]'' (1922), which also featured his brother Noah Beery Sr..\n\n===Historical films===\nBeery had a large then-rare heroic part as [[King Richard I]] (Richard the Lion-Hearted) in ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (1922), starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]] as [[Robin Hood]]. The lavish movie was a huge success and spawned a sequel the following year starring Beery in the title role of ''[[Richard the Lion-Hearted (1923 film)|Richard the Lion-Hearted]]''.\n\nBeery had an important unbilled cameo as \"the Ape-Man\" in ''[[A Blind Bargain]]'' (1922) starring [[Lon Chaney]] (Beery is seen crouching, in full ape-man make-up, in the background of some of the movie's posters), and a supporting role in ''[[The Flame of Life]]'' (1923). He played another historical king, [[Philip IV of Spain|King Philip IV]] of Spain in ''[[The Spanish Dancer]]'' (1923) with [[Pola Negri]].\n\nBeery starred in an action melodrama, ''[[Stormswept]]'' (1923) for [[FBO Films]] alongside his elder brother, [[Noah Beery Sr.]]. The tagline on the movie's posters was \"Wallace and Noah Beery - The Two Greatest Character Actors on the American Screen.\"\n\nBeery played his third royal, the [[Duc de Tours]], in ''[[Ashes of Vengeance]]'' (1923) with [[Norma Talmadge]], then did ''[[Drifting (1923 film)|Drifting]]'' (1923) with [[Priscilla Dean]] for director Browning.\n\nBeery had the titular role in ''[[Bavu]]'' (1923), about [[Bolsheviks]] and the [[Russian Revolution]]. He co-starred with [[Buster Keaton]] in the comedy ''[[Three Ages]]'' (1923), the first feature Keaton wrote, produced, directed and starred in.\n\nBeery was a villain in ''[[The Eternal Struggle (film)|The Eternal Struggle]]'' (1923), a [[Northwest Mounted Police|Mountie]] drama, produced by [[Louis B. Mayer]], who would eventually become crucial to Beery's career. He was reunited with Dean and Browning in ''[[White Tiger (1923 film)|White Tiger]]'' (1923), then played the title role in the aforementioned ''[[Richard the Lion-Hearted (1923 film)|Richard the Lion-Hearted]]'' (1923), a sequel to ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]'' based on [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[The Talisman (Scott novel)|The Talisman]]''.\n\nBeery was in ''[[The Drums of Jeopardy (1923 film)|The Drums of Jeopardy]]'' (1923) and had a supporting role in ''[[The Sea Hawk (1924 film)|The Sea Hawk]]'' (1924) for director Frank Lloyd. He also appeared in a supporting role for [[Clarence Brown]]'s ''[[The Signal Tower]]'' (1925) starring [[Virginia Valli]] and  [[Rockliffe Fellowes]].\n\n===Paramount===\nBeery signed a contract with Paramount Pictures. He had a support role in ''[[Adventure (1925 film)|Adventure]]'' (1925) directed by [[Victor Fleming]].\n\nAt First National, he was given the star role of [[Professor Challenger]] in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s dinosaur epic ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925), arguably his silent performance most frequently screened in the modern era. Beery was top billed in Paramount's ''[[The Devil's Cargo]]'' (1925) for Victor Fleming, and supported in ''[[The Night Club]]'' (1925), ''[[The Pony Express (1925 film)|The Pony Express]]'' (1925) for [[James Cruze]], and ''[[The Wanderer (1925 film)|The Wanderer]]'' (1925) for [[Raoul Walsh]].\n\nBeery starred in a comedy with [[Raymond Hatton]], ''[[Behind the Front (film)|Behind the Front]]'' (1926) and he was a villain in ''[[Volcano! (1926 film)|Volcano!]]'' (1926). He was a bos'n in ''[[Old Ironsides (film)|Old Ironsides]]'' (1926) for director James Cruze, with [[Charles Farrell]] in the romantic lead.\n\nBeery had the title role in the baseball movie ''[[Casey at the Bat (film)|Casey at the Bat]]'' (1927). He was reunited with Hatton in ''[[Fireman, Save My Child (1927 film)|Fireman, Save My Child]]'' (1927) and ''[[Now We're in the Air]]'' (1927). The latter also featured [[Louise Brooks]] who was Beery's co star in ''[[Beggars of Life]]'' (1928), directed by [[William Wellman]], which was Paramount's first part-talkie movie.\n\nThere was a fourth comedy with Hatton, ''[[Wife Savers]]'' (1929), then Beery starred in ''[[Chinatown Nights (1929 film)|Chinatown Nights]]'' (1929) for Wellman, produced by a young [[David O. Selznick]]. This film was shot silent with the voices dubbed in by the actors afterward, which worked spectacularly well with Beery's resonant voice, although the technique was not used again during the silent era for another full-length feature. Beery then played in ''[[Stairs of Sand]]'' (1929), a [[Western (genre)|Western]] also starring [[Jean Arthur]] (who would play the leading lady in the Western film ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' twenty-four years later) before being fired by Paramount.\n\n===MGM===\n[[File:The-Big-House-1930.jpg|thumb|[[Chester Morris]] and Wallace Beery in ''[[The Big House (1930 film)|The Big House]]'' (1930)]]\n[[File:DresslerBeeryJordanMinBill1930Trailer.jpg|right|thumb|With [[Marie Dressler]] in ''[[Min and Bill]]'' (1930)]]\n[[File:The Champ (1931) trailer 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jackie Cooper]], [[Edward Brophy]], and Wallace Beery in ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]'' (1931)]]\n[[File:Tugboat Annie 1933.jpg|thumb|''[[Tugboat Annie]]'' (1933)]]\n[[Irving Thalberg]] signed Beery to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] as a character actor. The association began well when Beery played the savage convict \"Butch,\" a role originally intended for [[Lon Chaney Sr.]] (who died that same year), in the highly successful 1930 prison film ''[[The Big House (1930 film)|The Big House]]'', directed by [[George W. Hill]]; Beery was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\nBeery's second film for MGM was also a huge success: ''[[Billy the Kid (1930 film)|Billy the Kid]]'' (1930), an early [[widescreen]] picture in which he played [[Pat Garrett]]. He supported [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] in ''[[Way for a Sailor]]'' (1930) and [[Grace Moore]] in ''[[A Lady's Morals]]'' (1930), portraying [[P.T. Barnum]] in the latter.\n\n===Stardom===\nBeery was well established as a leading man and top rank character actor. What really made him one of the cinema's foremost stars was ''[[Min and Bill]]'' (1930) opposite [[Marie Dressler]] and directed by [[George W. Hill]], a sensational success.<ref name=\"scott\">Scott Eyman, ''Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer'', Robson, 2005, p. 191 {{ISBN|9781861058928}}</ref>\n\nBeery made a third film with Hill, ''[[The Secret Six]]'' (1931), a gangster movie with [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Clark Gable]] in key supporting roles. The picture was popular but was surpassed at the box office by ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]'', which Beery made with [[Jackie Cooper]] for director [[King Vidor]]. The film, especially written for Beery, was another box office sensation. Beery shared the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] with [[Fredric March]].

''[[Hell Divers]]'' (1932), a naval airplane epic also starring a young [[Clark Gable]] billed under Beery, was a big hit. So too was the all-star ''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), in which Beery was billed fourth, under [[Greta Garbo]], [[John Barrymore]], and [[Joan Crawford]], one of the very few times he would not be top billed for the rest of his career. In 1932 his contract with MGM stipulated that he be paid a dollar more than any other contract player at the studio, making him the world's highest-paid actor.\n\nBeery was a German wrestler in ''[[Flesh (1932 film)|Flesh]]'' (1932), a hit directed by [[John Ford]] but Ford removed his directorial credit before the film opened, so the picture screened with no director listed despite being labeled \"A John Ford Production\" in the opening title card. Next Beery was in another all-star ensemble blockbuster, ''[[Dinner at Eight (1933 film)|Dinner at Eight]]'' (1933), with Jean Harlow holding her own as Beery's comically bickering wife. This time Beery was billed third, under [[Marie Dressler]] and [[John Barrymore]].\n\nBeery was loaned out to the new [[Twentieth Century Pictures]] for the boisterously fast-paced comedy/drama ''[[The Bowery (film)|The Bowery]]'' (1933), also starring [[George Raft]], Jackie Cooper and [[Fay Wray]], and featuring [[Pert Kelton]], under the direction of [[Raoul Walsh]]. The picture was a smash hit.\n\nBack at MGM he played the title role of [[Pancho Villa]] in ''[[Viva Villa!]]'' (1933) and was reunited with Dressler in ''[[Tugboat Annie]]'' (1933), a massive hit. He was [[Long John Silver]] in ''[[Treasure Island (1934 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1934), described as a box office \"disappointment\"<ref>THE YEAR IN HOLLYWOOD: 1984 May Be Remembered as the Beginning of the Sweetness-and-Light Era\nBy DOUGLAS W.

Barnum]] again. Back at MGM he was a kindly sergeant in ''[[West Point of the Air]]'' (1935) and was in an all-star spectacular, ''[[China Seas (film)|China Seas]]'' (1935), this time billed beneath Clark Gable.\n\n''[[O'Shaughnessy's Boy]]'' (1935) reunited Beery and Jackie Cooper. He had the lead as the drunken uncle in MGM's adaptation of ''[[Ah, Wilderness! (film)|Ah, Wilderness!]]'' (1936) and went back to Twentieth Century - now [[20th Century Fox]] - for ''[[A Message to Garcia (1936 film)|A Message to Garcia]]'' (1936).\n\nAt MGM he was in ''[[Old Hutch]]'' (1936) and ''[[The Good Old Soak]]'' (1937) then he was back at Fox for ''[[Slave Ship (1937 film)|Slave Ship]]'' (1937), taking second billing under [[Warner Baxter]], a rarity for Beery after ''Min and Bill'' catapulted his career into the stratosphere in 1931, during which he received top billing in all but six films (''Min and Bill'', ''Grand Hotel'', ''Tugboat Annie'', ''Dinner at Eight'', ''China Seas'' and ''Slave Ship'').\n\n===Decline===\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2019}}\nThe status of Beery's films went into a decline, possibly due to a scandal in which Beery was implicated in the death of [[Ted Healy]] in 1937, which was apparently kept out of the newspapers by the studio's \"fixer\" [[Eddie Mannix]], who eventually became head of MGM. After an abrupt European vacation, Beery was in ''[[The Bad Man of Brimstone]]'' (1938) with [[Dennis O'Keefe]] (and Noah Beery Sr. in a cameo role as a bartender), ''[[Port of Seven Seas]]'' (1938) with [[Maureen O'Sullivan]], ''[[Stablemates]]'' (1938) with [[Mickey Rooney]], ''[[Stand Up and Fight (film)|Stand Up and Fight]]'' (1939) with [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], ''[[Sergeant Madden]]'' (1939) with [[Tom Brown (actor)|Tom Brown]], ''[[Thunder Afloat]]'' (1939) with [[Chester Morris]], ''[[The Man from Dakota]]'' (1940) with [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and ''[[20 Mule Team]]'' (1940) with [[Marjorie Rambeau]], [[Anne Baxter]] and [[Noah Beery Jr.]], enjoying top billing in all of them.\n\n''[[Wyoming (1940 film)|Wyoming]]'' (1940) teamed Beery with [[Marjorie Main]]. After ''[[The Bad Man (1941 film)|The Bad Man]]'' (1941), which also stars [[Lionel Barrymore]] and future US president [[Ronald Reagan]], and was the remake of a [[Walter Huston]] picture, MGM reunited Beery and Main in ''[[Barnacle Bill (1941 film)|Barnacle Bill]]'' (1941), ''[[The Bugle Sounds]]'' (1941), and ''[[Jackass Mail]]'' (1942).\n\nBeery did a war film, ''[[Salute to the Marines]]'' (1943) then was back with Main in ''[[Rationing (film)|Rationing]]'' (1944). ''[[Barbary Coast Gent]]'' (1944), a broad Western comedy in which Beery played a bombastic con man, teamed him with [[Binnie Barnes]]. He did another war film, ''[[This Man's Navy]]'' (1945), then made another Western with Main, ''[[Bad Bascomb (film)|Bad Bascomb]]'' (1946), a huge hit, helped by [[Margaret O'Brien]]'s casting.\n\n''[[The Mighty McGurk]]'' (1947) put Beery with another child star of the studio, [[Dean Stockwell]]. ''[[Alias a Gentleman]]'' (1947) was the first of Beery's movies to lose money during the sound era. Beery received top billing for ''[[A Date with Judy (film)|A Date with Judy]]'' (1949), a hugely popular musical featuring [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. Beery's last film, again featuring Main, ''[[Big Jack (film)|Big Jack]]'' (1949), also lost money according to Mannix's reckoning.<ref name=\"Mannix\">{{Citation | title = The Eddie Mannix Ledger | publisher = Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study | place = Los Angeles}}.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Wallace Beery in 20 Mule Team (1940).png|thumb|right|''[[20 Mule Team]]'' (1940)]]\n[[File:Wallace Beery in The Bad Man (1941).png|thumb|right|''[[The Bad Man (1941 film)|The Bad Man]]'' (1941)]]\n\n=== First marriage ===\nOn March 27, 1916, at the age of {{age|1885|04|01|1916|02|20}}, Beery married {{age|1899|03|27|1916|03|27}}-year-old actress [[Gloria Swanson]] in Los Angeles.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Gloria Swanson: The Ultimate Star|last=Shearer|first=Stephen Michael|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|year=2013|isbn=9781250013668|location=|pages=}}</ref> The two had co-starred in ''[[Sweedie Goes to College]].''<ref name=\"Sonneborn 2002\" />  Although Beery had enjoyed popularity with his ''Sweedie'' shorts, his career had taken a dip, and during the marriage to Swanson, he relied on her as a breadwinner.

Mayer sighed and said, 'Yes, Howard, Beery's a son of a bitch.  But he's ''our'' son of a bitch.'  Strickling got the point.

Smith; 1916\u20131989) filed a paternity suit against Beery. Beery, through his lawyer, Norman Ronald Tyre (1910\u20132002), initially offered $6,000 as a settlement, but denied being the father.  Gloria had given birth on February 7, 1948, to Johan Richard Wallace Schumm.  Gloria, in 1924, divorced Stuttgart-born Hollywood actor [[Hans Schumm]] ''(n\u00e9'' Johann Josef Eugen Schumm; 1896\u20131990), but remarried him August 21, 1947, after realizing that she was pregnant.  Prior to remarrying [[Hans Schumm]], Gloria, on August 4, 1947, met with Beery at his home, where he gave her the name and address of a physician to submit an examination.<ref name=\"Long-Beach-Independent 1948 Apr 29\" />  At or around that time, she also asked Beery to marry her to ''legitimatize the expected child'' (her words), which Beery refused.\n\nAccording to newspapers, Gloria claimed to have been intimate with Wallace Beery on or about May 1, 1947, at his home in [[Beverly Hills]] (in the court proceedings, however, she claimed to have been intimate with Beery on May 17, 1947).  Beery conceded that he had known Gloria for about 15 years and that, under the pseudonym \"Gloria Whitney,\" she had played [[bit role]]s in 6 films that he starred in.  She again separated from [[Hans Schumm]] April 15, 1948.\n\n=== Death, estate, and continuing paternity suit ===\n[[File:Wallace Beery Grave.JPG|thumb|150px|Grave at Forest Lawn Glendale]]\nBeery died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on April 15, 1949 (14 months, 1 week, and 1 day after Johan Schumm's birth) \u2014 while the suit was pending.  Beery had been reading a newspaper at his [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] home when he collapsed.<ref>http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-wallace-beery-19490417-story.html</ref>  His body was interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]].  The inscription on his grave reads, \"No man is indispensable but some are irreplaceable.\"  \n\nBeery died [[intestate]].  In the paternity suit, Gloria Schumm's attorneys demanded $104,135 against Beery's $2,220,000 estate.  In February 1952, Judge Newcomb Condee approved a $26,750 settlement from the estate.  Gloria Schumm accepted the settlement, and Beery's paternity of Johan Schumm was not acknowledged.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nWhen Mickey Rooney's [[Joe Yule|father]] died less than a year later, Rooney arranged to have him buried next to his old friend.  \"I thought it was fitting that these two comedians should rest in peace, side by side,\" he wrote.<ref>Rooney, M. ''Life is Too Short''. Villard Books (1991), p. 239. {{ISBN|0679401954}}.</ref>\n\n=== Enduring case law ===\nThe paternity suit, and subsequent suits \u2013 including appeals \u2013 extended through about 1952 and were internationally publicized, particularly in [[gossip columnist|gossip columns]] and [[Gossip magazine|tabloids]]. The litigation has endured as [[case law]] with, among other things, treatises addressing the rights of [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] offspring against [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]] heirs in races for [[inheritance]].<ref name=\"Schumm-v-Berg\" /><ref name=\"Johann-Schumm-photos 1952\" /><ref name=\"Miller 2002\" /><ref name=\"Drennan 2016 Schumm v. Berg\" /><ref name=\"George-Korobkin 2017\" />\n\nThe upshot was that Schumm's paternity suit against Beery's estate put would-be half-siblings and other would-be family [[legatees]], including a would-be uncle, [[Noah Beery, Sr.]], in the position as ''[[de facto]]'' defendants.  Phyllis Ann Riley was not named in Beery's will.  Part of plaintiff's claim, initially, hinged on whether an oral agreement was binding. Gloria had claimed that Beery, while alive, agreed to provide for the child.  However, on November 17, 1949, Judge William B. McKesson (1895\u20131967) threw out Gloria's claim. The judge reasoned that any oral agreement between the two, specifically any that was intended to provide for maintenance and care of a minor, was not binding because the amount allegedly agreed upon was in excess of $500, which must be made in writing.<ref name=\"LATimes 1949 Nov 18\" />\n\nAnother matter in the case hinged on a \"[[Peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]]\" rule. That is, in order for any agreement, oral or written, between Wallace and Gloria to be binding, there must be [[consideration]].  The court, initially, found that Beery agreed to an oral contract where Gloria would (i) include the name \"Wallace\" in the child's name if a male, or \"Wally\" if a female, and (ii) refrain from filing a paternity suit that both agreed would damage Beery's \"social and professional standing as a prominent motion picture star.\"\n\nGenerally, under California state law at the time, a father who neither marries the mother nor acknowledges paternity does not have a right to name the child.  That right belongs to the mother. In exchange for Gloria's promise to name the child \"Wallace\" or \"Wally\" (the promise representing a form of [[consideration]]), Wallace Beery agreed to arrange for the payment of $100 per week to the child (as a [[third-party beneficiary]] under the contract), plus a lump sum of $25,000 to the child when he or she attained age 21, in addition to the customary obligation to pay for the \"maintenance, support and education according to the station in life and standard of living of Wallace Beery.\"<ref name=\"Drennan 2016 Schumm v. Berg\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nFor his contributions to the film industry, Wallace Beery posthumously received a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1960. His star is located at 7001 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref name=hwof/>\n\nBeery is mentioned in the film ''[[Barton Fink]]'', in which the lead character has been hired to write a wrestling screenplay to star Beery.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/movies/film-he-s-nobody-important-really-just-a-movie-writer.html|title=FILM; He's Nobody Important, Really.

A passing loop is double-ended and connected to the main track at both ends, though a dead end siding known as a [[refuge siding]], which is much less convenient, can be used. A similar arrangement is used on the [[gauntlet track]] of [[cable railway]]s and [[funicular]]s, and in [[passing place]]s on [[single-track road]]s.\n\nIdeally, the loop should be longer than all trains needing to cross at that point.  The first train to arrive must stop or move very slowly, while the second to arrive may pass at speed.  If one train is too long for the loop it must wait for the opposing train to enter the loop before proceeding, taking a few minutes. Ideally, the shorter train should arrive first and leave second. If both trains are too long for the loop, time-consuming \"see-sawing\" (or \"double saw-by\") operations are required for the trains to cross (see [[Tawa railway station#Train crossing|Tawa railway station]]).<ref>[http://www.sdmrra.org/Odds-n-Ends/saw_bye.htm \"double saw-by\"]</ref>\n\nOn railway systems that use [[Railway platform|platforms]], especially high-level platforms, for passengers to board and disembark from trains, the platforms may be provided on both the main and loop tracks or possibly on only one of them.\n\n== Systems of working ==\n\n=== Main and loop ===\n{{Routemap\n| collapsible = no\n| legend      = track\n| float       = left\n| map         =\nvCONTg-\nvSHI2gl-\ncBS\\vSTR\\cBS\ncBS\\vSTR\\cBS\nvSHI2g+l-\nvCONTf-\n}}\n\n{{Routemap\n| collapsible = no\n| legend      = track\n| float       = left\n| map         =\nvCONTg-\nvSHI2gl-\ncBS\\vSTR\\c\ncBS\\vSTR\\c\ncBS\\vSHI2g+l-\\c\ncBS\\dSTR\\cd\ncBS\\dSTR\\cd\nvCONTf-\n}}\nThe main line has straight track, while the loop line has low-speed [[Railroad switch|turnout]]s at either end. If the station has only one platform, then it is usually located on the main line.\n\nIf passenger trains are relatively few in number, and the likelihood of two passenger trains crossing each other low, the platform on the loop line may be omitted.\n\nIf the passenger train from one direction always arrives first, the platform on the loop line may also be omitted by extending the platform past the loop in that direction.\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>\n\n=== Platform road and through road ===\n{{Routemap\n| collapsible = no\n| legend      = track\n| float       = left\n| map         =\nCONTg\\c\ndSTRc2\\vSHI2gl-!~dSTR3\\c\ndSTR+1\\vSTR!~STRc4\\cBS\ndSTR2\\vSTR!~STRc3\\cBS\ndSTRc1\\vSHI2g+l-!~dSTR+4\\c\nCONTf\\c\n}}\nThe through road has straight track, while the platform road has low-speed turnouts at either end.\n\nA possible advantage of this layout is that trains scheduled to pass straight through the station can do so uninterrupted; they do not have to reduce their speed to pass through the curve. This layout is mostly used at local stations where many passenger trains do not stop.\n\nSince there is only one passenger platform, it is not convenient to cross two passenger trains if both stop.\n\nAn example is [[Scone railway station]], but the northern end was later rearranged to resemble a main and loop configuration. A disadvantage of the platform and through arrangement is the speed limits through the turnouts at each end.\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>\n\n=== Up and down working ===\n{{Routemap\n| collapsible = no\n| legend      = track\n| float       = left\n| map         =\nCONTg\nSPLa\ncBS\\dSTRg\\dSTR\\cBS\ncBS\\dSTR\\dSTRf\\cBS\nSPLe\nCONTf\n}}\nIn the example layout shown, trains take the left-hand track in their direction of running. Low-speed turnouts restrict the speed in one direction. Two platform faces are needed, and they can be provided either at a single [[island platform]] or two [[side platforms]] (as shown). Overtaking is not normally possible at this kind of up-and-down loop as some of the necessary signals are absent.\n\nCrossing loops using up-and-down working are very common in British practice. For one thing, fewer signals are required if the tracks in the station are signaled for one direction only; also, there is less likelihood of a collision caused by signalling a train onto the track reserved for trains in the opposing direction. In France, they often use spring switches and the speed is equally restricted in both directions.\n\nThe speed restriction in one direction can be eliminated with higher-speed turnouts, but this may require power operation, as the longer and heavier high-speed turnouts may be beyond the capability of manual lever operation.\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>\n\n=== Dead-end siding ===\n{{main|Refuge siding}}\n{{Routemap\n| collapsible = no\n| legend      = track\n| float       = left\n| map         =\ndCONTg\\c\nc\\vSHI2gl-\ncBS\\vSTR\ncBS\\vSTR-ENDEe\ndCONTf\\c\n}}\nRefuge sidings are used at locations with gradients too steep for heavy freight trains or steam haulage to depart from conventional passing loops, or confined spaces where a passing loop cannot be built. An extra parallel siding is often built at stations on refuge sidings so that two stopping trains can pass, and an extended catch point opposite the refuge siding may be added so as not to interfere with passing trains.\n\nAt [[Bombo railway station, New South Wales|Bombo]], Australia, the crossing loop had no platform, and as freight trains became longer it became inadequate to hold them.\n\n[[Molong railway station|Molong]] used to have a short loop, but it was replaced by a long stretch of a former branch line, which is a dead-end siding.\n\n[[Berry railway station|Berry]] has had its short loop removed and an even shorter dead-end siding substituted. Long freight trains do not need to cross each other here, and freight trains can cross passenger trains waiting in that short siding provided that the freight train arrives second and leaves first.\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>\n\n== Dynamic passing loop ==\nIf a crossing loop is several times the length of the trains using it, and is suitably signalled, then trains proceeding in opposite directions can pass (cross) each other without having to stop or even slow down. This greatly reduces the time lost by the first train to arrive at the crossing loop for the opposing train to go by. This system is referred to as a dynamic loop.\n\nIn the [[AusLink]] project for the [[Junee]] to [[Melbourne]] line, roughly every other section of single line will be [[track duplication|duplicated]] to provide so-called '''passing lanes'''.  About 220&nbsp;km of the 450&nbsp;km line will be duplicated.\n\nIn [[Sweden]], the passing loops are generally 750&nbsp;m long, made for cargo trains. Passenger trains are usually much shorter, at least on most single track lines, less than 200&nbsp;m. The signalling system now allows two passenger trains to cross without stopping, but one has to slow down to 40&nbsp;km/h, because of the limited length of the loop and the sharp curves in the switch points.\n\nFor [[Norway]] an investigation has been made about future high-speed railways, using 250&nbsp;km/h as cruise speed. The most promising link would be a new Oslo-Trondheim railway, which is suggested to be a single track along a 370&nbsp;km-long route. It is suggested to have about 15&nbsp;km-long passing loops, more like 15&nbsp;km double track, located about 80&nbsp;km apart. This would enable passing at 160&nbsp;km/h, but there could be only one train per hour per direction on the rail line. See also [[High-speed rail in Norway]].\n\n== Overlaps and catchpoints ==\n\nSome railways fit [[catchpoints]] at the ends of crossing loops so that if a train overruns the loop, it is derailed rather than collide with an opposing train.\n\nSince the available space for crossing loops is usually limited, they do not normally have an overlap (safety margin) between the starting signals and the end of the double line.  In Australia, the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation|Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC)]] policy provides for overlaps of about 500&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m respectively in an effort to avoid derailment or collision.\n\n== Automatic operation ==\n\nMany crossing loops are designed to operate automatically in an unattended mode. Such loops may be [[track circuit|track-circuited]] with home signals cleared by the approaching train. Some loops have the points in and out of the loop operated manually, albeit more recent examples have so-called self-restoring switches that allow trains to exit a loop without needing to change the points.\n\nOther forms of remote operation included [[Centralized traffic control]], in which a train controller changes points and signals from a remote office; and driver-operated points, which enable train crews to use a radio system to set the points from a distance.\n\n== Gradients ==\nThe design of crossing loops may have to be modified where there are severe gradients that make it difficult for a train to restart from a stationary position, or where the terrain is unsuitable for a normal loop.\n\nOne change would be to include runaway [[catchpoints]] on the downhill end, such as at the one at [[Tumulla railway station, New South Wales|Tumulla Railway Station,]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].\n\nOne oddity was [[Dombarton, New South Wales]] in Australia, where the crossing loop built to divide a long [[single track (rail)|single-line]] section on an extreme 1 in 30 (3.3%) gradient. The \"loop\" was built as a miniature zig-zag with a single track lower switchback on one side and a double track upper switchback on the other side, with a dive tunnel under the through track connecting the two.\n\nA refuge loop built on the [[ruling grade]] on [[Cowan Bank|Cowan bank]], New South Wales, Australia proved to be unworkable as the refuged train could not restart. This lesson was learned at Dombarton, where the uphill trains restart from level track. A refuge siding at Razorback halfway up the 1 in 75 ruling grade climb from [[Fish River (Oberon)|Fish River]] to [[Cullerin, New South Wales|Cullerin]] also allowed trains to restart from level track.\n\nA crossing loop on steep gradient may have [[catchpoints]] on the downhill end to reduce the impact of runaways.\n\n== Train length ==\n\nSince central operation of the points and signals from a single signal box is convenient, and since there are practical limits for the distance to these points and signals, crossing loops can have a system-wide effect on train sizes.  In New South Wales, mechanical operation of points and signals limited train lengths in the steam era to about 400&nbsp;m, which was only eased with the introduction of power-operated points and [[centralized traffic control]]. Train lengths are now as much as 1&thinsp;500&nbsp;m or 1&thinsp;800&nbsp;m.\n\nSee [[Longest trains]].\n\n== Line capacity ==\n\nLine capacity is partly determined by the distance between individual crossing loops. Ideally these should be located at [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]]-integer intervals along the track by travel time. The longest section between successive crossing loops will, like the weakest link in a chain, determine the overall line capacity.\n\n=== Short loops ===\n\nLong and short trains can cross at a short loop if the long train arrives second but leaves first.\n\nIt is best if all crossing loops are longer than the longest train.  Two long trains can cross at a short loop using a slow so-called see-saw process, which wastes time.\n\n== Double lines ==\n\nOvertaking loops can also be provided on double lines, one on each side, and these can be called '''Refuge Loops''' (if they are dead-ended they are known as [[refuge siding]]s, q.v.).\n\n== Right- and left-hand traffic ==\nCountries generally have a principle on which side trains shall meet, either on the left or on the right, generally the same for the whole country. But this is generally valid only on double track. On passing loops this principle is not necessarily used. Often the train that shall not stop uses the straight track. See also [[Right- and left-hand traffic]].\n\n== Accidents at crossing loops ==\n[[Image:CaseyJonesStamp.png|thumb|Casey Jones as depicted on a 3 cent [[postage stamp]] issued by the [[United States Postal Service]]]]\n* (1900) '''[[Casey Jones]]''' ([[Vaughan, Mississippi]], USA) - The legendary train driver (U.S.: ''engineer'') [[Casey Jones|John Luther \"Casey\" Jones]] was killed in an accident in 1900 involving trains too long to cross at a passing loop. The trains trying to cross were occupying both the main and loop tracks, and in addition, the train doing the see-saw was standing outside station limits. Jones was traveling fast in order to make up lost time, and could not stop in time to avoid [[Casey Jones#Death|a collision]].

A passing loop is double-ended and connected to the main track at both ends, though a dead end siding known as a [[refuge siding]], which is much less convenient, can be used. A similar arrangement is used on the [[gauntlet track]] of [[cable railway]]s and [[funicular]]s, and in [[passing place]]s on [[single-track road]]s.\n\nIdeally, the loop should be longer than all trains needing to cross at that point.  The first train to arrive must stop or move very slowly, while the second to arrive may pass at speed.  If one train is too long for the loop it must wait for the opposing train to enter the loop before proceeding, taking a few minutes. Ideally, the shorter train should arrive first and leave second. If both trains are too long for the loop, time-consuming \"see-sawing\" (or \"double saw-by\") operations are required for the trains to cross.<ref>[http://www.sdmrra.org/Odds-n-Ends/saw_bye.htm \"double saw-by\"]</ref>\n\nOn railway systems that use [[Railway platform|platforms]], especially high-level platforms, for passengers to board and disembark from trains, the platforms may be provided on both the main and loop tracks or possibly on only one of them.\n\n== Systems of working ==\n\n=== Main and loop ===\n{{Routemap\n| collapsible = no\n| legend      = track\n| float       = left\n| map         =\nvCONTg-\nvSHI2gl-\ncBS\\vSTR\\cBS\ncBS\\vSTR\\cBS\nvSHI2g+l-\nvCONTf-\n}}\n\n{{Routemap\n| collapsible = no\n| legend      = track\n| float       = left\n| map         =\nvCONTg-\nvSHI2gl-\ncBS\\vSTR\\c\ncBS\\vSTR\\c\ncBS\\vSHI2g+l-\\c\ncBS\\dSTR\\cd\ncBS\\dSTR\\cd\nvCONTf-\n}}\nThe main line has straight track, while the loop line has low-speed [[Railroad switch|turnout]]s at either end. If the station has only one platform, then it is usually located on the main line.\n\nIf passenger trains are relatively few in number, and the likelihood of two passenger trains crossing each other low, the platform on the loop line may be omitted.\n\nIf the passenger train from one direction always arrives first, the platform on the loop line may also be omitted by extending the platform past the loop in that direction.\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>\n\n=== Platform road and through road ===\n{{Routemap\n| collapsible = no\n| legend      = track\n| float       = left\n| map         =\nCONTg\\c\ndSTRc2\\vSHI2gl-!~dSTR3\\c\ndSTR+1\\vSTR!~STRc4\\cBS\ndSTR2\\vSTR!~STRc3\\cBS\ndSTRc1\\vSHI2g+l-!~dSTR+4\\c\nCONTf\\c\n}}\nThe through road has straight track, while the platform road has low-speed turnouts at either end.\n\nA possible advantage of this layout is that trains scheduled to pass straight through the station can do so uninterrupted; they do not have to reduce their speed to pass through the curve. This layout is mostly used at local stations where many passenger trains do not stop.\n\nSince there is only one passenger platform, it is not convenient to cross two passenger trains if both stop.\n\nAn example is [[Scone railway station]], but the northern end was later rearranged to resemble a main and loop configuration. A disadvantage of the platform and through arrangement is the speed limits through the turnouts at each end.\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>\n\n=== Up and down working ===\n{{Routemap\n| collapsible = no\n| legend      = track\n| float       = left\n| map         =\nCONTg\nSPLa\ncBS\\dSTRg\\dSTR\\cBS\ncBS\\dSTR\\dSTRf\\cBS\nSPLe\nCONTf\n}}\nIn the example layout shown, trains take the left-hand track in their direction of running. Low-speed turnouts restrict the speed in one direction. Two platform faces are needed, and they can be provided either at a single [[island platform]] or two [[side platforms]] (as shown). Overtaking is not normally possible at this kind of up-and-down loop as some of the necessary signals are absent.\n\nCrossing loops using up-and-down working are very common in British practice. For one thing, fewer signals are required if the tracks in the station are signaled for one direction only; also, there is less likelihood of a collision caused by signalling a train onto the track reserved for trains in the opposing direction. In France, they often use spring switches and the speed is equally restricted in both directions.\n\nThe speed restriction in one direction can be eliminated with higher-speed turnouts, but this may require power operation, as the longer and heavier high-speed turnouts may be beyond the capability of manual lever operation.\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>\n\n=== Dead-end siding ===\n{{main|Refuge siding}}\n{{Routemap\n| collapsible = no\n| legend      = track\n| float       = left\n| map         =\ndCONTg\\c\nc\\vSHI2gl-\ncBS\\vSTR\ncBS\\vSTR-ENDEe\ndCONTf\\c\n}}\nRefuge sidings are used at locations with gradients too steep for heavy freight trains or steam haulage to depart from conventional passing loops, or confined spaces where a passing loop cannot be built. An extra parallel siding is often built at stations on refuge sidings so that two stopping trains can pass, and an extended catch point opposite the refuge siding may be added so as not to interfere with passing trains.\n\nAt [[Bombo railway station, New South Wales|Bombo]], Australia, the crossing loop had no platform, and as freight trains became longer it became inadequate to hold them.\n\n[[Molong railway station|Molong]] used to have a short loop, but it was replaced by a long stretch of a former branch line, which is a dead-end siding.\n\n[[Berry railway station|Berry]] has had its short loop removed and an even shorter dead-end siding substituted. Long freight trains do not need to cross each other here, and freight trains can cross passenger trains waiting in that short siding provided that the freight train arrives second and leaves first.\n<div style=\"clear:left\"></div>\n\n== Dynamic passing loop ==\nIf a crossing loop is several times the length of the trains using it, and is suitably signalled, then trains proceeding in opposite directions can pass (cross) each other without having to stop or even slow down. This greatly reduces the time lost by the first train to arrive at the crossing loop for the opposing train to go by. This system is referred to as a dynamic loop.\n\nIn the [[AusLink]] project for the [[Junee]] to [[Melbourne]] line, roughly every other section of single line will be [[track duplication|duplicated]] to provide so-called '''passing lanes'''.  About 220&nbsp;km of the 450&nbsp;km line will be duplicated.\n\nIn [[Sweden]], the passing loops are generally 750&nbsp;m long, made for cargo trains. Passenger trains are usually much shorter, at least on most single track lines, less than 200&nbsp;m. The signalling system now allows two passenger trains to cross without stopping, but one has to slow down to 40&nbsp;km/h, because of the limited length of the loop and the sharp curves in the switch points.\n\nFor [[Norway]] an investigation has been made about future high-speed railways, using 250&nbsp;km/h as cruise speed. The most promising link would be a new Oslo-Trondheim railway, which is suggested to be a single track along a 370&nbsp;km-long route. It is suggested to have about 15&nbsp;km-long passing loops, more like 15&nbsp;km double track, located about 80&nbsp;km apart. This would enable passing at 160&nbsp;km/h, but there could be only one train per hour per direction on the rail line. See also [[High-speed rail in Norway]].\n\n== Overlaps and catchpoints ==\n\nSome railways fit [[catchpoints]] at the ends of crossing loops so that if a train overruns the loop, it is derailed rather than collide with an opposing train.\n\nSince the available space for crossing loops is usually limited, they do not normally have an overlap (safety margin) between the starting signals and the end of the double line.  In Australia, the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation|Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC)]] policy provides for overlaps of about 500&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m respectively in an effort to avoid derailment or collision.\n\n== Automatic operation ==\n\nMany crossing loops are designed to operate automatically in an unattended mode. Such loops may be [[track circuit|track-circuited]] with home signals cleared by the approaching train. Some loops have the points in and out of the loop operated manually, albeit more recent examples have so-called self-restoring switches that allow trains to exit a loop without needing to change the points.\n\nOther forms of remote operation included [[Centralized traffic control]], in which a train controller changes points and signals from a remote office; and driver-operated points, which enable train crews to use a radio system to set the points from a distance.\n\n== Gradients ==\nThe design of crossing loops may have to be modified where there are severe gradients that make it difficult for a train to restart from a stationary position, or where the terrain is unsuitable for a normal loop.\n\nOne change would be to include runaway [[catchpoints]] on the downhill end, such as at the one at [[Tumulla railway station, New South Wales|Tumulla Railway Station,]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].\n\nOne oddity was [[Dombarton, New South Wales]] in Australia, where the crossing loop built to divide a long [[single track (rail)|single-line]] section on an extreme 1 in 30 (3.3%) gradient. The \"loop\" was built as a miniature zig-zag with a single track lower switchback on one side and a double track upper switchback on the other side, with a dive tunnel under the through track connecting the two.\n\nA refuge loop built on the [[ruling grade]] on [[Cowan Bank|Cowan bank]], New South Wales, Australia proved to be unworkable as the refuged train could not restart. This lesson was learned at Dombarton, where the uphill trains restart from level track. A refuge siding at Razorback halfway up the 1 in 75 ruling grade climb from [[Fish River (Oberon)|Fish River]] to [[Cullerin, New South Wales|Cullerin]] also allowed trains to restart from level track.\n\nA crossing loop on steep gradient may have [[catchpoints]] on the downhill end to reduce the impact of runaways.\n\n== Train length ==\n\nSince central operation of the points and signals from a single signal box is convenient, and since there are practical limits for the distance to these points and signals, crossing loops can have a system-wide effect on train sizes.  In New South Wales, mechanical operation of points and signals limited train lengths in the steam era to about 400&nbsp;m, which was only eased with the introduction of power-operated points and [[centralized traffic control]]. Train lengths are now as much as 1&thinsp;500&nbsp;m or 1&thinsp;800&nbsp;m.\n\nSee [[Longest trains]].\n\n== Line capacity ==\n\nLine capacity is partly determined by the distance between individual crossing loops. Ideally these should be located at [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]]-integer intervals along the track by travel time. The longest section between successive crossing loops will, like the weakest link in a chain, determine the overall line capacity.\n\n=== Short loops ===\n\nLong and short trains can cross at a short loop if the long train arrives second but leaves first.\n\nIt is best if all crossing loops are longer than the longest train.  Two long trains can cross at a short loop using a slow so-called see-saw process, which wastes time.\n\n== Double lines ==\n\nOvertaking loops can also be provided on double lines, one on each side, and these can be called '''Refuge Loops''' (if they are dead-ended they are known as [[refuge siding]]s, q.v.).\n\n== Right- and left-hand traffic ==\nCountries generally have a principle on which side trains shall meet, either on the left or on the right, generally the same for the whole country. But this is generally valid only on double track. On passing loops this principle is not necessarily used. Often the train that shall not stop uses the straight track. See also [[Right- and left-hand traffic]].\n\n== Accidents at crossing loops ==\n[[Image:CaseyJonesStamp.png|thumb|Casey Jones as depicted on a 3 cent [[postage stamp]] issued by the [[United States Postal Service]]]]\n* (1900) '''[[Casey Jones]]''' ([[Vaughan, Mississippi]], USA) - The legendary train driver (U.S.: ''engineer'') [[Casey Jones|John Luther \"Casey\" Jones]] was killed in an accident in 1900 involving trains too long to cross at a passing loop. The trains trying to cross were occupying both the main and loop tracks, and in addition, the train doing the see-saw was standing outside station limits. Jones was traveling fast in order to make up lost time, and could not stop in time to avoid [[Casey Jones#Death|a collision]]. He was able to slow his train from an estimated {{convert|75|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to an estimated {{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at the time of collision; none of the passengers on Jones's train was seriously injured, and Jones was the only fatality.\n* (1914) '''[[Exeter crossing loop collision]]''' ([[Exeter, New South Wales]], Australia) - occurred at [[Exeter railway station, New South Wales|Exeter railway station]] in fog; one train too long for loop.

A mysterious figure emerges, introducing himself as Fu; he tells Goku, Vegeta and Mai that Future Trunks is trapped on a world called the \"Prison Planet\", a planet where warriors from alternate timelines and dimensions fight as part of an experiment conducted by Fu. The trio arrive on the planet and meet an alternate version of Goku, who is revealed to be part of a group called the Time Patrol. This Goku, referred to as \"Xeno Goku\", sees Fu and assumes that the trio are working for him; he immediately transforms into Super Saiyan 4 and attacks Goku, who reacts by transforming into Super Saiyan Blue. During the fight, Goku discovers that there is an invisible barrier around the Prison Planet that prevents them from escaping. The two Gokus engage in a Kamehameha clash, but their blasts cancel each other out. Fu deduces that Xeno Goku was trying to use the combined Kamehameha waves to break through the barrier, and explains that the Prison Planet is inescapable unless the group searches for a set of Dragon Balls (one of which is in Xeno Goku's possession) that they can use to escape. Fu disappears, and the two Gokus agree to work with each other to escape the planet. Meanwhile, Future Trunks is in a prison cell elsewhere on the planet. After escaping his cell, Future Trunks is confronted by Cooler, who demands a Dragon Ball from him.

As Cunber fires yet another blast at the Saiyan pair, Goku and Vegeta avoid it and fly directly upward, transforming into Super Saiyan in the process and attempt to get to Cunber's tail but even at his great size he proves to be swift enough to defend himself. As he steps on Goku, Future Trunks rushes in to help and tries to cut off the Golden Great Ape's tail with his sword but is struck hard to the ground. Along with his father, they fire a volley of blasts though they do no damage to him. Even when Golden Cooler fires blasts of his own, Cunber is still unfazed. Meanwhile, Fu continues to watch the battle from his laboratory, smitten by the current events when a nearby computer informs him of the damage to the Prison Planet's barrier and decides to go to the battle himself to control matters. Goku still remains under the foot of Cunber, struggling to get free but is them seemingly crushed. However, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan Blue and throws Cunber's foot off of him. Charging directly towards Cunber, Goku uses the Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken x20 and strikes Cunber in the face though he is unmoved. Goku fires a Kamehameha though the move is blocked. The ongoing battle causes the barrier to break down even more when suddenly Fu arrives, telling Cunber to watch what he's doing as he declares that he will rein him in. Fu powers up into an empowered state and gathering the energy from the Power Ball to his sword, he strikes at Cunber which causes him to revert to his normal state. Cunber throws a punch at Fu but he easily avoids it. While the others comment on what he just did, Fu tells them to continue their battle as he teleports away, avoiding Cooler's blast in the process.

Trunks is worried that the Earth will be destroyed, as it appears that Gogeta is unable to match Hearts' full power, but Piccolo refuses to give up. Hit and Jiren join Gogeta and add their own blasts to the Kamehameha, increasing its power and ultimately shattering the meteor. Trunks, Piccolo, and 17 shield the Earth from the meteor's fragments, while Gogeta and Hearts engage in a final clash. Gogeta overpowers Hearts and delivers a finishing blow that shatters the Universe Seed embedded in Hearts' chest, causing his body to disintegrate. As he dies, Hearts explains that he was merely trying to free all mortals by defeating the Omni-Kings, as their power to destroy entire universes on a whim prevents mortals from ever being truly free. Hearts congratulates Gogeta and the others on surpassing their limits to defeat him, and then dies peacefully. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the Omni-Kings have been playing hide-and-seek with the Gods of Destruction throughout the battles, but the Grand Minister was observing the fight and thanks the heroes for defeating the threat.

Super Saiyan God Xeno Trunks and Super Saiyan 4 Xeno Vegito are battling against Mechikabura, while the others look on. Xeno Vegito overpowers Mechikabura, while Chronoa empowers Xeno Trunks's mystical Key Sword with her magic, enabling him to injure Mechikabura. The Supreme Kai of Time then uses her magic to seal Mechikabura away, while her magical bird companion Toki-Toki uses his own magic to wash away the darkness of the Demon Realm and destroys the demons' palace.

Meanwhile, Toki-Toki has appeared on Earth in the main timeline, where Goku finds him while training with Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, Krillin, and Android 17. Xeno Trunks and Xeno Pan arrive and are happy to see that Toki-Toki is safe, with Xeno Pan explaining that his existence is very important for the inner workings of the multiverse. Suddenly, the group is interrupted by the arrival of all twelve Gods of Destruction. Champa identifies Toki-Toki and Beerus promptly attempts to destroy him, but Toki-Toki uses his magic to defuse Beerus's attack. Goku asks Beerus what's going on, and Beerus explains that he has received a premonition that a mysterious bird will appear in Universe 7 and destroy the entire multiverse. Xeno Trunks protests that this couldn't be possible, and Xeno Pan quickly escapes back to the Time Nest with Toki-Toki. Quitela, Champa and the other Gods of Destruction are angered by the mortals' defiance, and immediately prepare to destroy Earth in response, but Beerus tells them to stand down, saying that as Universe 7's God of Destruction, he will discipline the mortals himself.

Suddenly, a mass of giant tree roots appears in the sky around the Earth and begins draining the planet's energy. The other Gods of Destruction sense that the same thing is happening on other planets all over their own universes, with the affected planets eventually being consumed entirely. The other gods all rush back to their own universes to protect them, leaving Beerus, the Earth's heroes, and the Time Patrollers behind. They are then confronted by Fu, who is accompanied by Doki-Doki. Fu confirms that Doki-Doki is the \"Bird of Catastrophe\" that Beerus was worried about, and explains that the tree roots are part of the Universe Tree, which grew from the Universe Seed that Hearts was developing. By draining energy from all twelve universes using the Tree, he claims that he will be able to create a new universe. Fu and Doki-Doki escape through a portal, while Krillin, Piccolo, and the other inhabitants of Earth begin to weaken as a result of the Tree's draining their energy. Beerus rises into the sky and powers up, shielding the Earth by allowing the Tree to feed on his energy instead; however, he warns the others that he will not be able to keep this up for long, and that he cannot destroy the Tree by himself.

A mysterious figure emerges, introducing himself as Fu; he tells Goku, Vegeta and Mai that Future Trunks is trapped on a world called the \"Prison Planet\", a planet where warriors from alternate timelines and dimensions fight as part of an experiment conducted by Fu. The trio arrive on the planet and meet an alternate version of Goku, who is revealed to be part of a group called the Time Patrol. This Goku, referred to as \"Xeno Goku\", sees Fu and assumes that the trio are working for him; he immediately transforms into Super Saiyan 4 and attacks Goku, who reacts by transforming into Super Saiyan Blue. During the fight, Goku discovers that there is an invisible barrier around the Prison Planet that prevents them from escaping. The two Gokus engage in a Kamehameha clash, but their blasts cancel each other out. Fu deduces that Xeno Goku was trying to use the combined Kamehameha waves to break through the barrier, and explains that the Prison Planet is inescapable unless the group searches for a set of Dragon Balls (one of which is in Xeno Goku's possession) that they can use to escape. Fu disappears, and the two Gokus agree to work with each other to escape the planet. Meanwhile, Future Trunks is in a prison cell elsewhere on the planet. After escaping his cell, Future Trunks is confronted by Cooler, who demands a Dragon Ball from him.

Goku and Vegeta attack the evil Saiyan, but his aura drives Goku berserk, causing him to attack Vegeta. Fu reveals that the evil Saiyan's name is \"Cunber\", and explains that his energy can turn people into a berserk state by just touching his aura. Goku continues attacking Vegeta; Future Mai is almost caught in the crossfire, but Future Trunks appears and saves her. Vegeta orders Future Trunks to fight Goku while he goes to battle Cunber, but he's interrupted by Cooler, who now appears to be working with Future Trunks. Cooler begins fighting Goku and transforms into his own Golden form, which he calls \"Golden Cooler\". Using this form, he defeats Goku, snapping him out of his berserk state and returning him to normal. Cooler then launches a Supernova attack at Cunber, but the evil Saiyan survives unscathed, breaks free of his restraints, and attacks the group once again. Future Mai reveals that the Supreme Kai gave her his Potara earrings before they left Beerus' world, and gives them to Goku and Vegeta. Future Trunks and Cooler distract Cunber, who easily defeats Future Trunks; however, this gives Goku and Vegeta enough time to fuse into Vegito.

As he steps on Goku, Future Trunks rushes in to help and tries to cut off the Golden Great Ape's tail with his sword but is struck hard to the ground. Along with his father, they fire a volley of blasts though they do no damage to him. Even when Golden Cooler fires blasts of his own, Cunber is still unfazed. Meanwhile, Fu continues to watch the battle from his laboratory, smitten by the current events when a nearby computer informs him of the damage to the Prison Planet's barrier and decides to go to the battle himself to control matters. Goku still remains under the foot of Cunber, struggling to get free but is them seemingly crushed. However, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan Blue and throws Cunber's foot off of him. Charging directly towards Cunber, Goku uses the Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken x20 and strikes Cunber in the face though he is unmoved. Goku fires a Kamehameha though the move is blocked. The ongoing battle causes the barrier to break down even more when suddenly Fu arrives, telling Cunber to watch what he's doing as he declares that he will rein him in. Fu powers up into an empowered state and gathering the energy from the Power Ball to his sword, he strikes at Cunber which causes him to revert to his normal state. Cunber throws a punch at Fu but he easily avoids it. While the others comment on what he just did, Fu tells them to continue their battle as he teleports away, avoiding Cooler's blast in the process.

Hit and Jiren join Gogeta and add their own blasts to the Kamehameha, increasing its power and ultimately shattering the meteor. Trunks, Piccolo, and 17 shield the Earth from the meteor's fragments, while Gogeta and Hearts engage in a final clash. Gogeta overpowers Hearts and delivers a finishing blow that shatters the Universe Seed embedded in Hearts' chest, causing his body to disintegrate. As he dies, Hearts explains that he was merely trying to free all mortals by defeating the Omni-Kings, as their power to destroy entire universes on a whim prevents mortals from ever being truly free. Hearts congratulates Gogeta and the others on surpassing their limits to defeat him, and then dies peacefully. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the Omni-Kings have been playing hide-and-seek with the Gods of Destruction throughout the battles, but the Grand Minister was observing the fight and thanks the heroes for defeating the threat.

Meanwhile, Toki-Toki has appeared on Earth in the main timeline, where Goku finds him while training with Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, Krillin, and Android 17. Xeno Trunks and Xeno Pan arrive and are happy to see that Toki-Toki is safe, with Xeno Pan explaining that his existence is very important for the inner workings of the multiverse.

Champa identifies Toki-Toki and Beerus promptly attempts to destroy him, but Toki-Toki uses his magic to defuse Beerus's attack.

Suddenly, a mass of giant tree roots appears in the sky around the Earth and begins draining the planet's energy. The other Gods of Destruction sense that the same thing is happening on other planets all over their own universes, with the affected planets eventually being consumed entirely. The other gods all rush back to their own universes to protect them, leaving Beerus, the Earth's heroes, and the Time Patrollers behind. They are then confronted by Fu, who is accompanied by Doki-Doki. Fu confirms that Doki-Doki is the \"Bird of Catastrophe\" that Beerus was worried about, and explains that the tree roots are part of the Universe Tree, which grew from the Universe Seed that Hearts was developing. By draining energy from all twelve universes using the Tree, he claims that he will be able to create a new universe. Fu and Doki-Doki escape through a portal, while Krillin, Piccolo, and the other inhabitants of Earth begin to weaken as a result of the Tree's draining their energy. Beerus rises into the sky and powers up, shielding the Earth by allowing the Tree to feed on his energy instead; however, he warns the others that he will not be able to keep this up for long, and that he cannot destroy the Tree by himself.

He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval, and is best known for his [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), written in [[blank verse]], and widely considered to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written.\n\nWriting in English, Latin, Greek, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime; his celebrated ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644), written in condemnation of [[Prior restraint|pre-publication censorship]], is among history's most influential and impassioned defences of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]]. His desire for freedom extended into his style: he introduced new words (coined from Latin) to the English language, and was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations.\n\n[[William Hayley]]'s 1796 biography called him the \"greatest English author\",<ref>McCalman 2001 p. 605.</ref> and he remains generally regarded \"as one of the preeminent writers in the English language\",<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. [http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/milton-john \"Milton, John \u2013 Introduction\"].</ref> though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death (often on account of his [[republicanism]]). [[Samuel Johnson]] praised ''Paradise Lost'' as \"a poem which...with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind\", though he (a [[Tory]] and recipient of royal patronage) described Milton's politics as those of an \"acrimonious and surly republican\".<ref name=Works>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Arthur|title=The Works of Samuel Johnson, LL.

Milton studied, travelled, wrote poetry mostly for private circulation, and launched a career as pamphleteer and publicist under the increasingly personal rule of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and its breakdown into constitutional confusion and war. The shift in accepted attitudes in government placed him in public office under the [[Commonwealth of England]], from being thought dangerously radical and even heretical, and he even acted as an official spokesman in certain of his publications. The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660 deprived Milton, now completely blind, of his public platform, but this period saw him complete most of his major works of poetry.\n\nMilton's views developed from his very extensive reading, as well as travel and experience, from his student days of the 1620s to the [[English Civil War]].<ref>Masson 1859 pp. v\u2013vi.</ref> By the time of his death in 1674, Milton was impoverished and on the margins of English intellectual life, yet famous throughout Europe and unrepentant for his political choices.\n\n===Early life===\n{{Main|Early life of John Milton}}\n[[File:John Milton plaque Bread Street London.jpg|thumb|left|Blue plaque in Bread Street, London, where Milton was born]]\n\nJohn Milton was born in Bread Street, London on 9 December 1608, the son of composer [[John Milton (composer)|John Milton]] and his wife Sarah Jeffrey.

Research suggests that Young's influence served as the poet's introduction to religious radicalism.<ref>Skerpan-Wheeler, Elizabeth. \"John Milton.\" British Rhetoricians and Logicians, 1500\u20131660: Second Series.

Literature Resource Center.</ref> After Young's tutorship, Milton attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London. There he began the study of Latin and Greek, and the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English (he also wrote in Italian and Latin).\n\n[[File:John Milton portrait.jpg|thumb|John Milton at age 10 by [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen]].

One contemporary source is the ''[[Brief Lives]]'' of [[John Aubrey]], an uneven compilation including first-hand reports. In the work, Aubrey quotes Christopher, Milton's younger brother: \"When he was young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night\". Aubrey adds, \"\"His complexion exceeding faire\u2014he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ's College.\"<ref name=OLD>Dick 1962 pp. 270\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn 1625, Milton began attending [[Christ's College, Cambridge]].

He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote his ''Elegia Prima'', a first Latin [[elegy]], to Charles Diodati, a friend from St Paul's. Based on remarks of [[John Aubrey]], Chappell \"whipt\" Milton.<ref name=OLD/> This story is now disputed, though certainly Milton disliked Chappell.<ref>Wedgwood 1961 p. 178.</ref> Historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] cautiously notes that Milton was \"apparently\" rusticated, and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 34.</ref> It is also possible that, like [[Isaac Newton]] four decades later, Milton was sent home because of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], by which Cambridge was badly affected in 1625. In 1626, Milton's tutor was Nathaniel Tovey.\n\nAt Cambridge, Milton was on good terms with [[Edward King (British poet)|Edward King]], for whom he later wrote \"[[Lycidas]]\". He also befriended Anglo-American dissident and theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. Milton tutored Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch.<ref>Pfeiffer 1955 pp. 363\u201373.</ref> Despite developing a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition, Milton experienced alienation from his peers and university life as a whole. Having once watched his fellow students attempting comedy upon the college stage, he later observed 'they thought themselves gallant men, and I thought them fools'.<ref>Milton 1959 pp. 887\u201388.</ref>\n\nMilton was disdainful of the university curriculum, which consisted of stilted formal debates conducted in Latin on abstruse topics. His own corpus is not devoid of humour, notably his sixth [[wikt:prolusion|prolusion]] and his epitaphs on the death of [[Thomas Hobson]]. While at Cambridge, he wrote a number of his well-known shorter English poems, among them \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\", his \"Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare\" (his first poem to appear in print), ''[[L'Allegro]]'', and ''[[Il Penseroso]]''.\n\n===Study, poetry, and travel===\n{{Details|Early life of John Milton}}\n{{quote box\n|width=40%\n|quote=It appears in all his writings that he had the usual concomitant of great abilities, a lofty and steady confidence in himself, perhaps not without some contempt of others; for scarcely any man ever wrote so much, and praised so few. Of his praise he was very frugal; as he set its value high, and considered his mention of a name as a security against the waste of time, and a certain preservative from oblivion.<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I. p. 64.</ref>\n|source=\u2013 [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]''\n}}\n\nUpon receiving his M.A. in 1632, Milton retired to [[Hammersmith]], his father's new home since the previous year. He also lived at [[Horton, Berkshire|Horton]], Berkshire, from 1635 and undertook six years of self-directed private study. Hill argues that this was not retreat into a rural idyll; Hammersmith was then a \"suburban village\" falling into the orbit of London, and even Horton was becoming deforested and suffered from the plague.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 38.</ref> He read both ancient and modern works of theology, philosophy, history, politics, literature, and science in preparation for a prospective poetical career. Milton's intellectual development can be charted via entries in his [[commonplace book]] (like a scrapbook), now in the [[British Library]]. As a result of such intensive study, Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets. In addition to his years of private study, Milton had command of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and Italian from his school and undergraduate days; he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the 1650s while researching his ''History of Britain'', and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after.<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 103.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Milton plaque Berkyn Manor Farm Horton.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Commemorative blue plaque 'John Milton lived here 1632\u20131638' at Berkyn Manor Farm, [[Horton, Berkshire]]]]\n\nMilton continued to write poetry during this period of study; his ''[[Arcades (Milton)|Arcades]]'' and ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' were both commissioned for [[masques]] composed for noble patrons, connections of the Egerton family, and performed in 1632 and 1634 respectively. ''Comus'' argues for the virtuousness of [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[chastity]].  He contributed his [[pastoral]] [[elegy]] ''[[Lycidas]]'' to a memorial collection for one of his fellow-students at Cambridge.  Drafts of these poems are preserved in Milton's poetry notebook, known as the Trinity Manuscript because it is now kept at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Cambridge.\n\nIn May 1638, Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy that lasted until July or August 1639.<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000.</ref> His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experience of artistic and religious traditions, especially Roman Catholicism. He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time, and was able to display his poetic skills. For specific details of what happened within Milton's \"[[grand tour]]\", there appears to be just one [[primary source]]: Milton's own ''[[Defensio Secunda]]''. There are other records, including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts, but the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that, according to [[Barbara Lewalski]], \"was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric, designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe.\"<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nHe first went to [[Calais]] and then on to Paris, riding horseback, with a letter from diplomat [[Henry Wotton]] to ambassador [[John Scudamore (ambassador)|John Scudamore]]. Through Scudamore, Milton met [[Hugo Grotius]], a Dutch law philosopher, playwright, and poet. Milton left France soon after this meeting. He travelled south from [[Nice, France|Nice]] to [[Genoa]], and then to [[Livorno]] and [[Pisa]]. He reached Florence in July 1638. While there, Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city. His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles, and he met the astronomer [[Galileo]] who was under [[house arrest]] at [[Arcetri]], as well as others.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 88\u201394.</ref> Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the [[Accademia della Crusca]] along with smaller academies in the area, including the Apatisti and the [[Svogliati]].\n\n{{quote box |width=40% |quote=In [Florence], which I have always admired above all others because of the elegance, not just of its tongue, but also of its wit, I lingered for about two months.

With the connections from Florence, Milton was able to have easy access to Rome's intellectual society. His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli, who praised Milton within an epigram. In late October, Milton attended a dinner given by the [[English College, Rome]], despite his dislike for the [[Society of Jesus]], meeting English Catholics who were also guests\u2014theologian [[Henry Holden]] and the poet [[Patrick Cary]].<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000 and Lewalski p. 96.</ref> He also attended musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas.

Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent, and spent time at [[Geneva]] with Diodati's uncle after he returned to Rome. In ''Defensio Secunda'', Milton proclaimed that he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion, but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience [[Carnival]] and meet [[Lukas Holste]], a Vatican librarian who guided Milton through its collection. He was introduced to Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (1597\u20131679)|Francesco Barberini]] who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal. Around March, Milton travelled once again to Florence, staying there for two months, attending further meetings of the academies, and spending time with friends. After leaving Florence, he travelled through Lucca, Bologna, and Ferrara before coming to [[Venice]]. In Venice, Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism, later important in his political writings, but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva. From Switzerland, Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving back in England in either July or August 1639.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 99\u2013109.</ref>\n\n===Civil war, prose tracts, and marriage===\n{{Main|Milton's antiprelatical tracts}}\n[[File:Areopagitica bridwell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Title page of the 1644 edition of ''[[Areopagitica]]'']]\n\nOn returning to England where the [[Bishops' Wars]] presaged further armed conflict, Milton began to write prose [[tract (literature)|tracts]] against [[episcopacy]], in the service of the [[Puritan]] and [[Long Parliament|Parliamentary]] cause. Milton's first foray into polemics was ''Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England'' (1641), followed by ''Of Prelatical Episcopacy'', the two defences of [[Smectymnuus]] (a group of Presbyterian divines named from their initials; the \"TY\" belonged to Milton's old tutor Thomas Young), and ''[[The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty]]''. He vigorously attacked the High-church party of the Church of England and their leader [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], with frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period, and deploying a wide knowledge of church history.\n\nHe was supported by his father's investments, but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time, educating his nephews and other children of the well-to-do. This experience and discussions with educational reformer [[Samuel Hartlib]] led him to write his short tract ''[[Of Education]]'' in 1644, urging a reform of the national universities.\n\nIn June 1642, Milton paid a visit to the manor house at [[Forest Hill, Oxfordshire]], and returned with 16-year-old bride Mary Powell.<ref name=\"ODNB Milton\">{{cite journal|first=Gordon|last=Campbell|title=Milton, John (1608\u20131674)|journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|volume=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|edition=Online|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18800|accessdate=25 October 2013|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/18800}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref><ref>Lobel 1957 pp. 122\u201334.</ref> Mary found life difficult with the severe 35-year-old schoolmaster and pamphleteer, and she returned to her family a month later. She did not return until 1645, partly because of the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"ODNB Milton\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, her desertion prompted Milton to publish [[Milton's divorce tracts|a series of pamphlets]] over the next three years arguing for the legality and morality of divorce. ([[Anna Beer]], one of Milton's most recent biographers, points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising.) In 1643, Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings, in parallel with [[Hezekiah Woodward]], who had more trouble.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 181\u201382, 600.</ref> It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write ''[[Areopagitica|Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England]]'', his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship.  In ''Areopagitica'', Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause, and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty.<ref>Ann Hughes, 'Milton, Areopagitica, and the Parliamentary Cause', ''The Oxford Handbook of Milton'', ed.

''[[The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates]]'' (1649) defended the right of the people to hold their rulers to account, and implicitly sanctioned the [[regicide]]; Milton's political reputation got him appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues by the Council of State in March 1649. His main job description was to compose the English Republic's foreign correspondence in Latin, but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor.<ref>C. Sullivan, 'Milton and the Beginning of Civil Service', in ''Literature in the Public Service'' (2013), Ch. 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:19 York Street, Westminster (1848).jpg|thumb|The back of no 19 York Street (1848).

Milton tried to break this powerful image of Charles I (the literal translation of Eikonoklastes is 'the image breaker'). A month later, however, the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his party published the defence of monarchy ''Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo'', written by leading humanist [[Claudius Salmasius]]. By January of the following year, Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the [[English Council of State|Council of State]]. Milton worked more slowly than usual, given the European audience and the English Republic's desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy, as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte.\n\nOn 24 February 1652, Milton published his Latin defence of the English people ''[[Defensio pro Populo Anglicano]]'', also known as the ''First Defence''. Milton's pure Latin prose and evident learning exemplified in the ''First Defence'' quickly made him a European reputation, and the work ran to numerous editions.<ref>von Maltzahn 1999 p. 239.</ref> He addressed his ''Sonnet 16'' to 'The Lord Generall Cromwell in May 1652' beginning  \"Cromwell, our chief of men...\", although it was not published until 1654.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=POOLEY|first=ROGER|date=1993|title=The poets' Cromwell|journal=Critical Survey|volume=5|issue=3|pages=223\u2013234|jstor=41555744}}</ref>\n\nIn 1654, Milton completed the second defence of the English nation ''Defensio secunda'' in response to an anonymous Royalist tract ''\"Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Coelum Adversus Parricidas Anglicanos\"'' [The Cry of the Royal Blood to Heaven  Against the English Parricides], a work that made many personal attacks on Milton.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cOoXuk5wEbQC&dq=Regii+sanguinis+clam+royalist|title=The Milton Encyclopedia|last=Corns|first=Thomas N.|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300094442|location=|pages=216}}</ref> The second defence praised [[Oliver Cromwell]], now Lord Protector, while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. [[Alexander Morus]], to whom Milton wrongly attributed the ''Clamor'' (in fact by [[Peter du Moulin]]), published an attack on Milton, in response to which Milton published the autobiographical ''Defensio pro se'' in 1655. Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until 1660, although after he had become totally blind, most of the work was done by his deputies, Georg Rudolph Wecklein, then Philip Meadows, and from 1657 by the poet [[Andrew Marvell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/milton-appointed-latin-secretary|title=Milton appointed Latin Secretary {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|accessdate=3 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 1652, Milton had become totally blind;<ref>John Leonard, in the introduction to \"Paradise Lost\", Penguin Classics page ix  2000</ref> the cause of his blindness is debated but bilateral [[retinal detachment]] or [[glaucoma]] are most likely.<ref name=pmid18168884>{{cite journal|last=Sorsby|first=A.|title=On The Nature of Milton's Blindness|journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology|year=1930|volume=14|issue=7|pages=339\u201354|pmid=18168884|pmc=511199|doi=10.1136/bjo.14.7.339}}</ref> His blindness forced him to dictate his [[verse (poetry)|verse]] and prose to [[amanuensis|amanuenses]] who copied them out for him; one of these was poet Andrew Marvell.

Milton, however, stubbornly clung to the beliefs that had originally inspired him to write for the Commonwealth. In 1659, he published ''[[A Treatise of Civil Power]]'', attacking the concept of a state-dominated church (the position known as [[Erastianism]]), as well as ''Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove hirelings'', denouncing corrupt practises in church governance. As the Republic disintegrated, Milton wrote several proposals to retain a non-monarchical government against the wishes of parliament, soldiers, and the people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/john-milton/miltons-works|title=Milton's Works|date=3 February 2017|website=Milton's Works|publisher=Christ's College Cambridge}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewalski|first=Barbara Kiefer|year=1959|title=Milton: Political Beliefs and Polemical Methods, 1659\u201360|jstor=460581|journal=PMLA|volume=74|issue=3|pages=191\u2013202|doi=10.2307/460581}}</ref>\n\n*''A Letter to a Friend, Concerning the Ruptures of the Commonwealth'', written in October 1659, was a response to [[John Lambert (general)|General Lambert]]'s recent dissolution of the [[Rump Parliament]].\n*''Proposals of certain expedients for the preventing of a civil war now feared'', written in November 1659.\n*''[[The Ready and Easy Way to Establishing a Free Commonwealth]]'', in two editions, responded to [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General Monck]]'s march towards London to restore the [[Long Parliament]] (which led to the restoration of the monarchy). The work is an impassioned, bitter, and futile [[jeremiad]] damning the English people for backsliding from the cause of [[liberty]] and advocating the establishment of an authoritarian rule by an [[oligarchy]] set up by unelected parliament.\n\nUpon the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in May 1660, Milton went into hiding for his life, while a warrant was issued for his arrest and his writings were burnt. He re-emerged after [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act|a general pardon]] was issued, but was nevertheless arrested and briefly imprisoned before influential friends intervened, such as Marvell, now an MP. Milton married for a third and final time on 24 February 1663, marrying Elizabeth (Betty) Minshull, aged 24, a native of [[Wistaston]], Cheshire. He spent the remaining decade of his life living quietly in London, only retiring to a cottage during the [[Great Plague of London]]\u2014[[Milton's Cottage]] in [[Chalfont St. Giles]], his only extant home.\n\nDuring this period, Milton published several minor prose works, such as the grammar textbook ''Art of Logic'' and a ''History of Britain''. His only explicitly political tracts were the 1672 ''Of True Religion'', arguing for [[toleration]] (except for Catholics), and a translation of a Polish tract advocating an elective monarchy. Both these works were referred to in the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion]] debate, the attempt to exclude the heir presumptive from the throne of England\u2014[[James, Duke of York]]\u2014because he was Roman Catholic. That debate preoccupied politics in the 1670s and 1680s and precipitated the formation of the [[British Whig Party|Whig party]] and the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\nMilton died of kidney failure on 8 November 1674 and was buried in the church of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], [[Fore Street, London|Fore Street]], London.<ref name=EncylLon>{{cite book|author1=[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]]; Ben Weinreb; John Keay; Julia Keay.|title=The London Encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa0D0PqiwfEC&pg=PA762|year=2010|location=London|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-73878-2|page=762}}</ref> According to an early biographer, his funeral was attended by \"his learned and great Friends in London, not without a friendly concourse of the Vulgar.\"<ref>Toland 1932 p. 193.</ref> A monument was added in 1793, sculpted by [[John Bacon (sculptor, born 1740)|John Bacon the Elder]].\n\n===Family===\nMilton and his first wife Mary Powell (1625\u20131652) had four children:\n*Anne (born 7 July 1646)\n*Mary (born 25 October 1648)\n*John (16 March 1651 \u2013 June 1652)\n*Deborah (2 May 1652 \u2013 10 August 1727<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Monthly Mirror: Reflecting Men and Manners|publisher=Harding & Wright|year=1810|location=Edinburgh|pages=49|quote=|via=Google Books}}</ref>)\n\nMary Powell died on 5 May 1652 from complications following Deborah's birth. Milton's daughters survived to adulthood, but he always had a strained relationship with them.\n\nOn 12 November 1656, Milton was married to Katherine Woodcock at [[St Margaret's, Westminster]].<ref>'Milton, John', in ''Journal of the Society of Arts, 8 November 1867, p. 755</ref> She died on 3 February 1658, less than four months after giving birth to her daughter Katherine, who also died.\n\nMilton married for a third time on 24 February 1663 to Elizabeth Mynshull or Minshull (1638\u20131728), the niece of Thomas Mynshull, a wealthy apothecary and philanthropist in Manchester. The marriage took place at [[St Mary Aldermary]] in the City of London. Despite a 31-year age gap, the marriage seemed happy, according to [[John Aubrey]], and lasted more than 12 years until Milton's death. (A plaque on the wall of Mynshull's House in Manchester describes Elizabeth as Milton's \"3rd and Best wife\".) Samuel Johnson, however, claims that Mynshull was \"a domestic companion and attendant\" and that Milton's nephew [[Edward Phillips]] relates that Mynshull \"oppressed his children in his lifetime, and cheated them at his death\".<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I 86.</ref>\n\nHis nephews, [[Edward Phillips|Edward]] and [[John Phillips (author)|John Phillips]] (sons of Milton's sister Anne), were educated by Milton and became writers themselves.

Milton's key beliefs were idiosyncratic, not those of an identifiable group or faction, and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone, however, stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience.<ref>See, for instance, Barker, Arthur. ''Milton and the Puritan Dilemma, 1641\u20131660''.

John Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age. The great Poet was undoubtedly Reformed (though his grandfather, Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton had been Roman Catholic).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Arms of the Family: The Significance of John Milton's Relatives and Associates|last=Shawcross|first=John T.|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2004|isbn=978-0813122915|location=Lexington|pages=7}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=In the Days of Milton|last=Jenks|first=Tudor|publisher=A.S. Barnes & Company|year=1905|isbn=|location=New York|pages=35\u201336}}</ref> However, Milton's Calvinism had to find expression in a broad-spirited Humanism. Like many [[Renaissance]] artists before him, Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue, the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In ''Comus'', Milton may make ironic use of the [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] court [[masque]] by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton's theological concerns become more explicit.\n\nHis use of biblical citation was wide-ranging; Harris Fletcher, standing at the beginning of the intensification of the study of the use of scripture in Milton's work (poetry and prose, in all languages Milton mastered), notes that typically Milton clipped and adapted biblical quotations to suit the purpose, giving precise chapter and verse only in texts for a more specialized readership. As for the plenitude of Milton's quotations from scripture, Fletcher comments, \"For this work, I have in all actually collated about twenty-five hundred of the five to ten thousand direct Biblical quotations which appear therein\".<ref name=harris/> Milton's customary English Bible was the [[King James Version#Authorized Version|Authorized King James]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=E.

He has been accused of rejecting the [[Trinity]], believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as [[Arianism]]; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by [[Socinianism]]: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by [[William Dugard]] the ''[[Racovian Catechism]]'', based on a non-trinitarian creed.<ref>Lewalski, ''Life of Milton'', p. 253.</ref><ref>William Bridges Hunter, ''A Milton Encyclopedia'' (1980), Vol. VIII, p. 13.</ref> Milton's alleged Arianism, like much of his theology, is still subject of debate and controversy. [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] argued that \"In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian; and in the very last of his writings he declares that \"the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture.\"<ref>John Milton, The Prose Works of John Milton: With a Biographical Introduction by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. In Two Volumes (Philadelphia: John W. Moore, 1847). Vol. 1. [[wikisource:The Prose Works of John Milton/Biographical introduction|The Prose Works of John Milton, Biographical introduction]]</ref> In ''Areopagitica,'' Milton classified Arians and Socinians as \"errorists\" and \"schismatics\" alongside [[Arminians]] and [[Anabaptists]].<ref>W.F. Draper, \"The Religious Life and Opinions of John Milton.\" In \"The Bibliotheca Sacra and Biblical Repository,\" Volume 17 (1860) p. 38.</ref> A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant, if not always easy to locate in a more precise religious category.\n\nIn his 1641 treatise, ''[[Of Reformation]]'', Milton expressed his dislike for Catholicism and episcopacy, presenting Rome as a modern [[Babylon]], and bishops as Egyptian taskmasters. These analogies conform to Milton's puritanical preference for [[Old Testament]] imagery. He knew at least four commentaries on ''Genesis'': those of [[John Calvin]], [[Paulus Fagius]], [[David Pareus]] and [[Andreus Rivetus]].<ref>Arnold Williams, ''Renaissance Commentaries on \"Genesis\" and Some Elements of the Theology of Paradise Lost'', PMLA, Vol. 56, No. 1 (Mar. 1941), pp. 151\u201364.</ref>\n\nThrough the [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|Interregnum]], Milton often presents England, rescued from the trappings of a worldly monarchy, as an [[elect]] nation akin to the Old Testament [[Israel]], and shows its leader, [[Oliver Cromwell]], as a latter-day [[Moses]]. These views were bound up in Protestant views of the [[Millennium]], which some sects, such as the [[Fifth Monarchists]] predicted would arrive in England. Milton, however, would later criticise the \"worldly\" millenarian views of these and others, and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the [[Four Empires]].<ref>Walter S. H. Lim, ''John Milton, Radical Politics, and Biblical Republicanism'' (2006), p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 began a new phase in Milton's work. In ''Paradise Lost'', ''[[Paradise Regained]]'' and ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', Milton mourns the end of the godly [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]]. The [[Garden of Eden]] may allegorically reflect Milton's view of England's recent [[The Fall of Man|Fall from Grace]], while [[Samson]]'s blindness and captivity\u2014mirroring Milton's own lost sight\u2014may be a metaphor for England's blind acceptance of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as king.\nIllustrated by ''Paradise Lost'' is [[Soul sleep|mortalism]], the belief that the soul lies dormant after the body dies.<ref>John Rogers, ''The Matter of Revolution'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998), p. xi.</ref>\n\nDespite the Restoration of the monarchy, Milton did not lose his personal faith; Samson shows how the loss of national [[salvation]] did not necessarily preclude the salvation of the individual, while ''Paradise Regained'' expresses Milton's continuing belief in the promise of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ.\n\nThough he maintained his personal faith in spite of the defeats suffered by his cause, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' recounted how he had been alienated from the Church of England by Archbishop William Laud, and then moved similarly from the [[Dissenters]] by their denunciation of religious tolerance in England.\n\n{{quote|Milton had come to stand apart from all sects, though apparently finding the [[Quakers]] most congenial. He never went to any religious services in his later years. When a servant brought back accounts of sermons from [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] meetings, Milton became so sarcastic that the man at last gave up his place.}}Writing of the enigmatic and often conflicting views of Milton in the Puritan age, David Daiches wrote convincingly,<blockquote>\"Christian and Humanist, Protestant, patriot and heir of the golden ages of Greece and Rome, he faced what appeared to him to be the birth-pangs of a new and regenerate England with high excitement and idealistic optimism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>A fair theological summary may be: that John Milton was a Puritan, though his tendency to press further for liberty of conscience, sometimes out of conviction and often out of mere intellectual curiosity, made the great man, at least, a vital if not uncomfortable ally in the broader Puritan movement.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Religious toleration===\nMilton called in the ''[[Areopagitica]]'' for \"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties\" (applied, however, only to the conflicting Protestant denominations, and not to atheists, Jews, Muslims or Catholics).<ref>Hill, C.

In August of that year, he presented his thoughts to the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]], which had been created by the [[Long Parliament]] to bring greater reform to the Church of England. The Assembly convened on 1 July against the will of King Charles I.\n\nMilton's thinking on divorce caused him considerable trouble with the authorities. An orthodox Presbyterian view of the time was that Milton's views on divorce constituted a one-man [[heresy]]:\n\n{{quote|The fervently Presbyterian [[Thomas Edwards (heresiographer)|Edwards]] had included Milton's divorce tracts in his list in ''[[Gangraena]]'' of heretical publications that threatened the religious and moral fabric of the nation; Milton responded by mocking him as \"shallow Edwards\" in the satirical sonnet \"On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament\", usually dated to the latter half of 1646.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119394388/PDFSTART (PDF) Nicholas McDowell, ''Family Politics; Or, How John Phillips Read His Uncle's Satirical Sonnets'', Milton Quarterly Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp. 1\u201321.

However, Milton's basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals, particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly on the matter of divorce in August 1643,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704170506/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |archivedate= 4 July 2013 }}</ref> at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the Doctrine & Discipline of Divorce, Milton argued that divorce was a private matter, not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact, when the Westminster Assembly wrote the Westminster Confession of Faith they allowed for divorce ('Of Marriage and Divorce,' Chapter 24, Section 5) in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus, the Christian community, at least a majority within the 'Puritan' sub-set, approved of Milton's views.\n\nNevertheless, reaction among Puritans to Milton's views on divorce was mixed. [[Herbert Palmer (Puritan)|Herbert Palmer]], a member of the [[Westminster Assembly]], condemned Milton in the strongest possible language:\n\n{{quote|If any plead Conscience ... for divorce for other causes than Christ and His Apostles mention; Of which a wicked booke is abroad and uncensured, though deserving to be burnt, whose Author, hath been so impudent as to set his Name to it, and dedicate it to your selves ... will you grant a Toleration for all this?|The Glasse of God's Providence Towards His Faithfull Ones, 1644, p. 54.<ref>Ernest Sirluck, \"Introduction\", Complete Prose Works of John Milton, New Haven: Yale U. Press, 1959, II, 103</ref>}}\n\nPalmer expressed his disapproval in a sermon addressed to the Westminster Assembly.

He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the 18th and 19th centuries; he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets, including [[Shakespeare]].

A subsequent prose translation by [[Johann Jakob Bodmer]] was very popular; it influenced Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. The German-language Milton tradition returned to England in the person of the artist [[Henry Fuseli]].\n\nMany enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century revered and commented on Milton's poetry and non-poetical works. In addition to John Dryden, among them were [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[Thomas Newton]], and [[Samuel Johnson]]. For example, in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'',<ref>Nos 267, 273, 279, 285, 291, 297, 303, 309, 315, 321, 327, 333, 339, 345, 351, 357, 363, and 369.</ref> Joseph Addison wrote extensive notes, annotations, and interpretations of certain passages of ''Paradise Lost''. [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson, senior]], and Jonathan Richardson, the younger, co-wrote a book of criticism.<ref>''Explanatory Notes and Remarks on Milton's Paradise Lost'' (1734).</ref> In 1749, Thomas Newton published an extensive edition of Milton's poetical works with annotations provided by himself, Dryden, Pope, Addison, the Richardsons (father and son) and others. Newton's edition of Milton was a culmination of the honour bestowed upon Milton by early Enlightenment thinkers; it may also have been prompted by Richard Bentley's infamous edition, described above. Samuel Johnson wrote numerous essays on ''Paradise Lost'', and Milton was included in his ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]'' (1779\u20131781). In ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'', [[Voltaire]] said \"Milton remains the glory and the wonder (''l'admiration'') of England.\"<ref>Voltaire, ''Le Siecle de Louis XIV 2,'' Paris: Garnier-Flammarion, 1966, p.66.</ref>\n\n===Blake===\n[[File:Milton a Poem copy D 1818 Library of Congress object 1.jpg|thumb|[[Frontispiece (book)|Frontispiece]] to ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]]'']]\n\n[[William Blake]] considered Milton the major English poet.

For Burke, it was to set alongside mountain-tops, a storm at sea, and [[infinity]].<ref>Bill Beckley, ''Sticky Sublime'' (2001), p. 63.</ref> In ''The Beautiful and the Sublime'', he wrote: \"No person seems better to have understood the secret of heightening, or of setting terrible things, if I may use the expression, in their strongest light, by the force of a judicious obscurity than Milton.\"<ref>Part II, Section I: [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/sublime/part2.html Adelaide.edu.au] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026004530/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/sublime/part2.html |date=26 October 2008 }}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Romanticism|Romantic poets]] valued his exploration of [[blank verse]], but for the most part rejected his religiosity.

Eliot believed that \"of no other poet is it so difficult to consider the poetry simply as poetry, without our theological and political dispositions... making unlawful entry\".<ref>Eliot 1947 p. 63.</ref>\n\n===Literary legacy===\n[[File:Temple of British Worthies John Milton.jpg|thumb|Statue of Milton in [[Stowe House|Temple of British Worthies]], [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]]]]\n\nMilton's use of [[blank verse]], in addition to his stylistic innovations (such as grandiloquence of voice and vision, peculiar diction and phraseology) influenced later poets. At the time, poetic blank verse was considered distinct from its use in verse drama, and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was taken as a unique examplar.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 443.</ref> Said [[Isaac Watts]] in 1734, \"Mr. Milton is esteemed the parent and author of blank verse among us\".<ref>Watts 1810 iv. 619.</ref> \"Miltonic verse\" might be synonymous for a century with blank verse as poetry, a new poetic terrain independent from both the drama and the [[heroic couplet]].\n\nLack of rhyme was sometimes taken as Milton's defining innovation. He himself considered the rhymeless quality of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' to be an extension of his own personal liberty:\n\n{{quote|This neglect then of Rhime&nbsp;... is to be esteem'd an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recover'd to heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing.<ref>Milton 1668 xi.</ref>}}\n\nThis pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet.<ref>Gordon 2008 p. 234.</ref> Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish, he granted primacy to freedom, breadth and imaginative suggestiveness, eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror. Reaction to Milton's poetic worldview included, grudgingly, acknowledgement that of poet's resemblance to classical writers (Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed). Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics. Unrhymed lyrics like [[William Collins (poet)|Collins]]' ''[[Ode to Evening]]'' (in the meter of Milton's translation of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ode to Pyrrha]]'') were not uncommon after 1740.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 46.</ref>\n\nA second aspect of Milton's blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm:\n\n{{quote|His blank-verse paragraph, and his audacious and victorious attempt to combine blank and rhymed verse with paragraphic effect in Lycidas, lay down indestructible models and patterns of English verse-rhythm, as distinguished from the narrower and more strait-laced forms of English metre.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 457.</ref>}}\n\nBefore Milton, \"the sense of regular rhythm&nbsp;... had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 101.</ref> The \"Heroick measure\", according to [[Samuel Johnson]], \"is pure&nbsp;... when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line&nbsp;... The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable\".<ref>Johnson 1751 no. 86.</ref> [[Caesura]]l pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle and the end of the line. In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no [[enjambed]] endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included [[hypermetric]]al [[syllable]]s (trisyllabic [[Foot (prosody)|feet]]), [[inversion (prosody)|inversion]] or slighting of [[stress (linguistics)|stresses]], and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 57.</ref> Milton deemed these features to be reflective of \"the transcendental union of order and freedom\".<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 458\u201359.</ref> Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: \"The English&nbsp;... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit\".<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 59.</ref> Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Henry Pemberton]], and [[Scott of Amwell]], whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was \"displeasing to a nice ear\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 114.</ref> It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with [[Thomas Gray|Gray]]) began to appreciate \"the composition of Milton's harmony&nbsp;... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification\".<ref>Gray 1748 ''Observations on English Metre''.</ref> By the 20th century, American poet and critic John Hollander would go so far as to say that Milton \"was able, by plying that most remarkable instrument of English meter ... to invent a new mode of image-making in English poetry.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116|title=Vision and resonance : two senses of poetic form|last=Hollander|first=John|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0-19-501898-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116 116]|oclc=1530446}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Giles-without-Cripplegate, London 01.JPG|thumb|Memorial in [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], London]]\n\nWhile [[neoclassicism|neo-classical]] diction was as restrictive as its [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]], and narrow imagery paired with uniformity of sentence structure resulted in a small set of 800 nouns circumscribing the vocabulary of 90% of heroic couplets ever written up to the eighteenth century,<ref>Hobsbaum 1996 p. 40.</ref> and tradition required that the same adjectives attach to the same nouns, followed by the same verbs, Milton's pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well. It included many Latinate [[neologism]]s, as well as obsolete words already dropped from popular usage so completely that their meanings were no longer understood. In 1740, [[Francis Peck]] identified some examples of Milton's \"old\" words (now popular).<ref>They included \"self-same\", \"hue\", \"minstrelsy\", \"murky\", \"carol\", and \"chaunt\". Among Milton's naturalized Latin words were \"humid\", \"orient\", \"hostil\", \"facil\", \"fervid\", \"jubilant\", \"ire\", \"bland\", \"reluctant\", \"palpable\", \"fragil\", and \"ornate\". Peck 1740 pp. 110\u201311.</ref> The \"Miltonian dialect\", as it was called, was emulated by later poets; Pope used the diction of ''Paradise Lost'' in his [[Homer]] translation, while the lyric poetry of Gray and Collins was frequently criticised for their use of \"obsolete words out of Spenser and Milton\".<ref>Scott 1785 63.</ref> The language of [[James Thomson (poet)|Thomson]]'s finest poems (e.g. ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'', ''[[The Castle of Indolence]]'') was self-consciously modelled after the Miltonian dialect, with the same tone and sensibilities as ''Paradise Lost''. Following to Milton, English poetry from Pope to [[John Keats]] exhibited a steadily increasing attention to the connotative, the imaginative and poetic, value of words.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 468.</ref>\n\n===Musical settings===\n\nMilton's [[ode]] ''At a solemn Musick'' was set for choir and orchestra as ''[[Blest Pair of Sirens]]'' by [[Hubert Parry]] (1848\u20131918), and Milton's poem ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity'' was set as a large-scale choral work by [[Cyril Rootham]] (1875\u20131938). Milton also wrote the hymn [[Let us with a gladsome mind]], a versification of Psalm 136.

He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval, and is best known for his [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), written in [[blank verse]], and widely considered to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written.\n\nWriting in English, Latin, Greek, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime; his celebrated ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644), written in condemnation of [[Prior restraint|pre-publication censorship]], is among history's most influential and impassioned defences of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]]. His desire for freedom extended into his style: he introduced new words (coined from Latin) to the English language, and was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations.\n\n[[William Hayley]]'s 1796 biography called him the \"greatest English author\",<ref>McCalman 2001 p. 605.</ref> and he remains generally regarded \"as one of the preeminent writers in the English language\",<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. [http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/milton-john \"Milton, John \u2013 Introduction\"].</ref> though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death (often on account of his [[republicanism]]). [[Samuel Johnson]] praised ''Paradise Lost'' as \"a poem which...with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind\", though he (a [[Tory]] and recipient of royal patronage) described Milton's politics as those of an \"acrimonious and surly republican\".<ref name=Works>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Arthur|title=The Works of Samuel Johnson, LL.

Milton studied, travelled, wrote poetry mostly for private circulation, and launched a career as pamphleteer and publicist under the increasingly personal rule of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and its breakdown into constitutional confusion and war. The shift in accepted attitudes in government placed him in public office under the [[Commonwealth of England]], from being thought dangerously radical and even heretical, and he even acted as an official spokesman in certain of his publications. The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660 deprived Milton, now completely blind, of his public platform, but this period saw him complete most of his major works of poetry.\n\nMilton's views developed from his very extensive reading, as well as travel and experience, from his student days of the 1620s to the [[English Civil War]].<ref>Masson 1859 pp. v\u2013vi.</ref> By the time of his death in 1674, Milton was impoverished and on the margins of English intellectual life, yet famous throughout Europe and unrepentant for his political choices.\n\n===Early life===\n{{Main|Early life of John Milton}}\n[[File:John Milton plaque Bread Street London.jpg|thumb|left|Blue plaque in Bread Street, London, where Milton was born]]\n\nJohn Milton was born in Bread Street, London on 9 December 1608, the son of composer [[John Milton (composer)|John Milton]] and his wife Sarah Jeffrey. The senior John Milton (1562\u20131647) moved to London around 1583 after being disinherited by his devout Catholic father Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton for embracing Protestantism.<ref name=\":3\" /> In London, the senior John Milton married Sarah Jeffrey (1572\u20131637) and found lasting financial success as a [[scrivener]].<ref name=Forsyth16>{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=Neil |title=John Milton A Biography |edition=1st |year=2008 |publisher=[[Lion Hudson]] |location=Wilkinson House, Jordan Hill Road, Oxford OX2 8DR, England |isbn=978-0-7459-5310-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/johnmiltonbiogra0000fors/page/16 16] |chapter=St. Paul's |url=https://archive.org/details/johnmiltonbiogra0000fors/page/16 }}</ref> He lived in and worked from a house on [[Bread Street]], where the [[Mermaid Tavern]] was located in [[Cheapside]]. The elder Milton was noted for his skill as a musical composer, and this talent left his son with a lifelong appreciation for music and friendships with musicians such as [[Henry Lawes]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 3.</ref>\n\nMilton's father's prosperity provided his eldest son with a private tutor, [[Thomas Young (1587\u20131655)|Thomas Young]], a Scottish Presbyterian with an M.A. from the University of St. Andrews. Research suggests that Young's influence served as the poet's introduction to religious radicalism.<ref>Skerpan-Wheeler, Elizabeth. \"John Milton.\" British Rhetoricians and Logicians, 1500\u20131660: Second Series. Ed. Edward A. Malone. Detroit: Gale, 2003. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 281. Literature Resource Center.</ref> After Young's tutorship, Milton attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London. There he began the study of Latin and Greek, and the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English (he also wrote in Italian and Latin).\n\n[[File:John Milton portrait.jpg|thumb|John Milton at age 10 by [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen]]. In [[Milton's Cottage]], [[Chalfont St Giles]].]]\n\nMilton's first datable compositions are two psalms done at age 15 at [[Long Bennington]]. One contemporary source is the ''[[Brief Lives]]'' of [[John Aubrey]], an uneven compilation including first-hand reports. In the work, Aubrey quotes Christopher, Milton's younger brother: \"When he was young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night\". Aubrey adds, \"\"His complexion exceeding faire\u2014he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ's College.\"<ref name=OLD>Dick 1962 pp. 270\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn 1625, Milton began attending [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. He graduated with a B.A. in 1629,<ref>{{acad|id=MLTN624J|name=Milton, John}}</ref> ranking fourth of 24&nbsp;honours graduates that year in the University of Cambridge.<ref>Hunter 1980 p. 99.</ref> Preparing to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest, Milton stayed on and obtained his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts degree]] on 3 July 1632.\n\nMilton may have been [[rustication (academia)|rusticated]] (suspended) in his first year for quarrelling with his tutor, Bishop [[William Chappell (bishop)|William Chappell]]. He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote his ''Elegia Prima'', a first Latin [[elegy]], to Charles Diodati, a friend from St Paul's. Based on remarks of [[John Aubrey]], Chappell \"whipt\" Milton.<ref name=OLD/> This story is now disputed, though certainly Milton disliked Chappell.<ref>Wedgwood 1961 p. 178.</ref> Historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] cautiously notes that Milton was \"apparently\" rusticated, and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 34.</ref> It is also possible that, like [[Isaac Newton]] four decades later, Milton was sent home because of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], by which Cambridge was badly affected in 1625. In 1626, Milton's tutor was Nathaniel Tovey.\n\nAt Cambridge, Milton was on good terms with [[Edward King (British poet)|Edward King]], for whom he later wrote \"[[Lycidas]]\". He also befriended Anglo-American dissident and theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. Milton tutored Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch.<ref>Pfeiffer 1955 pp. 363\u201373.</ref> Despite developing a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition, Milton experienced alienation from his peers and university life as a whole. Having once watched his fellow students attempting comedy upon the college stage, he later observed 'they thought themselves gallant men, and I thought them fools'.<ref>Milton 1959 pp. 887\u201388.</ref>\n\nMilton was disdainful of the university curriculum, which consisted of stilted formal debates conducted in Latin on abstruse topics. His own corpus is not devoid of humour, notably his sixth [[wikt:prolusion|prolusion]] and his epitaphs on the death of [[Thomas Hobson]]. While at Cambridge, he wrote a number of his well-known shorter English poems, among them \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\", his \"Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare\" (his first poem to appear in print), ''[[L'Allegro]]'', and ''[[Il Penseroso]]''.\n\n===Study, poetry, and travel===\n{{Details|Early life of John Milton}}\n{{quote box\n|width=40%\n|quote=It appears in all his writings that he had the usual concomitant of great abilities, a lofty and steady confidence in himself, perhaps not without some contempt of others; for scarcely any man ever wrote so much, and praised so few. Of his praise he was very frugal; as he set its value high, and considered his mention of a name as a security against the waste of time, and a certain preservative from oblivion.<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I. p. 64.</ref>\n|source=\u2013 [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]''\n}}\n\nUpon receiving his M.A. in 1632, Milton retired to [[Hammersmith]], his father's new home since the previous year. He also lived at [[Horton, Berkshire|Horton]], Berkshire, from 1635 and undertook six years of self-directed private study. Hill argues that this was not retreat into a rural idyll; Hammersmith was then a \"suburban village\" falling into the orbit of London, and even Horton was becoming deforested and suffered from the plague.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 38.</ref> He read both ancient and modern works of theology, philosophy, history, politics, literature, and science in preparation for a prospective poetical career. Milton's intellectual development can be charted via entries in his [[commonplace book]] (like a scrapbook), now in the [[British Library]]. As a result of such intensive study, Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets. In addition to his years of private study, Milton had command of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and Italian from his school and undergraduate days; he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the 1650s while researching his ''History of Britain'', and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after.<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 103.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Milton plaque Berkyn Manor Farm Horton.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Commemorative blue plaque 'John Milton lived here 1632\u20131638' at Berkyn Manor Farm, [[Horton, Berkshire]]]]\n\nMilton continued to write poetry during this period of study; his ''[[Arcades (Milton)|Arcades]]'' and ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' were both commissioned for [[masques]] composed for noble patrons, connections of the Egerton family, and performed in 1632 and 1634 respectively. ''Comus'' argues for the virtuousness of [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[chastity]].  He contributed his [[pastoral]] [[elegy]] ''[[Lycidas]]'' to a memorial collection for one of his fellow-students at Cambridge.  Drafts of these poems are preserved in Milton's poetry notebook, known as the Trinity Manuscript because it is now kept at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Cambridge.\n\nIn May 1638, Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy that lasted until July or August 1639.<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000.</ref> His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experience of artistic and religious traditions, especially Roman Catholicism. He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time, and was able to display his poetic skills. For specific details of what happened within Milton's \"[[grand tour]]\", there appears to be just one [[primary source]]: Milton's own ''[[Defensio Secunda]]''. There are other records, including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts, but the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that, according to [[Barbara Lewalski]], \"was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric, designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe.\"<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nHe first went to [[Calais]] and then on to Paris, riding horseback, with a letter from diplomat [[Henry Wotton]] to ambassador [[John Scudamore (ambassador)|John Scudamore]]. Through Scudamore, Milton met [[Hugo Grotius]], a Dutch law philosopher, playwright, and poet. Milton left France soon after this meeting. He travelled south from [[Nice, France|Nice]] to [[Genoa]], and then to [[Livorno]] and [[Pisa]]. He reached Florence in July 1638. While there, Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city. His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles, and he met the astronomer [[Galileo]] who was under [[house arrest]] at [[Arcetri]], as well as others.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 88\u201394.</ref> Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the [[Accademia della Crusca]] along with smaller academies in the area, including the Apatisti and the [[Svogliati]].\n\n{{quote box |width=40% |quote=In [Florence], which I have always admired above all others because of the elegance, not just of its tongue, but also of its wit, I lingered for about two months. There I at once became the friend of many gentlemen eminent in rank and learning, whose private academies I frequented\u2014a Florentine institution which deserves great praise not only for promoting humane studies but also for encouraging friendly intercourse.<ref>Milton 1959 Vol. IV part I. pp. 615\u201317.</ref> |source=\u2013 Milton's account of Florence in ''Defensio Secunda''}}\n\nHe left Florence in September to continue to Rome. With the connections from Florence, Milton was able to have easy access to Rome's intellectual society. His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli, who praised Milton within an epigram. In late October, Milton attended a dinner given by the [[English College, Rome]], despite his dislike for the [[Society of Jesus]], meeting English Catholics who were also guests\u2014theologian [[Henry Holden]] and the poet [[Patrick Cary]].<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000 and Lewalski p. 96.</ref> He also attended musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas. Milton left for [[Naples]] toward the end of November, where he stayed only for a month because of the Spanish control.<ref>Chaney 1985 p. 244\u201351 and Chaney 2000 p. 313.</ref> During that time, he was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso, patron to both [[Torquato Tasso]] and to [[Giambattista Marino]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 94\u201398.</ref>\n\nOriginally, Milton wanted to leave Naples in order to travel to [[Sicily]] and then on to Greece, but he returned to England during the summer of 1639 because of what he claimed in ''Defensio Secunda''<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 98.</ref> were \"sad tidings of civil war in England.\"<ref>Milton 1959 Vol. IV part I pp. 618\u201319.</ref> Matters became more complicated when Milton received word that his childhood friend Diodati had died. Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent, and spent time at [[Geneva]] with Diodati's uncle after he returned to Rome. In ''Defensio Secunda'', Milton proclaimed that he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion, but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience [[Carnival]] and meet [[Lukas Holste]], a Vatican librarian who guided Milton through its collection. He was introduced to Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (1597\u20131679)|Francesco Barberini]] who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal. Around March, Milton travelled once again to Florence, staying there for two months, attending further meetings of the academies, and spending time with friends. After leaving Florence, he travelled through Lucca, Bologna, and Ferrara before coming to [[Venice]]. In Venice, Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism, later important in his political writings, but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva. From Switzerland, Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving back in England in either July or August 1639.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 99\u2013109.</ref>\n\n===Civil war, prose tracts, and marriage===\n{{Main|Milton's antiprelatical tracts}}\n[[File:Areopagitica bridwell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Title page of the 1644 edition of ''[[Areopagitica]]'']]\n\nOn returning to England where the [[Bishops' Wars]] presaged further armed conflict, Milton began to write prose [[tract (literature)|tracts]] against [[episcopacy]], in the service of the [[Puritan]] and [[Long Parliament|Parliamentary]] cause. Milton's first foray into polemics was ''Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England'' (1641), followed by ''Of Prelatical Episcopacy'', the two defences of [[Smectymnuus]] (a group of Presbyterian divines named from their initials; the \"TY\" belonged to Milton's old tutor Thomas Young), and ''[[The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty]]''. He vigorously attacked the High-church party of the Church of England and their leader [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], with frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period, and deploying a wide knowledge of church history.\n\nHe was supported by his father's investments, but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time, educating his nephews and other children of the well-to-do. This experience and discussions with educational reformer [[Samuel Hartlib]] led him to write his short tract ''[[Of Education]]'' in 1644, urging a reform of the national universities.\n\nIn June 1642, Milton paid a visit to the manor house at [[Forest Hill, Oxfordshire]], and returned with 16-year-old bride Mary Powell.<ref name=\"ODNB Milton\">{{cite journal|first=Gordon|last=Campbell|title=Milton, John (1608\u20131674)|journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|volume=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|edition=Online|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18800|accessdate=25 October 2013|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/18800}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref><ref>Lobel 1957 pp. 122\u201334.</ref> Mary found life difficult with the severe 35-year-old schoolmaster and pamphleteer, and she returned to her family a month later. She did not return until 1645, partly because of the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"ODNB Milton\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, her desertion prompted Milton to publish [[Milton's divorce tracts|a series of pamphlets]] over the next three years arguing for the legality and morality of divorce. ([[Anna Beer]], one of Milton's most recent biographers, points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising.) In 1643, Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings, in parallel with [[Hezekiah Woodward]], who had more trouble.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 181\u201382, 600.</ref> It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write ''[[Areopagitica|Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England]]'', his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship.  In ''Areopagitica'', Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause, and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty.<ref>Ann Hughes, 'Milton, Areopagitica, and the Parliamentary Cause', ''The Oxford Handbook of Milton'', ed.

Nicholas McDowell and Nigel Smith, Oxford University Press, 2009</ref>\n\n===Secretary for Foreign Tongues===\nWith the parliamentary victory in the Civil War, Milton used his pen in defence of the republican principles represented by the Commonwealth. ''[[The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates]]'' (1649) defended the right of the people to hold their rulers to account, and implicitly sanctioned the [[regicide]]; Milton's political reputation got him appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues by the Council of State in March 1649. His main job description was to compose the English Republic's foreign correspondence in Latin, but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor.<ref>C. Sullivan, 'Milton and the Beginning of Civil Service', in ''Literature in the Public Service'' (2013), Ch. 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:19 York Street, Westminster (1848).jpg|thumb|The back of no 19 York Street (1848).

Milton tried to break this powerful image of Charles I (the literal translation of Eikonoklastes is 'the image breaker'). A month later, however, the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his party published the defence of monarchy ''Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo'', written by leading humanist [[Claudius Salmasius]]. By January of the following year, Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the [[English Council of State|Council of State]]. Milton worked more slowly than usual, given the European audience and the English Republic's desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy, as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte.\n\nOn 24 February 1652, Milton published his Latin defence of the English people ''[[Defensio pro Populo Anglicano]]'', also known as the ''First Defence''. Milton's pure Latin prose and evident learning exemplified in the ''First Defence'' quickly made him a European reputation, and the work ran to numerous editions.<ref>von Maltzahn 1999 p. 239.</ref> He addressed his ''Sonnet 16'' to 'The Lord Generall Cromwell in May 1652' beginning  \"Cromwell, our chief of men...\", although it was not published until 1654.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=POOLEY|first=ROGER|date=1993|title=The poets' Cromwell|journal=Critical Survey|volume=5|issue=3|pages=223\u2013234|jstor=41555744}}</ref>\n\nIn 1654, Milton completed the second defence of the English nation ''Defensio secunda'' in response to an anonymous Royalist tract ''\"Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Coelum Adversus Parricidas Anglicanos\"'' [The Cry of the Royal Blood to Heaven  Against the English Parricides], a work that made many personal attacks on Milton.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cOoXuk5wEbQC&dq=Regii+sanguinis+clam+royalist|title=The Milton Encyclopedia|last=Corns|first=Thomas N.|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300094442|location=|pages=216}}</ref> The second defence praised [[Oliver Cromwell]], now Lord Protector, while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. [[Alexander Morus]], to whom Milton wrongly attributed the ''Clamor'' (in fact by [[Peter du Moulin]]), published an attack on Milton, in response to which Milton published the autobiographical ''Defensio pro se'' in 1655. Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until 1660, although after he had become totally blind, most of the work was done by his deputies, Georg Rudolph Wecklein, then Philip Meadows, and from 1657 by the poet [[Andrew Marvell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/milton-appointed-latin-secretary|title=Milton appointed Latin Secretary {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|accessdate=3 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 1652, Milton had become totally blind;<ref>John Leonard, in the introduction to \"Paradise Lost\", Penguin Classics page ix  2000</ref> the cause of his blindness is debated but bilateral [[retinal detachment]] or [[glaucoma]] are most likely.<ref name=pmid18168884>{{cite journal|last=Sorsby|first=A.|title=On The Nature of Milton's Blindness|journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology|year=1930|volume=14|issue=7|pages=339\u201354|pmid=18168884|pmc=511199|doi=10.1136/bjo.14.7.339}}</ref> His blindness forced him to dictate his [[verse (poetry)|verse]] and prose to [[amanuensis|amanuenses]] who copied them out for him; one of these was poet Andrew Marvell.

Milton, however, stubbornly clung to the beliefs that had originally inspired him to write for the Commonwealth. In 1659, he published ''[[A Treatise of Civil Power]]'', attacking the concept of a state-dominated church (the position known as [[Erastianism]]), as well as ''Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove hirelings'', denouncing corrupt practises in church governance. As the Republic disintegrated, Milton wrote several proposals to retain a non-monarchical government against the wishes of parliament, soldiers, and the people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/john-milton/miltons-works|title=Milton's Works|date=3 February 2017|website=Milton's Works|publisher=Christ's College Cambridge}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewalski|first=Barbara Kiefer|year=1959|title=Milton: Political Beliefs and Polemical Methods, 1659\u201360|jstor=460581|journal=PMLA|volume=74|issue=3|pages=191\u2013202|doi=10.2307/460581}}</ref>\n\n*''A Letter to a Friend, Concerning the Ruptures of the Commonwealth'', written in October 1659, was a response to [[John Lambert (general)|General Lambert]]'s recent dissolution of the [[Rump Parliament]].\n*''Proposals of certain expedients for the preventing of a civil war now feared'', written in November 1659.\n*''[[The Ready and Easy Way to Establishing a Free Commonwealth]]'', in two editions, responded to [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General Monck]]'s march towards London to restore the [[Long Parliament]] (which led to the restoration of the monarchy). The work is an impassioned, bitter, and futile [[jeremiad]] damning the English people for backsliding from the cause of [[liberty]] and advocating the establishment of an authoritarian rule by an [[oligarchy]] set up by unelected parliament.\n\nUpon the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in May 1660, Milton went into hiding for his life, while a warrant was issued for his arrest and his writings were burnt. He re-emerged after [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act|a general pardon]] was issued, but was nevertheless arrested and briefly imprisoned before influential friends intervened, such as Marvell, now an MP. Milton married for a third and final time on 24 February 1663, marrying Elizabeth (Betty) Minshull, aged 24, a native of [[Wistaston]], Cheshire. He spent the remaining decade of his life living quietly in London, only retiring to a cottage during the [[Great Plague of London]]\u2014[[Milton's Cottage]] in [[Chalfont St. Giles]], his only extant home.\n\nDuring this period, Milton published several minor prose works, such as the grammar textbook ''Art of Logic'' and a ''History of Britain''. His only explicitly political tracts were the 1672 ''Of True Religion'', arguing for [[toleration]] (except for Catholics), and a translation of a Polish tract advocating an elective monarchy. Both these works were referred to in the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion]] debate, the attempt to exclude the heir presumptive from the throne of England\u2014[[James, Duke of York]]\u2014because he was Roman Catholic. That debate preoccupied politics in the 1670s and 1680s and precipitated the formation of the [[British Whig Party|Whig party]] and the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\nMilton died of kidney failure on 8 November 1674 and was buried in the church of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], [[Fore Street, London|Fore Street]], London.<ref name=EncylLon>{{cite book|author1=[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]]; Ben Weinreb; John Keay; Julia Keay.|title=The London Encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa0D0PqiwfEC&pg=PA762|year=2010|location=London|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-73878-2|page=762}}</ref> According to an early biographer, his funeral was attended by \"his learned and great Friends in London, not without a friendly concourse of the Vulgar.\"<ref>Toland 1932 p. 193.</ref> A monument was added in 1793, sculpted by [[John Bacon (sculptor, born 1740)|John Bacon the Elder]].\n\n===Family===\nMilton and his first wife Mary Powell (1625\u20131652) had four children:\n*Anne (born 7 July 1646)\n*Mary (born 25 October 1648)\n*John (16 March 1651 \u2013 June 1652)\n*Deborah (2 May 1652 \u2013 10 August 1727<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Monthly Mirror: Reflecting Men and Manners|publisher=Harding & Wright|year=1810|location=Edinburgh|pages=49|quote=|via=Google Books}}</ref>)\n\nMary Powell died on 5 May 1652 from complications following Deborah's birth. Milton's daughters survived to adulthood, but he always had a strained relationship with them.\n\nOn 12 November 1656, Milton was married to Katherine Woodcock at [[St Margaret's, Westminster]].<ref>'Milton, John', in ''Journal of the Society of Arts, 8 November 1867, p. 755</ref> She died on 3 February 1658, less than four months after giving birth to her daughter Katherine, who also died.\n\nMilton married for a third time on 24 February 1663 to Elizabeth Mynshull or Minshull (1638\u20131728), the niece of Thomas Mynshull, a wealthy apothecary and philanthropist in Manchester. The marriage took place at [[St Mary Aldermary]] in the City of London. Despite a 31-year age gap, the marriage seemed happy, according to [[John Aubrey]], and lasted more than 12 years until Milton's death. (A plaque on the wall of Mynshull's House in Manchester describes Elizabeth as Milton's \"3rd and Best wife\".) Samuel Johnson, however, claims that Mynshull was \"a domestic companion and attendant\" and that Milton's nephew [[Edward Phillips]] relates that Mynshull \"oppressed his children in his lifetime, and cheated them at his death\".<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I 86.</ref>\n\nHis nephews, [[Edward Phillips|Edward]] and [[John Phillips (author)|John Phillips]] (sons of Milton's sister Anne), were educated by Milton and became writers themselves. John acted as a secretary, and Edward was Milton's first biographer.\n\n==Poetry==\nMilton's poetry was slow to see the light of day, at least under his name. His first published poem was \"On Shakespeare\" (1630), anonymously included in the [[Second Folio]] edition of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays in 1632. An annoted copy of the [[First Folio]] has been suggested to contain marginal notes by Milton.<ref>Flood, Alison,  ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/16/when-milton-met-shakespeare-poets-notes-on-bard-appear-to-have-been-found?

The anonymous edition of ''Comus'' was published in 1637, and the publication of ''Lycidas'' in 1638 in ''Justa Edouardo King Naufrago'' was signed J. M. Otherwise.

Both of these works also reflect Milton's post-Restoration political situation. Just before his death in 1674, Milton supervised a second edition of ''Paradise Lost'', accompanied by an explanation of \"why the poem rhymes not\", and prefatory verses by [[Andrew Marvell]]. In 1673, Milton republished his ''1645 Poems'', as well as a collection of his letters and the Latin prolusions from his Cambridge days.\n\n==Views==\nAn unfinished religious manifesto, ''[[De Doctrina Christiana (Milton)|De doctrina christiana]]'', probably written by Milton, lays out many of his heterodox theological views, and was not discovered and published until 1823. Milton's key beliefs were idiosyncratic, not those of an identifiable group or faction, and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone, however, stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience.<ref>See, for instance, Barker, Arthur. ''Milton and the Puritan Dilemma, 1641\u20131660''.

According to Fallon, Milton's monism is most notably reflected in ''Paradise Lost'' when he has angels eat (5.433\u201339){{clarify|date=May 2012}} and apparently engage in sexual intercourse (8.622\u201329){{clarify|date=May 2012}} and the ''De Doctrina'', where he denies the dual natures of man and argues for a theory of Creation [[Ex nihilo|''ex Deo'']].\n\n===Political thought===\n{{Main|John Milton's politics}}Milton was a \"passionately individual Christian Humanist poet.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Critical History of English Literature, Vol. I|last=Daiches|first=David|publisher=Seeker & Warburg|year=1960|isbn=|location=London|pages=457}}</ref> He appears on the pages of seventeenth century English Puritanism, an age characterized as \"the world turned upside down.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world turned upside down : radical ideas during the English revolution|last=Hill|first=Christopher|publisher=Penguin|year=1984|isbn=9780140137323|location=London|pages=}}</ref> He is a Puritan and yet is unwilling to surrender conscience to party positions on public policy.

In both the cases, he seems in control, taking stock of the situation arising from the polarization of the English society on religious and political lines.

After his divorce writings, ''Areopagitica'', and a gap, he wrote in 1649\u201354 in the aftermath of the [[execution of Charles I]], and in polemic justification of the regicide and the existing Parliamentarian regime. Then in 1659\u201360 he foresaw the Restoration, and wrote to head it off.<ref>Blair Worden, ''Literature and Politics in Cromwellian England: John Milton, Andrew Marvell and Marchamont Nedham'' (2007), p. 154.</ref>\n\nMilton's own beliefs were in some cases both unpopular and dangerous, and this was true particularly to his commitment to [[republicanism]].

John Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age. The great Poet was undoubtedly Reformed (though his grandfather, Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton had been Roman Catholic).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Arms of the Family: The Significance of John Milton's Relatives and Associates|last=Shawcross|first=John T.|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2004|isbn=978-0813122915|location=Lexington|pages=7}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=In the Days of Milton|last=Jenks|first=Tudor|publisher=A.S. Barnes & Company|year=1905|isbn=|location=New York|pages=35\u201336}}</ref> However, Milton's Calvinism had to find expression in a broad-spirited Humanism. Like many [[Renaissance]] artists before him, Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue, the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In ''Comus'', Milton may make ironic use of the [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] court [[masque]] by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton's theological concerns become more explicit.\n\nHis use of biblical citation was wide-ranging; Harris Fletcher, standing at the beginning of the intensification of the study of the use of scripture in Milton's work (poetry and prose, in all languages Milton mastered), notes that typically Milton clipped and adapted biblical quotations to suit the purpose, giving precise chapter and verse only in texts for a more specialized readership. As for the plenitude of Milton's quotations from scripture, Fletcher comments, \"For this work, I have in all actually collated about twenty-five hundred of the five to ten thousand direct Biblical quotations which appear therein\".<ref name=harris/> Milton's customary English Bible was the [[King James Version#Authorized Version|Authorized King James]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=E.

He has been accused of rejecting the [[Trinity]], believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as [[Arianism]]; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by [[Socinianism]]: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by [[William Dugard]] the ''[[Racovian Catechism]]'', based on a non-trinitarian creed.<ref>Lewalski, ''Life of Milton'', p. 253.</ref><ref>William Bridges Hunter, ''A Milton Encyclopedia'' (1980), Vol. VIII, p. 13.</ref> Milton's alleged Arianism, like much of his theology, is still subject of debate and controversy. [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] argued that \"In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian; and in the very last of his writings he declares that \"the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture.\"<ref>John Milton, The Prose Works of John Milton: With a Biographical Introduction by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. In Two Volumes (Philadelphia: John W. Moore, 1847). Vol. 1. [[wikisource:The Prose Works of John Milton/Biographical introduction|The Prose Works of John Milton, Biographical introduction]]</ref> In ''Areopagitica,'' Milton classified Arians and Socinians as \"errorists\" and \"schismatics\" alongside [[Arminians]] and [[Anabaptists]].<ref>W.F. Draper, \"The Religious Life and Opinions of John Milton.\" In \"The Bibliotheca Sacra and Biblical Repository,\" Volume 17 (1860) p. 38.</ref> A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant, if not always easy to locate in a more precise religious category.\n\nIn his 1641 treatise, ''[[Of Reformation]]'', Milton expressed his dislike for Catholicism and episcopacy, presenting Rome as a modern [[Babylon]], and bishops as Egyptian taskmasters. These analogies conform to Milton's puritanical preference for [[Old Testament]] imagery. He knew at least four commentaries on ''Genesis'': those of [[John Calvin]], [[Paulus Fagius]], [[David Pareus]] and [[Andreus Rivetus]].<ref>Arnold Williams, ''Renaissance Commentaries on \"Genesis\" and Some Elements of the Theology of Paradise Lost'', PMLA, Vol. 56, No. 1 (Mar. 1941), pp. 151\u201364.</ref>\n\nThrough the [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|Interregnum]], Milton often presents England, rescued from the trappings of a worldly monarchy, as an [[elect]] nation akin to the Old Testament [[Israel]], and shows its leader, [[Oliver Cromwell]], as a latter-day [[Moses]]. These views were bound up in Protestant views of the [[Millennium]], which some sects, such as the [[Fifth Monarchists]] predicted would arrive in England. Milton, however, would later criticise the \"worldly\" millenarian views of these and others, and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the [[Four Empires]].<ref>Walter S. H. Lim, ''John Milton, Radical Politics, and Biblical Republicanism'' (2006), p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 began a new phase in Milton's work. In ''Paradise Lost'', ''[[Paradise Regained]]'' and ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', Milton mourns the end of the godly [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]]. The [[Garden of Eden]] may allegorically reflect Milton's view of England's recent [[The Fall of Man|Fall from Grace]], while [[Samson]]'s blindness and captivity\u2014mirroring Milton's own lost sight\u2014may be a metaphor for England's blind acceptance of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as king.\nIllustrated by ''Paradise Lost'' is [[Soul sleep|mortalism]], the belief that the soul lies dormant after the body dies.<ref>John Rogers, ''The Matter of Revolution'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998), p. xi.</ref>\n\nDespite the Restoration of the monarchy, Milton did not lose his personal faith; Samson shows how the loss of national [[salvation]] did not necessarily preclude the salvation of the individual, while ''Paradise Regained'' expresses Milton's continuing belief in the promise of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ.\n\nThough he maintained his personal faith in spite of the defeats suffered by his cause, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' recounted how he had been alienated from the Church of England by Archbishop William Laud, and then moved similarly from the [[Dissenters]] by their denunciation of religious tolerance in England.\n\n{{quote|Milton had come to stand apart from all sects, though apparently finding the [[Quakers]] most congenial. He never went to any religious services in his later years. When a servant brought back accounts of sermons from [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] meetings, Milton became so sarcastic that the man at last gave up his place.}}Writing of the enigmatic and often conflicting views of Milton in the Puritan age, David Daiches wrote convincingly,<blockquote>\"Christian and Humanist, Protestant, patriot and heir of the golden ages of Greece and Rome, he faced what appeared to him to be the birth-pangs of a new and regenerate England with high excitement and idealistic optimism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>A fair theological summary may be: that John Milton was a Puritan, though his tendency to press further for liberty of conscience, sometimes out of conviction and often out of mere intellectual curiosity, made the great man, at least, a vital if not uncomfortable ally in the broader Puritan movement.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Religious toleration===\nMilton called in the ''[[Areopagitica]]'' for \"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties\" (applied, however, only to the conflicting Protestant denominations, and not to atheists, Jews, Muslims or Catholics).<ref>Hill, C. Milton and the English Revolution.  Faber & Faber. 1977.  pp. 155\u201357</ref> \"Milton argued for [[disestablishment]] as the only effective way of achieving broad [[Religious toleration|toleration]].

In August of that year, he presented his thoughts to the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]], which had been created by the [[Long Parliament]] to bring greater reform to the Church of England. The Assembly convened on 1 July against the will of King Charles I.\n\nMilton's thinking on divorce caused him considerable trouble with the authorities. An orthodox Presbyterian view of the time was that Milton's views on divorce constituted a one-man [[heresy]]:\n\n{{quote|The fervently Presbyterian [[Thomas Edwards (heresiographer)|Edwards]] had included Milton's divorce tracts in his list in ''[[Gangraena]]'' of heretical publications that threatened the religious and moral fabric of the nation; Milton responded by mocking him as \"shallow Edwards\" in the satirical sonnet \"On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament\", usually dated to the latter half of 1646.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119394388/PDFSTART (PDF) Nicholas McDowell, ''Family Politics; Or, How John Phillips Read His Uncle's Satirical Sonnets'', Milton Quarterly Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp. 1\u201321.

However, Milton's basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals, particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly on the matter of divorce in August 1643,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704170506/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |archivedate= 4 July 2013 }}</ref> at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the Doctrine & Discipline of Divorce, Milton argued that divorce was a private matter, not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact, when the Westminster Assembly wrote the Westminster Confession of Faith they allowed for divorce ('Of Marriage and Divorce,' Chapter 24, Section 5) in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus, the Christian community, at least a majority within the 'Puritan' sub-set, approved of Milton's views.\n\nNevertheless, reaction among Puritans to Milton's views on divorce was mixed. [[Herbert Palmer (Puritan)|Herbert Palmer]], a member of the [[Westminster Assembly]], condemned Milton in the strongest possible language:\n\n{{quote|If any plead Conscience ... for divorce for other causes than Christ and His Apostles mention; Of which a wicked booke is abroad and uncensured, though deserving to be burnt, whose Author, hath been so impudent as to set his Name to it, and dedicate it to your selves ... will you grant a Toleration for all this?|The Glasse of God's Providence Towards His Faithfull Ones, 1644, p. 54.<ref>Ernest Sirluck, \"Introduction\", Complete Prose Works of John Milton, New Haven: Yale U.

He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the 18th and 19th centuries; he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets, including [[Shakespeare]].

A subsequent prose translation by [[Johann Jakob Bodmer]] was very popular; it influenced Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. The German-language Milton tradition returned to England in the person of the artist [[Henry Fuseli]].\n\nMany enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century revered and commented on Milton's poetry and non-poetical works. In addition to John Dryden, among them were [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[Thomas Newton]], and [[Samuel Johnson]]. For example, in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'',<ref>Nos 267, 273, 279, 285, 291, 297, 303, 309, 315, 321, 327, 333, 339, 345, 351, 357, 363, and 369.</ref> Joseph Addison wrote extensive notes, annotations, and interpretations of certain passages of ''Paradise Lost''. [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson, senior]], and Jonathan Richardson, the younger, co-wrote a book of criticism.<ref>''Explanatory Notes and Remarks on Milton's Paradise Lost'' (1734).</ref> In 1749, Thomas Newton published an extensive edition of Milton's poetical works with annotations provided by himself, Dryden, Pope, Addison, the Richardsons (father and son) and others. Newton's edition of Milton was a culmination of the honour bestowed upon Milton by early Enlightenment thinkers; it may also have been prompted by Richard Bentley's infamous edition, described above. Samuel Johnson wrote numerous essays on ''Paradise Lost'', and Milton was included in his ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]'' (1779\u20131781). In ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'', [[Voltaire]] said \"Milton remains the glory and the wonder (''l'admiration'') of England.\"<ref>Voltaire, ''Le Siecle de Louis XIV 2,'' Paris: Garnier-Flammarion, 1966, p.66.</ref>\n\n===Blake===\n[[File:Milton a Poem copy D 1818 Library of Congress object 1.jpg|thumb|[[Frontispiece (book)|Frontispiece]] to ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]]'']]\n\n[[William Blake]] considered Milton the major English poet.

At the time, poetic blank verse was considered distinct from its use in verse drama, and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was taken as a unique examplar.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 443.</ref> Said [[Isaac Watts]] in 1734, \"Mr. Milton is esteemed the parent and author of blank verse among us\".<ref>Watts 1810 iv. 619.</ref> \"Miltonic verse\" might be synonymous for a century with blank verse as poetry, a new poetic terrain independent from both the drama and the [[heroic couplet]].\n\nLack of rhyme was sometimes taken as Milton's defining innovation. He himself considered the rhymeless quality of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' to be an extension of his own personal liberty:\n\n{{quote|This neglect then of Rhime&nbsp;... is to be esteem'd an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recover'd to heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing.<ref>Milton 1668 xi.</ref>}}\n\nThis pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet.<ref>Gordon 2008 p. 234.</ref> Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish, he granted primacy to freedom, breadth and imaginative suggestiveness, eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror. Reaction to Milton's poetic worldview included, grudgingly, acknowledgement that of poet's resemblance to classical writers (Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed). Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics. Unrhymed lyrics like [[William Collins (poet)|Collins]]' ''[[Ode to Evening]]'' (in the meter of Milton's translation of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ode to Pyrrha]]'') were not uncommon after 1740.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 46.</ref>\n\nA second aspect of Milton's blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm:\n\n{{quote|His blank-verse paragraph, and his audacious and victorious attempt to combine blank and rhymed verse with paragraphic effect in Lycidas, lay down indestructible models and patterns of English verse-rhythm, as distinguished from the narrower and more strait-laced forms of English metre.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 457.</ref>}}\n\nBefore Milton, \"the sense of regular rhythm&nbsp;... had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 101.</ref> The \"Heroick measure\", according to [[Samuel Johnson]], \"is pure&nbsp;... when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line&nbsp;... The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable\".<ref>Johnson 1751 no. 86.</ref> [[Caesura]]l pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle and the end of the line. In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no [[enjambed]] endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included [[hypermetric]]al [[syllable]]s (trisyllabic [[Foot (prosody)|feet]]), [[inversion (prosody)|inversion]] or slighting of [[stress (linguistics)|stresses]], and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 57.</ref> Milton deemed these features to be reflective of \"the transcendental union of order and freedom\".<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 458\u201359.</ref> Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: \"The English&nbsp;... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit\".<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 59.</ref> Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Henry Pemberton]], and [[Scott of Amwell]], whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was \"displeasing to a nice ear\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 114.</ref> It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with [[Thomas Gray|Gray]]) began to appreciate \"the composition of Milton's harmony&nbsp;... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification\".<ref>Gray 1748 ''Observations on English Metre''.</ref> By the 20th century, American poet and critic John Hollander would go so far as to say that Milton \"was able, by plying that most remarkable instrument of English meter ... to invent a new mode of image-making in English poetry.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116|title=Vision and resonance : two senses of poetic form|last=Hollander|first=John|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0-19-501898-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116 116]|oclc=1530446}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Giles-without-Cripplegate, London 01.JPG|thumb|Memorial in [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], London]]\n\nWhile [[neoclassicism|neo-classical]] diction was as restrictive as its [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]], and narrow imagery paired with uniformity of sentence structure resulted in a small set of 800 nouns circumscribing the vocabulary of 90% of heroic couplets ever written up to the eighteenth century,<ref>Hobsbaum 1996 p. 40.</ref> and tradition required that the same adjectives attach to the same nouns, followed by the same verbs, Milton's pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well.

In 1740, [[Francis Peck]] identified some examples of Milton's \"old\" words (now popular).<ref>They included \"self-same\", \"hue\", \"minstrelsy\", \"murky\", \"carol\", and \"chaunt\".
