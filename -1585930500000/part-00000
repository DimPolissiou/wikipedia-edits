{"title_page": "Crawl space", "text_new": "[[File:Crawlspace_under_house.jpg|thumb|A typical crawl space with [[vapor barrier]] keeping some moisture from coming in from the dirt floor.]]\n{{Other uses|Crawl space (disambiguation)}}\nA '''crawl space''' is an unoccupied, unfinished narrow space under a building, between the ground and first floor. The crawl space is so named because there is typically only enough room to crawl rather than stand; anything larger than about {{convert|1|to|1.5|m}} would tend to be considered a [[basement]].\n\n==Uses==\nA crawl space is often built when building a basement would be impractical or too expensive. A crawl space can also substitute for a [[concrete slab]] [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] that would hinder [[building inspection]]s.<ref name=termite>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/09/what-do-when-pests-become-homewreckers/|title=What to do when pests become homewreckers - The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nThe crawl space's functions include providing access to repair plumbing, electrical wiring, and heating and cooling systems without the need for excavation. [[Building insulation]] can also be installed in a crawl spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/campaign/seal_insulate/basement_crawlspace|title=Basement & Crawlspace Air Sealing and Insulating Project|website=www.energystar.gov}}</ref> The crawl space can provide a protective buffer between the damp ground and the wooden parts of a home and, with adequate sealing, help with [[radon mitigation]]. Crawl spaces are also sometimes used for storage of items such as canned goods that are not particularly susceptible to destruction by [[mildew]] or unstable temperatures.\n\nA crawl space foundation can be used to elevate the lowest floors of residential buildings located in [[Special Flood Hazard Area]]s above the [[Base Flood Elevation]]. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] recommends that the floor of the crawlspace be at or above the lowest grade adjacent to the building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/crawlspace|title=Crawlspace &#124; FEMA.gov|website=www.fema.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCrawl spaces are not usually an option in cold regions, such as the [[northern United States]], where a full basement is needed to get the foundation below the [[frost line]]. Another downside of crawl spaces compared to basements is that they offer less protection against [[earthquake]]s, [[tornado]]s, and [[hurricane]]s. Crawl spaces also tend to be more expensive than slab foundations. Problems with crawl spaces, such as leaks, may not be noticed as quickly as problems with basements, since people typically do not go into their crawl space as often. A crawl space also may not be as well-suited to a sloped lot as a basement. [[HVAC]] equipment in unconditioned crawl spaces tends not to operate as efficiently as it would in a conditioned space such as a basement.<ref>https://www.byhyu.com/home--podcast/slab-crawlspace-or-basement-do-you-know-what-type-of-foundation-to-choose-byhyu-069</ref>\n\n==Designs==\nCrawl spaces can be actively or passively vented, or closed. An advantage of a vented crawl space is that harmful gases such as [[radon]] or [[carbon monoxide]] (e.g. from [[gas furnace]]s or [[water heating|water heaters]]) can escape or be diluted before they can enter the living space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://europepmc.org/article/med/3980214|title=Europe PMC|website=europepmc.org}}</ref> However, in regions with a humid climate, vents to the outside can also allow moist air to come in, which can then condense if temperatures (e.g. on cooler surfaces such as ductwork) drop below the [[dew point]], creating a damp environment that is hospitable to [[indoor mold]] growth as well as infestations by rodents and insects, possibly including wood-damaging ones such as [[termite]]s<ref name=termite/> or [[carpenter ant]]s.

The crawl space is so named because there is typically only enough room to crawl rather than stand; anything larger than about {{convert|1|to|1.5|m}} would tend to be considered a [[basement]].\n\n==Uses==\nA crawl space is often built when building a basement would be impractical or too expensive. A crawl space can also substitute for a [[concrete slab]] [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] that would hinder [[building inspection]]s.<ref name=termite>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/09/what-do-when-pests-become-homewreckers/|title=What to do when pests become homewreckers - The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nThe crawl space's functions include providing access to repair plumbing, electrical wiring, and heating and cooling systems without the need for excavation. [[Building insulation]] can also be installed in a crawl spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/campaign/seal_insulate/basement_crawlspace|title=Basement & Crawlspace Air Sealing and Insulating Project|website=www.energystar.gov}}</ref> The crawl space can provide a protective buffer between the damp ground and the wooden parts of a home and, with adequate sealing, help with [[radon mitigation]]. Crawl spaces are also sometimes used for storage of items such as canned goods that are not particularly susceptible to destruction by [[mildew]] or unstable temperatures.\n\nA crawl space foundation can be used to elevate the lowest floors of residential buildings located in [[Special Flood Hazard Area]]s above the [[Base Flood Elevation]]. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] recommends that the floor of the crawlspace be at or above the lowest grade adjacent to the building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/crawlspace|title=Crawlspace &#124; FEMA.gov|website=www.fema.gov}}</ref>\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCrawl spaces are not usually an option in cold regions, such as the [[northern United States]], where a full basement is needed to get the foundation below the [[frost line]]. Another downside of crawl spaces compared to basements is that they offer less protection against [[earthquake]]s, [[tornado]]s, and [[hurricane]]s. Crawl spaces also tend to be more expensive than slab foundations. Problems with crawl spaces, such as leaks, may not be noticed as quickly as problems with basements, since people typically do not go into their crawl space as often. A crawl space also may not be as well-suited to a sloped lot as a basement. [[HVAC]] equipment in unconditioned crawl spaces tends not to operate as efficiently as it would in a conditioned space such as a basement.<ref>https://www.byhyu.com/home--podcast/slab-crawlspace-or-basement-do-you-know-what-type-of-foundation-to-choose-byhyu-069</ref>\n\n==Designs==\nCrawl spaces can be actively or passively vented, or closed. An advantage of a vented crawl space is that harmful gases such as [[radon]] or [[carbon monoxide]] (e.g. from [[gas furnace]]s or [[water heater]]s) can escape or be diluted before they can enter the living space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://europepmc.org/article/med/3980214|title=Europe PMC|website=europepmc.org}}</ref> However, in regions with a humid climate, vents to the outside can also allow moist air to come in, which can then condense if temperatures (e.g. on cooler surfaces such as ductwork) drop below the [[dew point]], creating a damp environment that is hospitable to [[indoor mold]] growth as well as infestations by rodents and insects, possibly including wood-damaging ones such as [[termite]]s<ref name=termite/> or [[carpenter ant]]s.

Fullwood.<ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidalm/2019/02/05/marlon-riggs-icon-of-queer-and-black-cinema-celebrated-in-brooklyn/#1f8a178dee8d</ref><ref>https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/marlon-riggs-retrospective</ref>\n \nWith support from the [https://www.fordfoundation.org/ Ford Foundation], [[Vivian Kleiman]] and [http://marlonriggs.com/signifyin-works/ Signifyin' Works] were able to spend the year introducing the work to a powerful new generation. Charles Stephens of [https://www.thecounternarrative.org The Counter Narrative Project], was instrumental in bringing Tongues Untied to organizations that support black gay men across the United States and fostering crucial discussions surrounding the film. \n \nIn May, 2019, the [[Peabody Award]]s honored ''Tongues Untied'' with a tribute, which [[Billy Porter (entertainer)|Billy Porter]] of the award-winning FX Channel series [[Pose (TV series)|Pose]] presented. He reflected that the film changed his life and gave him his voice at an early age.<ref>http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/tongues-untied-tribute</ref>\n\nNew York Times critic-at-large [[Wesley Morris]] wrote \"Tongues Untied is Riggs's unclassifiable scrapbook of black gay male sensibility (a hallucinatory whir of style, memory, psychology).... This is storytelling that arises from joy and pain and pride (Riggs\u2019s clearest emotional forebear is James Baldwin).\" <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/blackness-gayness-representation-marlon-riggs-unpacks-it-all-in-his-films.html</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[African-American culture and sexual orientation]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* ''Black American Cinema'', Manthia Diawara.\n* '' Resolutions: Contemporary Video Practices'', (eds.

Aryan's girlfriend Rishma ([[Ihana Dhillon]]) appears with a gun to kill him. In a tussle, Rishma is shot and dies.\n\nThe story moves back, introducing Aryan and Rajveer ([[Karan Wahi]]), sons of wealthy businessman and politician Vikram Khurana ([[Gulshan Grover]]). Looking for a fresh face to represent their company, Rajveer goes to a bar, where he is smitten by Tasha. He woos Tasha by promising her to make her a star and hires her for their company. In an attempt to lure her into bed, he pays some goons to attack her so he can swoop in as the hero. As he is paying the goons, someone takes a picture of the transaction. Aryan too is captivated by Tasha's beauty and is able to get her drunk at a party. That night, he sleeps with her, and she wakes up regretting the event. This is when their photo is sent to her phone.\n\nIn the present, Aryan convinces Tasha to quietly dispose of Rishma's body. They dump the body in a river. Tasha then reveals to the audience that she herself is the person behind all of this - the mastermind behind all the events thus far. She had known that Rajveer had hired goons and had bribed them as well; she also spiked Aryan's drink at the party, and after he passed out, took photos with him in compromising positions to make it look like they slept together. She then sent the photos to Rishma.\n\nTasha continues to avoid Rajveer, making him desperate for her. Playing the brothers against each other, she publicly rejects Rajveer's proposal, telling him that Aryan told her about how Rajveer lures girls into bed, then leaves them. She also reveals that she and Aryan are involved. Aryan receives a video clip of him dumping Rishma's body.\n\nVikram is baffled by Rajveer's behaviour when he receives the compromising picture of Aryan and Tasha and the video of Aryan dumping a dead body. He gets a threatening call in which the blackmailer (Tasha) demands that his sons confess to the crime they committed two years ago in India. It is revealed that  two years ago, Rajveer tried to force a girl Bhavna ([[Tia Bajpai]]) into his car. When a passersby Ashwin ([[Shaad Randhawa]]) came to help her, Aryan shot him. Overcome by rage, Rajveer shot him again and again, killing him. In the hospital, Ashwin is declared dead as his sister Natasha (Tasha) and his mother arrive. Bhavna's family is threatened by Vikram to keep silent. Natasha vows to avenge her brother's murder.\n\nPresently, Rajveer, heartbroken, is not able to overcome the pain when he is informed that Aryan is the one who snatched his love. He confronts Aryan and threatens to reveal that Aryan killed Rishma. In the struggle to stop him, Aryan ends up killing Rajveer. He dumps him in a grave as suggested by Tasha. Rajveer's ex Monica discovers the truth about Tasha and tells Aryan. Aryan tries to kill Tasha but she successfully knocks him out and injures herself, acting innocent in front of the police, who then arrest Aryan.\n\nIn the ending credits, Tasha blames Vikram for being a bad father. At Natasha's home, Rishma, revealed to be alive, stands in front of Ashwin's picture: she had been his fianc\u00e9 when he was alive.\n\n==Cast ==\n*[[Urvashi Rautela]] as Natasha \"Tasha\" Choudhary\n*[[Karan Wahi]] as Rajveer Khurrana\n*[[Vivan Bhatena]] as Aryann Khurrana\n*[[Ihana Dhillon]] as Reshma\n*[[Gulshan Grover]] as UK Minister Vikram Khurana, also a business tycoon\n*[[Tia Bajpai]] as Bhavna Shrivastav{{small|(special appearance)}}\n*[[Shaad Randhawa]] as Ashwin Choudhary, Natasha's elder brother{{small|(special appearance)}}\n*James Abbey as ACP, Mumbai Police\n*Rita Siddiqui as Monica\n\n==Production==\nThe [[pre-production]] of the film began in June 2017.<ref>[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/060617/urvashi-rautela-to-star-in-hate-story-4.html \"Exclusive: Urvashi Rautela to star in Hate Story 4?\"]</ref> [[Principal photography]] commenced in [[London]] from September 2017<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/hate-story-4-shoot-begins-in-london-ihana-dhillon-to-debut-in-bollywood/story-aX39yxTTqfut6kJ3tValNM.html \"Hate Story 4 shoot begins in London, Ihana Dhillon to debut in Bollywood\"]</ref> and concluded on 11 November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinestaan.com/articles/2017/nov/13/9216/hate-story-4-shoot-wrapped-up|title=Hate Story 4 shoot wrapped up|date=13 November 2017|website=cinestaan.com|access-date=13 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |author-link=Vishal Pandya|user=ivishalpandya|number=929302277621518337|date=11 November 2017|title=Hate Story 4 !!

It is revealed that  two years ago, Rajveer tried to force a girl Bhavna ([[Tia Bajpai]]) into his car. When a passersby Ashwin ([[Shaad Randhawa]]) came to help her, Aryan shot him. Overcome by rage, Rajveer shot him again and again, killing him. In the hospital, Ashwin is declared dead as his sister Natasha (Tasha) and his mother arrive. Bhavna's family is threatened by Vikram to keep silent. Natasha vows to avenge her brother's murder.\n\nPresently, Rajveer, heartbroken, is not able to overcome the pain when he is informed that Aryan is the one who snatched his love. He confronts Aryan and threatens to reveal that Aryan killed Rishma. In the struggle to stop him, Aryan ends up killing Rajveer. He dumps him in a grave as suggested by Tasha. Rajveer's ex Monica discovers the truth about Tasha and tells Aryan. Aryan tries to kill Tasha but she successfully knocks him out and injures herself, acting innocent in front of the police, who then arrest Aryan.\n\nIn the ending credits, Tasha blames Vikram for being a bad father. At Natasha's home, Rishma, revealed to be alive, stands in front of Ashwin's picture: she had been his fiance when he was alive.\n\n==Cast ==\n*[[Urvashi Rautela]] as Natasha \"Tasha\" Choudhary\n*[[Karan Wahi]] as Rajveer Khurrana\n*[[Vivan Bhatena]] as Aryann Khurrana\n*[[Ihana Dhillon]] as Reshma\n*[[Gulshan Grover]] as UK Minister Vikram Khurana, also a business tycoon\n*[[Tia Bajpai]] as Bhavna Shrivastav{{small|(special appearance)}}\n*[[Shaad Randhawa]] as Ashwin Choudhary, Natasha's elder brother{{small|(special appearance)}}\n*James Abbey as ACP, Mumbai Police\n*Rita Siddiqui as Monica\n\n==Production==\nThe [[pre-production]] of the film began in June 2017.<ref>[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/060617/urvashi-rautela-to-star-in-hate-story-4.html \"Exclusive: Urvashi Rautela to star in Hate Story 4?\"]</ref> [[Principal photography]] commenced in [[London]] from September 2017<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/hate-story-4-shoot-begins-in-london-ihana-dhillon-to-debut-in-bollywood/story-aX39yxTTqfut6kJ3tValNM.html \"Hate Story 4 shoot begins in London, Ihana Dhillon to debut in Bollywood\"]</ref> and concluded on 11 November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinestaan.com/articles/2017/nov/13/9216/hate-story-4-shoot-wrapped-up|title=Hate Story 4 shoot wrapped up|date=13 November 2017|website=cinestaan.com|access-date=13 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |author-link=Vishal Pandya|user=ivishalpandya|number=929302277621518337|date=11 November 2017|title=Hate Story 4 !!
