WP:MOS-ZH--> was a [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|kingdom]] within the [[Han Empire]] of China, located in present-day [[Hunan]] and some surrounding areas. The kingdom was founded when [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]] granted the territory to [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], one of his main followers, around the same time as the establishment of the Han dynasty in 202 BC. Wu Rui and his descendants held the kingdom for five generations until Wu Zhu died without an heir in 157 BC. In 155 BC, the kingdom was reestablished for a member of the [[Family tree of the Han Dynasty|imperial family]]. However, the creation of this second kingdom coincided with the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent reforms under [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]], and Changsha under the imperial family saw its autonomy greatly diminished. The kingdom was dissolved during [[Wang Mang]]'s [[Xin dynasty|usurpation]] (AD 9 \u2013 23), briefly restored after the founding of the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern Han]], and finally abolished in {{nowrap|AD 33}} and converted to a [[Jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] under the imperial government.\n\nChangsha was one of the largest and longest-lasting kingdoms in Han China.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}} Despite being established on the empire's frontier, technology and art flourished in Changsha. Numerous archaeological sites of the kingdom have been discovered and excavated; most notably [[Mawangdui]], the tomb of Changsha's [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] Li Cang and his family, providing valuable insights into life in the kingdom and Han dynasty in general.\n\n==History==\nThe first king of Changsha, [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], was a [[Baiyue]] leader who had been the magistrate of [[Poyang County]] under the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 \u2013 207 BC). He enjoyed high prestige among the local people and was known as \"Lord of the Po\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u756a|\u541b}}}}, ''P\u00f3j\u016bn'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} \n\nIn {{nowrap|209 BC}}, [[Dazexiang Uprising|a peasant uprising]] triggered a wave of rebellions that resulted in [[collapse of Qin|the collapse]] of the Qin. After hearing news of the uprising, Wu Rui organized a mostly Baiyue army in support of the rebels. His forces soon grew to become a major faction in the civil war that ensued.{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} In {{nowrap|207 BC}}, Rui's army joined forces with the [[Han dynasty|Han]] leader [[Liu Bang]] (the future Emperor Gaozu, at the time one of the rebel generals) and marched to the [[Guanzhong Plain]], where they received the surrender of [[Ziying]], the last ruler of Qin.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} One year later, the [[Western Chu|Chu]] King [[Xiang Yu]], then the most prominent leader in the rebellion, in [[Eighteen Kingdoms|an attempt to redivide the empire]], recognized Rui as the \"King of Hengshan\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8861\u5c71|\u738b}}}},}} ''H\u00e9ngsh\u0101n W\u00e1ng''). The Han eventually emerged victorious from [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|post-Qin conflicts]] and established itself as the preeminent power in China. In 203/{{nowrap|202 BC}}, Emperor Gaozu moved Wu Rui's fief{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} and established the Kingdom of Changsha.{{sfn|Li|2014|p=330}} The capital was Linxiang and located within the present-day city of [[Changsha]].{{sfn|He|2013|pp=260\u2013266}} The new kingdom helped the Han dynasty consolidate control over the Chu heartland and served as a [[buffer state]] against the independent realm of [[Nanyue]] founded by the Qin general [[Zhao Tuo]] in present-day [[Guangdong]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|He|2013|pp=3\u20135}} Rui died shortly after moving to his new territory, and the title passed to his son, Wu Chen {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u81e3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u00e9n'').{{sfn|Li|2014|pp=331\u2013332}} Wu Chen reigned for eight years.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}\n\nThe kings of Changsha were staunch supporters of the Han, and their loyalty and competence was praised by successive emperors.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=22}} In the first years after the founding of the Han Empire, the Emperor Gaozu embarked on a campaign to eliminate kings that were not members of the imperial family. The kings first grew to prominence as heads of independent factions in the chaos following Qin's fall, and the emperor viewed them as great threats to his authority. Changsha, located on the empire's southern fringe, was among the weakest among the kingdoms; however, it was the only one to survive beyond 190s BC.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=28}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} In {{nowrap|195 BC,}} [[Ying Bu]], King of [[Huainan]] and son-in-law of Wu Rui, rebelled against the Han and was defeated. As Ying retreated south of the [[Yangtze River]], the King of Changsha pretended to assist him in his escape to Nanyue but instead killed him in Cixiang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8332\u9109}}}},}} ''C\u00edxi\u0101ng'') near Poyang.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=106}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nWu Chen was succeeded by his son Wu Hui {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u56de}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Hu\u00ed''). Hui reigned for seven years, and was succeeded by his son Wu You {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u53f3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Y\u00f2u''), whose name is also recorded as Wu Ruo {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u82e5}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ru\u00f2'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=107}} At the time, the Han dynasty was under [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]] and [[Empress L\u00fc]], who favored lenient laws and political views of the [[Huang\u2013Lao]] school of philosophy. Changsha was able to develop under relative peace.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=31}} In {{nowrap|183 BC,}} however, Empress L\u00fc banned the export of [[iron ware]] to Nanyue, which angered Zhao Tuo, who then proclaimed himself Emperor of Nanyue and then twice invaded Changsha, occupying a few [[county (China)|counties]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=136}} Later, during Empress L\u00fc's reign, the imperial court decided to launch a military campaign against Nanyue. However, in the hot and humid summer, a plague broke out in the Han army, hindering its advance. The campaign was eventually abandoned with the death of Empress L\u00fc.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}} In {{nowrap|178 BC,}} the kingdom passed to Wu You's son Wu Zhu {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u8457}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Zh\u00f9''), for whom the names Wu Chai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u5dee}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u0101i'') and Wu Chan {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u7522}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u01cen'') are alternatively used in some records.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=113}} Wu Zhu reigned for twenty-one years, dying in {{nowrap|157 BC}} without male issue.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}\n\nAfter the extinction of this house, [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u767c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa F\u0101'') in {{nowrap|155 BC.}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} Fa's mother, Tang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}, ''T\u00e1ng''), was a servant of the Emperor's concubine Cheng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7a0b}}}}, ''Ch\u00e9ng'') and had given birth to Fa after the intoxicated emperor had mistaken her for his favorite concubine. Consequently, Fa had the lowest status among the Emperor's 14 sons and was [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] in Changsha, far away from the capital [[Chang'an]] and the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=35\u201336}} Changsha Kingdom was held by the Liu family until early the 1st century AD, when the Han dynasty was interrupted by usurper [[Wang Mang]]. Along with other kings of the Liu family in the empire, Liu Shun {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u821c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa Sh\u00f9n''), the last King of Changsha, was demoted first to the rank of duke and then to a commoner.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=40}}{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}} After the restoration of Han dynasty, the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu Emperor]], himself a descendant of Liu Fa, gave Changsha to Liu Shun's son Liu Xing {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u8208}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa X\u012bng'') in {{nowrap|AD 26.}} In 33 the Emperor rescinded the decision and demoted Xing to the rank of a marquis, citing the distance of kinship between Xing and himself. Changsha was administered as an imperial [[Jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] thereafter.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=40}}\n\n==Territory==\n[[File:Western Han Mawangdui Silk Map.JPG|thumb|Silk map unearthed from Mawangdui, showing Changsha and the neighboring kingdom of [[Nanyue]].|alt=A scan of the Mawangdui silk map. The coastline and several rivers drawn in dark colors are clearly visible.]]\n\nThe exact extent of the first Changsha Kingdom is still unclear. The official ''[[Book of Han]]'' reports Changsha's border \u201creaching the north bank of [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]] and stretching to [[Jiuyi Mountains]]\u201d, although it is unlikely that Changsha actually reached so far. Similarly, it reports that, when Emperor Gaozu created the Kingdom of Changsha, he granted Wu Rui authority over the five [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commanderies]] of Changsha, Yuzhang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c6b\u7ae0}}}},}} ''Y\u00f9zh\u0101ng''), Xiang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c61}}}}, ''Xi\u00e0ng''), Guilin {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u6797}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecl\u00edn'') and Nanhai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5357\u6d77}}}},}} ''N\u00e1nh\u01cei''). However, Yuzhang Commandery had already been conferred to Ying Bu, the King of Huainan, while Xiang, Guilin, and Nanhai Commanderies were all held by Zhao Tuo, the effectively independent King of Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=42}} This state of the Changsha\u2013Nanyue border was confirmed in a [[Early Chinese cartography|map]] unearthed from the [[Mawangdui]] tombs.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}} On the other hand, other preserved and unearthed texts have shown that there were two other commanderies actually controlled by the Changsha Kingdom: Wuling {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6b66\u9675}}}},}} ''W\u01d4l\u00edng'') and Guiyang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u967d}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecy\u00e1ng''). The first may have been granted by the imperial Han government; the historical geographer [[Zhou Zhenhe]] argues that the \"Yuzhang\" recorded in the ''Book of Han'' was simply a mistake for \"Wuling\", which would have been part of the original grant of the kingdom.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|p=119}} Guiyang was likely created by the kings of Changsha at some point for defense against invasions from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}}\n\nThe reconstruction offered by Zhou and [[Tan Qixiang]] is that Changsha's northern border ran along modern [[Tongcheng County|Tongcheng]], [[Songzi]], and [[Gong'an County|Gong'an]] counties; the western border along modern [[Longshan County|Longshan]], [[Zhenyuan County, Guizhou|Zhenyuan]], and [[Jingzhou County|Jingzhou]] counties; and the eastern border along modern [[Gao'an]], [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichuan]], [[Lianhua County|Lianhua]], and [[Chaling County|Chaling]] counties. Changsha's southern frontier with Nanyue was approximately the modern southern border of Hunan.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}}\n\nWhen Emperor Jing granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa, the kingdom's territory was reduced to Changsha Commandery alone. Consequently, the kingdom's southwestern border was in the vicinity of modern Chaling, [[Wugang, Hunan|Wugang]] and [[Quanzhou County|Quanzhou]] counties.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}} From Emperor Wu's reign onward, 20 [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|marquisates]] was created from Changsha. These marquisates were administered as parts of neighboring commanderies, further reducing the kingdom's territory.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|pp=122\u2013125}}\n\n==Demographics==\nChangsha was sparsely populated compared to other parts of the Han Empire.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=78}} The population primarily consisted of descendants of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] colonizers, members of the Qin military garrison and their offspring, assimilated [[Nanman]], and the native Baiyue tribes. Zhao Tuo, King of Nanyue, claimed that \"half of Changsha are [[Four Barbarians|Man and Yi]]\". [[Jia Yi]], grand tutor of the king from 176 to {{nowrap|172 BC,}} wrote that there were only 25,000 households in the kingdom,{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=50}} although it is likely that the figure was an underestimate.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=110}} (Jia, an advocate for further limits on the kingdoms' autonomy, saw Changsha's weakness as a reason of its loyalty.) However, the population increased rapidly, partly due to the favorable agricultural policies and partly because of immigration both from within the Han empire and from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=52\u201353}} In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} when the Han dynasty conducted an empire-wide population census, the population of Changsha was recorded as 235,825 living in 43,470 households. The commanderies that constituted the larger Changsha of the early Han dynasty together had a population of 717,433 living in 126,858 households, a five-fold increase from Jia Yi's estimation during the early Han period.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=52}}\n\n==Government==\n[[File:\u201c\u957f\u6c99\u76f8\u5370\u7ae0\u201d\u5c01\u6ce5.jpg|thumb|A clay imprint of the [[seal (East Asia)|seal]] of the chancellor of the Changsha Kingdom.|alt=Refer to caption.]]\nIn the early Han dynasty, the government structure of the kingdoms closely followed that of the [[Government of the Han dynasty#Central government|Han central government]], but differences remained.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} Except for the chancellor and grand tutor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u592a\u5085}}}},}} ''t\u00e0if\u00f9''), who were selected by the imperial court, all officials were appointed by the king.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} As in the imperial government, the chancellor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u76f8\u570b}}}},}} ''xi\u00e0nggu\u00f3'', before {{nowrap|194 BC}} and {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e1e\u76f8}}}},}} ''ch\u00e9ngxi\u00e0ng'', thereafter) was the highest civil office and the leader of the government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|pp=110\u2013111}} However, the chancellor was not directly involved in the kingdom's everyday affairs, which were overseen by the court clerk {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5167\u53f2}}}},}} ''n\u00e8ish\u01d0''). Compared to the central government, where the crown princes' tutors had little real authority, the grand tutor played a much more extensive role in a kingdom, as he supervised the king on behalf of the imperial government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} Meanwhile, the duties of the court clerk are reminiscent of the [[Warring States]], where the post was second only to the chancellor in status, rather than the Han central government&mdash;the same post in the imperial government was merely in charge of finance and affairs in the capital region.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=111}}{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}}  The responsibilities of the royal secretary {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5fa1\u53f2|\u5927\u592b}}}},}} ''y\u00f9sh\u01d0 d\u00e0f\u016b'') were similar to the imperial equivalent, i.e. supervision over the bureaucrats, although his status was likely lower than the court clerk.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} The imperial [[Nine Ministers]] also had their equivalents in the kingdom.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=105}} In addition, early Changsha had a unique office, the \"pillar of state\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u67f1|\u570b}}}},}} ''zh\u00f9gu\u00f3''). It was designation for an eminent official originating from the Chu state, but was not seen elsewhere in the Han dynasty;{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} the post may have merged into or been replaced by that of the chancellor.{{sfn|He|2013|p=254}}\n\nUnder the Wu family, the Changsha Kingdom was administered at two levels, the [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commandery]] and the [[county (China)|county]]. As [[#Territory|described above]], the state is believed to have consisted of the three commanderies of Changsha, Wuling, and Guiyang and to have claimed further commanderies under Nanyue's control. The three actual commanderies were divided into over 40 counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}} Under the cadet branch of the Liu family, the Changsha Kingdom eliminated the needless commandery level as its territory had been much reduced. In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} the kingdom only administered thirteen counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}}\n\nIn regions inhabited by the Baiyue, larger but less populated [[circuit (administrative division)|circuits]] were used in place of counties. Two circuits{{mdash}}He ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u9f55}}}}, ''H\u00e9'') and Ling ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6ce0}}}}, ''L\u00edng''){{mdash}}are noted on the map unearthed at Mawangdui. Counties were each headed by a [[county magistrate|magistrate]] and were subdivided into [[township (China)|townships]] and villages ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u91cc}}}}, ''l\u01d0'') in the same manner as in centrally administered territories of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=151}}\n\nThe reestablishment of the Changsha Kingdom under Liu Fa coincided with the abortive [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent drastic measures to limit the autonomy of kingdoms by Emperor Jing.

In 155 BC, the kingdom was reestablished for a member of the [[Family tree of the Han Dynasty|imperial family]]. However, the creation of this second kingdom coincided with the [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent reforms under [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]], and Changsha under the imperial family saw its autonomy greatly diminished. The kingdom was dissolved during [[Wang Mang]]'s [[Xin dynasty|usurpation]] (AD 9 \u2013 23), briefly restored after the founding of the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern Han]], and finally abolished in {{nowrap|AD 33}} and converted to a [[Jun (country subdivision)|commandery]] under the imperial government.\n\nChangsha was one of the largest and longest-lasting kingdoms in Han China.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}} Despite being established on the empire's frontier, technology and art flourished in Changsha. Numerous archaeological sites of the kingdom have been discovered and excavated; most notably [[Mawangdui]], the tomb of Changsha's [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] Li Cang and his family, providing valuable insights into life in the kingdom and Han dynasty in general.\n\n==History==\nThe first king of Changsha, [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], was a [[Baiyue]] leader who had been the magistrate of [[Poyang County]] under the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 \u2013 207 BC). He enjoyed high prestige among the local people and was known as \"Lord of the Po\" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u756a|\u541b}}}}, ''P\u00f3j\u016bn'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} \n\nIn {{nowrap|209 BC}}, [[Dazexiang Uprising|a peasant uprising]] triggered a wave of rebellions that resulted in [[collapse of Qin|the collapse]] of the Qin. After hearing news of the uprising, Wu Rui organized a mostly Baiyue army in support of the rebels. His forces soon grew to become a major faction in the civil war that ensued.{{sfn|He|2013|p=6}} In {{nowrap|207 BC}}, Rui's army joined forces with the [[Han dynasty|Han]] leader [[Liu Bang]] (the future Emperor Gaozu, at the time one of the rebel generals) and marched to the [[Guanzhong Plain]], where they received the surrender of [[Ziying]], the last ruler of Qin.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} One year later, the [[Western Chu|Chu]] King [[Xiang Yu]], then the most prominent leader in the rebellion, in [[Eighteen Kingdoms|an attempt to redivide the empire]], recognized Rui as the \"King of Hengshan\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8861\u5c71|\u738b}}}},}} ''H\u00e9ngsh\u0101n W\u00e1ng''). The Han eventually emerged victorious from [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|post-Qin conflicts]] and established itself as the preeminent power in China. In 203/{{nowrap|202 BC}}, Emperor Gaozu moved Wu Rui's fief{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=14}} and established the Kingdom of Changsha.{{sfn|Li|2014|p=330}} The capital was Linxiang and located within the present-day city of [[Changsha]].{{sfn|He|2013|pp=260\u2013266}} The new kingdom helped the Han dynasty consolidate control over the Chu heartland and served as a [[buffer state]] against the independent realm of [[Nanyue]] founded by the Qin general [[Zhao Tuo]] in present-day [[Guangdong]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|He|2013|pp=3\u20135}} Rui died shortly after moving to his new territory, and the title passed to his son, Wu Chen {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u81e3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u00e9n'').{{sfn|Li|2014|pp=331\u2013332}} Wu Chen reigned for eight years.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}\n\nThe kings of Changsha were staunch supporters of the Han, and their loyalty and competence was praised by successive emperors.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=22}} In the first years after the founding of the Han Empire, the Emperor Gaozu embarked on a campaign to eliminate kings that were not members of the imperial family. The kings first grew to prominence as heads of independent factions in the chaos following Qin's fall, and the emperor viewed them as great threats to his authority. Changsha, located on the empire's southern fringe, was among the weakest among the kingdoms; however, it was the only one to survive beyond 190s BC.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=28}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} In {{nowrap|195 BC,}} [[Ying Bu]], King of [[Huainan]] and son-in-law of Wu Rui, rebelled against the Han and was defeated. As Ying retreated south of the [[Yangtze River]], the King of Changsha pretended to assist him in his escape to Nanyue but instead killed him in Cixiang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8332\u9109}}}},}} ''C\u00edxi\u0101ng'') near Poyang.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=106}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nWu Chen was succeeded by his son Wu Hui {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u56de}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Hu\u00ed''). Hui reigned for seven years, and was succeeded by his son Wu You {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u53f3}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Y\u00f2u''), whose name is also recorded as Wu Ruo {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u82e5}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ru\u00f2'').{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=30}}{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=107}} At the time, the Han dynasty was under [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]] and [[Empress L\u00fc]], who favored lenient laws and political views of the [[Huang\u2013Lao]] school of philosophy. Changsha was able to develop under relative peace.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=31}} In {{nowrap|183 BC,}} however, Empress L\u00fc banned the export of [[iron ware]] to Nanyue, which angered Zhao Tuo, who then proclaimed himself Emperor of Nanyue and then twice invaded Changsha, occupying a few [[county (China)|counties]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=136}} Later, during Empress L\u00fc's reign, the imperial court decided to launch a military campaign against Nanyue.

The campaign was eventually abandoned with the death of Empress L\u00fc.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=32}} In {{nowrap|178 BC,}} the kingdom passed to Wu You's son Wu Zhu {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u8457}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Zh\u00f9''), for whom the names Wu Chai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u5dee}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u0101i'') and Wu Chan {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5433|\u7522}}}},}} ''W\u00fa Ch\u01cen'') are alternatively used in some records.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=113}} Wu Zhu reigned for twenty-one years, dying in {{nowrap|157 BC}} without male issue.{{sfn|He|2013|p=1}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}\n\nAfter the extinction of this house, [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u767c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa F\u0101'') in {{nowrap|155 BC.}}{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=32\u201335}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|pp=124\u2013125}} Fa's mother, Tang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5510}}}}, ''T\u00e1ng''), was a servant of the Emperor's concubine Cheng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7a0b}}}}, ''Ch\u00e9ng'') and had given birth to Fa after the intoxicated emperor had mistaken her for his favorite concubine. Consequently, Fa had the lowest status among the Emperor's 14 sons and was [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] in Changsha, far away from the capital [[Chang'an]] and the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]].{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=35\u201336}} Changsha Kingdom was held by the Liu family until early the 1st century AD, when the Han dynasty was interrupted by usurper [[Wang Mang]]. Along with other kings of the Liu family in the empire, Liu Shun {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u821c}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa Sh\u00f9n''), the last King of Changsha, was demoted first to the rank of duke and then to a commoner.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=40}}{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}} After the restoration of Han dynasty, the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu Emperor]], himself a descendant of Liu Fa, gave Changsha to Liu Shun's son Liu Xing {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5289|\u8208}}}},}} ''Li\u00fa X\u012bng'') in {{nowrap|AD 26.}} In 33 the Emperor rescinded the decision and demoted Xing to the rank of a marquis, citing the distance of kinship between Xing and himself.

The coastline and several rivers drawn in dark colors are clearly visible.]]\n\nThe exact extent of the first Changsha Kingdom is still unclear. The official ''[[Book of Han]]'' reports Changsha's border \u201creaching the north bank of [[Han River (Hubei)|Han River]] and stretching to [[Jiuyi Mountains]]\u201d, although it is unlikely that Changsha actually reached so far. Similarly, it reports that, when Emperor Gaozu created the Kingdom of Changsha, he granted Wu Rui authority over the five [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commanderies]] of Changsha, Yuzhang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c6b\u7ae0}}}},}} ''Y\u00f9zh\u0101ng''), Xiang ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8c61}}}}, ''Xi\u00e0ng''), Guilin {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u6797}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecl\u00edn'') and Nanhai {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5357\u6d77}}}},}} ''N\u00e1nh\u01cei''). However, Yuzhang Commandery had already been conferred to Ying Bu, the King of Huainan, while Xiang, Guilin, and Nanhai Commanderies were all held by Zhao Tuo, the effectively independent King of Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=42}} This state of the Changsha\u2013Nanyue border was confirmed in a [[Early Chinese cartography|map]] unearthed from the [[Mawangdui]] tombs.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}} On the other hand, other preserved and unearthed texts have shown that there were two other commanderies actually controlled by the Changsha Kingdom: Wuling {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6b66\u9675}}}},}} ''W\u01d4l\u00edng'') and Guiyang {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6842\u967d}}}},}} ''Gu\u00ecy\u00e1ng''). The first may have been granted by the imperial Han government; the historical geographer [[Zhou Zhenhe]] argues that the \"Yuzhang\" recorded in the ''Book of Han'' was simply a mistake for \"Wuling\", which would have been part of the original grant of the kingdom.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|p=119}} Guiyang was likely created by the kings of Changsha at some point for defense against invasions from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=41}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=231}}\n\nThe reconstruction offered by Zhou and [[Tan Qixiang]] is that Changsha's northern border ran along modern [[Tongcheng County|Tongcheng]], [[Songzi]], and [[Gong'an County|Gong'an]] counties; the western border along modern [[Longshan County|Longshan]], [[Zhenyuan County, Guizhou|Zhenyuan]], and [[Jingzhou County|Jingzhou]] counties; and the eastern border along modern [[Gao'an]], [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichuan]], [[Lianhua County|Lianhua]], and [[Chaling County|Chaling]] counties. Changsha's southern frontier with Nanyue was approximately the modern southern border of Hunan.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}}\n\nWhen Emperor Jing granted Changsha to his son Liu Fa, the kingdom's territory was reduced to Changsha Commandery alone. Consequently, the kingdom's southwestern border was in the vicinity of modern Chaling, [[Wugang, Hunan|Wugang]] and [[Quanzhou County|Quanzhou]] counties.{{sfn|He|2013|pp=221\u2013240}} From Emperor Wu's reign onward, 20 [[Government of the Han dynasty#Kingdoms, marquisates, and fiefs of princesses|marquisates]] was created from Changsha. These marquisates were administered as parts of neighboring commanderies, further reducing the kingdom's territory.{{sfn|Zhou|1987|pp=122\u2013125}}\n\n==Demographics==\nChangsha was sparsely populated compared to other parts of the Han Empire.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=78}} The population primarily consisted of descendants of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] colonizers, members of the Qin military garrison and their offspring, assimilated [[Nanman]], and the native Baiyue tribes. Zhao Tuo, King of Nanyue, claimed that \"half of Changsha are [[Four Barbarians|Man and Yi]]\". [[Jia Yi]], grand tutor of the king from 176 to {{nowrap|172 BC,}} wrote that there were only 25,000 households in the kingdom,{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=50}} although it is likely that the figure was an underestimate.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=110}} (Jia, an advocate for further limits on the kingdoms' autonomy, saw Changsha's weakness as a reason of its loyalty.) However, the population increased rapidly, partly due to the favorable agricultural policies and partly because of immigration both from within the Han empire and from Nanyue.{{sfn|Luo|1998|pp=52\u201353}} In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} when the Han dynasty conducted an empire-wide population census, the population of Changsha was recorded as 235,825 living in 43,470 households. The commanderies that constituted the larger Changsha of the early Han dynasty together had a population of 717,433 living in 126,858 households, a five-fold increase from Jia Yi's estimation during the early Han period.{{sfn|Luo|1998|p=52}}\n\n==Government==\n[[File:\u201c\u957f\u6c99\u76f8\u5370\u7ae0\u201d\u5c01\u6ce5.jpg|thumb|A clay imprint of the [[seal (East Asia)|seal]] of the chancellor of the Changsha Kingdom|alt=refer to caption]]\nIn the early Han dynasty, the government structure of the kingdoms closely followed that of the [[Government of the Han dynasty#Central government|Han central government]], but differences remained.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} Except for the chancellor and grand tutor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u592a\u5085}}}},}} ''t\u00e0if\u00f9''), who were selected by the imperial court, all officials were appointed by the king.{{sfn|He|2013|p=250}} As in the imperial government, the chancellor {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u76f8\u570b}}}},}} ''xi\u00e0nggu\u00f3'', before {{nowrap|194 BC}} and {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4e1e\u76f8}}}},}} ''ch\u00e9ngxi\u00e0ng'', thereafter) was the highest civil office and the leader of the government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|pp=110\u2013111}} However, the chancellor was not directly involved in the kingdom's everyday affairs, which were overseen by the court clerk {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5167\u53f2}}}},}} ''n\u00e8ish\u01d0''). Compared to the central government, where the crown princes' tutors had little real authority, the grand tutor played a much more extensive role in a kingdom, as he supervised the king on behalf of the imperial government.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} Meanwhile, the duties of the court clerk are reminiscent of the [[Warring States]], where the post was second only to the chancellor in status, rather than the Han central government&mdash;the same post in the imperial government was merely in charge of finance and affairs in the capital region.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=111}}{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}}  The responsibilities of the royal secretary {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5fa1\u53f2|\u5927\u592b}}}},}} ''y\u00f9sh\u01d0 d\u00e0f\u016b'') were similar to the imperial equivalent, i.e. supervision over the bureaucrats, although his status was likely lower than the court clerk.{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=112}} The imperial [[Nine Ministers]] also had their equivalents in the kingdom.{{sfn|Bielenstein|1980|p=105}} In addition, early Changsha had a unique office, the \"pillar of state\" {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u67f1|\u570b}}}},}} ''zh\u00f9gu\u00f3''). It was designation for an eminent official originating from the Chu state, but was not seen elsewhere in the Han dynasty;{{sfn|Wu|1990|p=122}} the post may have merged into or been replaced by that of the chancellor.{{sfn|He|2013|p=254}}\n\nUnder the Wu family, the Changsha Kingdom was administered at two levels, the [[jun (administrative subdivision)|commandery]] and the [[county (China)|county]]. As [[#Territory|described above]], the state is believed to have consisted of the three commanderies of Changsha, Wuling, and Guiyang and to have claimed further commanderies under Nanyue's control. The three actual commanderies were divided into over 40 counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}} Under the cadet branch of the Liu family, the Changsha Kingdom eliminated the needless commandery level as its territory had been much reduced. In {{nowrap|AD 2,}} the kingdom only administered thirteen counties.{{sfn|Fu|1984|p=111}}{{sfn|He|2013|p=175}}\n\nIn regions inhabited by the Baiyue, larger but less populated [[circuit (administrative division)|circuits]] were used in place of counties. Two circuits{{mdash}}He ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u9f55}}}}, ''H\u00e9'') and Ling ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6ce0}}}}, ''L\u00edng''){{mdash}}are noted on the map unearthed at Mawangdui. Counties were each headed by a [[county magistrate|magistrate]] and were subdivided into [[township (China)|townships]] and villages ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u91cc}}}}, ''l\u01d0'') in the same manner as in centrally administered territories of the Han dynasty.{{sfn|Yi|1995|pp=65\u201368}}{{sfn|Loewe|1986|p=151}}\n\nThe reestablishment of the Changsha Kingdom under Liu Fa coincided with the abortive [[Rebellion of the Seven States]] and the subsequent drastic measures to limit the autonomy of kingdoms by Emperor Jing.

Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is a re-imagining of the Norman and Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship.

Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Crew / detail\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nA [[television film|made-for-television]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film. Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand.

The series is a television reboot set in the 2010s and chronicle Norman Bates' early childhood with his mother and how she drove him to become a killer. In July 2012, A&E ordered 10 episodes of the series, skipping the initial pilot stage. The series takes place in the modern day and stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as young Norman Bates and [[Vera Farmiga]] as Mrs. Bates. The series premiered on March 18, 2013 and produced five seasons for a total of 50 episodes. The series was shot in [[Vancouver]] with a replica of the Psycho house from [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and a recreation of the original Bates Motel from the first movie.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original. He describes it as a \"Slow, stilted, completely pointless scene-for-scene remake of the Hitchcock classic (with a few awkward new touches to taint its claim as an exact replica.)\" He ultimately calls it \"an insult, rather than a tribute to a landmark film.\"{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Continuity===\nWhile ''Bates Motel'' (1987) was a partial continuation of the series as it continued from where ''Psycho'' left off, it ignored the continuity of ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'', and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' due to the death of Norman Bates in the film and the fact that Bates is deemed sane and returns to the Bates Motel in ''Psycho II''. ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O.

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is a re-imagining of the Norman and Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel set ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Crew / detail\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]]. Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nA [[television film|made-for-television]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film. Alex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum for killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Mrs. Bates]], are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Seasons\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First aired\n! scope=\"col\" |Last aired\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| [[Carlton Cuse]], [[Kerry Ehrin]], [[Anthony Cipriano]]\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Russell (cinematographer)|John L. Russell]] and Best Art Direction for [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]], [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clatworthy]] and [[George Milo]]. All three sequels have been nominated for [[Saturn Awards]]: ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' for Best Supporting Actress ([[Meg Tilly]]); ''[[Psycho III]]'' for Best Horror Film and Best Actor ([[Anthony Perkins]]); and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies (attraction)|Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal City Studios]] in 1959 for the production of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. It has been said that the house, designed by art directors [[Joseph Hurley (art director)|Joseph Hurley]] and [[Robert Clatworthy (art director)|Robert Clathworthy]], was loosely based on an [[Edward Hopper]] painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''Psycho'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Thriller (American TV series)|Boris Karloff's Thriller]]''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented [[Studio Tour|Studio Tram Tour]]. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. A 1992 episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' called \"Incident in Lot 7\" featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular [[Angela Lansbury]] series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four ''Psycho'' films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===''78/52'' documentary (2017) ===\n\nA documentary examination of the ''Psycho'' shower scene was released on October 13, 2017 by director [[Alexandre O.

Cohesin is formed of [[SMC3]], [[SMC1A|SMC1]], [[RAD21]] and SCC3 ([[STAG1|SA1]] or [[STAG2|SA2]] in humans). Cohesin holds sister chromatids together after DNA replication until anaphase when removal of cohesin leads to separation of sister chromatids. The complex forms a ring-like structure and it is believed that sister chromatids are held together by entrapment inside the cohesin ring. Cohesin is a member of the [[SMC proteins|SMC family of protein complexes]] which includes [[Condensin]], MukBEF and SMC-ScpAB.\n\nCohesin was separately discovered in budding yeast by [[Douglas Koshland]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Guacci |first1=V |last2=Koshland |first2=D |last3=Strunnikov |first3=A |title=A direct link between sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome condensation revealed through the analysis of MCD1 in S. cerevisiae. |journal=Cell |date=3 October 1997 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=47-57 |doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(01)80008-8 |pmid=9335334}}</ref> and [[Kim Nasmyth]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Michaelis |first1=C |last2=Ciosk |first2=R |last3=Nasmyth |first3=K |title=Cohesins: chromosomal proteins that prevent premature separation of sister chromatids. |journal=Cell |date=3 October 1997 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=35-45 |doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(01)80007-6 |pmid=9335333}}</ref> \n\n== Structure ==\nCohesin is a multi-subunit protein complex, made up of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21 and SCC3 (SA1 or SA2). SMC1 and SMC3 are members of the [[SMC protein|Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) family]]. SMC proteins have two main structural characteristics: an [[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ATP-binding cassette]]-like 'head' domain with ATPase activity (formed by the interaction of the N- and C- terminals) and a hinge domain that allows dimerization of SMCs. The head and the hinge domains are connected to each other via long anti-parallel coiled coils. The dimer is present in a V-shaped form, connected by the hinges. \n\nThe N-terminal domain of RAD21 contains two \u03b1-helices which forms a four helix bundle with the coiled coil of SMC3.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gligoris |first1=TG |last2=Scheinost |first2=JC |last3=B\u00fcrmann |first3=F |last4=Petela |first4=N |last5=Chan |first5=KL |last6=Uluocak |first6=P |last7=Beckou\u00ebt |first7=F |last8=Gruber |first8=S |last9=Nasmyth |first9=K |last10=L\u00f6we |first10=J |title=Closing the cohesin ring: structure and function of its Smc3-kleisin interface. |journal=Science (New York, N.Y.) |date=21 November 2014 |volume=346 |issue=6212 |pages=963-7 |doi=10.1126/science.1256917 |pmid=25414305}}</ref> The central region of RAD21 is thought to be largely unstructured but contains several binding sites for regulators of cohesin.

It is not known which conformation is predominant inside the cell and whether some are induced by sample preparation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yatskevich |first1=S |last2=Rhodes |first2=J |last3=Nasmyth |first3=K |title=Organization of Chromosomal DNA by SMC Complexes. |journal=Annual review of genetics |date=3 December 2019 |volume=53 |pages=445-482 |doi=10.1146/annurev-genet-112618-043633 |pmid=31577909}}</ref>\n\n== Function ==\nThe cohesin ring has many functions:\n\n1. It is used to keep the sister chromatids connected with each other during [[metaphase]] ensuring that during [[mitosis]] (and [[meiosis]]), each sister chromatid segregates to opposite poles. Without cohesin, the cell would be unable to control sister chromatid segregation since there would be no way of ensuring whether the spindle fiber attached on each sister chromatid is from a different pole.\n\n2. It facilitates [[Spindle apparatus|spindle]] attachment onto [[chromosomes]].\n\n3. It facilitates DNA repair by [[Genetic recombination|recombination]].\n\n4. Recently many novel functions of cohesin have been discovered in many different cellular processes. Cohesin has been shown to be responsible for transcription regulation, [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|DNA double strand break repair]], chromosome condensation, pairing of [[homologous chromosome]]s during [[Meiosis#Meiosis I|meiosis I]], mono-orientation of sister [[kinetochore]]s during meiosis I, non-homologous [[centromere]] coupling, chromosome architecture and rearrangement, DNA replication etc.<ref name=\"pmid23831059\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehta GD, Kumar R, Srivastava S, Ghosh SK | title = Cohesin: functions beyond sister chromatid cohesion | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 587 | issue = 15 | pages = 2299\u2013312 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23831059 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2013.06.035 }}</ref>\n\n== Dissociation of sister chromatid cohesion ==\nThe anaphase promoting complex associated to Cdc20 (APC/C-cdc20) marks Securin (anaphase inhibitor) for degradation by the proteasome.

Therefore, when the cell division process will end, each daughter cell will receive a complete set of organelles. At the same time, during S phase all cells must duplicate their [[DNA]] very precisely, a process termed [[DNA replication]]. Once DNA replication has finished, in eukaryotes the DNA molecule is compacted and condensed, to form the mitotic [[chromosome]]s, each one constituted by two sister [[chromatid]]s, which stay held together by the establishment of cohesion between them; each chromatid is a complete DNA molecule, attached via [[microtubule]]s to one of the two centrosomes of the dividing cell, located at opposed poles of the cell. To avoid premature sister chromatid separation, the APC/C is maintained in an inactive state bound to different molecules, which are part of a complex mechanism termed the [[spindle assembly checkpoint]].\n\n== Mechanism of Sister Chromatid Cohesion ==\nIt is not clear how the cohesin ring links sister chromatids together. There are two possible scenarios:\n\n# Cohesin subunits bind to each sister chromatid and form a bridge between the two.\n# Since cohesin has a ring structure, it is able to encircle both sister chromatids.\nCurrent evidence suggests that the second scenario is the most likely. Proteins that are essential for sister chromatid cohesion, such as Smc3 and Scc1, do not regulate the formation of covalent bonds between cohesin and DNA, indicating that DNA interaction is not sufficient for cohesion.<ref name=\"Gruber_2003\"/> In addition, disturbing the ring structure of cohesin through cleavage of Smc3 or Scc1 triggers premature sister chromatid segregation in vivo.<ref name=\"pmid19056890\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Peters JM, Tedeschi A, Schmitz J | title = The cohesin complex and its roles in chromosome biology | journal = Genes & Development | volume = 22 | issue = 22 | pages = 3089\u2013114 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19056890 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1724308 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This shows that the ring structure is important for cohesin\u2019s function.\n\nEarly studies suggested various ways in which cohesin may entrap DNA,<ref name=\"pmid19075111\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang N, Kuznetsov SG, Sharan SK, Li K, Rao PH, Pati D | title = A handcuff model for the cohesin complex | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 183 | issue = 6 | pages = 1019\u201331 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19075111 | pmc = 2600748 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200801157 }}</ref> including as a monomer that holds both homologues together, and a \"hand-cuff\" model where two intertwining cohesin complexes each hold one sister chromatid.

One possibility is that one ring surrounds the two chromatids. Another possibility involves the creation of a dimer where each ring surrounds one sister chromatid. The two rings are connected to each other through formation of a bridge that holds the two sister chromatids together.\n\nThe topology and structure of these subunits has been best characterized in budding yeast<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haering |first1=CH |last2=L\u00f6we |first2=J |last3=Hochwagen |first3=A |last4=Nasmyth |first4=K |title=Molecular architecture of SMC proteins and the yeast cohesin complex. |journal=Molecular cell |date=April 2002 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=773-88 |doi=10.1016/s1097-2765(02)00515-4 |pmid=11983169}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haering |first1=CH |last2=Farcas |first2=AM |last3=Arumugam |first3=P |last4=Metson |first4=J |last5=Nasmyth |first5=K |title=The cohesin ring concatenates sister DNA molecules. |journal=Nature |date=17 July 2008 |volume=454 |issue=7202 |pages=297-301 |doi=10.1038/nature07098 |pmid=18596691}}</ref>, but the sequence conservation of these proteins and biochemical and electron microscopic observations imply that cohesin complexes in other species are very similar in their structure, [http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/22/22/3089.long].\n \nThe cohesin complex is established during the initial stages of [[S-phase]]. The complexes associate with chromosomes before DNA replication occurs. Once cells start replicating their DNA, cohesin rings close and link the sister chromatids together.<ref name=\"Gruber_2003\"/> Cohesin complexes must be present during [[S-phase]] in order for cohesion to take place. It is unclear, however, how cohesin is loaded on the chromosomes during [[G1 phase|G1]]. There are two proposed hypotheses so far:\n\n# The ATPase domain of the SMC proteins interacts with DNA and this interaction initially mediates the loading of cohesin complexes on chromosomes.\n# Several proteins aid in the loading process. For example, Scc2 and Scc4 are both required for cohesin to load in budding yeast.\n\n== Localization of cohesin rings ==\nCohesin binding along the chromosomal DNA is considered to be dynamic and its location changes based on gene transcription, specific DNA sequence and presence of chromosome-associated proteins. There are three possible scenarios:\n\n# Cohesin location is influenced by the orientation of neighboring genes and it is most frequently located in areas of convergent transcription. Gene orientation depends on the direction of transcription and can be of three types: head-to-head, head-to-tail and tail-to-tail. The tail-to-tail configuration results in the convergence of transcription machinery. One hypothesis states that the [[RNA polymerase]] \u201cpushes\u201d cohesin along the DNA, causing them to move towards the direction of the RNA polymerases. Changing the transcription pattern of genes changes the location of cohesin indicating that localization of cohesin may depend on transcription.<ref name=\"Ross_2004\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross KE, Cohen-Fix O | title = Molecular biology: cohesins slip sliding away | journal = Nature | volume = 430 | issue = 6999 | pages = 520\u20131 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15282594 | doi = 10.1038/430520b | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1233231 }}</ref>\n# In another model, chromatin loop extrusion is pushed by transcription generated supercoiling ensuring also that cohesin relocalizes quickly and loops grow with reasonable speed and in a good direction.

For example, [[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]] have multiple copies of specific heterochromatic DNA whose involvement in cohesion binding has been proven.

Therefore, when the cell division process will end, each daughter cell will receive a complete set of organelles.

Once DNA replication has finished, in eukaryotes the DNA molecule is compacted and condensed, to form the mitotic [[chromosome]]s, each one constituted by two sister [[chromatid]]s, which stay held together by the establishment of cohesion between them; each chromatid is a complete DNA molecule, attached via [[microtubule]]s to one of the two centrosomes of the dividing cell, located at opposed poles of the cell. To avoid premature sister chromatid separation, the APC/C is maintained in an inactive state bound to different molecules, which are part of a complex mechanism termed the [[spindle assembly checkpoint]].\n\n== Mechanism of Sister Chromatid Cohesion ==\nIt is not clear how the cohesin ring links sister chromatids together. There are two possible scenarios:\n\n# Cohesin subunits bind to each sister chromatid and form a bridge between the two.\n# Since cohesin has a ring structure, it is able to encircle both sister chromatids.\nCurrent evidence suggests that the second scenario is the most likely. Proteins that are essential for sister chromatid cohesion, such as Smc3 and Scc1, do not regulate the formation of covalent bonds between cohesin and DNA, indicating that DNA interaction is not sufficient for cohesion.<ref name=\"Gruber_2003\"/> In addition, disturbing the ring structure of cohesin through cleavage of Smc3 or Scc1 triggers premature sister chromatid segregation in vivo.<ref name=\"pmid19056890\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Peters JM, Tedeschi A, Schmitz J | title = The cohesin complex and its roles in chromosome biology | journal = Genes & Development | volume = 22 | issue = 22 | pages = 3089\u2013114 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19056890 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1724308 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This shows that the ring structure is important for cohesin\u2019s function.\n\nEarly studies suggested various ways in which cohesin may entrap DNA,<ref name=\"pmid19075111\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang N, Kuznetsov SG, Sharan SK, Li K, Rao PH, Pati D | title = A handcuff model for the cohesin complex | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 183 | issue = 6 | pages = 1019\u201331 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19075111 | pmc = 2600748 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200801157 }}</ref> including as a monomer that holds both homologues together, and a \"hand-cuff\" model where two intertwining cohesin complexes each hold one sister chromatid.

The two rings are connected to each other through formation of a bridge that holds the two sister chromatids together.\n\nThe topology and structure of these subunits has been best characterized in budding yeast<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haering |first1=CH |last2=L\u00f6we |first2=J |last3=Hochwagen |first3=A |last4=Nasmyth |first4=K |title=Molecular architecture of SMC proteins and the yeast cohesin complex. |journal=Molecular cell |date=April 2002 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=773-88 |doi=10.1016/s1097-2765(02)00515-4 |pmid=11983169}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haering |first1=CH |last2=Farcas |first2=AM |last3=Arumugam |first3=P |last4=Metson |first4=J |last5=Nasmyth |first5=K |title=The cohesin ring concatenates sister DNA molecules. |journal=Nature |date=17 July 2008 |volume=454 |issue=7202 |pages=297-301 |doi=10.1038/nature07098 |pmid=18596691}}</ref>, but the sequence conservation of these proteins and biochemical and electron microscopic observations imply that cohesin complexes in other species are very similar in their structure, [http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/22/22/3089.long].\n \nThe cohesin complex is established during the initial stages of [[S-phase]]. The complexes associate with chromosomes before DNA replication occurs.

It is unclear, however, how cohesin is loaded on the chromosomes during [[G1 phase|G1]]. There are two proposed hypotheses so far:\n\n# The ATPase domain of the SMC proteins interacts with DNA and this interaction initially mediates the loading of cohesin complexes on chromosomes.\n# Several proteins aid in the loading process. For example, Scc2 and Scc4 are both required for cohesin to load in budding yeast.\n\n== Localization of cohesin rings ==\nCohesin binding along the chromosomal DNA is considered to be dynamic and its location changes based on gene transcription, specific DNA sequence and presence of chromosome-associated proteins. There are three possible scenarios:\n\n# Cohesin location is influenced by the orientation of neighboring genes and it is most frequently located in areas of convergent transcription. Gene orientation depends on the direction of transcription and can be of three types: head-to-head, head-to-tail and tail-to-tail. The tail-to-tail configuration results in the convergence of transcription machinery. One hypothesis states that the [[RNA polymerase]] \u201cpushes\u201d cohesin along the DNA, causing them to move towards the direction of the RNA polymerases. Changing the transcription pattern of genes changes the location of cohesin indicating that localization of cohesin may depend on transcription.<ref name=\"Ross_2004\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross KE, Cohen-Fix O | title = Molecular biology: cohesins slip sliding away | journal = Nature | volume = 430 | issue = 6999 | pages = 520\u20131 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15282594 | doi = 10.1038/430520b | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1233231 }}</ref>\n# In another model, chromatin loop extrusion is pushed by transcription generated supercoiling ensuring also that cohesin relocalizes quickly and loops grow with reasonable speed and in a good direction.

For example, [[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]] have multiple copies of specific heterochromatic DNA whose involvement in cohesion binding has been proven.

[[Andrei Alexandrescu]] joined the design and development effort in 2007. Though it originated as a re-engineering of [[C++]], D is a distinct language. It has redesigned some core C++ features, while also sharing characteristics of other languages, notably [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]].\n\nThe design goals of the language attempted to combine the performance and safety of [[compiled language]]s with the [[expressive power (computer science)|expressive power]] of modern [[Dynamic programming language|dynamic languages]]. [[Idiomatic]] D code was commonly as fast as equivalent C++ code, while also being shorter.<ref name=\"short\" />  The language as a whole was not [[memory safety|memory-safe]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12391370 |date=August 30, 2016 |title=On: Ruminations on D: An Interview with Walter Bright|website=Hacker News}} \"It's close, and we're working to close the remaining gaps.\"</ref> but does include optional attributes designed to check memory safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dlang.org/spec/memory-safe-d.html |title=Memory-Safe-D-Spec |publisher=D Language Foundation}}</ref>\n\n[[Type inference]], [[Garbage collection (computer science)|automatic memory management]] and [[syntactic sugar]] for [[Type (computer programming)|common types]] allow faster [[software development|development]], while [[bounds checking]], [[design by contract]] features and a [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]]-aware [[type system]] help reduce the occurrence of [[software bug|bugs]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlVpPstLPEc |title=Three Cool Things About D |date=2 August 2010 |people=Andrei Alexandrescu}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nD was designed with lessons learned from practical C++ usage, rather than from a purely theoretical perspective. Although the language uses many [[C (programming language)|C]] and C++ concepts, it also discards some and was not compatible with C and C++ source code. D has, however, been constrained in its design by the rule that any code that was legal in both C and D should behave in the same way. D gained some features before C++, such as [[closure (computer science)|closures]], [[anonymous functions]], and [[compile time function execution]]. D adds to the functionality of C++ by also implementing [[design by contract]], [[unit test]]ing, true [[module (programming)|modules]], [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], [[first-class object|first class]] [[array data type|arrays]], [[associative array]]s, [[dynamic array]]s, [[array slicing]], [[nested function]]s, [[lazy evaluation]], and a re-engineered [[generic programming#Templates in C++|template]] syntax. D retains C++'s ability to perform [[low-level programming language|low-level programming]] and to add [[inline assembler|inline]] [[assembly language|assembler]]. C++ [[multiple inheritance]] was replaced by Java-style [[multiple inheritance|single inheritance]] with [[interface (computer science)|interfaces]] and [[mixin]]s. On the other hand, D's declaration, statement and expression [[syntax]] closely matches that of C++.\n\nThe [[inline assembler]] typifies the differences between D and application languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. An inline assembler lets programmers enter machine-specific [[assembly language|assembly code]] within standard D code, a method used by system programmers to access the low-level features of the [[central processing unit|processor]] needed to run programs that interface directly with the underlying [[computer hardware|hardware]], such as [[operating system]]s and [[device driver]]s.\n\nD has built-in support for documentation comments, allowing automatic [[documentation generator|documentation generation]].\n\n===Programming paradigms===\nD supports five main [[programming paradigm]]s: [[imperative programming|imperative]], [[object-oriented]], [[metaprogramming]], [[functional programming|functional]] and [[concurrent programming language|concurrent]] ([[actor model]]).\n\n====Imperative====\nImperative programming in D is almost identical to that in C.  Functions, data, statements, declarations and expressions work just as they do in C, and the C runtime library may be accessed directly.  On the other hand, some notable differences between D and C in the area of imperative programming include D's [[foreach|<code>foreach</code>]] loop construct, which allows looping over a collection, and [[nested function]]s, which are functions that are declared inside another and may access the enclosing function's [[local variable]]s.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nimport std.stdio;\nvoid main() {\n    int multiplier = 10;\n    int scaled(int x) { return x * multiplier; }\n\n    foreach (auto i; 0 .. 10) {\n        writefln(\"Hello, world %d! scaled = %d\", i, scaled(i));\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nD also includes dynamic arrays and associative arrays by default in the language.\n\n====Object-oriented====\nObject-oriented programming in D is based on a single inheritance hierarchy, with all classes derived from class Object. D does not support multiple inheritance; instead, it uses Java-style [[interface (Java)|interfaces]], which are comparable to C++'s pure abstract classes, and [[mixin]]s, which separates common functionality from the inheritance hierarchy. D also allows the defining of static and final (non-virtual) methods in interfaces.\n\n====Metaprogramming====\nMetaprogramming is supported by a combination of templates, compile time function execution, [[tuple]]s, and string mixins. The following examples demonstrate some of D's compile-time features.\n\nTemplates in D can be written in a more imperative style compared to the C++ functional style for templates.  This is a regular function that calculates the [[factorial]] of a number:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nulong factorial(ulong n) {\n    if (n < 2)\n        return 1;\n    else\n        return n * factorial(n-1);\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHere, the use of <code>static if</code>, D's compile-time conditional construct, is demonstrated to construct a template that performs the same calculation using code that is similar to that of the function above:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\ntemplate Factorial(ulong n) {\n    static if (n < 2)\n        enum Factorial = 1;\n    else\n        enum Factorial = n * Factorial!(n-1);\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the following two examples, the template and function defined above are used to compute factorials.  The types of constants need not be specified explicitly as the compiler [[type inference|infers their types]] from the right-hand sides of assignments:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nenum fact_7 = Factorial!(7);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis is an example of [[compile time function execution]]. Ordinary functions may be used in constant, compile-time expressions provided they meet certain criteria:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nenum fact_9 = factorial(9);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe <code>std.string.format</code> function performs [[printf|<code>printf</code>]]-like data formatting (also at compile-time, through [[compile time function execution|CTFE]]), and the \"msg\" [[Directive (programming)|pragma]] displays the result at compile time:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nimport std.string : format;\npragma(msg, format(\"7! = %s\", fact_7));\npragma(msg, format(\"9! = %s\", fact_9));\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nString mixins, combined with compile-time function execution, allow generating D code using string operations at compile time. This can be used to parse [[domain-specific language]]s to D code, which will be compiled as part of the program:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nimport FooToD; // hypothetical module which contains a function that parses Foo source code\n               // and returns equivalent D code\nvoid main() {\n    mixin(fooToD(import(\"example.foo\")));\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Functional====\nD supports [[functional programming]] features such as [[anonymous function|function literals]], [[Closure (computer science)|closures]], recursively-immutable objects and the use of [[higher-order function]]s. There are two syntaxes for anonymous functions, including a multiple-statement form and a \"shorthand\" single-expression notation:<ref name=\"short\">{{cite web |title=Expressions |url=http://dlang.org/expression.html#Lambda |publisher=Digital Mars |access-date=27 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"D\">\nint function(int) g;\ng = (x) { return x * x; }; // longhand\ng = (x) => x * x;          // shorthand\n</source>\n\nThere are two built-in types for function literals, <code>function</code>, which is simply a pointer to a stack-allocated function, and <code>delegate</code>, which also includes a pointer to the surrounding environment. Type inference may be used with an anonymous function, in which case the compiler creates a <code>delegate</code> unless it can prove that an environment pointer is not necessary. Likewise, to implement a closure, the compiler places enclosed local variables on the heap only if necessary (for example, if a closure is returned by another function, and exits that function's scope). When using type inference, the compiler will also add attributes such as <code>pure</code> and <code>nothrow</code> to a function's type, if it can prove that they apply.\n\nOther functional features such as [[currying]] and common higher-order functions such as [[map (higher-order function)|map]], [[filter (higher-order function)|filter]], and [[fold (higher-order function)|reduce]] are available through the standard library modules <code>std.functional</code> and <code>std.algorithm</code>.\n\n<source lang=\"D\">\nimport std.stdio, std.algorithm, std.range;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    int[] a1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];\n    int[] a2 = [6, 7, 8, 9];\n\n    // must be immutable to allow access from inside a pure function\n    immutable pivot = 5;\n\n    int mySum(int a, int b) pure nothrow // pure function\n    {\n        if (b <= pivot) // ref to enclosing-scope\n            return a + b;\n        else\n            return a;\n    }\n\n    // passing a delegate (closure)\n    auto result = reduce!mySum(chain(a1, a2));\n    writeln(\"Result: \", result); // Result: 15\n\n    // passing a delegate literal\n    result = reduce!((a, b) => (b <= pivot) ? a + b : a)(chain(a1, a2));\n    writeln(\"Result: \", result); // Result: 15\n}\n</source>\n\nAlternatively, the above function compositions can be expressed using [[Uniform Function Call Syntax]] (UFCS) for more natural left-to-right reading:\n\n<source lang=\"D\">\n    auto result = a1.chain(a2).reduce!mySum();\n    writeln(\"Result: \", result);\n\n    result = a1.chain(a2).reduce!((a, b) => (b <= pivot) ? a + b : a)();\n    writeln(\"Result: \", result);\n</source>\n\n====Parallel====\n<source lang=D>\nimport std.stdio : writeln;\nimport std.range : iota;\nimport std.parallelism : parallel;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    foreach (i; iota(11).parallel) {\n        // The body of the foreach loop is executed in parallel for each i\n        writeln(\"processing \", i);\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n====Concurrent====\nConcurrent programming is fully implemented in the library, and does not require any special support from the compiler. Alternative implementations and methodologies of writing concurrent code are possible. The use of D typing system does help ensure memory safety.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">import std.stdio, std.concurrency, std.variant;\n\nvoid foo()\n{\n    bool cont = true;\n\n    while (cont)\n    {\n        receive( // Delegates are used to match the message type.\n            (int msg) => writeln(\"int received: \", msg),\n            (Tid sender) { cont = false; sender.send(-1); },\n            (Variant v) => writeln(\"huh?\") // Variant matches any type\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    auto tid = spawn(&foo); // spawn a new thread running foo()\n\n    foreach (i; 0 .. 10)\n        tid.send(i);   // send some integers\n    tid.send(1.0f);    // send a float\n    tid.send(\"hello\"); // send a string\n    tid.send(thisTid); // send a struct (Tid)\n\n    receive((int x) => writeln(\"Main thread received message: \", x));\n}</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Memory management===\nMemory is usually managed with [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], but specific objects may be finalized immediately when they go out of scope. Explicit memory management is possible using the [[operator overloading|overloaded operators]] <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>, and by simply calling [[C (programming language)|C]]'s [[malloc|malloc and free]] directly. Garbage collection can be controlled: programmers may add and exclude memory ranges from being observed by the collector, can disable and enable the collector and force either a generational or full collection cycle.<ref>{{cite web |title=std.gc |url=http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/phobos/std_gc.html |work=D Programming Language 1.0 |publisher=Digital Mars |access-date=6 July 2010}}</ref> The manual gives many examples of how to implement different highly optimized memory management schemes for when garbage collection is inadequate in a program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dlang.org/memory.html |title=Memory Management |publisher=Digital Mars |work=D Programming Language 2.0 |access-date=17 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n===SafeD===\nSafeD<ref name=\"SafeD\">{{cite web |title=SafeD \u2013 D Programming Language |url=http://dlang.org/safed.html |author=Bartosz Milewski |access-date=17 July 2014}}</ref>\nis the name given to the subset of D that can be guaranteed to be memory safe (no writes to memory that were not allocated or that have already been recycled). Functions marked <code>@safe</code> are checked at compile time to ensure that they do not use any features that could result in corruption of memory, such as pointer arithmetic and unchecked casts, and any other functions called must also be marked as <code>@safe</code> or <code>@trusted</code>. Functions can be marked <code>@trusted</code> for the cases where the compiler cannot distinguish between safe use of a feature that is disabled in SafeD and a potential case of memory corruption.<ref>{{cite web |title=How to Write @trusted Code in D |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2016/09/28/how-to-write-trusted-code-in-d/ |author=Steven Schveighoffer |date=28 September 2016 |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n=====Scope Lifetime Safety=====\nInitially under the banners of DIP1000<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/other/DIP1000.md|title=Scoped Pointers|date=3 April 2020}}</ref> and DIP25<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.dlang.org/DIP25|title=Sealed References}}</ref> (now part of the language specification<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#return-scope-parameters|title=D Language Specification: Functions - Return Scope Parameters}}</ref>), D provides protections against certain ill-formed constructions involving the lifetimes of data.\n\nThe current mechanisms in place primarily deal with function parameters and stack memory however it is a stated ambition of the leadership of the programming language to provide a more thorough treatment of lifetimes within the D programming language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dlang.org/blog/2019/07/15/ownership-and-borrowing-in-d/|title=Ownership and Borrowing in D|date=15 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Lifetime Safety of Assignments=====\nWithin @safe code, the lifetime of an assignment involving a reference type is checked to ensure that the lifetime of the assignee is longer than that of the assigned.\n\nFor example:\n<source lang=\"D\">\n@safe void test()\n{\n    int tmp = 0; // #1\n    int* rad; // #2\n    rad = &tmp; // If the order of the declarations of #1 and #2 is reversed, this fails.\n    {\n    \tint bad = 45; // Lifetime of \"bad\" only extends to the scope in which it is defined.\n        *rad = bad; // This is kosher.\n        rad = &bad; // Lifetime of rad longer than bad, hence this is not kosher at all.       \n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n=====Function Parameter Lifetime Annotations within @safe code=====\nWhen applied to function parameter which are either of pointer type or references, the keywords ''return'' and ''scope'' constrain the lifetime and use of that parameter. \n\nThe Standard Dictates the following behaviour:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#param-storage|title=D Language Specification: Functions - Function Parameter Storage Classes}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Storage Class\n!Behaviour (and constraints to) of a Parameter with the storage class\n|-\n|''scope''\n|references in the parameter cannot be escaped.

The first public Tango announcement came within days of D 1.0's release.<ref>{{cite web |title=Announcing a new library |url=http://forum.dlang.org/post/en9ou4$23hr$1@digitaldaemon.com |access-date=15 February 2012}}</ref> Tango adopted a different programming style, embracing OOP and high modularity. Being a community-led project, Tango was more open to contributions, which allowed it to progress faster than the official standard library. At that time, Tango and Phobos were incompatible due to different runtime support APIs (the garbage collector, threading support, etc.). This made it impossible to use both libraries in the same project. The existence of two libraries, both widely in use, has led to significant dispute due to some packages using Phobos and others using Tango.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wiki4D: Standard Lib |url=http://www.prowiki.org/wiki4d/wiki.cgi?StandardLib |access-date=6 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2007, the first version of D2 was released.<ref name=\"D2 changelog\">{{cite web |title=Change Log \u2013 D Programming Language |url=https://dlang.org/changelog/ |work=D Programming Language 2.0 |publisher=D Language Foundation |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref> The beginning of D2's development signaled D1's stabilization. The first version of the language has been placed in maintenance, only receiving corrections and implementation bugfixes.

Ddbg can be used with various IDEs or from the command line; ZeroBUGS has its own [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).\n\n==Examples==\n===Example 1===\nThis example program prints its command line arguments. The <code>main</code> function is the entry point of a D program, and <code>args</code> is an array of strings representing the command line arguments. A <code>string</code> in D is an array of characters, represented by <code>char[]</code> in D1, or <code>immutable(char)[]</code> in D2.\n\n<source lang=\"D\" line highlight=\"3,5\">\nimport std.stdio: writefln;\n\nvoid main(string[] args)\n{\n    foreach (i, arg; args)\n        writefln(\"args[%d] = '%s'\", i, arg);\n}\n</source>\n\nThe <code>foreach</code> statement can iterate over any collection. In this case, it is producing a sequence of indexes (<code>i</code>) and values (<code>arg</code>) from the array <code>args</code>. The index <code>i</code> and the value <code>arg</code> have their types inferred from the type of the array <code>args</code>.\n\n===Example 2===\nThe following shows several D capabilities and D design trade-offs in a short program. It iterates over the lines of a text file named <code>words.txt</code>, which contains a different word on each line, and prints all the words that are anagrams of other words.\n\n<source lang=\"D\" line highlight=\"5,7,9,10,11,14,16\">\nimport std.stdio, std.algorithm, std.range, std.string;\n\nvoid main() {\n    dstring[] [dstring] signs2words;\n\n    foreach (dchar[] w; lines(File(\"words.txt\"))) {\n        w = w.chomp().toLower();\n        immutable key = w.dup.sort().release().idup;\n        signs2words[key] ~= w.idup;\n    }\n\n    foreach (words; signs2words) {\n        if (words.length > 1) {\n            writefln(words.join(\" \"));\n        }\n    }\n}</source>\n\n# <code>signs2words</code> is a built-in associative array that maps dstring (32-bit / char) keys to arrays of dstrings. It is similar to <code>defaultdict(list)</code> in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].\n# <code>lines(File())</code> yields lines lazily, with the newline. It has to then be copied with <code>idup</code> to obtain a string to be used for the associative array values (the <code>idup</code> property of arrays returns an immutable duplicate of the array, which is required since the <code>dstring</code> type is actually <code>immutable(dchar)[]</code>). Built-in associative arrays require immutable keys.\n# The <code>~=</code> operator appends a new dstring to the values of the associate dynamic array.\n# <code>toLower</code>, <code>join</code> and <code>chomp</code> are string functions that D allows the use of with a method syntax. The name of such functions are often similar to Python string methods. The <code>toLower</code> converts a string to lower case, <code>join(\"&nbsp;\")</code> joins an array of strings into a single string using a single space as separator, and <code>chomp</code> removes a newline from the end of the string if one is present. The <code>w.dup.sort().release().idup</code> is more readable, but equivalent to <code>release(sort(w.dup)).idup</code> for example. This feature is called UCFS (Uniform Function Call Syntax), and allows extending any built-in or third party package types with method-like functionality. The style of writing code like this is often referenced as [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]] (especially when the objects used are lazily computed, for example iterators / ranges) or [[Fluent interface]].\n# The <code>sort</code> is an std.algorithm function that sorts the array in place, creating a unique signature for words that are anagrams of each other. The <code>release()</code> method on the return value of <code>sort()</code> is handy to keep the code as a single expression.\n# The second <code>foreach</code> iterates on the values of the associative array, it's able to infer the type of <code>words</code>.\n# <code>key</code> is assigned to an immutable variable, its type is inferred.\n# [[UTF-32]] <code>dchar[]</code> is used instead of normal [[UTF-8]] <code>char[]</code> otherwise <code>sort()</code> refuses to sort it. There are more efficient ways to write this program using just UTF-8.\n\n==Uses==\nNotable organisations that use the D programming language for projects include [[Facebook]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Under the Hood: warp, a fast C and C++ preprocessor |date=28 March 2014 |url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/476987592402291/under-the-hood-warp-a-fast-c-and-c-preprocessor/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> [[eBay]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Faster Command Line Tools in D |date=24 May 2017 |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2017/05/24/faster-command-line-tools-in-d/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Introducing Vectorflow |date=2 August 2017 |url=https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/introducing-vectorflow-fe10d7f126b8 |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nD has been successfully used for [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA games]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Quantum Break: AAA Gaming With Some D Code |url=http://dconf.org/2016/talks/watson.html |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> a [[JavaScript]] virtual machine,<ref>{{cite web |title=Higgs JavaScript Virtual Machine |url=https://github.com/higgsjs/Higgs |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A D implementation of the ECMA 262 (Javascript) programming language |url=https://github.com/DigitalMars/DMDScript |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> an [[operating system]] [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Project Highlight: The PowerNex Kernel |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2016/06/24/project-highlight-the-powernex-kernel/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] programming,<ref>{{cite web |title=DCompute: Running D on the GPU |date=30 October 2017 |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2017/10/30/d-compute-running-d-on-the-gpu/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> [[web development]],<ref>{{cite web |title=vibe.d - a high-performance asynchronous I/O, concurrency and web application toolkit written in D |url=http://vibed.org/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Project Highlight: Diamond MVC Framework |date=20 November 2017 |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2017/11/20/project-highlight-diamond-mvc-framework/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> [[numerical analysis]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Numeric age for D: Mir GLAS is faster than OpenBLAS and Eigen |url=http://blog.mir.dlang.io/glas/benchmark/openblas/2016/09/23/glas-gemm-benchmark.html |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> [[Graphical user interface|GUI applications]],<ref>{{cite web |title=On Tilix and D: An Interview with Gerald Nunn |date=11 August 2017 |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2017/08/11/on-tilix-and-d-an-interview-with-gerald-nunn/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Project Highlight: DlangUI |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2016/10/07/project-highlight-dlangui/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> and a [[passenger information system]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Project Highlight: Funkwerk |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2017/07/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[Ddoc]]\n* [[D Language Foundation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Alexandrescu |first=Andrei |title=The D Programming Language |publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional |date=4 January 2010 |edition=1 |isbn=978-0-321-63536-5}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.ddj.com/hpc-high-performance-computing/217801225 |title=The Case for D |last=Alexandrescu |first=Andrei |date=15 June 2009 |publisher=Dr. Dobb's Journal}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/how-i-came-to-write-d/240165322 |title=How I Came to Write D |last=Bright |first=Walter |date=8 April 2014 |publisher=Dr. Dobb's Journal}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://ddili.org/ders/d.en/index.html |title=Programming in D |last=\u00c7ehreli |first=Ali |date=1 February 2012}} (distributed under CC-BY-NC-SA license).

[[Andrei Alexandrescu]] joined the design and development effort in 2007. Though it originated as a re-engineering of [[C++]], D is a distinct language. It has redesigned some core C++ features, while also sharing characteristics of other languages, notably [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]].\n\nThe design goals of the language attempted to combine the performance and safety of [[compiled language]]s with the [[expressive power (computer science)|expressive power]] of modern [[Dynamic programming language|dynamic languages]]. [[Idiomatic]] D code was commonly as fast as equivalent C++ code, while also being shorter.<ref name=\"short\" />  The language as a whole was not [[memory safety|memory-safe]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12391370 |date=August 30, 2016 |title=On: Ruminations on D: An Interview with Walter Bright|website=Hacker News}} \"It's close, and we're working to close the remaining gaps.\"</ref> but does include optional attributes designed to check memory safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dlang.org/spec/memory-safe-d.html |title=Memory-Safe-D-Spec |publisher=D Language Foundation}}</ref>\n\n[[Type inference]], [[Garbage collection (computer science)|automatic memory management]] and [[syntactic sugar]] for [[Type (computer programming)|common types]] allow faster [[software development|development]], while [[bounds checking]], [[design by contract]] features and a [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]]-aware [[type system]] help reduce the occurrence of [[software bug|bugs]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlVpPstLPEc |title=Three Cool Things About D |date=2 August 2010 |people=Andrei Alexandrescu}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nD was designed with lessons learned from practical C++ usage, rather than from a purely theoretical perspective. Although the language uses many [[C (programming language)|C]] and C++ concepts, it also discards some and was not compatible with C and C++ source code. D has, however, been constrained in its design by the rule that any code that was legal in both C and D should behave in the same way. D gained some features before C++, such as [[closure (computer science)|closures]], [[anonymous functions]], and [[compile time function execution]]. D adds to the functionality of C++ by also implementing [[design by contract]], [[unit test]]ing, true [[module (programming)|modules]], [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], [[first-class object|first class]] [[array data type|arrays]], [[associative array]]s, [[dynamic array]]s, [[array slicing]], [[nested function]]s, [[lazy evaluation]], and a re-engineered [[generic programming#Templates in C++|template]] syntax. D retains C++'s ability to perform [[low-level programming language|low-level programming]] and to add [[inline assembler|inline]] [[assembly language|assembler]]. C++ [[multiple inheritance]] was replaced by Java-style [[multiple inheritance|single inheritance]] with [[interface (computer science)|interfaces]] and [[mixin]]s. On the other hand, D's declaration, statement and expression [[syntax]] closely matches that of C++.\n\nThe [[inline assembler]] typifies the differences between D and application languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. An inline assembler lets programmers enter machine-specific [[assembly language|assembly code]] within standard D code, a method used by system programmers to access the low-level features of the [[central processing unit|processor]] needed to run programs that interface directly with the underlying [[computer hardware|hardware]], such as [[operating system]]s and [[device driver]]s.\n\nD has built-in support for documentation comments, allowing automatic [[documentation generator|documentation generation]].\n\n===Programming paradigms===\nD supports five main [[programming paradigm]]s: [[imperative programming|imperative]], [[object-oriented]], [[metaprogramming]], [[functional programming|functional]] and [[concurrent programming language|concurrent]] ([[actor model]]).\n\n====Imperative====\nImperative programming in D is almost identical to that in C.  Functions, data, statements, declarations and expressions work just as they do in C, and the C runtime library may be accessed directly.  On the other hand, some notable differences between D and C in the area of imperative programming include D's [[foreach|<code>foreach</code>]] loop construct, which allows looping over a collection, and [[nested function]]s, which are functions that are declared inside another and may access the enclosing function's [[local variable]]s.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nimport std.stdio;\nvoid main() {\n    int multiplier = 10;\n    int scaled(int x) { return x * multiplier; }\n\n    foreach (auto i; 0 .. 10) {\n        writefln(\"Hello, world %d! scaled = %d\", i, scaled(i));\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nD also includes dynamic arrays and associative arrays by default in the language.\n\n====Object-oriented====\nObject-oriented programming in D is based on a single inheritance hierarchy, with all classes derived from class Object. D does not support multiple inheritance; instead, it uses Java-style [[interface (Java)|interfaces]], which are comparable to C++'s pure abstract classes, and [[mixin]]s, which separates common functionality from the inheritance hierarchy. D also allows the defining of static and final (non-virtual) methods in interfaces.\n\n====Metaprogramming====\nMetaprogramming is supported by a combination of templates, compile time function execution, [[tuple]]s, and string mixins. The following examples demonstrate some of D's compile-time features.\n\nTemplates in D can be written in a more imperative style compared to the C++ functional style for templates.  This is a regular function that calculates the [[factorial]] of a number:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nulong factorial(ulong n) {\n    if (n < 2)\n        return 1;\n    else\n        return n * factorial(n-1);\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHere, the use of <code>static if</code>, D's compile-time conditional construct, is demonstrated to construct a template that performs the same calculation using code that is similar to that of the function above:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\ntemplate Factorial(ulong n) {\n    static if (n < 2)\n        enum Factorial = 1;\n    else\n        enum Factorial = n * Factorial!(n-1);\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the following two examples, the template and function defined above are used to compute factorials.  The types of constants need not be specified explicitly as the compiler [[type inference|infers their types]] from the right-hand sides of assignments:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nenum fact_7 = Factorial!(7);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis is an example of [[compile time function execution]]. Ordinary functions may be used in constant, compile-time expressions provided they meet certain criteria:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nenum fact_9 = factorial(9);\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe <code>std.string.format</code> function performs [[printf|<code>printf</code>]]-like data formatting (also at compile-time, through [[compile time function execution|CTFE]]), and the \"msg\" [[Directive (programming)|pragma]] displays the result at compile time:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nimport std.string : format;\npragma(msg, format(\"7! = %s\", fact_7));\npragma(msg, format(\"9! = %s\", fact_9));\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nString mixins, combined with compile-time function execution, allow generating D code using string operations at compile time. This can be used to parse [[domain-specific language]]s to D code, which will be compiled as part of the program:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">\nimport FooToD; // hypothetical module which contains a function that parses Foo source code\n               // and returns equivalent D code\nvoid main() {\n    mixin(fooToD(import(\"example.foo\")));\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Functional====\nD supports [[functional programming]] features such as [[anonymous function|function literals]], [[Closure (computer science)|closures]], recursively-immutable objects and the use of [[higher-order function]]s. There are two syntaxes for anonymous functions, including a multiple-statement form and a \"shorthand\" single-expression notation:<ref name=\"short\">{{cite web |title=Expressions |url=http://dlang.org/expression.html#Lambda |publisher=Digital Mars |access-date=27 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"D\">\nint function(int) g;\ng = (x) { return x * x; }; // longhand\ng = (x) => x * x;          // shorthand\n</source>\n\nThere are two built-in types for function literals, <code>function</code>, which is simply a pointer to a stack-allocated function, and <code>delegate</code>, which also includes a pointer to the surrounding environment. Type inference may be used with an anonymous function, in which case the compiler creates a <code>delegate</code> unless it can prove that an environment pointer is not necessary. Likewise, to implement a closure, the compiler places enclosed local variables on the heap only if necessary (for example, if a closure is returned by another function, and exits that function's scope). When using type inference, the compiler will also add attributes such as <code>pure</code> and <code>nothrow</code> to a function's type, if it can prove that they apply.\n\nOther functional features such as [[currying]] and common higher-order functions such as [[map (higher-order function)|map]], [[filter (higher-order function)|filter]], and [[fold (higher-order function)|reduce]] are available through the standard library modules <code>std.functional</code> and <code>std.algorithm</code>.\n\n<source lang=\"D\">\nimport std.stdio, std.algorithm, std.range;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    int[] a1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];\n    int[] a2 = [6, 7, 8, 9];\n\n    // must be immutable to allow access from inside a pure function\n    immutable pivot = 5;\n\n    int mySum(int a, int b) pure nothrow // pure function\n    {\n        if (b <= pivot) // ref to enclosing-scope\n            return a + b;\n        else\n            return a;\n    }\n\n    // passing a delegate (closure)\n    auto result = reduce!mySum(chain(a1, a2));\n    writeln(\"Result: \", result); // Result: 15\n\n    // passing a delegate literal\n    result = reduce!((a, b) => (b <= pivot) ? a + b : a)(chain(a1, a2));\n    writeln(\"Result: \", result); // Result: 15\n}\n</source>\n\nAlternatively, the above function compositions can be expressed using [[Uniform Function Call Syntax]] (UFCS) for more natural left-to-right reading:\n\n<source lang=\"D\">\n    auto result = a1.chain(a2).reduce!mySum();\n    writeln(\"Result: \", result);\n\n    result = a1.chain(a2).reduce!((a, b) => (b <= pivot) ? a + b : a)();\n    writeln(\"Result: \", result);\n</source>\n\n====Parallel====\n<source lang=D>\nimport std.stdio : writeln;\nimport std.range : iota;\nimport std.parallelism : parallel;\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    foreach (i; iota(11).parallel) {\n        // The body of the foreach loop is executed in parallel for each i\n        writeln(\"processing \", i);\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n====Concurrent====\nConcurrent programming is fully implemented in the library, and does not require any special support from the compiler. Alternative implementations and methodologies of writing concurrent code are possible. The use of D typing system does help ensure memory safety.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"D\">import std.stdio, std.concurrency, std.variant;\n\nvoid foo()\n{\n    bool cont = true;\n\n    while (cont)\n    {\n        receive( // Delegates are used to match the message type.\n            (int msg) => writeln(\"int received: \", msg),\n            (Tid sender) { cont = false; sender.send(-1); },\n            (Variant v) => writeln(\"huh?\") // Variant matches any type\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nvoid main()\n{\n    auto tid = spawn(&foo); // spawn a new thread running foo()\n\n    foreach (i; 0 .. 10)\n        tid.send(i);   // send some integers\n    tid.send(1.0f);    // send a float\n    tid.send(\"hello\"); // send a string\n    tid.send(thisTid); // send a struct (Tid)\n\n    receive((int x) => writeln(\"Main thread received message: \", x));\n}</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Memory management===\nMemory is usually managed with [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], but specific objects may be finalized immediately when they go out of scope. Explicit memory management is possible using the [[operator overloading|overloaded operators]] <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>, and by simply calling [[C (programming language)|C]]'s [[malloc|malloc and free]] directly. Garbage collection can be controlled: programmers may add and exclude memory ranges from being observed by the collector, can disable and enable the collector and force either a generational or full collection cycle.<ref>{{cite web |title=std.gc |url=http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/phobos/std_gc.html |work=D Programming Language 1.0 |publisher=Digital Mars |access-date=6 July 2010}}</ref> The manual gives many examples of how to implement different highly optimized memory management schemes for when garbage collection is inadequate in a program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dlang.org/memory.html |title=Memory Management |publisher=Digital Mars |work=D Programming Language 2.0 |access-date=17 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n===SafeD===\nSafeD<ref name=\"SafeD\">{{cite web |title=SafeD \u2013 D Programming Language |url=http://dlang.org/safed.html |author=Bartosz Milewski |access-date=17 July 2014}}</ref>\nis the name given to the subset of D that can be guaranteed to be memory safe (no writes to memory that were not allocated or that have already been recycled). Functions marked <code>@safe</code> are checked at compile time to ensure that they do not use any features that could result in corruption of memory, such as pointer arithmetic and unchecked casts, and any other functions called must also be marked as <code>@safe</code> or <code>@trusted</code>. Functions can be marked <code>@trusted</code> for the cases where the compiler cannot distinguish between safe use of a feature that is disabled in SafeD and a potential case of memory corruption.<ref>{{cite web |title=How to Write @trusted Code in D |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2016/09/28/how-to-write-trusted-code-in-d/ |author=Steven Schveighoffer |date=28 September 2016 |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n=====Scope Lifetime Safety=====\nInitially under the banners of DIP1000<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/other/DIP1000.md|title=Scoped Pointers|date=3 April 2020}}</ref> and DIP25<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.dlang.org/DIP25|title=Sealed References}}</ref> (now part of the language specification<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#return-scope-parameters|title=D Language Specification: Functions - Return Scope Parameters}}</ref>), D provides protections against certain ill-formed constructions involving the lifetimes of data.\n\nThe current mechanisms in place primarily deal with function parameters and stack memory however it is a stated ambition of the leadership of the programming language to provide a more thorough treatment of lifetimes within the D programming language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dlang.org/blog/2019/07/15/ownership-and-borrowing-in-d/|title=Ownership and Borrowing in D|date=15 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Lifetime Safety of Assignments=====\nWithin @safe code, the lifetime of an assignment involving a reference type is checked to ensure to the lifetime of the assignee is longer than that of the assigned.\n\nFor example:\n<source lang=\"D\">\n@safe void test()\n{\n    int tmp = 0; // #1\n    int* rad; // #2\n    rad = &tmp; // If the order of the declarations of #1 and #2 is reversed, this fails.\n    {\n    \tint bad = 45; // Lifetime of \"bad\" only extends to the scope in which it is defined.\n        *rad = bad; // This is kosher.\n        rad = &bad; // Lifetime of rad longer than bad, hence this is not kosher at all.       \n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n=====Function Parameter Lifetime Annotations within @safe code=====\nWhen applied to function parameter which are either of pointer type or references, the keywords ''return'' and ''scope'' constrain the lifetime and use of that parameter. \n\nThe Standard Dictates the following behaviour:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dlang.org/spec/function.html#param-storage|title=D Language Specification: Functions - Function Parameter Storage Classes}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Storage Class\n!Behaviour (and constraints to) of a Parameter with the storage class\n|-\n|''scope''\n|references in the parameter cannot be escaped.

The first public Tango announcement came within days of D 1.0's release.<ref>{{cite web |title=Announcing a new library |url=http://forum.dlang.org/post/en9ou4$23hr$1@digitaldaemon.com |access-date=15 February 2012}}</ref> Tango adopted a different programming style, embracing OOP and high modularity. Being a community-led project, Tango was more open to contributions, which allowed it to progress faster than the official standard library. At that time, Tango and Phobos were incompatible due to different runtime support APIs (the garbage collector, threading support, etc.). This made it impossible to use both libraries in the same project. The existence of two libraries, both widely in use, has led to significant dispute due to some packages using Phobos and others using Tango.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wiki4D: Standard Lib |url=http://www.prowiki.org/wiki4d/wiki.cgi?StandardLib |access-date=6 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2007, the first version of D2 was released.<ref name=\"D2 changelog\">{{cite web |title=Change Log \u2013 D Programming Language |url=https://dlang.org/changelog/ |work=D Programming Language 2.0 |publisher=D Language Foundation |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref> The beginning of D2's development signaled D1's stabilization. The first version of the language has been placed in maintenance, only receiving corrections and implementation bugfixes.

Ddbg can be used with various IDEs or from the command line; ZeroBUGS has its own [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).\n\n==Examples==\n===Example 1===\nThis example program prints its command line arguments. The <code>main</code> function is the entry point of a D program, and <code>args</code> is an array of strings representing the command line arguments. A <code>string</code> in D is an array of characters, represented by <code>char[]</code> in D1, or <code>immutable(char)[]</code> in D2.\n\n<source lang=\"D\" line highlight=\"3,5\">\nimport std.stdio: writefln;\n\nvoid main(string[] args)\n{\n    foreach (i, arg; args)\n        writefln(\"args[%d] = '%s'\", i, arg);\n}\n</source>\n\nThe <code>foreach</code> statement can iterate over any collection. In this case, it is producing a sequence of indexes (<code>i</code>) and values (<code>arg</code>) from the array <code>args</code>. The index <code>i</code> and the value <code>arg</code> have their types inferred from the type of the array <code>args</code>.\n\n===Example 2===\nThe following shows several D capabilities and D design trade-offs in a short program. It iterates over the lines of a text file named <code>words.txt</code>, which contains a different word on each line, and prints all the words that are anagrams of other words.\n\n<source lang=\"D\" line highlight=\"5,7,9,10,11,14,16\">\nimport std.stdio, std.algorithm, std.range, std.string;\n\nvoid main() {\n    dstring[] [dstring] signs2words;\n\n    foreach (dchar[] w; lines(File(\"words.txt\"))) {\n        w = w.chomp().toLower();\n        immutable key = w.dup.sort().release().idup;\n        signs2words[key] ~= w.idup;\n    }\n\n    foreach (words; signs2words) {\n        if (words.length > 1) {\n            writefln(words.join(\" \"));\n        }\n    }\n}</source>\n\n# <code>signs2words</code> is a built-in associative array that maps dstring (32-bit / char) keys to arrays of dstrings. It is similar to <code>defaultdict(list)</code> in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].\n# <code>lines(File())</code> yields lines lazily, with the newline. It has to then be copied with <code>idup</code> to obtain a string to be used for the associative array values (the <code>idup</code> property of arrays returns an immutable duplicate of the array, which is required since the <code>dstring</code> type is actually <code>immutable(dchar)[]</code>). Built-in associative arrays require immutable keys.\n# The <code>~=</code> operator appends a new dstring to the values of the associate dynamic array.\n# <code>toLower</code>, <code>join</code> and <code>chomp</code> are string functions that D allows the use of with a method syntax. The name of such functions are often similar to Python string methods. The <code>toLower</code> converts a string to lower case, <code>join(\"&nbsp;\")</code> joins an array of strings into a single string using a single space as separator, and <code>chomp</code> removes a newline from the end of the string if one is present. The <code>w.dup.sort().release().idup</code> is more readable, but equivalent to <code>release(sort(w.dup)).idup</code> for example. This feature is called UCFS (Uniform Function Call Syntax), and allows extending any built-in or third party package types with method-like functionality. The style of writing code like this is often referenced as [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipeline]] (especially when the objects used are lazily computed, for example iterators / ranges) or [[Fluent interface]].\n# The <code>sort</code> is an std.algorithm function that sorts the array in place, creating a unique signature for words that are anagrams of each other. The <code>release()</code> method on the return value of <code>sort()</code> is handy to keep the code as a single expression.\n# The second <code>foreach</code> iterates on the values of the associative array, it's able to infer the type of <code>words</code>.\n# <code>key</code> is assigned to an immutable variable, its type is inferred.\n# [[UTF-32]] <code>dchar[]</code> is used instead of normal [[UTF-8]] <code>char[]</code> otherwise <code>sort()</code> refuses to sort it. There are more efficient ways to write this program using just UTF-8.\n\n==Uses==\nNotable organisations that use the D programming language for projects include [[Facebook]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Under the Hood: warp, a fast C and C++ preprocessor |date=28 March 2014 |url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/476987592402291/under-the-hood-warp-a-fast-c-and-c-preprocessor/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> [[eBay]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Faster Command Line Tools in D |date=24 May 2017 |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2017/05/24/faster-command-line-tools-in-d/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> and [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Introducing Vectorflow |date=2 August 2017 |url=https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/introducing-vectorflow-fe10d7f126b8 |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nD has been successfully used for [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA games]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Quantum Break: AAA Gaming With Some D Code |url=http://dconf.org/2016/talks/watson.html |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> a [[JavaScript]] virtual machine,<ref>{{cite web |title=Higgs JavaScript Virtual Machine |url=https://github.com/higgsjs/Higgs |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A D implementation of the ECMA 262 (Javascript) programming language |url=https://github.com/DigitalMars/DMDScript |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> an [[operating system]] [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Project Highlight: The PowerNex Kernel |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2016/06/24/project-highlight-the-powernex-kernel/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] programming,<ref>{{cite web |title=DCompute: Running D on the GPU |date=30 October 2017 |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2017/10/30/d-compute-running-d-on-the-gpu/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> [[web development]],<ref>{{cite web |title=vibe.d - a high-performance asynchronous I/O, concurrency and web application toolkit written in D |url=http://vibed.org/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Project Highlight: Diamond MVC Framework |date=20 November 2017 |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2017/11/20/project-highlight-diamond-mvc-framework/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> [[numerical analysis]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Numeric age for D: Mir GLAS is faster than OpenBLAS and Eigen |url=http://blog.mir.dlang.io/glas/benchmark/openblas/2016/09/23/glas-gemm-benchmark.html |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> [[Graphical user interface|GUI applications]],<ref>{{cite web |title=On Tilix and D: An Interview with Gerald Nunn |date=11 August 2017 |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2017/08/11/on-tilix-and-d-an-interview-with-gerald-nunn/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Project Highlight: DlangUI |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2016/10/07/project-highlight-dlangui/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref> and a [[passenger information system]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Project Highlight: Funkwerk |url=https://dlang.org/blog/2017/07/ |access-date=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[Ddoc]]\n* [[D Language Foundation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Alexandrescu |first=Andrei |title=The D Programming Language |publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional |date=4 January 2010 |edition=1 |isbn=978-0-321-63536-5}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.ddj.com/hpc-high-performance-computing/217801225 |title=The Case for D |last=Alexandrescu |first=Andrei |date=15 June 2009 |publisher=Dr. Dobb's Journal}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/how-i-came-to-write-d/240165322 |title=How I Came to Write D |last=Bright |first=Walter |date=8 April 2014 |publisher=Dr. Dobb's Journal}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://ddili.org/ders/d.en/index.html |title=Programming in D |last=\u00c7ehreli |first=Ali |date=1 February 2012}} (distributed under CC-BY-NC-SA license).

As the guild celebrates, they are visited and taunted by Bacchus, Erza's rival from Quatro Cerberus, who has come to replace War Cry. Carla relays her premonition to Poluchka, saying that she saw Mercurius collapsing around what appeared to be a tearfully singing Lucy. The second day of the tournament begins with a footrace atop a train of moving chariots, causing the participants Natsu, Gajeel, and Sting to suffer from motion sickness as a side effect of their Dragon Slayer magic. As Natsu and Gajeel force themselves forward, Sting inquires about their determination to which Natsu responds that it is as a result of the strength of Fairy Tail's bonds. Sting eventually throws the race while Natsu and Gajeel manage to finish as sixth and seventh placers, respectively, earning Fairy Tail the audience's respect.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 162\n| Title           = Elfman vs. Bacchus\n| TranslitTitle   = Erufuman vs. Bakkasu\n| NativeTitle     = \u30a8\u30eb\u30d5\u30de\u30f3 vs. \u30d0\u30c3\u30ab\u30b9\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|12|22}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = Due to a miscomunnication between the king and his knight Arcadios, Elfman is chosen as Bacchus' opponent instead of Erza.

Bacchus ruthlessly attacks Elfman with his bare palms, who manages to damage Bacchus with his defensive Lizardman transformation. Elfman manages to outlast Bacchus as he exhausts himself, winning the match and forcing Bacchus' team to be renamed. Meanwhile, Natsu finds Wendy, Carla, and Poluchka being kidnapped by a group of masked men. Upon being caught, the men claim they were hired to kidnap Lucy by Raven Tail.

Since the two competitors are well-known for being magazine models, their battle consists almost entirely of a fashion showdown, much to the pleasure of the audience. Eventually, as the showdown becomes redundant, Jenny proposes a wager: the loser must pose nude for the ''Weekly Sorcerer'' magazine, which Mirajane accepts. Jenny then transforms into her battle armor while Mirajane shifts into her Satan Soul \"Sitri\" form and easily defeats Jenny. The final match of the day is announced, with Kagura Mikazuchi of Mermaid Heel pitted against Yukino Aguria of Saber Tooth. Yukino proposes to Kagura that they wager their lives on their battle.

However, Kagura slays Ophiuchus with her sword still sheathed and easily defeats Yukino. Later, Jellal discusses the fact that he has not sensed the evil power similar to Zeref's even though the second day of the Grand Magic Games has ended. Erza reunites with Milliana, who is revealed to be a member of Mermaid Heel. Meanwhile, Saber Tooth's master Ziemma is dissatisfied with his guild's performance.

As Natsu leaves, he states that Saber Tooth will never surpass Fairy Tail because they care for their friends, words that are echoed by Rogue, while Sting is left in awe at Natsu's strength. The following day as the Grand Magic Games continue, an event called \"Pandemonium\" begins. It involves the participants entering a magical citadel filled with 100 monsters of varying strengths and individually doing battle with any number of monsters they choose. Representing Fairy Tail Team A, Erza requests the 100 monsters as her opponents.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 167\n| Title           = 100 Against 1\n| TranslitTitle   = Hyaku tai Ichi\n| NativeTitle     = 100\u5bfe1\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|2|2}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = Erza kills the 100 monsters using various types of armor to match their strength and weaknesses. As a result, the crowd praises Fairy Tail, and the guild is awarded with 10 points. Moreover, the game officials decided to determine the ranks of the remaining participants by means of a device called \"Magic Power Finder\" (sometimes abbreviated as MPF). Using this tool, participants must attack it with their magic power, which will, in turn, calculate and display their equivalent scores depending on the extent of power used. In the end, Cana of Fairy Tail Team B dominates the event by using the Fairy Glitter spell lent to her by Mavis, much to Makarov's surprise. With Cana's victory, Fairy Tail Team B receives 8 points, and the audience began to burst once more into a resounding swarm of cheers and claps due to the finish of the two Fairy Tail teams. Meanwhile, the Raven Tail team somehow managed to get an insider information regarding the battle matchups for the day, so the masked leader Alexei tells his subordinates Flare, Obra, Nalpudding, and Kurohebi that it's about time to proceed with their true mission.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 168\n| Title           = Laxus vs. Alexei\n| TranslitTitle   = Rakusasu vs. Arekusei\n| NativeTitle     = \u30e9\u30af\u30b5\u30b9 vs. \u30a2\u30ec\u30af\u30bb\u30a4\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|2|9}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = In the battle portion of the Grand Magic Games' third day, Milliana of Mermaid Heel beats Semmes of Quatro Puppy while Saber Tooth's Rufus swiftly defeats Blue Pegasus' Eve. For the third match, Laxus of Fairy Tail Team B is chosen to battle against Alexei of Team Raven Tail. Since the opponent is from a suspicious guild, the Fairy Tail members take extra precautions by watching the actions of Ivan Dreyar as well as the other four Raven Tail members. However, as the match commences, the spectators are shocked to see Laxus being beaten by Alexei, although no cautious movements can be seen from the Raven Tail team. It turns out that the two dueling people are just illusions created by Alexei in order for him to have a talk with Laxus. Also, the other Raven Tail members being monitored by Fairy Tail are just lifelike illusions, for in reality they are with Alexei in the battlefield. Alexei reveals himself to be Ivan Dreyar. Unable to interrogate Laxus of the Lumen Histoire's location, Ivan and the Raven Tail members are forced to fight him.

The game officials declare Laxus the victor, and Ivan tells him that Lumen Histoire is Fairy Tail\u2019s 'darkness'. Due to the infraction of the rules, the Raven Tail team is disqualified for the remainder of the Games, and its members are captured by the soldiers. Later, Wendy of Fairy Tail Team A and Sherria Blendy of Team Lamia Scale face off to compete for the final match of the day. As the two exchange attacks, gusts of wind surround the arena since Sherria is revealed to be a Sky God Slayer. Wendy employs an advanced Sky Dragon Slayer attack much to Poluchka's astonishment, causing Sherria to fall on the ground. Wendy is about to be announced as the winner of the bout when Sherria suddenly stands up with her wounds fully healed. Meanwhile, the Crime Sorci\u00e8re guild senses the nefarious aura, and Jellal proceeds to the Domus Flau audience, oblivious that he bumped into Doranbolt, who, in turn, wonders what is Mystogan doing in Earthland.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 170\n| Title           = Small Fists\n| TranslitTitle   = Chiisana Kobushi\n| NativeTitle     = \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u62f3\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|2|23}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = With Cheria being fully healed and Wendy being almost depleted of magic power, their battle continues, with the former casting a high-level spell towards the latter. However, it seems that Wendy enhances Cheria's physical strength, causing the attack to gain much force and thus missing Wendy. The two competitors then engage in a hand-to-hand combat, but due to the time limit and neither side is giving up, their battle resulted in a draw, giving both teams 5 points. Meanwhile, Jellal manages to track the sinister aura among the crowd in the form of a hooded stranger. Jellal is about to confront the aura source, but he is abruptly cornered by Doranbolt, Lahar, and other Rune Knights. Doranbalt then interrogates Jellal, and as his cover was blown, the Rune Knights, as well as Kagura and Milliana glancing nearby, are startled to see the true identity of Mystogan. Yajima convinces the Rune Knights that Mystogan is Jellal\u2019s Edolas counterpart, prompting Lahar to release the fugitive.

After the other participants fall out of the aquatic sphere, a five-minute battle between Lucy and Minerva ensues. However, Minerva quickly attacks Lucy, and she manages to steal the keys of the Celestial Spirit mage. Regardless of this, Lucy refuses to surrender. After hearing Lucy's intentions,  Minerva stops from attacking up to the extent that the five-minute mark was reached. However, Minerva resumes attacking Lucy until the game officials decide to halt the match.

He also reveals that the new team will have the former Team A's 35 points to start with. The new Fairy Tail team, consisting of Natsu, Gray, Erza, Gajeel, and Laxus, are well-received as they enter the field. The second part of the tournament begins with a tag battle between Blue Pegasus' Ichiya and \"Rabbit\" and Quatro Puppy's Rocker and Bacchus. To everyone's shock, it is revealed that \"Rabbit\" is actually Nichiya in disguise, and after the Exceed is punched by Bacchus, Ichiya bulks up to defeat the Quatro Puppy opponents, awarding Blue Pegasus with 10 points.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 173\n| Title           = Battle of Dragon Slayers!\n| TranslitTitle   = Batoru obu Doragon Sureiy\u0101\n| NativeTitle     = \u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30b9\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|3|16}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = Mermaid Heel's Kagura and Milliana and Lamia Scale's Lyon and Yuka face off for the second tag battle of the games.

As the battle commences, Sting and Rogue were about to take the initiative when they were suddenly attacked by Natsu and Gajeel. The four mages then exchange attacks; however, the audience watches in shock as the Fairy Tail Dragon Slayers overpower the Saber Tooth Dragon Slayers.

Sting decides to finish the Fairy Tail Dragon Slayers alone, for he held a promise to his Exceed friend Lector many years ago. As the three mages fight, the tide turns in favor of Sting as he unleashes a powerful attack on Natsu and Gajeel, resulting in the collapse of the arena floor, and after a hand-to-hand combat underground, Sting was seemingly the victor of the match. However, the Fairy Tail duo stands up, comments on Sting\u2019s strength, and argues about his position while attacking, thereby causing Natsu to drag Gajeel on a mining cart and send it away.

With Cana's victory, Fairy Tail Team B receives 8 points, and the audience began to burst once more into a resounding swarm of cheers and claps due to the finish of the two Fairy Tail teams. Meanwhile, the Raven Tail team somehow managed to get an insider information regarding the battle matchups for the day, so the masked leader Alexei tells his subordinates Flare, Obra, Nalpudding, and Kurohebi that it's about time to proceed with their true mission.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 168\n| Title           = Laxus vs. Alexei\n| TranslitTitle   = Rakusasu vs. Arekusei\n| NativeTitle     = \u30e9\u30af\u30b5\u30b9 vs. \u30a2\u30ec\u30af\u30bb\u30a4\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|2|9}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = In the battle portion of the Grand Magic Games' third day, Milliana of Mermaid Heel beats Semmes of Quatro Puppy while Saber Tooth's Rufus swiftly defeats Blue Pegasus' Eve. For the third match, Laxus of Fairy Tail Team B is chosen to battle against Alexei of Team Raven Tail. Since the opponent is from a suspicious guild, the Fairy Tail members take extra precautions by watching the actions of Ivan Dreyar as well as the other four Raven Tail members. However, as the match commences, the spectators are shocked to see Laxus being beaten by Alexei, although no cautious movements can be seen from the Raven Tail team. It turns out that the two dueling people are just illusions created by Alexei in order for him to have a talk with Laxus. Also, the other Raven Tail members being monitored by Fairy Tail are just lifelike illusions, for in reality they are with Alexei in the battlefield. Alexei reveals himself to be Ivan Dreyar. Unable to interrogate Laxus of the Lumen Histoire's location, Ivan and the Raven Tail members are forced to fight him. Before their battle begins, Ivan declares that Raven Tail is an anti-Fairy Tail guild.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 169\n| Title           = Wendy vs. Shelia\n| TranslitTitle   = Wendi vs. Sheria\n| NativeTitle     = \u30a6\u30a7\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3 vs. \u30b7\u30a7\u30ea\u30a2\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|2|16}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = After Laxus defeats Ivan and the four Raven Tail elite members, Ivan's illusions disappear to the shock of everyone in the stadium. The game officials declare Laxus the victor, and Ivan tells him that Lumen Histoire is Fairy Tail\u2019s 'darkness'. Due to the infraction of the rules, the Raven Tail team is disqualified for the remainder of the Games, and its members are captured by the soldiers. Later, Wendy of Fairy Tail Team A and Sherria Blendy of Team Lamia Scale face off to compete for the final match of the day. As the two exchange attacks, gusts of wind surround the arena since Sherria is revealed to be a Sky God Slayer. Wendy employs an advanced Sky Dragon Slayer attack much to Poluchka's astonishment, causing Sherria to fall on the ground. Wendy is about to be announced as the winner of the bout when Sherria suddenly stands up with her wounds fully healed. Meanwhile, the Crime Sorci\u00e8re guild senses the nefarious aura, and Jellal proceeds to the Domus Flau audience, oblivious that he bumped into Doranbolt, who, in turn, wonders what is Mystogan doing in Earthland.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 170\n| Title           = Small Fists\n| TranslitTitle   = Chiisana Kobushi\n| NativeTitle     = \u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u62f3\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|2|23}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = With Cheria being fully healed and Wendy being almost depleted of magic power, their battle continues, with the former casting a high-level spell towards the latter. However, it seems that Wendy enhances Cheria's physical strength, causing the attack to gain much force and thus missing Wendy. The two competitors then engage in a hand-to-hand combat, but due to the time limit and neither side is giving up, their battle resulted in a draw, giving both teams with 5 points. Meanwhile, Jellal manages to track the sinister aura among the crowd in the form of a hooded stranger. Jellal is about to confront the aura source, but he is abruptly cornered by Doranbolt, Lahar, and other Rune Knights. Doranbalt then interrogates Jellal, and as his cover was blown, the Rune Knights, as well as Kagura and Milliana glancing nearby, are startled to see the true identity of Mystogan. Yajima convinces the Rune Knights that Mystogan is Jellal\u2019s Edolas counterpart, prompting Lahar to release the fugitive. Meanwhile, Laxus and Makarov have a small conversation regarding Lumen Histoire when Mavis appears and explains that Lumen Histoire is the \u2018light\u2019 of Fairy Tail.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 171\n| Title           = Naval Battle\n| TranslitTitle   = Nabaru Batoru\n| NativeTitle     = {{ruby|\u6d77\u6218|\u30ca\u30d0\u30eb\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb}}\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|3|2}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = As the jubilant Fairy Tail members celebrate their victories, the other people, such as Sting, Kagura, and Milliana, are contemplating on their own concerns, while Yukino is enlisted as a sergeant under Arcadios' command. Meanwhile, the fourth day of the competitions comes to a start with an event, \"Naval Battle\", which involves the participants swimming in a giant water sphere and knocking the other competitors out. After the other participants fall out of the aquatic sphere, a five-minute battle between Lucy and Minerva ensues. However, Minerva quickly attacks Lucy, and she manages to steal the keys of the Celestial Spirit mage. Regardless of this, Lucy refuses to surrender. After hearing Lucy's intentions,  Minerva stops from attacking up to the extent that the five-minute mark was reached. However, Minerva resumes attacking Lucy until the game officials decide to halt the match. The Fairy Tail members snap, and Minerva dangles Lucy out of the sphere while the others rush to her aid.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 172\n| Title           = A Parfum for You\n| TranslitTitle   = Kimi ni Sasageru Parufamu\n| NativeTitle     = \u541b\u306b\u6367\u3052\u308b{{ruby|\u9999\u308a|\u30d1\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30e0}}\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|3|9}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = While Lucy is hospitalized and taken to the infirmary, the Fairy Tail members warn Saber Tooth that they have angered the worst possible guild to do so. Later, Makarov announces that the two Fairy Tail teams must merge as a result of the disqualification of Raven Tail and to compensate for the odd number of teams for the battle round. He also reveals that the new team will have the former Team A's 35 points to start with. The new Fairy Tail team, consisting of Natsu, Gray, Erza, Gajeel, and Laxus, are well-received as they enter the field. The second part of the tournament begins with a tag battle between Blue Pegasus' Ichiya and \"Rabbit\" and Quatro Puppy's Rocker and Bacchus. To everyone's shock, it is revealed that \"Rabbit\" is actually Nichiya in disguise, and after the Exceed is punched by Bacchus, Ichiya bulks up to defeat the Quatro Puppy opponents, awarding Blue Pegasus with 10 points.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 173\n| Title           = Battle of Dragon Slayers!\n| TranslitTitle   = Batoru obu Doragon Sureiy\u0101\n| NativeTitle     = \u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30b9\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|3|16}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = Mermaid Heel's Kagura and Milliana and Lamia Scale's Lyon and Yuka face off for the second tag battle of the games. The two teams struggle to earn a victory, only to have their battle ending in a draw due to the time limit. For the third and final match of the day, the spectators look on in silence as Natsu and Gajeel of Team Fairy Tail and Sting and Rogue of Team Saber Tooth enter the field. As the battle commences, Sting and Rogue were about to take the initiative when they were suddenly attacked by Natsu and Gajeel. The four mages then exchange attacks; however, the audience watches in shock as the Fairy Tail Dragon Slayers overpower the Saber Tooth Dragon Slayers. Unable to keep themselves on par with their adversaries, Sting activates 'White Drive' while Rogue powers up using 'Shadow Drive'.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 174\n| Title           = Four Dragons\n| TranslitTitle   = Yonin no Doragon\n| NativeTitle     = \u56db\u4eba\u306e{{ruby|\u7adc|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3}}\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|3|23}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = The tag battle continues, with Sting and Rogue beginning to attack Natsu and Gajeel with their powers being increased. After receiving heavy blows from the Saber Tooth Dragon Slayers, Natsu and Gajeel manages to hold them off, thus forcing Sting and Rogue to activate \"Dragon Force\" on their own will, to the shock of the Fairy Tail audience. Sting decides to finish the Fairy Tail Dragon Slayers alone, for he held a promise to his Exceed friend Lector many years ago. As the three mages fight, the tide turns in favor of Sting as he unleashes a powerful attack on Natsu and Gajeel, resulting in the collapse of the arena floor, and after a hand-to-hand combat underground, Sting was seemingly the victor of the match. However, the Fairy Tail duo stands up, comments on Sting\u2019s strength, and argues about his position while attacking, thereby causing Natsu to drag Gajeel on a mining cart and send it away. While Gajeel is left incapacitated due to motion sickness, Natsu challenges the Twin Dragons of Saber Tooth alone, in retribution to what Sting did earlier on them.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Fairy Tail (season 6)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 175\n| Title           = Natsu vs. the Twin Dragons\n| TranslitTitle   = Natsu vs. S\u014dry\u016b\n| NativeTitle     = \u30ca\u30c4 vs. \u53cc\u7adc\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|3|30}}\n| AltDate         = \u2014\n| ShortSummary    = The tag battle of the Dragon Slayers comes to a close, with Natsu overpowering the combined attacks of Sting and Rogue. The Saber Tooth members watch in dismay, while Ziemma seethes in anger over the defeat of the Twin Dragons, frightening the nearby spectators away. The rest of Fairy Tail celebrates in joy as its team receives 10 points, finally surpassing Team Saber Tooth by a single point. Meanwhile, Gajeel, back to his senses after being dragged by Natsu into a cart earlier, stumbles upon a cave full of dragon skeletons. During that night, Jellal manages to corner the source of the dark aura, standing in disbelief at the identity of the stranger.\n| LineColor       = \n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===General===\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/fairytail/episodes/episodes13/ |title=Episodes 151-162 |publisher=TV Tokyo |language=Japanese |access-date=February 7, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219024842/http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/fairytail/episodes/episodes13/ |archive-date=February 19, 2013 |df= }}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/fairytail/episodes/episodes14/ |title=Episodes 163-175 |publisher=TV Tokyo |language=Japanese |access-date=February 7, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221002804/http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/fairytail/episodes/episodes14/ |archive-date=February 21, 2013 |df= }}\n\n===Specific===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Fairy Tail}}\n\n\n[[Category:Fairy Tail seasons|6]]\n[[Category:2012 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:2013 Japanese television seasons]]\n", "name_user": "King Marcus XXV", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEpisode list:Grammar.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_Tail_(season_6)"}

He also has been an integral part of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] organization, dating back to the team's first tenure in LA<ref name= profootballweekly/>\n\n==Early career==\nFaulkner served in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] during World War II, then married Betty Lou Mackey in 1946.  Playing the first of two seasons at linebacker for [[Miami University]] under head coach [[Sid Gillman]] proved to be a boon to Faulkner's future.  When Gillman was hired as head coach at the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1949, he brought Faulkner along and spent the next six seasons in that position with the Bearcats.\n\nIn January 1955, Gillman moved into the professional ranks when he was hired as head coach of the [[Los Angeles Rams]], with the mentor again asking Faulkner to join him.  The pair spent five years trying to return the team to its early success in the decade and reached the NFL Championship game in their first year.  However, by 1959, the team had slumped to a 2-10 record, with Gillman announcing his resignation at the end of the season.\n\nWhen Gillman accepted the head coaching reins of the fledgling [[Los Angeles Chargers]] of the [[American Football League|AFL]] on January 7, 1960, he hired Faulkner two weeks later.  The team won two conference championships, but fell short in both title games against the [[Houston Oilers]].  Faulkner's defense in 1961 was outstanding, with the Chargers (who now resided in [[San Diego]]) intercepting a professional record 49 opposing passes.\n\n==Broncos head coach==\nThat success resulted in Faulkner being hired as head coach of the Broncos on February 1, 1962.  He then added the title of general manager when [[Dean Griffing]] was fired five months later, and after Faulkner took over, the team made two prominent efforts to change its image.  The first involved switching the team's colors from its original brown and gold to the fondly remembered orange, blue and white, while the latter involved the public burning of the team's vertically striped socks in July. The socks had been roundly criticized and remain a part of dubious lore in professional football history.  In later years, to commemorate the team's history, Faulkner sent one of the only socks left that was saved from the fire to the Pro Football Hame of Fame .\n \nAfter starting the season with a 6-1 record, the team collapsed by going in reverse during the second half of the season and finishing with a 7-7 record.  Despite the slide, Faulkner was named [[American Football League|AFL]] [[NFL Coach of the Year Award|Coach of the Year]].\n \nThat signing would be one of the last positive developments for Faulkner in Denver as he started to reshape the roster, getting rid of many of the team's veterans, including quarterback [[Frank Tripucka]].  These moves would prove disastrous when the team, lacking a consistent signal caller, dropped to 2-11-1 on the year.  The frustration of the campaign exploded in the season finale on December 22 when Gillman's powerhouse Chargers defeated Denver 58-20.  Faulkner accused his good friend of running up the score, with San Diego scoring a touchdown in the final minute, then going for two points before trying an onside kick with six seconds left.  Though the controversy put a strain on the two coaches' friendship for a brief time their lifelong camaraderie was never questioned.\n\nWhen the team lost their first four games in the 1964 season,  Faulkner was fired on October 4, 1964, and replaced by [[Mac Speedie]], with his final record at 10-21-1.  However, following the 6-1 start two years earlier, Faulkner's team had managed only a 4-20-1 mark.  Unfortunately the Broncos never would achieve real success until a decade or more later with another rookie head coach at the helm, Red Miller, who led them to their very first playoff appearance.\n\n==Later career==\nOn January 22, 1965, Faulkner was hired as defensive backs coach of the [[Minnesota Vikings]] under [[Norm Van Brocklin]], who had played quarterback with the Rams during Faulkner's tenure.  The changing Northern climate had a major effect on the allergies of Faulkner's three-year-old son Jon, forcing him to resign after just one season before accepting a scouting position with the Rams.\n\nAfter one season in that capacity, Faulkner went back to coaching as defensive backs assistant with the expansion [[New Orleans Saints]] under another former Ram, [[Tom Fears]].  After one year, Faulkner was promoted to defensive coordinator, but the continuing futility of the team resulted in Fears' dismissal midway through the [[1970 NFL season]].  By that time, Faulkner had shifted to the team's front office, serving as player personnel director after the rigors of coaching had resulted in an ulcer.  Before leaving the Saints for greener pastures once again in Los Angeles, Faulkner's last act with the Saints was to sign to the team a new quarterback whose last name still resonates in the NFL, [[Archie Manning]].\n\nOn March 16, 1971, Faulkner joined the Rams for a third time, again becoming a scout for the team.  Upon the arrival of new head coach [[Chuck Knox]] and long time friend two years later, Faulkner moved back into the coaching ranks again, serving seven seasons as the team's defensive line coach.  During this stretch, the team played in five [[NFC Championship game]]s, finally winning the 1979 contest to compete in [[Super Bowl XIV]].<ref name= profootballweekly/>\n\nFollowing that appearance, Faulkner left the coaching ranks for good and became the team's assistant general manager.  That position quickly evolved into Director of Football Operations which allowed him to best use his talents as a renowned evaluator of football talent.  He served in that capacity up through the late 1990s when his title evolved into Director of Pro Personnel responsible for evaluating the team's opponents and devising the weekly game plans with the coaching staff.\n\nWhen the franchise shifted to [[St. Louis]] following the [[1994 NFL season]], Faulkner was one of the few staff members to stay in [[California]].  With Rams offices still based in Los Angeles he continued his work with the team all the way up to his death in 2008.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Denver Broncos coach navbox}}\n{{Denver Broncos general manager navbox}}\n{{1967 New Orleans Saints}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Faulkner, Jack}}\n[[Category:1926 births]]\n[[Category:2008 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burials at Pacific View Memorial Park]]\n[[Category:Cincinnati Bearcats football coaches]]\n[[Category:Denver Broncos head coaches]]\n[[Category:Denver Broncos executives]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Rams coaches]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Rams executives]]\n[[Category:Miami RedHawks football players]]\n[[Category:Minnesota Vikings coaches]]\n[[Category:New Orleans Saints coaches]]\n[[Category:San Diego Chargers coaches]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Rams executives]]\n[[Category:National Football League general managers]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Youngstown, Ohio]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{one source|date=June 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2008}}\n}}\n{{Infobox NFL biography\n| name                = Jack Faulkner\n| image               = \n| image_size          = \n| alt                 = \n| caption             = \n| birth_date          = {{Birth date|1926|4|4}}\n| birth_place         = [[Youngstown, Ohio]]\n| death_date          = {{Death date and age|2008|9|28|1926|4|4}}\n| death_place         = [[Newport Beach, California]]\n| high_school         = \n| college             = \n| pastcoaching        = \n* [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] (1961)<br>Defensive backs coach\n* [[Denver Broncos]] (1962\u20131964)<br>Head coach\n* [[Minnesota Vikings]] (1965)<br>Defensive backs coach\n* [[New Orleans Saints]] (1968\u20131969)<br>Defensive coordinator\n* [[Los Angeles Rams]] (1979)<br>Offensive backfield coach\n| pastexecutive       =\n* Denver Broncos (1962\u20131964)<br>General manager\n* New Orleans Saints (1970)<br>Director of player personnel\n* Los Angeles Rams (1980\u20131993)<br>Director of football operations\n| highlights          = \n| regular_record      = \n| playoff_record      = \n| overall_record      = \n| pfrcoach            = \n}}\n\n'''Jack Faulkner''' (April 4, 1926 \u2013 September 28, 2008)<ref name= profootballweekly>{{Cite web |url=http://www.profootballweekly.com/PFW/NFL/NFC/NFC+West/St.+Louis/Features/2008/holbrook092908.htm |title=Profootballweekly.com |access-date=2008-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120151126/http://www.profootballweekly.com/PFW/NFL/NFC/NFC+West/St.+Louis/Features/2008/holbrook092908.htm |archive-date=2008-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> was an [[American football]] coach and administrator who most prominently served as head coach of the [[American Football League]]'s [[Denver Broncos]] from 1962 to 1964.

Geographically in the [[Mu Ko Samui|Chumphon Archipelago]], it is part of [[Surat Thani Province]], though as of 2012, Ko Samui was granted municipal status and thus is now locally self-governing.

Or it may derive from the name of a [[Micromelum minutum|tree]] known locally in [[Southern Thai language|southern Thailand]] as \u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e38\u0e22 (full name \u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e22). A third possibility is that it originated from early Hainanese traders to Samui. In Hainanese Chinese, \u0e40\u0e0b\u0e48\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e22 means 'first island', 'barrier', or 'gate', or literally 'beautiful beach'. <ref name=TP/>As it was their first port of call in Thailand, it became its name and evolved over time to \u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e22. Some people believe that the word \"samui\" derives from the Malay word ''saboey'', or 'safe haven'. There is no firm corroboration of any of these theories.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e32\u0e21\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e21\u0e32\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30 \u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e22|language=thai|trans-title=Origin of the name of Ko Samui|url=http://www.komchadluek.net/news/local/25143|website=komchadluek.net|accessdate=2018-12-30|date=2009-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230181030/http://www.komchadluek.net/news/local/25143|archive-date=2018-12-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Ko'' is the Thai word for \"island\". \n\nUntil the late-20th century, Ko Samui was an isolated self-sufficient community, having little connection with the mainland of Thailand. The island was without roads until the early 1970s, and the 15&nbsp;km journey from one side of the island to the other could involve a whole-day trek through the mountainous central jungles.\n\nKo Samui's economy now is based primarily on a successful tourist industry, as well as exports of [[coconut]] and [[rubber]].\n\nEconomic growth has brought not only prosperity, but also major changes to the island's environment and culture.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Levy|first1=Adrian|last2=Scott-Clark|first2=Cathy|title=Danger in paradise|

conversion of the municipality into a special administrative area with greater powers of self-governance similar to [[Pattaya]] has been discussed since 2008, but as of 2018 no action has been taken.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Sunrise thailand ko samui.jpg|thumb|right|Sunrise, Ko Samui]]\n\nKo Samui is in the [[Gulf of Thailand]], about 35&nbsp;km northeast of Surat Thani town (9\u00b0N, 100\u00b0E). It is the most significant island in the [[List of islands of Thailand|Chumphon Archipelago]]. The island measures some 25&nbsp;km at its widest point. To the north are the populated resort islands of Ko Pha-ngan, Ko Tao, and Ko Nang Yuan. Close to Bangrak in northeast Samui is the small uninhabited island of Ko Som, and to the northeast of Chaweng is the tiny Ko Matlang. To the south are Ko Taen and Ko Matsum, each of which have small tourist facilities. To the far west are 44 other islands which together compose [[Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park]] which is accessible by a day-trip boat tour from Ko Samui.\n\nThe central part of Ko Samui is mostly tropical jungle, including its largest mountain, Khao Pom, peaking at 635 meters. The various lowland and coastal areas are connected by Route 4169, which is a 51 kilometre-long road, encircling the island. Many other concrete roads branch off from Route 4169 to service other areas.\n\nOn the west coast of the island is the original capital, Nathon, which still houses many government offices, as well as two of the island's five major piers. Nathon is the major port for fisheries and for vehicular and goods transportation from the mainland. As the site of the main port and the closest city to the mainland has made Nathon the commercial centre for Samui locals. More recently, the transition from dependence on the local coconut industry along with the continued growth and development of the tourist industry, as well as the northeastern location of the airport, has led to the increase of commercial activity in Chaweng and Bophut.\n\n==Climate==\nKo Samui has a [[tropical savanna climate]] according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. The island has a [[dry season]] month, with the average monthly precipitation in February falling below {{convert|60|mm|0|abbr=on}}, the threshold for a tropical dry season month. The temperature is well above the threshold of 18 degrees Celsius year round, indeed closer to an average temperature of 28 degrees. The climate is warm and humid for most of the year. In comparison to [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] and most of the rest of southern Thailand, Samui's weather is relatively drier (Samui receives about 1,960&nbsp;mm rain per year, Phuket {{convert|2,220|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Phuket's [[wet season]] is spread over six to eight months. Ko Samui has only two months with more than {{convert|212|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain). The heaviest precipitation typically falls in the months of October and November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelfish.org/weather_fish.php |title=Weather in Thailand |publisher=Travelfish.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> For the rest of the year, given the tropical climate, rain showers are brief; 20\u201360 minutes duration is typical.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Ko Samui (1981\u20132010)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 33.4\n|Feb record high C = 33.9\n|Mar record high C = 35.4\n|Apr record high C = 36.5\n|May record high C = 36.3\n|Jun record high C = 36.2\n|Jul record high C = 36.0\n|Aug record high C = 35.8\n|Sep record high C = 35.4\n|Oct record high C = 34.1\n|Nov record high C = 34.0\n|Dec record high C = 32.3\n|year record high C = 36.5\n|Jan high C = 29.0\n|Feb high C = 29.4\n|Mar high C = 30.6\n|Apr high C = 32.0\n|May high C = 32.6\n|Jun high C = 32.5\n|Jul high C = 32.2\n|Aug high C = 32.1\n|Sep high C = 31.7\n|Oct high C = 30.5\n|Nov high C = 29.6\n|Dec high C = 29.2\n|year high C = 31.0\n|Jan mean C = 26.8\n|Feb mean C = 27.4\n|Mar mean C = 28.2\n|Apr mean C = 29.1\n|May mean C = 28.9\n|Jun mean C = 28.7\n|Jul mean C = 28.3\n|Aug mean C = 28.2\n|Sep mean C = 27.9\n|Oct mean C = 27.2\n|Nov mean C = 26.8\n|Dec mean C = 26.6\n|year mean C = 27.8\n|Jan low C = 24.2\n|Feb low C = 25.0\n|Mar low C = 25.6\n|Apr low C = 26.1\n|May low C = 25.7\n|Jun low C = 25.5\n|Jul low C = 25.1\n|Aug low C = 25.2\n|Sep low C = 24.8\n|Oct low C = 24.3\n|Nov low C = 24.1\n|Dec low C = 23.9\n|year low C = 25.0\n|Jan record low C = 18.6\n|Feb record low C = 19.5\n|Mar record low C = 21.0\n|Apr record low C = 22.0\n|May record low C = 22.1\n|Jun record low C = 20.6\n|Jul record low C = 19.9\n|Aug record low C = 21.7\n|Sep record low C = 19.4\n|Oct record low C = 21.4\n|Nov record low C = 20.3\n|Dec record low C = 18.8\n|year record low C = 18.6\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 86.2\n|Feb rain mm = 54.4\n|Mar rain mm = 80.8\n|Apr rain mm = 83.1\n|May rain mm = 155.9\n|Jun rain mm = 124.1\n|Jul rain mm = 116.3\n|Aug rain mm = 110.9\n|Sep rain mm = 121.7\n|Oct rain mm = 309.8\n|Nov rain mm = 506.6\n|Dec rain mm = 210.3\n|year rain mm = 1960.1\n|Jan rain days = 11.0\n|Feb rain days = 5.6\n|Mar rain days = 5.9\n|Apr rain days = 8.6\n|May rain days = 15.6\n|Jun rain days = 13.7\n|Jul rain days = 14.4\n|Aug rain days = 15.2\n|Sep rain days = 16.2\n|Oct rain days = 19.6\n|Nov rain days = 19.2\n|Dec rain days = 13.7\n|year rain days = 158.7\n|Jan humidity = 83\n|Feb humidity = 82\n|Mar humidity = 82\n|Apr humidity = 81\n|May humidity = 80\n|Jun humidity = 78\n|Jul humidity = 78\n|Aug humidity = 78\n|Sep humidity = 80\n|Oct humidity = 85\n|Nov humidity = 85\n|Dec humidity = 82\n|year humidity = 81\n|Jan sun = 198.4\n|Feb sun = 214.7\n|Mar sun = 238.7\n|Apr sun = 201.0\n|May sun = 192.2\n|Jun sun = 150.0\n|Jul sun = 155.0\n|Aug sun = 151.9\n|Sep sun = 144.0\n|Oct sun = 145.7\n|Nov sun = 174.0\n|Dec sun = 176.7\n|year sun = \n|Jand sun = 6.4\n|Febd sun = 7.6\n|Mard sun = 7.7\n|Aprd sun = 6.7\n|Mayd sun = 6.2\n|Jund sun = 5.0\n|Juld sun = 5.0\n|Augd sun = 4.9\n|Sepd sun = 4.8\n|Octd sun = 4.7\n|Novd sun = 5.8\n|Decd sun = 5.7\n|yeard sun = 5.9\n|source 1 = Thai Meteorological Department<ref name=TMD1>{{cite web\n| url = http://climate.tmd.go.th/content/file/75\n| title = Climatological Data for the Period 1981\u20132010\n| publisher = Thai Meteorological Department\n| page = 23\n| accessdate = 7 August 2016}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Office of Water Management and Hydrology, Royal Irrigation Department (sun and humidity)<ref name=RID>{{cite web\n| url = http://water.rid.go.th/hwm/cropwater/CWRdata/ETo/ETo_PenMon_2554.pdf\n| title = \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e32\u0e13\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e07\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e27\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07 Penman Monteith (Reference Crop Evapotranspiration by Penman Monteith)\n| publisher = Office of Water Management and Hydrology, Royal Irrigation Department \n| page = 108\n| language = Thai\n| accessdate = 7 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==Administration==\nKo Samui is an [[amphoe]] (district) of [[Surat Thani Province]], divided into seven sub-districts (''[[tambon]]s'') and 39 administrative villages (''[[muban]]s'').

Due to its use of locally produced palm leaves and a natural, open-air cooling system, the terminal complex received an Environment Impact Assessment Award under the guidance of [[Prasert Prasarttong-Osoth]]. Ko Samui airport is built in an open style, drawing connections between it and traditional Thai architecture.

Public buses to all parts of the mainland operate from a new bus station north of Nathon.  Privately operated [[songthaew]]s circle the ring road like a bus service with fixed fees mostly only in the daytime, and private taxis which charged a fixed, flat fee depending on the destination.{{CN|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Tourism==\nThe expansion of tourism in Ko Samui has resulted in growth of building resorts, bungalows, and luxury private villas on the island. The island's total inventory of 17,479 hotel rooms in 2013 will be augmented by an additional 459 new rooms by 2015. A gradual shift in demand is seeing more Asian visitors and families, but the top three source markets have been Germany, the UK, and Thailand, which contribute a combined 27 percent share. Bangkok Airways continues to modernise its fleet with new Airbuses, phasing out older ATR 72 propeller planes, which will provide 189,000 additional airline seats for Samui travelers. Bangkok Airways has already increased the number of daily flights from 36 to 50.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centreforaviation.com/analysis/reports/bangkok-airways-part-2-plans-for-further-network-fleet--partnership-portfolio-expansion-for-2016-256648|title=Bangkok Airways Part 2: Plans for further network, fleet & partnership portfolio expansion for 2016|website=CAPA - Centre for Aviation|accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe island received more than 2.5 million foreign visitors in 2017, up from 2.34 million in 2016.

The problem started on Samui in 2008 when the incinerator stopped being operable, a problem that is yet to be solved. With approximately 150 tonnes of garbage being produced on the island each day from households and tourist-related establishments the problem is growing at an alarming rate.\n\n==Events and festivals==\n*Buffalo Fighting Festival: One of the best-known festivals on Ko Samui is the Buffalo Fighting Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Buffalo Fight Festival|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/21296_info_buffalo-fight-festival.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150129171816/http://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/21296_info_buffalo-fight-festival.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 January 2015|website=Bangkok Post Travel|publisher=Bangkok Post|accessdate=12 Feb 2015}}</ref> which is held on special occasions such as New Year's Day and [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]]. Unlike Spanish bullfighting, the fighting on Ko Samui is fairly harmless. The fighting season varies according to some ancient customs and ceremonies. The buffalo are decorated with ribbons and gold-painted leaves. Before the contest, which lasts just two rounds, monks spray the buffalos with holy water.\n\n*Samui Regatta: The Samui Regatta is a sailing tournament held every year. The tournament is internationally known and competitors come from as far away as Australia, Singapore, Japan, and China. The event began in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Samui Regatta|url=http://www.samuiregatta.com/home|website=Samui Regatta|accessdate=12 February 2015}}{{Primary source inline|date=June 2019}}</ref>\n\n*Ten Stars Samui Art Party: A recurring cultural event bringing together art lovers, local Thai and international artists, and their artwork.

Or it may derive from the name of a [[Micromelum minutum|tree]] known locally in [[Southern Thai language|southern Thailand]] as \u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e38\u0e22 (full name \u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e22). A third possibility is that it originated from early Hainanese traders to Samui. In Hainanese Chinese, \u0e40\u0e0b\u0e48\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e22 means 'first island', 'barrier', or 'gate', or literally 'beautiful beach'. <ref name=TP/>As it was their first port of call in Thailand, it became its name and evolved over time to \u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e22. Some people believe that the word \"samui\" derives from the Malay word ''saboey'', or 'safe haven'. There is no firm corroboration of any of these theories.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e32\u0e21\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e21\u0e32\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30 \u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e22|language=thai|trans-title=Origin of the name of Ko Samui|url=http://www.komchadluek.net/news/local/25143|website=komchadluek.net|accessdate=2018-12-30|date=2009-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230181030/http://www.komchadluek.net/news/local/25143|archive-date=2018-12-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Ko'' is the Thai word for \"island\". \n\nUntil the late-20th century, Ko Samui was an isolated self-sufficient community, having little connection with the mainland of Thailand. The island was without roads until the early 1970s, and the 15&nbsp;km journey from one side of the island to the other could involve a whole-day trek through the mountainous central jungles.\n\nKo Samui's economy now is based primarily on a successful tourist industry, as well as exports of [[coconut]] and [[rubber]].\n\nEconomic growth has brought not only prosperity, but also major changes to the island's environment and culture.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Levy|first1=Adrian|last2=Scott-Clark|first2=Cathy|title=Danger in paradise|

conversion of the municipality into a special administrative area with greater powers of self-governance similar to [[Pattaya]] has been discussed since 2008, but as of 2018 no action has been taken.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Sunrise thailand ko samui.jpg|thumb|right|Sunrise, Ko Samui]]\n\nKo Samui is in the [[Gulf of Thailand]], about 35&nbsp;km northeast of Surat Thani town (9\u00b0N, 100\u00b0E). It is the most significant island in the [[List of islands of Thailand|Chumphon Archipelago]]. The island measures some 25&nbsp;km at its widest point. To the north are the populated resort islands of Ko Pha-ngan, Ko Tao, and Ko Nang Yuan. Close to Bangrak in northeast Samui is the small uninhabited island of Ko Som, and to the northeast of Chaweng is the tiny Ko Matlang. To the south are Ko Taen and Ko Matsum, each of which have small tourist facilities. To the far west are 44 other islands which together compose [[Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park]] which is accessible by a day-trip boat tour from Ko Samui.\n\nThe central part of Ko Samui is mostly tropical jungle, including its largest mountain, Khao Pom, peaking at 635 meters. The various lowland and coastal areas are connected by Route 4169, which is a 51 kilometre-long road, encircling the island. Many other concrete roads branch off from Route 4169 to service other areas.\n\nOn the west coast of the island is the original capital, Nathon, which still houses many government offices, as well as two of the island's five major piers. Nathon is the major port for fisheries and for vehicular and goods transportation from the mainland. As the site of the main port and the closest city to the mainland has made Nathon the commercial centre for Samui locals. More recently, the transition from dependence on the local coconut industry along with the continued growth and development of the tourist industry, as well as the northeastern location of the airport, has led to the increase of commercial activity in Chaweng and Bophut.\n\n==Climate==\nKo Samui has a [[tropical savanna climate]] according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]. The island has a [[dry season]] month, with the average monthly precipitation in February falling below {{convert|60|mm|0|abbr=on}}, the threshold for a tropical dry season month. The temperature is well above the threshold of 18 degrees Celsius year round, indeed closer to an average temperature of 28 degrees. The climate is warm and humid for most of the year. In comparison to [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] and most of the rest of southern Thailand, Samui's weather is relatively drier (Samui receives about 1,960&nbsp;mm rain per year, Phuket {{convert|2,220|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Phuket's [[wet season]] is spread over six to eight months. Ko Samui has only two months with more than {{convert|212|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain). The heaviest precipitation typically falls in the months of October and November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelfish.org/weather_fish.php |title=Weather in Thailand |publisher=Travelfish.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> For the rest of the year, given the tropical climate, rain showers are brief; 20\u201360 minutes duration is typical.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Ko Samui (1981\u20132010)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 33.4\n|Feb record high C = 33.9\n|Mar record high C = 35.4\n|Apr record high C = 36.5\n|May record high C = 36.3\n|Jun record high C = 36.2\n|Jul record high C = 36.0\n|Aug record high C = 35.8\n|Sep record high C = 35.4\n|Oct record high C = 34.1\n|Nov record high C = 34.0\n|Dec record high C = 32.3\n|year record high C = 36.5\n|Jan high C = 29.0\n|Feb high C = 29.4\n|Mar high C = 30.6\n|Apr high C = 32.0\n|May high C = 32.6\n|Jun high C = 32.5\n|Jul high C = 32.2\n|Aug high C = 32.1\n|Sep high C = 31.7\n|Oct high C = 30.5\n|Nov high C = 29.6\n|Dec high C = 29.2\n|year high C = 31.0\n|Jan mean C = 26.8\n|Feb mean C = 27.4\n|Mar mean C = 28.2\n|Apr mean C = 29.1\n|May mean C = 28.9\n|Jun mean C = 28.7\n|Jul mean C = 28.3\n|Aug mean C = 28.2\n|Sep mean C = 27.9\n|Oct mean C = 27.2\n|Nov mean C = 26.8\n|Dec mean C = 26.6\n|year mean C = 27.8\n|Jan low C = 24.2\n|Feb low C = 25.0\n|Mar low C = 25.6\n|Apr low C = 26.1\n|May low C = 25.7\n|Jun low C = 25.5\n|Jul low C = 25.1\n|Aug low C = 25.2\n|Sep low C = 24.8\n|Oct low C = 24.3\n|Nov low C = 24.1\n|Dec low C = 23.9\n|year low C = 25.0\n|Jan record low C = 18.6\n|Feb record low C = 19.5\n|Mar record low C = 21.0\n|Apr record low C = 22.0\n|May record low C = 22.1\n|Jun record low C = 20.6\n|Jul record low C = 19.9\n|Aug record low C = 21.7\n|Sep record low C = 19.4\n|Oct record low C = 21.4\n|Nov record low C = 20.3\n|Dec record low C = 18.8\n|year record low C = 18.6\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 86.2\n|Feb rain mm = 54.4\n|Mar rain mm = 80.8\n|Apr rain mm = 83.1\n|May rain mm = 155.9\n|Jun rain mm = 124.1\n|Jul rain mm = 116.3\n|Aug rain mm = 110.9\n|Sep rain mm = 121.7\n|Oct rain mm = 309.8\n|Nov rain mm = 506.6\n|Dec rain mm = 210.3\n|year rain mm = 1960.1\n|Jan rain days = 11.0\n|Feb rain days = 5.6\n|Mar rain days = 5.9\n|Apr rain days = 8.6\n|May rain days = 15.6\n|Jun rain days = 13.7\n|Jul rain days = 14.4\n|Aug rain days = 15.2\n|Sep rain days = 16.2\n|Oct rain days = 19.6\n|Nov rain days = 19.2\n|Dec rain days = 13.7\n|year rain days = 158.7\n|Jan humidity = 83\n|Feb humidity = 82\n|Mar humidity = 82\n|Apr humidity = 81\n|May humidity = 80\n|Jun humidity = 78\n|Jul humidity = 78\n|Aug humidity = 78\n|Sep humidity = 80\n|Oct humidity = 85\n|Nov humidity = 85\n|Dec humidity = 82\n|year humidity = 81\n|Jan sun = 198.4\n|Feb sun = 214.7\n|Mar sun = 238.7\n|Apr sun = 201.0\n|May sun = 192.2\n|Jun sun = 150.0\n|Jul sun = 155.0\n|Aug sun = 151.9\n|Sep sun = 144.0\n|Oct sun = 145.7\n|Nov sun = 174.0\n|Dec sun = 176.7\n|year sun = \n|Jand sun = 6.4\n|Febd sun = 7.6\n|Mard sun = 7.7\n|Aprd sun = 6.7\n|Mayd sun = 6.2\n|Jund sun = 5.0\n|Juld sun = 5.0\n|Augd sun = 4.9\n|Sepd sun = 4.8\n|Octd sun = 4.7\n|Novd sun = 5.8\n|Decd sun = 5.7\n|yeard sun = 5.9\n|source 1 = Thai Meteorological Department<ref name=TMD1>{{cite web\n| url = http://climate.tmd.go.th/content/file/75\n| title = Climatological Data for the Period 1981\u20132010\n| publisher = Thai Meteorological Department\n| page = 23\n| accessdate = 7 August 2016}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Office of Water Management and Hydrology, Royal Irrigation Department (sun and humidity)<ref name=RID>{{cite web\n| url = http://water.rid.go.th/hwm/cropwater/CWRdata/ETo/ETo_PenMon_2554.pdf\n| title = \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e32\u0e13\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e07\u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e27\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07 Penman Monteith (Reference Crop Evapotranspiration by Penman Monteith)\n| publisher = Office of Water Management and Hydrology, Royal Irrigation Department \n| page = 108\n| language = Thai\n| accessdate = 7 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==Administration==\nKo Samui is an [[amphoe]] (district) of [[Surat Thani Province]], divided into seven sub-districts (''[[tambon]]s'') and 39 administrative villages (''[[muban]]s'').

Due to its use of locally produced palm leaves and a natural, open-air cooling system, the terminal complex received an Environment Impact Assessment Award under the guidance of [[Prasert Prasarttong-Osoth]]. Ko Samui airport is built in an open style, drawing connections between it and traditional Thai architecture. In 2009, the airport handled 1.3 million passengers and 17,707 aircraft operations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Koh Samui Airport, Thailand|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/koh-samui/|work=airport-technology.com|publisher=Kable|accessdate=18 Jan 2014|year=2013}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}</ref> The airport is now additionally served by [[Thai Airways International]] to [[Bangkok]], [[Firefly (airline)|Firefly Airlines]] to Kuala Lumpur and Penang, and [[SilkAir]] to [[Singapore]].\n \nFlights from Samui to Phuket and other Thai destinations are available, and in 2012, the Thai government announced the possibility of a second Ko Samui airport due to complaints of high airport fees.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/289233/samui-may-get-second-airport |title=Samui may get second airport|work=Bangkok Post |date=2012-04-18 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref>\n\nSeveral ferries connect the island with the mainland, including two car/passenger ferries, and connect Don Sak to piers in the west of the island, in Lipa Noi and in [[Nathon]]. Public buses to all parts of the mainland operate from a new bus station north of Nathon.  Privately operated [[songthaew]]s circle the ring road like a bus service with fixed fees mostly only in the daytime, and private taxis which charged a fixed, flat fee depending on the destination.{{CN|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Tourism==\nThe expansion of tourism in Ko Samui has resulted in growth of building resorts, bungalows, and luxury private villas on the island. The island's total inventory of 17,479 hotel rooms in 2013 will be augmented by an additional 459 new rooms by 2015. A gradual shift in demand is seeing more Asian visitors and families, but the top three source markets have been Germany, the UK, and Thailand, which contribute a combined 27 percent share. Bangkok Airways continues to modernise its fleet with new Airbuses, phasing out older ATR 72 propeller planes, which will provide 189,000 additional airline seats for Samui travelers. Bangkok Airways has already increased the number of daily flights from 36 to 50.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centreforaviation.com/analysis/reports/bangkok-airways-part-2-plans-for-further-network-fleet--partnership-portfolio-expansion-for-2016-256648|title=Bangkok Airways Part 2: Plans for further network, fleet & partnership portfolio expansion for 2016|website=CAPA - Centre for Aviation|accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe island received more than 2.5 million foreign visitors in 2017, up from 2.34 million in 2016.

They, and residents, generate 250,000 [[tonne]]s of solid waste per year, straining island infrastructure. Wastewater treatment also poses a challenge. Ko Samui has only three wastewater treatments plants, in Chaweng, Lamai, and Mae Nam, to handle the effluent from 2,000 hotels and restaurants. Plans to build more plants has been stymied by lack of funding.<ref name=\"BP-20180408\">{{cite news|last1=Chaolan|first1=Supapong|last2=Wipatayotin|first2=Apinya|title=Islands seek clean break from trail of tourist trash|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/1442782/islands-seek-clean-break-from-trail-of-tourist-trash|accessdate=9 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, Samui is experiencing a serious garbage disposal issue. It is being said that the main garbage pile located not far from airport has reached over 250,000 tons in volume, and is the same height as a three-story building. The problem started on Samui in 2008 when the incinerator stopped being operable, a problem that is yet to be solved. With approximately 150 tonnes of garbage being produced on the island each day from households and tourist-related establishments the problem is growing at an alarming rate.\n\n==Events and festivals==\n*Buffalo Fighting Festival: One of the best-known festivals on Ko Samui is the Buffalo Fighting Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Buffalo Fight Festival|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/21296_info_buffalo-fight-festival.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150129171816/http://www.bangkokpost.com/travel/21296_info_buffalo-fight-festival.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 January 2015|website=Bangkok Post Travel|publisher=Bangkok Post|accessdate=12 Feb 2015}}</ref> which is held on special occasions such as New Year's Day and [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]]. Unlike Spanish bullfighting, the fighting on Ko Samui is fairly harmless. The fighting season varies according to some ancient customs and ceremonies. The buffalo are decorated with ribbons and gold-painted leaves. Before the contest, which lasts just two rounds, monks spray the buffalos with holy water.\n\n*Samui Regatta: The Samui Regatta is a sailing tournament held every year.

The items having been ''pawned'' to the broker are themselves called [[pledge (law)|''pledges'' or ''pawns'']], or simply the collateral. While many items can be pawned, pawnshops typically accept jewelry, musical instruments, home audio equipment, computers, video game systems, coins, gold, silver, televisions, cameras, power tools, firearms, and other relatively valuable items as collateral.\n\n[[File:Pawnbroker's sign, Camden High Street, London.JPG|thumb|A [[London]] shop displays the traditional pawnbroker's sign.]]\n\nIf an item is pawned for a loan (colloquially \"hocked\" or \"popped\"<ref>{{cite OED|pop}}</ref>), within a certain contractual period of time the pawner may redeem it for the amount of the loan plus some agreed-upon amount for [[interest]]. The amount of time, and rate of interest, is governed by law and by the pawnbroker's policies. If the loan is not paid (or extended, if applicable) within the time period, the pawned item will be offered for sale to other customers by the pawnbroker. Unlike other lenders, the pawnbroker does not report the defaulted loan on the customer's credit report, since the pawnbroker has physical possession of the item and may recoup the loan value through outright sale of the item. The pawnbroker also sells items that have been sold outright to them by customers. Some pawnshops are willing to trade items in their shop for items brought to them by customers.Can you edit now old royal london properties.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of pawnbroking}}\nIn the west, pawnbroking existed in the Ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Most contemporary [[Western law]] on the subject is derived from the Roman jurisprudence. As the empire spread its culture, pawnbroking went with it. Likewise, in the East, the business model existed in China 1,500 years ago in [[Buddhist_temple|Buddhist monasteries]] no different from today, through the ages strictly regulated by Imperial or other authorities.\n\n[[File:Pawnshop with sign in usa.jpg|thumb|left|Modern pawnbroker storefront.]]\n\nIn spite of early [[Roman Catholic Church]] prohibitions against charging [[interest]] on [[loan]]s, there is some evidence that the [[Franciscans]] were permitted to begin the practice as an aid to the poor. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gregg|first=Samuel|date=2016|title=How Medieval Monks Changed the Face of Banking|journal=American Banker|volume=1 no. 88|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> In 1338, Edward III pawned his jewels to raise money for his war with France. King Henry V did much the same in 1415. The Lombards were not a popular class, and [[Henry VII Tudor|Henry VII]] harried them a good deal. In 1603 an ''Act against Brokers'' was passed and remained on the statute-book until 1872. It was aimed at the many counterfeit brokers in London. This type of broker was evidently regarded as a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]].\n[[File:Provident Loan Society Essex Houston jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Provident Loan Society]] of New York, a charitable pawnbroker]]\n\nCrusaders, predominantly in France, brokered their land holdings to monasteries and diocese for funds to supply, outfit, and transport their armies to the Holy Land. Instead of outright repayment, the Church reaped a certain amount of crop returns for a certain amount of seasons, which could additionally be re-exchanged in a type of equity.\n\nA pawnbroker can also be a charity. In 1450, Barnaba Manassei, a [[Franciscan]] friar, began the Monte di Piet\u00e0 movement in [[Perugia]], Italy. It provided financial assistance in the form of no-interest loans secured with pawned items. Instead of interest, the Monte di Piet\u00e0 urged borrowers to make donations to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]. It spread through Italy, then to other parts of Europe. The first Monte de Piedad organization in Spain was founded in [[Madrid]], and from there the idea was transferred to [[New Spain]] by Pedro Romero de Terreros, the Count of Santa Maria de Regla<ref name=\"Ficachi\">{{cite web|author=Leon Teutli Ficachi |url=http://www.anahuac.mx/clares/archivos/nacionalmontedepiedad.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nacional Monte de Piedad |accessdate=2008-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219125044/http://www.anahuac.mx/clares/archivos/nacionalmontedepiedad.pdf |archivedate=December 19, 2008 }}</ref> and [[Order of Calatrava|Knight of Calatrava]].<ref name=\"EncMex\" /> The [[Nacional Monte de Piedad]] is a charitable institution and pawn shop whose main office is located just off the [[Z\u00f3calo]], or main plaza of [[Mexico City]].

Common items pawned (or, in some instances, sold outright) by customers include [[jewelry]], [[electronics]], collectibles, [[musical instruments]], [[tools]], and (depending on local regulations) [[firearms]]. [[Gold]], [[silver]], and [[platinum]] are popular items\u2014which are often purchased, even if in the form of broken jewelry of little value. Metal can still be sold in bulk to a [[bullion]] dealer or [[smelter]] for the value by weight of the component metals. Similarly, jewelry that contains genuine [[gemstones]], even if broken or missing pieces, have value.\n\nThe pawnbroker assumes the risk that an item might have been stolen. However, laws in many jurisdictions protect both the community and broker from ''unknowingly'' [[handling stolen goods]] (also known as ''fencing''). These laws often require that the pawnbroker establish positive identification of the seller through photo identification (such as a driver's license or government-issued [[identity document]]), as well as a holding period placed on an item purchased by a pawnbroker (to allow time for local law enforcement authorities to track stolen items). In some jurisdictions, pawnshops must give a list of all newly pawned items and any associated serial number to police, so the police can determine if any of the items have been reported stolen. Many police departments advise burglary or robbery victims to visit local pawnshops to see if they can locate stolen items. Some pawnshops set up their own screening criteria to avoid buying stolen property.\n\nThe pawnbroker assesses an item for its condition and marketability by testing the item and examining it for flaws, scratches or other damage. Another aspect that affects marketability is the supply and demand for the item in the community or region. In some markets, the [[used good]]s market is so flooded with used stereos and car stereos, for example, that pawnshops will only accept the higher-quality brand names. Alternatively, a customer may offer to pawn an item that is difficult to sell, such as a surfboard in an inland region, or a pair of snowshoes in warm-winter regions. The pawnshop owner either turns down hard-to-sell items, or offers a low price. While some items never get outdated, such as hammers and hand saws, electronics and computer items quickly become obsolete and unsaleable. Pawnshop owners must learn about different makes and models of computers, software, and other electronic equipment, so they can value objects accurately.\n\nTo assess value of different items, pawnbrokers use guidebooks (\"blue books\"), catalogs, Internet search engines, and their own experience. Some pawnbrokers have trained in identification of gems, or employ a specialist to assess jewelry. One of the risks of accepting secondhand goods is that the item may be counterfeit. If the item is counterfeit, such as a fake [[Rolex]] watch, it may have only a fraction of the value of the genuine item. Once the pawnbroker determines the item is genuine and not likely stolen, and that it is marketable, the pawnbroker offers the customer an amount for it.  The customer can either sell the item outright if (as in most cases) the pawnbroker is also a licensed secondhand dealer, or offer the item as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] on a loan. Most pawnshops are willing to negotiate the amount of the loan with the client.\n\n===Determining amount of loan===\nTo determine the amount of the loan, the pawnshop owner needs to take into account several factors. A key factor is the predicted resale value of the item. This is often thought of in terms of a range, with the low point being the [[wholesale]] value of the used good, in the case that the pawnshop is unable to sell it to pawnshop customers, and they decide to sell it to a wholesale merchant of used goods. The higher point in the range is the retail sale price in the pawnshop. For example, a five-year-old laptop may have been bought by the customer for $1,000. However, as a used item in a pawnshop, it might only fetch $250 as a purchase price in the pawnshop, because the customers will be wary that it might be a [[lemon market|\"lemon\"]] that the seller is getting rid of because it has some hard-to-detect problem, and because pawnshops do not typically offer a warranty with goods sold. Used electronics wholesalers will buy the laptop from the pawnshop owner for $100 to $150. The wholesaler pays a lower price than the retail value because they have the added cost of hiring electronics technicians who overhaul and repair the items so that they can be sold in used electronics stores.\n\nThe pawnshop owner also takes into account their knowledge of [[supply and demand]] for the item in question to determine if they think that they will end up selling the laptop for $100 to a wholesaler or $250 to a pawnshop customer. If the pawnshop owner believes that the local market for used laptops is saturated (overloaded with used laptops), they may fear that they will only get $100 for the laptop if they have to unload it to a wholesaler. With that figure in mind as the expected revenue, the pawnshop owner has to factor in the overhead costs of the store (rent, heat, electricity, phone connection, yellow pages advertisement, website costs, staff costs, insurance, alarm system, items lost when they are confiscated by police, etc.), and a profit for the business. As such, the customer who comes in with this laptop that they paid $1,000 for when it was new may be offered as little as $50 by the pawnshop owner, who is taking into account all of the risk and cost factors.\n\nIn determining the amount of the loan, the pawnshop owner also assesses the likelihood that the customer will pay the interest for several weeks or months and then return to repay the loan and reclaim the item. Since the key to the pawnshop business model is earning interest on the loaned money, pawnshop owners want to accept items that the customer is likely to want to recover, after having paid interest for a period on the loan. If, in an extreme case, a pawnshop only accepted items that customers had no interest in ever reclaiming, it would not make any money from interest, and the store would in effect become a second-hand dealer. Determining if the customer is likely to return to reclaim an item is a subjective decision, and the pawnshop owner may take many factors into account. For example, if a young able-bodied man comes into the pawnshop to pawn an electric wheelchair (perhaps claiming it to be the possession of his late grandparent), the pawnshop owner may doubt that the item will be redeemed. On the other hand, if a middle-aged man pawns a top quality set of golf clubs, the pawnshop owner may assess it as more credible that he will return for the items.  Some customers may attempt to persuade the pawnshop owner that the item in question is important to them (\"that necklace belonged to my grandmother, so I will certainly return for it\") as a means of obtaining a loan.  Other customers return to the same store, repeatedly pawn the same items as a way of borrowing money, and return to pay the interest and recover the items before the end of the loan period; thus, the pawnbroker knows that redemption is likely and will, therefore, make the loan.\n\nThe saleability of the item and the amount that the customer wants for it are also factored into the pawnbroker's assessment; if a customer offers a very salable item at a low price, the pawnbroker may accept it even if it is unlikely that the customer will return, because the pawnshop can turn around a quick profit on the item. However, if a customer offers an extremely low price the pawnbroker may turn down the offer because this suggests that the item may either be counterfeit or stolen.\n\nIn some countries such as Sweden, there is legislation to prevent the pawnbroker from making unfair profits ([[usury]] due to financial distress or ignorance of the customer) at the expense of the customer by low valuations of their collaterals. It is stated that the pawnbroker may not keep the collateral but must sell them at public [[auction]]. Any excess after paying the loan, the interest and auction costs must be paid to the customer. If the item does not fetch a price that will cover these expenses the pawnbroker may keep the item and sell it through other channels. Despite this protection, the cost for the customer to borrow money this way will be high, and if he cannot redeem the collateral it would in many cases be better to sell the goods directly.\n\n[[File:Pawn Shop at Sherman Way & Reseda Blvd., Reseda, CA.JPG|thumb|left|Pawnbroker in [[Reseda, CA]]]]\n\n===Inventory management===\nPawnshops have to be careful to manage how many new items they accept as pawns: either too little inventory or too much is bad. A pawnshop might have too little inventory if, for example, it mostly buys jewels and gold that it resells or smelts\u2014or perhaps the pawnshop owner quickly sells most items through specialty shops (e.g., musical instruments to music stores, stereos to used hi-fi audio stores, etc.). In this case, the pawnshop is less interesting to customers, because it is mostly empty.\n\nOn the other extreme, a pawnshop with a huge inventory has several disadvantages. If the store is crammed with used athletic gear, old stereos, and old tools, the store owner must spend time and money shelving and sorting items, displaying them on different stands or in glass cases, and monitoring customers to prevent [[shoplifting]]. If there are too many low-value, poor quality items, such as old toasters, scratched-up 20-year-old TVs, and worn-out sports gear piled into cardboard boxes, the store may begin to look more like a [[rummage sale]] or [[flea market]].  Small, high-value items such as iPod players or cell phones must be in locked glass display cases, which means the owner may need additional staff to unlock the cabinets for items customers want to examine. As a store fills with items, an owner must protect inventory from theft by hiring staff to supervise the different areas or install security cameras and alarms. Too much unsold inventory means that the store has not been able to realize value from these items to provide cash to lend.\n\nThe better option lies in the middle: a store with a moderate amount of good quality, brand-name items arranged neatly in the display windows attracts passersby, who are more likely to enter and shop. If items are attractively laid out in display cases and shelves, the pawnshop looks more professional and reputable. Once passersby start shopping in the store, they may be more inclined to pawn or sell their own items to the pawnshop. Some pawnshop owners prevent cluttered look by storing overstocked items, or less attractive items such as snow tires, in a backroom or basement. Some pawnshop companies operate a chain of stores in a state or province. This way, they can balance inventory between stores. For example, they can move some of a rural store's surfeit of fishing gear to an urban store.\n\nSome stores also slim down inventory by selling items to speciality retailers. A pawnshop in a low-income neighborhood that pays a customer $300 for a power amplifier with a used value of $2000 may find the unit hard to sell alongside much less expensive merchandise. They may sell the amplifier to a used audio equipment store whose customers expect higher-end equipment. Some pawnshops sell speciality items online, on  [[eBay]] or other websites. A speciality item such as a high-end model railroad set may not sell in the store for its \"blue book\" value. On an online auction, it stands a good chance of bringing a good price.\n\nAnother growing trend in the industry is vehicle pawn or auto pawning. This form of Pawnbroking works like a traditional pawn loan, however, these stores only accept vehicles as security. Many stores are also accepting \"Title Loans\", where you can pawn the ownership or \"Title\" documents of your vehicle. This essentially means that the pawnbroker owns your car while you drive it, and you regain ownership once you pay back your loan.\n\n===Auxiliary operations===\nWhile the main business activities of a pawnshop are lending money for interest based on valuable items that customers bring in, some pawnshops also undertake other business activities, such as selling brand-new retail items that are in demand in the neighborhood of the store. Depending on where a pawnshop is located, these other retail items may range from musical instruments to firearms. Some pawnbrokers also sell brand-new self-defense items such as pepper spray or stun guns.\n\nMany pawnshops will also trade used items, as long as the transaction turns a profit for pawn shop. In cases where the pawnshop buys items outright, the money is not a loan; it is a straight payment for the item.  On sales, the pawnshop may offer [[layaway]] plans, subject to conditions (down payment, regular payments, and forfeiture of previously paid amounts if the item is not paid off).\n\nSome pawnshops may keep a few unusual, high value items on display to capture the interests of passersby, such as a vintage Harley Davidson motorcycle; the owner is not typically expecting to sell these items.

The three sphere symbol is attributed to the [[Medici]] family of [[Florence, Italy]], owing to its symbolic meaning of Lombard.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2017}} This refers to the [[Regions of Italy|Italian region]] of [[Lombardy]], where pawn shop banking originated under the name of [[Lombard banking]]. It has been conjectured that the golden spheres were originally three flat yellow effigies of [[bezant]]s, or gold coins, laid heraldically upon a [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] field, but that they were converted into spheres to better attract attention.\n\nMost European towns called the pawn shop the \"Lombard\". The [[Lombards]] were a banking community in medieval [[London, England]]. According to legend, a Medici employed by [[Charlemagne]] slew a giant using three bags of rocks. The three-ball symbol became the family crest. Since the Medicis were so successful in the financial, banking, and moneylending industries, other families also adopted the symbol. Throughout the Middle Ages, [[heraldry|coats of arms]] bore three balls, orbs, plates, discs, coins and more as symbols of monetary success.\n\n[[Saint Nicholas]] is the patron saint of pawnbrokers. The symbol has also been attributed to the story of Nicholas giving a poor man's three daughters each a [[bag of gold]] so they could get [[Marriage|married]].<ref>[http://www.history.com/shows/pawn-stars/articles/pawn-stats ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202075513/http://www.history.com/shows/pawn-stars/articles/pawn-stats |date=February 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==In Asia==\n{{see also|Pawnbrokers in Hong Kong}}\n[[File:Bonuspawnshop.JPG|thumb|left|Pawn shop in [[Changlun]], Malaysia]]\n[[File:Hk wan chai tram ways 1.jpg|thumb|left|Pawn shop in Hong Kong]]\n[[File:Hong Kong Pawn Shop Logo.jpg|thumb|A typical Hong Kong pawn shop sign: a [[bat]] holding a [[coin]].]]\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]] the practice follows the Chinese tradition, and the counter of the shop is typically higher than the average person for security. A customer can only hold up his hand to offer belongings and there is a wooden screen between the door and the counter for customers' privacy. The symbol of a pawn shop in Hong Kong is a [[bat]] holding a [[coin]] ({{zh|\u8760\u9f20\u540a\u91d1\u9322}}, [[Cantonese]]: ''f\u016bk sy\u00fa diu g\u0101m ch\u00edn''). The bat signifies fortune and the coin signifies benefits. In Japan, the usual symbol for a pawn shop is a circled number seven (7) because \"shichi\", the Japanese word for seven, sounds similar to the word for \"pawn\" ({{lang|ja|\u8cea}}).\n\nThe majority of pawnbrokers in Malaysia, a multi-race country wherein [[Malaysian Chinese]] consists 25% of the population, are managed by Malaysian Chinese. In Malay, pawn is called \"pajak gadai\". A valid and licensed pawnshop in Malaysia must always declare themselves as a \"pajak gadai\" or a pawn shop for their company registration. They must also fulfill the requirements of the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government]] which states the pawn counter must not be higher than 4 feet, is bullet-proof, has stainless-steel counters/doors, strong rooms with automatic locks, safes, equipped with fully computerized system, CCTV, alarm, and pawnbroker insurance.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], pawnshops are generally privately-owned businesses and are regulated by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] (BSP). Pawnshops in the country traditionally have Spanish names beginning with \"Agencia de Empe\u00f1os\" (lit. \"Pawn agency\"), contrary to \"Casa de Empe\u00f1os\" in Spain and Latin America.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Official Gazette, Vol. 1|magazine=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)]]|year=1942|publisher=[[Philippine Executive Commission]]|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Mf4qAQAAMAAJ}}</ref> Most pawnshops accept jewelry, vehicles or electronic valuables as collateral. They also offer various forms of other finance-related services such as [[remittance]], bills payment and [[microfinance|microfinancing]]. Therefore, they serve as financial [[one stop shop]]s primarily to communities in which alternatives such as banks are not available. Recently, they have also started conducting services online and through mobile applications although this is yet subject to regulation by the BSP.\n\nIn India, the Marwari [[Jain]] community pioneered the pawnbroking business, but today others are involved; the work is done by many agents called \"saudagar\". Instead of working from a shop, they go to needy people's homes and motivate them to become involved in the business. Pawn shops are often run as part of jewelry stores. Gold, silver, and diamonds are frequently accepted as collateral.\n\nPawnbroking is also a traditional trade in [[Thailand]], where pawn shops are run both privately and by local governments.\n\nIn [[Sri Lanka]], pawnbroking is a lucrative business engaged in by specialized pawnbrokers as well as commercial banks and other finance companies.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], there is a state-owned company called [[Pegadaian]] which provides a range of conventional and Sharia-compliant pawnbroking services across the archipelago. The company accepts high-value items such as gold, motor vehicles, and other expensive items as collateral. In addition to pawnbroking activities, the company provides a range of other services, such as a safe deposit box and gold trading services.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Consignment shop]]\n* [[Lombard banking]]\n* ''[[Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No 2)]]'' [2003] UKHL 40, [2004] 1 AC 816\n* In April 2011, the [[Special English|VOA Special English]] service of the [[Voice of America]] broadcast a 15-minute program on pawnbrokers.

The items having been ''pawned'' to the broker are themselves called [[pledge (law)|''pledges'' or ''pawns'']], or simply the collateral. While many items can be pawned, pawnshops typically accept jewelry, musical instruments, home audio equipment, computers, video game systems, coins, gold, silver, televisions, cameras, power tools, firearms, and other relatively valuable items as collateral.\n\n[[File:Pawnbroker's sign, Camden High Street, London.JPG|thumb|A [[London]] shop displays the traditional pawnbroker's sign.]]\n\nIf an item is pawned for a loan (colloquially \"hocked\" or \"popped\"<ref>{{cite OED|pop}}</ref>), within a certain contractual period of time the pawner may redeem it for the amount of the loan plus some agreed-upon amount for [[interest]]. The amount of time, and rate of interest, is governed by law and by the pawnbroker's policies. If the loan is not paid (or extended, if applicable) within the time period, the pawned item will be offered for sale to other customers by the pawnbroker. Unlike other lenders, the pawnbroker does not report the defaulted loan on the customer's credit report, since the pawnbroker has physical possession of the item and may recoup the loan value through outright sale of the item. The pawnbroker also sells items that have been sold outright to them by customers. Some pawnshops are willing to trade items in their shop for items brought to them by customers.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of pawnbroking}}\nIn the west, pawnbroking existed in the Ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Most contemporary [[Western law]] on the subject is derived from the Roman jurisprudence. As the empire spread its culture, pawnbroking went with it. Likewise, in the East, the business model existed in China 1,500 years ago in [[Buddhist_temple|Buddhist monasteries]] no different from today, through the ages strictly regulated by Imperial or other authorities.\n\n[[File:Pawnshop with sign in usa.jpg|thumb|left|Modern pawnbroker storefront.]]\n\nIn spite of early [[Roman Catholic Church]] prohibitions against charging [[interest]] on [[loan]]s, there is some evidence that the [[Franciscans]] were permitted to begin the practice as an aid to the poor. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gregg|first=Samuel|date=2016|title=How Medieval Monks Changed the Face of Banking|journal=American Banker|volume=1 no. 88|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> In 1338, Edward III pawned his jewels to raise money for his war with France. King Henry V did much the same in 1415. The Lombards were not a popular class, and [[Henry VII Tudor|Henry VII]] harried them a good deal. In 1603 an ''Act against Brokers'' was passed and remained on the statute-book until 1872. It was aimed at the many counterfeit brokers in London. This type of broker was evidently regarded as a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]].\n[[File:Provident Loan Society Essex Houston jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Provident Loan Society]] of New York, a charitable pawnbroker]]\n\nCrusaders, predominantly in France, brokered their land holdings to monasteries and diocese for funds to supply, outfit, and transport their armies to the Holy Land. Instead of outright repayment, the Church reaped a certain amount of crop returns for a certain amount of seasons, which could additionally be re-exchanged in a type of equity.\n\nA pawnbroker can also be a charity. In 1450, Barnaba Manassei, a [[Franciscan]] friar, began the Monte di Piet\u00e0 movement in [[Perugia]], Italy. It provided financial assistance in the form of no-interest loans secured with pawned items. Instead of interest, the Monte di Piet\u00e0 urged borrowers to make donations to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]. It spread through Italy, then to other parts of Europe. The first Monte de Piedad organization in Spain was founded in [[Madrid]], and from there the idea was transferred to [[New Spain]] by Pedro Romero de Terreros, the Count of Santa Maria de Regla<ref name=\"Ficachi\">{{cite web|author=Leon Teutli Ficachi |url=http://www.anahuac.mx/clares/archivos/nacionalmontedepiedad.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nacional Monte de Piedad |accessdate=2008-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219125044/http://www.anahuac.mx/clares/archivos/nacionalmontedepiedad.pdf |archivedate=December 19, 2008 }}</ref> and [[Order of Calatrava|Knight of Calatrava]].<ref name=\"EncMex\" /> The [[Nacional Monte de Piedad]] is a charitable institution and pawn shop whose main office is located just off the [[Z\u00f3calo]], or main plaza of [[Mexico City]].

Common items pawned (or, in some instances, sold outright) by customers include [[jewelry]], [[electronics]], collectibles, [[musical instruments]], [[tools]], and (depending on local regulations) [[firearms]]. [[Gold]], [[silver]], and [[platinum]] are popular items\u2014which are often purchased, even if in the form of broken jewelry of little value. Metal can still be sold in bulk to a [[bullion]] dealer or [[smelter]] for the value by weight of the component metals. Similarly, jewelry that contains genuine [[gemstones]], even if broken or missing pieces, have value.\n\nThe pawnbroker assumes the risk that an item might have been stolen. However, laws in many jurisdictions protect both the community and broker from ''unknowingly'' [[handling stolen goods]] (also known as ''fencing''). These laws often require that the pawnbroker establish positive identification of the seller through photo identification (such as a driver's license or government-issued [[identity document]]), as well as a holding period placed on an item purchased by a pawnbroker (to allow time for local law enforcement authorities to track stolen items). In some jurisdictions, pawnshops must give a list of all newly pawned items and any associated serial number to police, so the police can determine if any of the items have been reported stolen. Many police departments advise burglary or robbery victims to visit local pawnshops to see if they can locate stolen items. Some pawnshops set up their own screening criteria to avoid buying stolen property.\n\nThe pawnbroker assesses an item for its condition and marketability by testing the item and examining it for flaws, scratches or other damage. Another aspect that affects marketability is the supply and demand for the item in the community or region. In some markets, the [[used good]]s market is so flooded with used stereos and car stereos, for example, that pawnshops will only accept the higher-quality brand names. Alternatively, a customer may offer to pawn an item that is difficult to sell, such as a surfboard in an inland region, or a pair of snowshoes in warm-winter regions. The pawnshop owner either turns down hard-to-sell items, or offers a low price. While some items never get outdated, such as hammers and hand saws, electronics and computer items quickly become obsolete and unsaleable. Pawnshop owners must learn about different makes and models of computers, software, and other electronic equipment, so they can value objects accurately.\n\nTo assess value of different items, pawnbrokers use guidebooks (\"blue books\"), catalogs, Internet search engines, and their own experience. Some pawnbrokers have trained in identification of gems, or employ a specialist to assess jewelry. One of the risks of accepting secondhand goods is that the item may be counterfeit. If the item is counterfeit, such as a fake [[Rolex]] watch, it may have only a fraction of the value of the genuine item. Once the pawnbroker determines the item is genuine and not likely stolen, and that it is marketable, the pawnbroker offers the customer an amount for it.  The customer can either sell the item outright if (as in most cases) the pawnbroker is also a licensed secondhand dealer, or offer the item as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] on a loan. Most pawnshops are willing to negotiate the amount of the loan with the client.\n\n===Determining amount of loan===\nTo determine the amount of the loan, the pawnshop owner needs to take into account several factors. A key factor is the predicted resale value of the item. This is often thought of in terms of a range, with the low point being the [[wholesale]] value of the used good, in the case that the pawnshop is unable to sell it to pawnshop customers, and they decide to sell it to a wholesale merchant of used goods. The higher point in the range is the retail sale price in the pawnshop. For example, a five-year-old laptop may have been bought by the customer for $1,000. However, as a used item in a pawnshop, it might only fetch $250 as a purchase price in the pawnshop, because the customers will be wary that it might be a [[lemon market|\"lemon\"]] that the seller is getting rid of because it has some hard-to-detect problem, and because pawnshops do not typically offer a warranty with goods sold. Used electronics wholesalers will buy the laptop from the pawnshop owner for $100 to $150. The wholesaler pays a lower price than the retail value because they have the added cost of hiring electronics technicians who overhaul and repair the items so that they can be sold in used electronics stores.\n\nThe pawnshop owner also takes into account their knowledge of [[supply and demand]] for the item in question to determine if they think that they will end up selling the laptop for $100 to a wholesaler or $250 to a pawnshop customer. If the pawnshop owner believes that the local market for used laptops is saturated (overloaded with used laptops), they may fear that they will only get $100 for the laptop if they have to unload it to a wholesaler. With that figure in mind as the expected revenue, the pawnshop owner has to factor in the overhead costs of the store (rent, heat, electricity, phone connection, yellow pages advertisement, website costs, staff costs, insurance, alarm system, items lost when they are confiscated by police, etc.), and a profit for the business. As such, the customer who comes in with this laptop that they paid $1,000 for when it was new may be offered as little as $50 by the pawnshop owner, who is taking into account all of the risk and cost factors.\n\nIn determining the amount of the loan, the pawnshop owner also assesses the likelihood that the customer will pay the interest for several weeks or months and then return to repay the loan and reclaim the item. Since the key to the pawnshop business model is earning interest on the loaned money, pawnshop owners want to accept items that the customer is likely to want to recover, after having paid interest for a period on the loan. If, in an extreme case, a pawnshop only accepted items that customers had no interest in ever reclaiming, it would not make any money from interest, and the store would in effect become a second-hand dealer. Determining if the customer is likely to return to reclaim an item is a subjective decision, and the pawnshop owner may take many factors into account. For example, if a young able-bodied man comes into the pawnshop to pawn an electric wheelchair (perhaps claiming it to be the possession of his late grandparent), the pawnshop owner may doubt that the item will be redeemed. On the other hand, if a middle-aged man pawns a top quality set of golf clubs, the pawnshop owner may assess it as more credible that he will return for the items.  Some customers may attempt to persuade the pawnshop owner that the item in question is important to them (\"that necklace belonged to my grandmother, so I will certainly return for it\") as a means of obtaining a loan.  Other customers return to the same store, repeatedly pawn the same items as a way of borrowing money, and return to pay the interest and recover the items before the end of the loan period; thus, the pawnbroker knows that redemption is likely and will, therefore, make the loan.\n\nThe saleability of the item and the amount that the customer wants for it are also factored into the pawnbroker's assessment; if a customer offers a very salable item at a low price, the pawnbroker may accept it even if it is unlikely that the customer will return, because the pawnshop can turn around a quick profit on the item. However, if a customer offers an extremely low price the pawnbroker may turn down the offer because this suggests that the item may either be counterfeit or stolen.\n\nIn some countries such as Sweden, there is legislation to prevent the pawnbroker from making unfair profits ([[usury]] due to financial distress or ignorance of the customer) at the expense of the customer by low valuations of their collaterals. It is stated that the pawnbroker may not keep the collateral but must sell them at public [[auction]]. Any excess after paying the loan, the interest and auction costs must be paid to the customer. If the item does not fetch a price that will cover these expenses the pawnbroker may keep the item and sell it through other channels. Despite this protection, the cost for the customer to borrow money this way will be high, and if he cannot redeem the collateral it would in many cases be better to sell the goods directly.\n\n[[File:Pawn Shop at Sherman Way & Reseda Blvd., Reseda, CA.JPG|thumb|left|Pawnbroker in [[Reseda, CA]]]]\n\n===Inventory management===\nPawnshops have to be careful to manage how many new items they accept as pawns: either too little inventory or too much is bad. A pawnshop might have too little inventory if, for example, it mostly buys jewels and gold that it resells or smelts\u2014or perhaps the pawnshop owner quickly sells most items through specialty shops (e.g., musical instruments to music stores, stereos to used hi-fi audio stores, etc.). In this case, the pawnshop is less interesting to customers, because it is mostly empty.\n\nOn the other extreme, a pawnshop with a huge inventory has several disadvantages. If the store is crammed with used athletic gear, old stereos, and old tools, the store owner must spend time and money shelving and sorting items, displaying them on different stands or in glass cases, and monitoring customers to prevent [[shoplifting]]. If there are too many low-value, poor quality items, such as old toasters, scratched-up 20-year-old TVs, and worn-out sports gear piled into cardboard boxes, the store may begin to look more like a [[rummage sale]] or [[flea market]].  Small, high-value items such as iPod players or cell phones must be in locked glass display cases, which means the owner may need additional staff to unlock the cabinets for items customers want to examine. As a store fills with items, an owner must protect inventory from theft by hiring staff to supervise the different areas or install security cameras and alarms. Too much unsold inventory means that the store has not been able to realize value from these items to provide cash to lend.\n\nThe better option lies in the middle: a store with a moderate amount of good quality, brand-name items arranged neatly in the display windows attracts passersby, who are more likely to enter and shop. If items are attractively laid out in display cases and shelves, the pawnshop looks more professional and reputable. Once passersby start shopping in the store, they may be more inclined to pawn or sell their own items to the pawnshop. Some pawnshop owners prevent cluttered look by storing overstocked items, or less attractive items such as snow tires, in a backroom or basement. Some pawnshop companies operate a chain of stores in a state or province. This way, they can balance inventory between stores. For example, they can move some of a rural store's surfeit of fishing gear to an urban store.\n\nSome stores also slim down inventory by selling items to speciality retailers. A pawnshop in a low-income neighborhood that pays a customer $300 for a power amplifier with a used value of $2000 may find the unit hard to sell alongside much less expensive merchandise. They may sell the amplifier to a used audio equipment store whose customers expect higher-end equipment. Some pawnshops sell speciality items online, on  [[eBay]] or other websites. A speciality item such as a high-end model railroad set may not sell in the store for its \"blue book\" value. On an online auction, it stands a good chance of bringing a good price.\n\nAnother growing trend in the industry is vehicle pawn or auto pawning. This form of Pawnbroking works like a traditional pawn loan, however, these stores only accept vehicles as security. Many stores are also accepting \"Title Loans\", where you can pawn the ownership or \"Title\" documents of your vehicle. This essentially means that the pawnbroker owns your car while you drive it, and you regain ownership once you pay back your loan.\n\n===Auxiliary operations===\nWhile the main business activities of a pawnshop are lending money for interest based on valuable items that customers bring in, some pawnshops also undertake other business activities, such as selling brand-new retail items that are in demand in the neighborhood of the store. Depending on where a pawnshop is located, these other retail items may range from musical instruments to firearms. Some pawnbrokers also sell brand-new self-defense items such as pepper spray or stun guns.\n\nMany pawnshops will also trade used items, as long as the transaction turns a profit for pawn shop. In cases where the pawnshop buys items outright, the money is not a loan; it is a straight payment for the item.  On sales, the pawnshop may offer [[layaway]] plans, subject to conditions (down payment, regular payments, and forfeiture of previously paid amounts if the item is not paid off).\n\nSome pawnshops may keep a few unusual, high value items on display to capture the interests of passersby, such as a vintage Harley Davidson motorcycle; the owner is not typically expecting to sell these items. Other activities carried out by pawnshops are financial services including fee-based check cashing, [[payday loan]]s, vehicle title or house title loans, and currency exchange services.\n\n===Upscale pawnshops===\nUpscale pawnshops began to appear in the early 20th century, often referred to as \"loan offices\", since the term \u201cpawn shop\u201d had a very negative historical reputation at this point.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/inhockpawningina0000wolo|url-access=registration|quote=upscale pawnshops.|title=In Hock: Pawning in America from Independence through the Great Depression|author=Wendy A.

The three sphere symbol is attributed to the [[Medici]] family of [[Florence, Italy]], owing to its symbolic meaning of Lombard.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2017}} This refers to the [[Regions of Italy|Italian region]] of [[Lombardy]], where pawn shop banking originated under the name of [[Lombard banking]]. It has been conjectured that the golden spheres were originally three flat yellow effigies of [[bezant]]s, or gold coins, laid heraldically upon a [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] field, but that they were converted into spheres to better attract attention.\n\nMost European towns called the pawn shop the \"Lombard\". The [[Lombards]] were a banking community in medieval [[London, England]]. According to legend, a Medici employed by [[Charlemagne]] slew a giant using three bags of rocks. The three-ball symbol became the family crest. Since the Medicis were so successful in the financial, banking, and moneylending industries, other families also adopted the symbol. Throughout the Middle Ages, [[heraldry|coats of arms]] bore three balls, orbs, plates, discs, coins and more as symbols of monetary success.\n\n[[Saint Nicholas]] is the patron saint of pawnbrokers. The symbol has also been attributed to the story of Nicholas giving a poor man's three daughters each a [[bag of gold]] so they could get [[Marriage|married]].<ref>[http://www.history.com/shows/pawn-stars/articles/pawn-stats ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202075513/http://www.history.com/shows/pawn-stars/articles/pawn-stats |date=February 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==In Asia==\n{{see also|Pawnbrokers in Hong Kong}}\n[[File:Bonuspawnshop.JPG|thumb|left|Pawn shop in [[Changlun]], Malaysia]]\n[[File:Hk wan chai tram ways 1.jpg|thumb|left|Pawn shop in Hong Kong]]\n[[File:Hong Kong Pawn Shop Logo.jpg|thumb|A typical Hong Kong pawn shop sign: a [[bat]] holding a [[coin]].]]\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]] the practice follows the Chinese tradition, and the counter of the shop is typically higher than the average person for security. A customer can only hold up his hand to offer belongings and there is a wooden screen between the door and the counter for customers' privacy. The symbol of a pawn shop in Hong Kong is a [[bat]] holding a [[coin]] ({{zh|\u8760\u9f20\u540a\u91d1\u9322}}, [[Cantonese]]: ''f\u016bk sy\u00fa diu g\u0101m ch\u00edn''). The bat signifies fortune and the coin signifies benefits. In Japan, the usual symbol for a pawn shop is a circled number seven (7) because \"shichi\", the Japanese word for seven, sounds similar to the word for \"pawn\" ({{lang|ja|\u8cea}}).\n\nThe majority of pawnbrokers in Malaysia, a multi-race country wherein [[Malaysian Chinese]] consists 25% of the population, are managed by Malaysian Chinese. In Malay, pawn is called \"pajak gadai\". A valid and licensed pawnshop in Malaysia must always declare themselves as a \"pajak gadai\" or a pawn shop for their company registration. They must also fulfill the requirements of the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government]] which states the pawn counter must not be higher than 4 feet, is bullet-proof, has stainless-steel counters/doors, strong rooms with automatic locks, safes, equipped with fully computerized system, CCTV, alarm, and pawnbroker insurance.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], pawnshops are generally privately-owned businesses and are regulated by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] (BSP). Pawnshops in the country traditionally have Spanish names beginning with \"Agencia de Empe\u00f1os\" (lit. \"Pawn agency\"), contrary to \"Casa de Empe\u00f1os\" in Spain and Latin America.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Official Gazette, Vol. 1|magazine=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)]]|year=1942|publisher=[[Philippine Executive Commission]]|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Mf4qAQAAMAAJ}}</ref> Most pawnshops accept jewelry, vehicles or electronic valuables as collateral. They also offer various forms of other finance-related services such as [[remittance]], bills payment and [[microfinance|microfinancing]]. Therefore, they serve as financial [[one stop shop]]s primarily to communities in which alternatives such as banks are not available. Recently, they have also started conducting services online and through mobile applications although this is yet subject to regulation by the BSP.\n\nIn India, the Marwari [[Jain]] community pioneered the pawnbroking business, but today others are involved; the work is done by many agents called \"saudagar\". Instead of working from a shop, they go to needy people's homes and motivate them to become involved in the business. Pawn shops are often run as part of jewelry stores. Gold, silver, and diamonds are frequently accepted as collateral.\n\nPawnbroking is also a traditional trade in [[Thailand]], where pawn shops are run both privately and by local governments.\n\nIn [[Sri Lanka]], pawnbroking is a lucrative business engaged in by specialized pawnbrokers as well as commercial banks and other finance companies.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], there is a state-owned company called [[Pegadaian]] which provides a range of conventional and Sharia-compliant pawnbroking services across the archipelago. The company accepts high-value items such as gold, motor vehicles, and other expensive items as collateral. In addition to pawnbroking activities, the company provides a range of other services, such as a safe deposit box and gold trading services.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Consignment shop]]\n* [[Lombard banking]]\n* ''[[Wilson v First County Trust Ltd (No 2)]]'' [2003] UKHL 40, [2004] 1 AC 816\n* In April 2011, the [[Special English|VOA Special English]] service of the [[Voice of America]] broadcast a 15-minute program on pawnbrokers.
