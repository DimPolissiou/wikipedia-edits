Attacks can range from a warning or expulsion from Northern Ireland, backed up by the threat of violence, to severe beatings that leave victims in hospital and shootings in the limbs (such as [[kneecapping]]). The cause of the attacks is disputed; proposed explanations include the breakdown of order as a result of the [[Northern Ireland conflict]] ({{circa|1970}}\u20131998), ideological opposition to British law enforcement (in the case of republicans), and the ineffectiveness of police to prevent crime. \n\nSince reporting began in 1973, more than 6,106 shootings and beatings have been reported to the police,  leading to at least 115 deaths. The official figures are an underestimate because many attacks are not reported. Most victims are young men and boys under the age of thirty years, whom their attackers claim are responsible for criminal or antisocial behaviour. Despite attempts to put an end to the practice, according to researcher Sharon Mallon in a 2017 policy briefing, \"paramilitaries are continuing to operate an informal criminal justice system,  with  a  degree  of  political  and  legal  impunity\".{{sfn|Mallon|2017|p=8}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Name==\nThe term \"punishment\" is controversial. According to [[Liam Kennedy (historian)|Liam Kennedy]], \"Not only has the label 'punishment' a euphemistic quality when applied to extremely cruel practices, it also carries a presumption that the victim is somehow deserving of what he (occasionally she) receives.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1995|p=86}}, cited in {{harvnb|Human Rights Watch|1997|loc=5.

In the 1970s, the [[Free Derry Police]] also operated independent of paramilitary groups. \"People's courts\" which mostly imposed sentences of [[community service]] based on a [[restorative justice]] approach operated in the early years of the conflict, but shut down due to police intimidation and because they did not have the authority of punishment imposed by paramilitaries.{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=153}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=44\u201345}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|p=439}} In nationalist  Belfast, the [[Catholic Ex-Servicemen's Association]] initially played a role in keeping order.{{sfn|Knox|Monaghan|2002|pp=31\u201332}} At the same time, Protestant  neighbourhoods began to organize defence groups in response to retaliatory raids.

The IRA defined \"political\" crime as informing or fraternizing with British soldiers, while \"normal\" crime was judged to include vandalism, theft, joyriding, rape, selling drugs, and \"[[antisocial behavior]]\"\u2014anything from verbally abusing the elderly to dumping rubbish.  \"Normal\" crimes by first-time offenders were often dealt with by a restorative justice approach based on providing restitution to victims. The typical punishment for repeat offenders  was [[kneecapping]],  a malicious wounding of the knee with a bullet.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=44\u201345}} The IRA claimed that its methods were more lenient than those of other insurgent groups, such as the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Algerian FLN]] or the [[French resistance]], which Munck agrees with.{{sfn|Munck|1984|p=86}}\n\nThe IRA also punished its own members for misusing the organization's name, losing weapons, disobeying orders, or breaking other rules, and launched purges against other republican paramilitary groups such as the Irish People's  Liberation Organisation and the Official IRA. Within the IRA, those responsible for punishment belonged to auxiliary cells and were considered the \"dregs\" of the organization.  The IRA maintained distinct sections for internal and external punishment.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=46\u201347}} Although informers were usually executed, part of the IRA's strategy for defeating informers included periodic amnesties (usually announced after murders) during which anyone could admit to informing without punishment.{{sfn|Sarma|2013|p=254}} Around 1980, the system of punishment attacks was questioned by IRA figures, which resulted in the increase in warnings given. The IRA pledged to stop kneecapping in 1983, and both shootings and beatings drastically declined. However, soon community members were calling for more paramilitary attacks to combat an increase in crime, especially violent rapes.{{sfn|Munck|1984|pp=89\u201390}}{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=157}}\n\nOther republican paramilitary groups also punished offenders but on a smaller scale.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=46\u201347}} [[Direct Action Against Drugs]] was an IRA [[front group]] that claimed responsibility for some murders of alleged drug dealers beginning in 1995, allowing the IRA to pretend to follow the ceasefire.{{sfn|Moran|2009|p=32}} DAAD drew up a list of alleged drug dealers and crossed their names off the list as they were executed.<ref name=\"independent\" /> Other republican anti-drug vigilante groups include [[Republican Action Against Drugs]],<ref name=\"btelegraph\" />{{sfn|Morrison|2016|p=607}} [[Irish Republican Movement]],<ref name=\"McClements\" />  and [[Action Against Drugs]].<ref name=\"BBC3\"/> Along with conventional terrorism, punishment attacks are a major feature of the [[dissident Irish republican campaign]] carried out by the [[New IRA]] and other groups.{{sfn|Morrison|2016|p=599}} However, the attacks are controversial among dissident republicans, who question whether any benefit of the attacks is worth the internal division and alienation of youth.{{sfn|Morrison|2016|p=608}}\n\n===Loyalist groups===\n{{see also|loyalist feud}}\n[[File:Shopping in Shankill, Belfast. - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Shankill Road is a hotspot for loyalist attacks]]\nUlster loyalist paramilitaries, whilst not drawing on historical precedents, justified their role in terms of maintaining order and enforcing the law. Unlike republican vigilantes, however, they saw their role as aiding the  [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]  rather than subverting it. Nevertheless, they were prepared to mete out their own punishments in cases where they judged the  official justice system not to  deal harshly enough with the alleged offender. In 1971, the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA), the largest Ulster loyalist group, formed as a merger between various neighbourhood watch and vigilante groups. It adopted the motto {{lang|la|Codenta Arma Togae}} (\"law before violence\") and states that its aim is to see order restored throughout Northern Ireland. The UDA has collected evidence on petty crime and used vigilante punishment against criminals, antisocial elements, rival Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups, and as a means of discipline within groups. It also used the  threat of punishment in order to  conscript new members.  The [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) used to patrol the [[Shankill, Belfast|Shankill]] neighbourhood in Belfast. Criminals were warned or reported to the official police.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=49}}\n\nBetween 1973 and 1985, loyalists were responsible for many fewer punishment attacks than republicans, due to a view that their role was protecting Protestants from Catholics rather than enforcing rules within Protestant communities. From 1985 to 1998, they were responsible for a similar number of attacks. According to insider [[Sammy Duddy]], the UDA stopped reporting offenders to the police and started to engage in punishment shootings because the police was pressuring the offenders to inform on loyalist groups.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=134\u2013135}} Since the Good Friday Agreement, loyalists have committed significantly more punishment attacks than republicans.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=136}} The increase in punishment attacks has been attributed to increasing mistrust of official law enforcement, ineffectiveness at controlling petty crime, and perceived leniency of sentences.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=51}} Both the UDA and UVF have less internal discipline than the IRA,{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2001|p=364}}{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=136}} which means that an order to stop would be difficult to enforce. Loyalist groups' punishment style is more haphazard and groups who cannot find their intended target have been known to attack an innocent Catholic individual.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=136}} Individuals have joined loyalist paramilitaries to avoid a punishment attack from a rival group.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=50}}\n\nIn 1996, newspapers reported that the UVF had set up a \"court\" in Shankhill which fined  offenders for various offenses, but according to sociologist  Heather Hamill this is more likely a reflection of ability to pay rather than a genuine justice system  based on severity of the offence. In 2003, the North Belfast branch of the UDA announced that it was ceasing violent punishments in favour of \"naming and shaming\" offenders, who were forced to stand with placards announcing their offence. This change proved short lived.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=137}}\n\n==Attacks==\n===Overview===\nThe punishment methods of republican and loyalist paramilitaries are similar.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=50}} Because paramilitaries rely on popular support, they cannot overstep community consensus on appropriate punishment without risking the loss of support.{{sfn|Munck|1984|p=86}} The penalty chosen would be based on the crime and potentially mitigating or aggravating factors such as criminal history, age, gender, and family background.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=46, 52}} Crime against targets valued by the community, such as religious leaders, pensioners, community centers, or locally owned businesses, tended to be punished more harshly than crimes against large corporations, which were frequently ignored.{{sfn|Brewer ''et al.''|1998|p=579}} Punishment attacks often begin when masked paramilitaries break into the victim's home.{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=154}}  In other cases, victims would be told to show up at a certain time and place, either at a political front organization or at their home, for the attack.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}}{{sfn|Silke|1998|p=132}} Many victims keep these appointments because if they fail to do so, the punishment will be escalated in severity.{{sfn|Silke|1998|p=132}} These appointments are more likely to be made by republican than loyalist groups.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=50}} Some victims were able to negotiate the type of punishment.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=34, 69, 71}} In order to avoid the victims dying, paramilitaries frequently call emergency services after the attack.{{sfn|Peyton|2002|p=s54}} In  cases of mistaken identity, the IRA was known to issue apologies after the fact.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}}\n\nInitially, both republican and loyalist paramilitaries were reluctant to shoot or seriously harm women and children  younger than 16, although this became more frequent as the Troubles continued.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=46, 52}} Even female informers were usually subject to humiliation-type punishment rather than physical violence.{{sfn|Sarma|2013|p=252}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=46}} There were exceptions, such as the case of accused informer [[Jean McConville]], who was kidnapped and killed in 1972.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=46}}\n\n===Non-physical===\nMore minor punishments, often used on first offenders, are warnings, promises not to offend again, curfews, and fines.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=46}}{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=154}} Parents sometimes request that their child be warned in order to keep him or her from greater involvement in delinquency.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=69}} During the 1970s, when the IRA had the most control over established \"[[no-go area#Northern Ireland|no-go zones]]\",  humiliation was often used as a form of punishment. The victim was forced to hold a placard or [[tarred and feathered]]. In republican areas, women accused of fraternizing with British soldiers had their heads shaved. The use of such types of humiliation was greatest in the 1970s and decreased due to the risk of getting caught and complaints from [[Derry Women's Aid]] that the practice was misogynistic.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=46}}{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=76\u201377}}\n\nSometimes paramilitaries would approach a person and ask them to leave West Belfast{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=70\u201371}} or Northern Ireland within a certain period of time (such as 48 hours), with an implicit  threat of serious injury or execution if they did not comply.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}}{{sfn|Silke|1998|p=131}} It could be applied arbitrarily when paramilitaries go out looking for the victim but cannot find him, they will issue an expulsion order to friends or relatives.{{sfn|Silke|1998|p=132}} Expulsion was an alternative to violence favoured by paramilitaries because it removed the offender from the community whilst avoiding bloodshed.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}} However, victims frequently experienced it as the worst form of attack short of execution. Most victims are young, unemployed and lack educational qualifications as well as the skills and savings needed to establish themselves in a new area.{{sfn|Silke|1998|pp=124, 131}} Expulsion can be a life sentence but usually it lasts between three months and two years. Some victims, although they have not been convicted of any crime, go to juvenile detention centres to avoid punishment until their sentence expires.{{sfn|Silke|1998|p=132}}\n\n===Beatings===\n[[File:Weapons used against paramilitary punishment victims, 1997\u20132017.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Weapons used against paramilitary punishment victims who required orthopedic treatment, 1997\u20132017. GSW refers to [[gunshot wound]].]]\nSome individuals report that the attack was quite mild and no more than a \"cuff around the ear\" or being slapped around. Other beatings are more severe and the victim ends up in hospital for considerable period of time. Beatings are accomplished with instruments such as baseball bats, hammers, golf clubs, hurley sticks, iron bars,  concrete blocks, and cudgels (often studded with nails). The resulting injury can be quite  severe, involving flesh split by nails, broken skulls, broken limbs, punctured lungs, and other serious damage.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=72\u201373}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}}{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|p=11}} More injuries affected the limbs than the torso. In some cases, paramilitaries used powered drills and hacksaws to directly injure bone.{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|p=740\u2013741}} Beatings became more severe after the 1994 ceasefires due to the reduction in shootings, and were often accomplished with baseball bats and similar implements studded with six-inch nails.{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|p=11}} In the worst cases, individuals were hung from railings and nailed to fences in a form of [[crucifixion]].{{sfn|Jarman|2007|p=9}} \n\n===Shootings===\n{{see also|Kneecapping}}\nVictims are typically shot in the knees,  ankles, thighs, elbows, ankles, or a combination of the above.{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2001|p=360}} Kneecapping is considered a \"trademark\" of the IRA,{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=74}} although it became less popular over time because the disability and mortality incurred was unpopular with the community. It was replaced with low-velocity shots aimed at the soft tissue in the lower limbs. As a result, \"kneecapping\" is frequently a misnomer because by the 2010s most injuries targeted the [[femur]] or [[Popliteus muscle|popliteal]] area rather than the knee joint.{{sfn|McGarry ''et al.''|2017|p=93}}{{sfn|Peyton|2002|p=s54}}{{sfn|Lau ''et al.''|2017|p=747}} Typically, the victim is forced to lie face down and shot from behind.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=74}} Republican paramilitaries tended to shoot side to side while loyalists shot back to front, causing more severe damage.{{sfn|Peyton|2002|p=s54}} As with beatings, there are various degrees of shooting, with the number of shots, proximity to a joint, and the [[calibre]] of the firearm depending on the severity of the offence. If the victim is shot in the fleshy  part of the thigh, it will heal quickly with little damage. On the other hand, if they are shot directly in the joint it can cause permanent disability.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}}{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=74\u201375}}  An especially severe form is the \"six pack\", during which a victim is shot in both knees, elbows, and ankles.{{sfn|McGarry ''et al.''|2017|p=93}} Depending on the attack, shooting can leave relatively minor injuries compared to a severe beating,{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|p=12}}{{sfn|Knox|Dickson|2002|p=2}} with one NHS doctor estimating that 50% of those with such injuries will  have only minor scars.<ref name=\"Brutality\" /> The IRA sought the advice of doctors in how to cause serious but non-lethal injury. They were advised to shoot the ankles and wrists instead of the knees because it lessened the risk of the victim bleeding out, as happened to [[Murder of Andrew Kearney|Andrew Kearney]] in 1998.<ref name=\"doctors\" /> The harshest punishments are for informing, which typically results in execution.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=45, 50}}{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\n===Consequences===\n[[File:Knee injury from punishment attack.png|thumb|left|Knee injury caused by a punishment shooting]]\nAccording to psychiatrist Oscar Daly, who treats victims of the attacks, the characteristics of those who tend to be victims\u2014such as poor parenting and preexisting mental health problems\u2014make them more vulnerable to psychological [[sequelae]]. A 1995 study found that symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], such as [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], [[hypervigilance]], difficulty concentrating, and attempts to numb or minimize the incident, are common in youth who survive a punishment attack. According Hamill's research, desire to escape fear and the feeling of powerlessness can contribute to problems with alcoholism and  drug  abuse.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=77\u201378}} More than one third of her subjects suffered from extended bouts of depression following attacks  and 22% said that they had attempted suicide.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=79}}{{sfn|Mallon ''et al.''|2019|p=2}} Mallon analyzed the 402 suicides in Northern Ireland between 2007 and 2009 and identified nineteen cases in which young men had killed themselves after being threatened with punishment attacks for alleged criminal or anti-social behaviour.{{sfn|Mallon ''et al.''|2019|p=4}}\n\nIn 2002, the [[National Health Service]] estimated that it spent at least \u00a31.5m annually on treating the victims of punishment attacks.<ref name=paramilitary-style/> Depending on the time period under consideration, the per-patient cost of treating victims who have been physically attacked varies from \u00a32,855 (2012\u20132013) to \u00a36,017 (pre-1994)  in 2015 pounds. These figures only include the first hospital admission and therefore do not include the cost of treating resulting psychological disorders. The lower cost is due both to less severe attacks and improved treatment techniques.{{sfn|McGarry ''et al.''|2017|p=92}} Many victims were treated at [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast]], which developed expertise in dealing with the particular injuries involved.{{sfn|Munck|1984|p=90}}{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|p=740\u2013741}} Punishment beatings often leave victims with serious injuries and permanently disabled.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}} Kneecapping often resulted in neurovascular damage which had to be treated with weeks in the hospital and extensive outpatient rehabilitation.{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|p=740\u2013741}} However, medical advancements allowed most victims to regain most function in their limbs.{{sfn|Lau ''et al.''|2017|p=750}} Between 1969 and 2003, 13 patients treated at [[Musgrave Park Hospital]] in Belfast required leg amputation because of kneecapping attacks.{{sfn|Graham|Parke|2004|p=229}}\n\nIf considered \"innocent victims of violent crime\", victims of punishment attacks (like others injured by paramilitaries) are eligible for compensation by the [[Compensation Agency]] of the Northern Ireland Office.{{sfn|Knox|Dickson|2002|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n==Statistics==\n[[File:Punishment attacks in Northern Ireland, 1973\u20132008.png|frameless|right|upright=1.6]]\nPolice received reports  of 6,106 punishment attacks between 1973 and 2015, of which 3,113 incidents were attributed to loyalists and  2,993 to republicans.<ref name=\"rt\u00e9\" /> At least 115 people were killed by these attacks between 1973 and 2000.{{sfn|Silke|2000|loc=abstract}} There have been additional deaths since then, such as multiple murders claimed by Republican Action Against Drugs and the killing of Michael McGibbon in 2016.<ref>{{cite news |title=Timeline of Irish dissident activity |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-10866072 |accessdate=3 December 2019 |work=BBC News |date=10 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC3\" /> These statistics only include incidents reported to the police, and are therefore an underestimate.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=51}} Pressure group [[Families Against Intimidation and Terror]] claims that it is a 30\u201350% underestimate,{{sfn|Knox|2002|pp=174, 176}} while according to Sharon Mallon, underreporting makes accurate measurement of these attacks impossible.{{sfn|Mallon|2017|p=3}} No statistics exist for other forms of penalties, such as expulsion,{{efn|Belfast victim-support group Base 2 knows of 453 people who were expelled between 1994 and 1996.

Resistance is rarely attempted, because most victims perceive their situation to be hopeless. Sometimes, if a bystander steps in to defend the targeted person, they will be attacked as well.{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|pp=6\u20138}} About three-quarters of attacks take place between 16:00 and midnight; the majority begin in the victim's residence (often they are abducted and taken elsewhere for the main attack).{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|p=9}} Most loyalist attacks involve between three and five attackers, but two-thirds of IRA attacks involve five or more attackers.{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|p=10}} \n\nAfter a decrease in the early 2000s, punishment attacks are increasing again.{{sfn|Mallon ''et al.''|2019|p=2}}{{sfn|Topping|Byrne|2012|p=42}} In 2018, [[Community Restorative Justice Ireland]] estimated that each year there are 250-300 threats, significantly higher than the number reported to PSNI.<ref name=\"BBC3\" /> Between July 2018 and June 2019, 81 punishment attacks were reported to the police, on average more than one every four days.<ref name=\"itimes\" /> From January to November 2019, 68 attacks were reported.<ref>{{cite news |last1=O'Doherty |first1=Malachi |title=Thugs behind 'punishment' attacks act as if they enjoy some sort of community endorsement... shamefully, they're not wrong |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/columnists/malachi-odoherty/malachi-odoherty-thugs-behind-punishment-attacks-act-as-if-they-enjoy-some-sort-of-community-endorsement-shamefully-theyre-not-wrong-38735976.html |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |date=28 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Victims==\n===\"Hoods\"===\nMost victims come from a delinquent youth subculture colloquially known as \"hoods\".{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=98, ''passim''}}{{sfn|Jarman|2007|p=8}}{{sfn|Munck|1984|p=91}} Offences that they commit range from organized drug dealing to joyriding.{{sfn|Munck|1984|p=91}} Hoods continue to offend even though they know that this puts them at high risk of punishment.

Paramilitary \"Policing\": Requirements of International Law}}\n\n===Restorative justice===\nIn 1990, the Belfast-based victim support group Base 2 was founded. In the first eight years, it helped more than 1,000 people stay in their communities and avoid punishment attacks.{{sfn|Conway |1997|pp=109-110}} Since then, there have been community-based attempts to mediate conflict between paramilitaries and their targets via a restorative justice approach. These interventions have included verifying if an individual is under sentence of expulsion, helping such individuals relocate elsewhere, and eventually reintegrating them into the community.{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2001|p=368}} Alleged offenders may be offered mediation with the wronged party and asked to offer restitution or perform community service. As part of the programme, they have to stop the behaviour and cease using alcohol and drugs. These are voluntary programmes, and require the agreement of both parties. Some offenders prefer the official justice system or to suffer paramilitary punishment.{{sfn|Jarman|2007|pp=11-12}}\n\nSinn F\u00e9in supported restorative justice, which was endorsed by the IRA in 1999; the organization also asked locals to stop requesting punishment attacks.{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2001|p=369}} About this time, Community Restorative Justice Ireland (CRJI) was established to coordinate restorative justice initiatives in republican areas.{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2002|p=537}}{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=167}} The RUC's opposition to the centres made them ideologically acceptable to

''[[Saoirse Irish Freedom]]'' (the organ of Republican Sinn F\u00e9in) once described it as \"British [[double speak]] for collaboration with Crown Forces\".{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2002|p=554}} Loyalist neighbourhoods have also seen community restorative justice approaches, organized by [[Northern Ireland Alternatives]],<ref name=\"PeaceInsight\" /> which originated in the greater Shankill area{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=167}} and worked closely with the police from the beginning,{{sfn|Jarman|2007|p=12}} despite scepticism from law enforcement.{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=167}}\n\nProponents of restorative justice argue that they are the only way to end paramilitary violence and are a legitimate form of [[legal pluralism]].<ref name=\"PeaceInsight\" />{{sfn|Jarman|2007|p=13}} According to a study by [[Atlantic Philanthropies]], Alternatives prevented 71% of punishment attacks by loyalists and CRJI prevented 81% of attacks by republicans.{{sfn|Cody|2008|p=556}} Critics argue that the restorative justice approach legitimizes the role of paramilitaries in informal justice and allows them to retain the threat of violent attacks if they are not satisfied with the result.<ref name=\"PeaceInsight\" />{{sfn|Jarman|2007|p=13}} In 2006, the eighth report of the International Monitoring Commission described participation in  restorative justice as one means by which paramilitaries attempted to maintain their role and exert influence.{{sfn|Jarman|2007|p=10}} Another argument against restorative justice is that it institutionalizes a different justice system for the rich and poor.{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2002|p=552}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|25em|refs=\n<ref name=\"post\">{{cite news |last1=Higgins |first1=Erica Doyle

Attacks can range from a warning or expulsion from Northern Ireland, backed up by the threat of violence, to severe beatings that leave victims in hospital and shootings in the limbs (such as [[kneecapping]]). The cause of the attacks is disputed; proposed explanations include the breakdown of order as a result of the [[Northern Ireland conflict]] ({{circa|1970}}\u20131998), ideological opposition to British law enforcement (in the case of republicans), and the ineffectiveness of police to prevent crime. \n\nSince reporting began in 1973, more than 6,106 shootings and beatings have been reported to the police,  leading to at least 115 deaths. The official figures are an underestimate because many attacks are not reported. Most victims are young men and boys under the age of thirty years, whom their attackers claim are responsible for criminal or antisocial behaviour. Despite attempts to put an end to the practice, according to researcher Sharon Mallon in a 2017 policy briefing, \"paramilitaries are continuing to operate an informal criminal justice system,  with  a  degree  of  political  and  legal  impunity\".{{sfn|Mallon|2017|p=8}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Name==\nThe term \"punishment\" is controversial. According to [[Liam Kennedy (historian)|Liam Kennedy]], \"Not only has the label 'punishment' a euphemistic quality when applied to extremely cruel practices, it also carries a presumption that the victim is somehow deserving of what he (occasionally she) receives.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1995|p=86}}, cited in {{harvnb|Human Rights Watch|1997|loc=5.

In the 1970s, the [[Free Derry Police]] also operated independent of paramilitary groups. \"People's courts\" which mostly imposed sentences of [[community service]] based on a [[restorative justice]] approach operated in the early years of the conflict, but shut down due to police intimidation and because they did not have the authority of punishment imposed by paramilitaries.{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=153}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=44\u201345}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|p=439}} In nationalist  Belfast, the [[Catholic Ex-Servicemen's Association]] initially played a role in keeping order.{{sfn|Knox|Monaghan|2002|pp=31\u201332}} At the same time, Protestant  neighbourhoods began to organize defence groups in response to retaliatory raids.

Once  a crime had been reported to Sinn F\u00e9in, the party would assign its Civil Administration Officers to  investigate. Suspects often were  given the opportunity to defend themselves to Sinn F\u00e9in before the organization made a decision on their guilt or innocence. Sinn F\u00e9in could issue a  warning or pass the information to the IRA for punishment.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n==Causes==\nOne cause of vigilantism is the breakdown in law and order and lack of trust in the authorities.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=44, 52}}{{sfn|Jarman|2007|pp=3, 7}} According to anthropologist Neil Jarman, vigilantism emerged in both loyalist and republican areas due to the failings in state policing, a gap which paramilitaries ended up filling.{{sfn|Jarman|2007|pp=3, 7}} According to Munck, punishment attacks represent \"a sharp contest over the legitimacy of criminal justice within a society deeply divided along [[ethno-national]] lines\".{{sfn|Munck|1984|p=151}}  In republican neighbourhoods, the IRA was the only organization with the capability to offer an effective alternative to the British judicial system.{{sfn|Brooks|2019|p=211}}  The ideology of [[Sinn F\u00e9in (slogan)|self-reliance]] in defence from loyalist attacks came to extend to defending the community from crime, which created a cycle where the IRA was expected to deal with criminality but had no way to do so besides violent attacks.{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2001|pp=362\u2013363}}{{sfn|Jarman|2007|p=9}}{{efn|Some paramilitary groups do have the ability to hold prisoners captive for extended periods of time.

The IRA defined \"political\" crime as informing or fraternizing with British soldiers, while \"normal\" crime was judged to include vandalism, theft, joyriding, rape, selling drugs, and \"[[antisocial behavior]]\"\u2014anything from verbally abusing the elderly to dumping rubbish.  \"Normal\" crimes by first-time offenders were often dealt with by a restorative justice approach based on providing restitution to victims. The typical punishment for repeat offenders  was [[kneecapping]],  a malicious wounding of the knee with a bullet.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=44\u201345}} The IRA claimed that its methods were more lenient than those of other insurgent groups, such as the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Algerian FLN]] or the [[French resistance]], which Munck agrees with.{{sfn|Munck|1984|p=86}}\n\nThe IRA also punished its own members for misusing the organization's name, losing weapons, disobeying orders, or breaking other rules, and launched purges against other republican paramilitary groups such as the Irish People's  Liberation Organisation and the Official IRA. Within the IRA, those responsible for punishment belonged to auxiliary cells and were considered the \"dregs\" of the organization.  The IRA maintained distinct sections for internal and external punishment.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=46\u201347}} Although informers were usually executed, part of the IRA's strategy for defeating informers included periodic amnesties (usually announced after murders) during which anyone could admit to informing without punishment.{{sfn|Sarma|2013|p=254}} Around 1980, the system of punishment attacks was questioned by IRA figures, which resulted in the increase in warnings given. The IRA pledged to stop kneecapping in 1983, and both shootings and beatings drastically declined. However, soon community members were calling for more paramilitary attacks to combat an increase in crime, especially violent rapes.{{sfn|Munck|1984|pp=89\u201390}}{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=157}}\n\nOther republican paramilitary groups also punished offenders but on a smaller scale.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=46\u201347}} [[Direct Action Against Drugs]] was an IRA [[front group]] that claimed responsibility for some murders of alleged drug dealers beginning in 1995, allowing the IRA to pretend to follow the ceasefire.{{sfn|Moran|2009|p=32}} DAAD drew up a list of alleged drug dealers and crossed their names off the list as they were executed.<ref name=\"independent\" /> Other republican anti-drug vigilante groups include [[Republican Action Against Drugs]],<ref name=\"btelegraph\" />{{sfn|Morrison|2016|p=607}} [[Irish Republican Movement]],<ref name=\"McClements\" />  and [[Action Against Drugs]].<ref name=\"BBC3\"/> Along with conventional terrorism, punishment attacks are a major feature of the [[dissident Irish republican campaign]] carried out by the [[New IRA]] and other groups.{{sfn|Morrison|2016|p=599}} However, the attacks are controversial among dissident republicans, who question whether any benefit of the attacks is worth the internal division and alienation of youth.{{sfn|Morrison|2016|p=608}}\n\n===Loyalist groups===\n{{see also|loyalist feud}}\n[[File:Shopping in Shankill, Belfast. - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Shankill Road is a hotspot for loyalist attacks]]\nUlster loyalist paramilitaries, whilst not drawing on historical precedents, justified their role in terms of maintaining order and enforcing the law. Unlike republican vigilantes, however, they saw their role as aiding the  [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]  rather than subverting it. Nevertheless, they were prepared to mete out their own punishments in cases where they judged the  official justice system not to  deal harshly enough with the alleged offender. In 1971, the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA), the largest Ulster loyalist group, formed as a merger between various neighbourhood watch and vigilante groups. It adopted the motto {{lang|la|Codenta Arma Togae}} (\"law before violence\") and states that its aim is to see order restored throughout Northern Ireland. The UDA has collected evidence on petty crime and used vigilante punishment against criminals, antisocial elements, rival Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups, and as a means of discipline within groups. It also used the  threat of punishment in order to  conscript new members.  The [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) used to patrol the [[Shankill, Belfast|Shankill]] neighbourhood in Belfast. Criminals were warned or reported to the official police.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=49}}\n\nBetween 1973 and 1985, loyalists were responsible for many fewer punishment attacks than republicans, due to a view that their role was protecting Protestants from Catholics rather than enforcing rules within Protestant communities. From 1985 to 1998, they were responsible for a similar number of attacks. According to insider [[Sammy Duddy]], the UDA stopped reporting offenders to the police and started to engage in punishment shootings because the police was pressuring the offenders to inform on loyalist groups.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=134\u2013135}} Since the Good Friday Agreement, loyalists have committed significantly more punishment attacks than republicans.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=136}} The increase in punishment attacks has been attributed to increasing mistrust of official law enforcement, ineffectiveness at controlling petty crime, and perceived leniency of sentences.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=51}} Both the UDA and UVF have less internal discipline than the IRA,{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2001|p=364}}{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=136}} which means that an order to stop would be difficult to enforce. Loyalist groups' punishment style is more haphazard and groups who cannot find their intended target have been known to attack an innocent Catholic individual.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=136}} Individuals have joined loyalist paramilitaries to avoid a punishment attack from a rival group.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=50}}\n\nIn 1996, newspapers reported that the UVF had set up a \"court\" in Skanhill which fined  offenders for various offenses, but according to sociologist  Heather Hamill this is more likely a reflection of ability to pay rather than a genuine justice system  based on severity of the offence. In 2003, the North Belfast branch of the UDA announced that it was ceasing violent punishments in favour of \"naming and shaming\" offenders, who were forced to stand with placards announcing their offence. This change proved short lived.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=137}}\n\n==Attacks==\n===Overview===\nThe punishment methods of republican and loyalist paramilitaries are similar.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=50}} Because paramilitaries rely on popular support, they cannot overstep community consensus on appropriate punishment without risking the loss of support.{{sfn|Munck|1984|p=86}} The penalty chosen would be based on the crime and potentially mitigating or aggravating factors such as criminal history, age, gender, and family background.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=46, 52}} Crime against targets valued by the community, such as religious leaders, pensioners, community centers, or locally owned businesses, tended to be punished more harshly than crimes against large corporations, which were frequently ignored.{{sfn|Brewer ''et al.''|1998|p=579}} Punishment attacks often begin when masked paramilitaries break into the victim's home.{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=154}}  In other cases, victims would be told to show up at a certain time and place, either at a political front organization or at their home, for the attack.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}}{{sfn|Silke|1998|p=132}} Many victims keep these appointments because if they fail to do so, the punishment will be escalated in severity.{{sfn|Silke|1998|p=132}} These appointments are more likely to be made by republican than loyalist groups.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=50}} Some victims were able to negotiate the type of punishment.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=34, 69, 71}} In order to avoid the victims dying, paramilitaries frequently call emergency services after the attack.{{sfn|Peyton|2002|p=s54}} In  cases of mistaken identity, the IRA was known to issue apologies after the fact.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}}\n\nInitially, both republican and loyalist paramilitaries were reluctant to shoot or seriously harm women and children  younger than 16, although this became more frequent as the Troubles continued.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=46, 52}} Even female informers were usually subject to humiliation-type punishment rather than physical violence.{{sfn|Sarma|2013|p=252}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=46}} There were exceptions, such as the case of accused informer [[Jean McConville]], who was kidnapped and killed in 1972.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=46}}\n\n===Non-physical===\nMore minor punishments, often used on first offenders, are warnings, promises not to offend again, curfews, and fines.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=46}}{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=154}} Parents sometimes request that their child be warned in order to keep him or her from greater involvement in delinquency.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=69}} During the 1970s, when the IRA had the most control over established \"[[no-go area#Northern Ireland|no-go zones]]\",  humiliation was often used as a form of punishment. The victim was forced to hold a placard or [[tarred and feathered]]. In republican areas, women accused of fraternizing with British soldiers had their heads shaved. The use of such types of humiliation was greatest in the 1970s and decreased due to the risk of getting caught and complaints from [[Derry Women's Aid]] that the practice was misogynistic.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=46}}{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=76\u201377}}\n\nSometimes paramilitaries would approach a person and ask them to leave West Belfast{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=70\u201371}} or Northern Ireland within a certain period of time (such as 48 hours), with an implicit  threat of serious injury or execution if they did not comply.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}}{{sfn|Silke|1998|p=131}} It could be applied arbitrarily when paramilitaries go out looking for the victim but cannot find him, they will issue an expulsion order to friends or relatives.{{sfn|Silke|1998|p=132}} Expulsion was an alternative to violence favoured by paramilitaries because it removed the offender from the community whilst avoiding bloodshed.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}} However, victims frequently experienced it as the worst form of attack short of execution. Most victims are young, unemployed and lack educational qualifications as well as the skills and savings needed to establish themselves in a new area.{{sfn|Silke|1998|pp=124, 131}} Expulsion can be a life sentence but usually it lasts between three months and two years. Some victims, although they have not been convicted of any crime, go to juvenile detention centres to avoid punishment until their sentence expires.{{sfn|Silke|1998|p=132}}\n\n===Beatings===\n[[File:Weapons used against paramilitary punishment victims, 1997\u20132017.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Weapons used against paramilitary punishment victims who required orthopedic treatment, 1997\u20132017. GSW refers to [[gunshot wound]].]]\nSome individuals report that the attack was quite mild and no more than a \"cuff around the ear\" or being slapped around. Other beatings are more severe and the victim ends up in hospital for considerable period of time. Beatings are accomplished with instruments such as baseball bats, hammers, golf clubs, hurley sticks, iron bars,  concrete blocks, and cudgels (often studded with nails). The resulting injury can be quite  severe, involving flesh split by nails, broken skulls, broken limbs, punctured lungs, and other serious damage.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=72\u201373}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}}{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|p=11}} More injuries affected the limbs than the torso. In some cases, paramilitaries used powered drills and hacksaws to directly injure bone.{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|p=740\u2013741}} Beatings became more severe after the 1994 ceasefires due to the reduction in shootings, and were often accomplished with baseball bats and similar implements studded with six-inch nails.{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|p=11}} In the worst cases, individuals were hung from railings and nailed to fences in a form of [[crucifixion]].{{sfn|Jarman|2007|p=9}} \n\n===Shootings===\n{{see also|Kneecapping}}\nVictims are typically shot in the knees,  ankles, thighs, elbows, ankles, or a combination of the above.{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2001|p=360}} Kneecapping is considered a \"trademark\" of the IRA,{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=74}} although it became less popular over time because the disability and mortality incurred was unpopular with the community. It was replaced with low-velocity shots aimed at the soft tissue in the lower limbs. As a result, \"kneecapping\" is frequently a misnomer because by the 2010s most injuries targeted the [[femur]] or [[Popliteus muscle|popliteal]] area rather than the knee joint.{{sfn|McGarry ''et al.''|2017|p=93}}{{sfn|Peyton|2002|p=s54}}{{sfn|Lau ''et al.''|2017|p=747}} Typically, the victim is forced to lie face down and shot from behind.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=74}} Republican paramilitaries tended to shoot side to side while loyalists shot back to front, causing more severe damage.{{sfn|Peyton|2002|p=s54}} As with beatings, there are various degrees of shooting, with the number of shots, proximity to a joint, and the [[calibre]] of the firearm depending on the severity of the offence. If the victim is shot in the fleshy  part of the thigh, it will heal quickly with little damage. On the other hand, if they are shot directly in the joint it can cause permanent disability.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}}{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=74\u201375}}  An especially severe form is the \"six pack\", during which a victim is shot in both knees, elbows, and ankles.{{sfn|McGarry ''et al.''|2017|p=93}} Depending on the attack, shooting can leave relatively minor injuries compared to a severe beating,{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|p=12}}{{sfn|Knox|Dickson|2002|p=2}} with one NHS doctor estimating that 50% of those with such injuries will  have only minor scars.<ref name=\"Brutality\" /> The IRA sought the advice of doctors in how to cause serious but non-lethal injury. They were advised to shoot the ankles and wrists instead of the knees because it lessened the risk of the victim bleeding out, as happened to [[Murder of Andrew Kearney|Andrew Kearney]] in 1998.<ref name=\"doctors\" /> The harshest punishments are for informing, which typically results in execution.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|pp=45, 50}}{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\n===Consequences===\n[[File:Knee injury from punishment attack.png|thumb|left|Knee injury caused by a punishment shooting]]\nAccording to psychiatrist Oscar Daly, who treats victims of the attacks, the characteristics of those who tend to be victims\u2014such as poor parenting and preexisting mental health problems\u2014make them more vulnerable to psychological [[sequelae]]. A 1995 study found that symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], such as [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], [[hypervigilance]], difficulty concentrating, and attempts to numb or minimize the incident, are common in youth who survive a punishment attack. According Hamill's research, desire to escape fear and the feeling of powerlessness can contribute to problems with alcoholism and  drug  abuse.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|pp=77\u201378}} More than one third of her subjects suffered from extended bouts of depression following attacks  and 22% said that they had attempted suicide.{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=79}}{{sfn|Mallon ''et al.''|2019|p=2}} Mallon analyzed the 402 suicides in Northern Ireland between 2007 and 2009 and identified nineteen cases in which young men had killed themselves after being threatened with punishment attacks for alleged criminal or anti-social behaviour.{{sfn|Mallon ''et al.''|2019|p=4}}\n\nIn 2002, the [[National Health Service]] estimated that it spent at least \u00a31.5m annually on treating the victims of punishment attacks.<ref name=paramilitary-style/> Depending on the time period under consideration, the per-patient cost of treating victims who have been physically attacked varies from \u00a32,855 (2012\u20132013) to \u00a36,017 (pre-1994)  in 2015 pounds. These figures only include the first hospital admission and therefore do not include the cost of treating resulting psychological disorders. The lower cost is due both to less severe attacks and improved treatment techniques.{{sfn|McGarry ''et al.''|2017|p=92}} Many victims were treated at [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast]], which developed expertise in dealing with the particular injuries involved.{{sfn|Munck|1984|p=90}}{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|p=740\u2013741}} Punishment beatings often leave victims with serious injuries and permanently disabled.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=47}} Kneecapping often resulted in neurovascular damage which had to be treated with weeks in the hospital and extensive outpatient rehabilitation.{{sfn|Barr|Mollan|1989|p=740\u2013741}} However, medical advancements allowed most victims to regain most function in their limbs.{{sfn|Lau ''et al.''|2017|p=750}} Between 1969 and 2003, 13 patients treated at [[Musgrave Park Hospital]] in Belfast required leg amputation because of kneecapping attacks.{{sfn|Graham|Parke|2004|p=229}}\n\nIf considered \"innocent victims of violent crime\", victims of punishment attacks (like others injured by paramilitaries) are eligible for compensation by the [[Compensation Agency]] of the Northern Ireland Office.{{sfn|Knox|Dickson|2002|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n==Statistics==\n[[File:Punishment attacks in Northern Ireland, 1973\u20132008.png|frameless|right|upright=1.6]]\nPolice received reports  of 6,106 punishment attacks between 1973 and 2015, of which 3,113 incidents were attributed to loyalists and  2,993 to republicans.<ref name=\"rt\u00e9\" /> At least 115 people were killed by these attacks between 1973 and 2000.{{sfn|Silke|2000|loc=abstract}} There have been additional deaths since then, such as multiple murders claimed by Republican Action Against Drugs and the killing of Michael McGibbon in 2016.<ref>{{cite news |title=Timeline of Irish dissident activity |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-10866072 |accessdate=3 December 2019 |work=BBC News |date=10 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC3\" /> These statistics only include incidents reported to the police, and are therefore an underestimate.{{sfn|Monaghan|2002|p=51}} Pressure group [[Families Against Intimidation and Terror]] claims that it is a 30\u201350% underestimate,{{sfn|Knox|2002|pp=174, 176}} while according to Sharon Mallon, underreporting makes accurate measurement of these attacks impossible.{{sfn|Mallon|2017|p=3}} No statistics exist for other forms of penalties, such as expulsion,{{efn|Belfast victim-support group Base 2 knows of 453 people who were expelled between 1994 and 1996.

Resistance is rarely attempted, because most victims perceive their situation to be hopeless. Sometimes, if a bystander steps in to defend the targeted person, they will be attacked as well.{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|pp=6\u20138}} About three-quarters of attacks take place between 16:00 and midnight; the majority begin in the victim's residence (often they are abducted and taken elsewhere for the main attack).{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|p=9}} Most loyalist attacks involve between three and five attackers, but two-thirds of IRA attacks involve five or more attackers.{{sfn|Silke|Taylor|2002|p=10}} \n\nAfter a decrease in the early 2000s, punishment attacks are increasing again.{{sfn|Mallon ''et al.''|2019|p=2}}{{sfn|Topping|Byrne|2012|p=42}} In 2018, [[Community Restorative Justice Ireland]] estimated that each year there are 250-300 threats, significantly higher than the number reported to PSNI.<ref name=\"BBC3\" /> Between July 2018 and June 2019, 81 punishment attacks were reported to the police, on average more than one every four days.<ref name=\"itimes\" /> From January to November 2019, 68 attacks were reported.<ref>{{cite news |last1=O'Doherty |first1=Malachi |title=Thugs behind 'punishment' attacks act as if they enjoy some sort of community endorsement... shamefully, they're not wrong |url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/columnists/malachi-odoherty/malachi-odoherty-thugs-behind-punishment-attacks-act-as-if-they-enjoy-some-sort-of-community-endorsement-shamefully-theyre-not-wrong-38735976.html |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |date=28 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Victims==\n===\"Hoods\"===\nMost victims come from a delinquent youth subculture colloquially known as \"hoods\".{{sfn|Hamill|2011|p=98, ''passim''}}{{sfn|Jarman|2007|p=8}}{{sfn|Munck|1984|p=91}} Offences that they commit range from organized drug dealing to joyriding.{{sfn|Munck|1984|p=91}} Hoods continue to offend even though they know that this puts them at high risk of punishment.

In the first eight years, it helped more than 1,000 people stay in their communities and avoid punishment attacks.{{sfn|Conway |1997|pp=109-110}} Since then, there have been community-based attempts to mediate conflict between paramilitaries and their targets via a restorative justice approach. These interventions have included verifying if an individual is under sentence of expulsion, helping such individuals relocate elsewhere, and eventually reintegrating them into the community.{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2001|p=368}} Alleged offenders may be offered mediation with the wronged party and asked to offer restitution or perform community service. As part of the programme, they have to stop the behaviour and cease using alcohol and drugs. These are voluntary programmes, and require the agreement of both parties. Some offenders prefer the official justice system or to suffer paramilitary punishment.{{sfn|Jarman|2007|pp=11-12}}\n\nSinn F\u00e9in supported restorative justice, which was endorsed by the IRA in 1999; the organization also asked locals to stop requesting punishment attacks.{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2001|p=369}} About this time, Community Restorative Justice Ireland (CRJI) was established to coordinate restorative justice initiatives in republican areas.{{sfn|McEvoy|Mika|2002|p=537}}{{sfn|Feenan|2002b|p=167}} The RUC's opposition to the centres made them ideologically acceptable to

study by [[Atlantic Philanthropies]], Alternatives prevented 71% of punishment attacks by loyalists and CRJI prevented 81% of attacks by republicans.{{sfn|Cody|2008|p=556}} Critics argue that the

This would be her first botanical exploration trip to Mexico. Once in Mexico, Mex\u00eda decided that she could accomplish more on her own and abandoned the group, traveling the country for two years and collecting more than 1,500 specimens.<ref name=\":5\" /> The trip resulted in 500 species being collected, including one named in Mex\u00eda's honor, ''Mimosa mexiae''.

Mex\u00eda was said to be more interested in exploration and discovery rather than preparing her specimens, but her legacy lives on through those preserved botanical collections.<ref name=\":5\" /> In her will, Mex\u00eda left enough money to the California Academy of Sciences to hire Bracelin as an assistant to Alice Eastwood.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMex\u00eda was an active member of many scientific societies, including the [[California Botanical Society]], the [[Sierra Club]], the Audubon Association of the Pacific, the Sociedad Geogr\u00e1fica de Lima, and the California Academy of Sciences.

It has now since dissolved due to lack of time.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe band released their debut album ''Lamentations'' on England's [[Candlelight Records]] in 1994 and caught the attention of an underground scene that was at that point swept up with the still new second wave of black metal. Successive UK and European tours, with Count Raven and Anathema respectively, firmly cemented the band as something of a cult act across the continent.\n\n1996 saw the release of the ''Halcyon'' EP on Black Tears, comfortably conveying the strength and progression of that line-up, while further embracing their English Heavy Metal roots but with an aesthetic that shows the band were not afraid to court a more sinister undercurrent. Shortly after, however, Solstice once again suffered line-up problems that essentially resulted in the band becoming largely dormant. In 1998, the band signed with [[Misanthropy Records]], which helped with the release of ''New Dark Age'', but the band was painfully laid to rest in 2002.\n\nIn 2007, Solstice was re-ignited. after a five-year hiatus, Walker commented that he was inspired to continue Solstice after enlisting the services of Andrew Whittaker from The Lamp Of Thoth.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}The recruitment of Paul Bwitton on vocals and Richard Horton on drums (both formerly of NWOBHM outfit Scarab) proved fruitless, but undeterred the band had Procession singer Felipe temporarily fill the vocalist position in order to honour live commitments.\n\nBuoyed by this success, Solstice set about recruiting a full-time vocalist with whom they could move forward and so in the Summer of 2011 they welcomed Paul Thomas Kearns into the lineup. An Irishman living in Oslo, Kearns had appeared on one album with disbanded Irish Doom/Death Metal outfit [[Arcane Sun]]. The new line-up of Solstice made their live debut supporting [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]] in the latter's 20 years anniversary show at Dublin's Academy on 24 September 2011.

It has now since dissolved due to lack of time.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe band released their debut album ''Lamentations'' on England's [[Candlelight Records]] in 1994 and caught the attention of an underground scene that was at that point swept up with the still new second wave of black metal. Successive UK and European tours, with Count Raven and Anathema respectively, firmly cemented the band as something of a cult act across the continent.\n\n1996 saw the release of the ''Halcyon'' EP on Black Tears, comfortably conveying the strength and progression of that line-up, while further embracing their English Heavy Metal roots but with an aesthetic that shows the band were not afraid to court a more sinister undercurrent. Shortly after, however, Solstice once again suffered line-up problems that essentially resulted in the band becoming largely dormant. In 1998, the band signed with [[Misanthropy Records]], which helped with the release of ''New Dark Age'', but the band was painfully laid to rest in 2002.\n\nIn 2007, Solstice was re-ignited. after a five-year hiatus, Walker commented that he was inspired to continue Solstice after enlisting the services of Andrew Whittaker from The Lamp Of Thoth.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}The recruitment of Paul Bwitton on vocals and Richard Horton on drums (both formerly of NWOBHM outfit Scarab) proved fruitless, but undeterred the band had Procession singer Felipe temporarily fill the vocalist position in order to honour live commitments.\n\nBuoyed by this success, Solstice set about recruiting a full-time vocalist with whom they could move forward and so in the Summer of 2011 they welcomed Paul Thomas Kearns into the lineup. An Irishman living in Oslo, Kearns had appeared on one album with disbanded Irish Doom/Death Metal outfit [[Arcane Sun]]. The new line-up of Solstice made their live debut supporting [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]] in the latter's 20 years anniversary show at Dublin's Academy on 24 September 2011. Del Nichol replaced Richard Horton on drums later in 2011 and was also replaced nine months later by Deceptor's drummer James Ashbey.\n\nSolstice ended their 12-year absence from the recording studio in early 2013 with the release of their Mini LP ''Death's Crown is Victory'',  issued on their own \"White Horse\" imprint.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Covid 19 new cases and deaths China showing Hubei lockdown.png|thumb|325px|Semi-log graph of new cases and deaths in China during Covid-19 epidemic showing the lockdown and lifting]]\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Covid 19 new cases and deaths China showing Hubei lockdown.png|thumb|right|325px|Semi-log graph of new cases and deaths in China during Covid-19 epidemic showing the lockdown and lifting]]\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.
