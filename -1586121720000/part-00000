city|independent component city]] in the [[Philippine province|province]] of [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] in the [[Philippine region|region]] of [[Eastern Visayas]] of the [[Philippines]]. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} inhabitants,{{PH census|current}} making it the second most-populous city in the [[Leyte (province)|province]] after the provincial capital, [[Tacloban City]]. Ormoc is the economic, cultural, commercial and transportation hub of western Leyte.\n\nOrmoc City is an independent component city, not subject to regulation from the Provincial Government of Leyte. However, the city is part of the [[Congressional Districts of Leyte|4th Congressional District of Leyte]] together with [[Albuera, Leyte|Albuera]], [[Kananga, Leyte|Kananga]], [[Merida, Leyte|Merida]], [[Palompon]] and [[Isabel, Leyte|Isabel]], and statistically grouped under the province by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]. On November 8, 2013, the city was extensively damaged by [[Super Typhoon Yolanda]] (Haiyan), having previously suffered severe destruction and loss of life in 1991 from torrential flooding during [[Tropical Storm Thelma]] (Uring).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.finwaze.com/cebu-ceo-visits-ormoc-city-engages-financial-literacy-common-people/|publisher=FINWAZE.com|accessdate=December 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe city's name is derived from ''ogmok'', an [[Visayan languages|archaic Visayan]] term for \"lowland\" or \"depressed plain\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://filipinohomes.com/ormoc|publisher=Filipino Homes|accessdate=November 22, 2018}}</ref> The city also celebrates an annual thanksgiving festival called the ''Pi\u00f1a Festival'' in honor of the saints Peter and Paul in thanks for the bountiful pineapple harvest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bastaigatsikat.com/2013/10/tugob-ormoc-city-festival.html|website=bastaigatsikat.com|accessdate=November 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOrmoc City is a port city and is the largest city in Leyte by land area and the second largest in Eastern Visayas after [[Calbayog City]] in Samar. At the head of [[Ormoc Bay]], the city's terrain is mostly of gently rolling plains. It is bounded on the northwest by the towns of [[Matag-ob, Leyte|Matag-ob]] and [[Merida, Leyte|Merida]], in the north by [[Kananga, Leyte|Kananga]], in the northeast by the towns of [[Jaro, Leyte|Jaro]], [[Pastrana, Leyte|Pastrana]] and [[Dagami, Leyte|Dagami]], and in the south by the town of [[Albuera, Leyte|Albuera]]. High mountain ranges separate Ormoc from the eastern portion of Leyte. Numerous rivers and streams traverse Ormoc. Among them are the Bao River in the north, Pagsangahan River in the west, the Bagong-bong River in the south, the Panilahan River also in the south and the Anilao and Malbasag Rivers which border the eastern and western flanks of Ormoc City Proper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vigattintourism.com/tourism/articles/Ormoc-City-Leyte|website=vigattintourism.com|accessdate=December 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Barangays===\nOrmoc City is politically subdivided into 110 [[barangay]]s.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=17em}}\n* Airport\n* Alegria\n* Alta Vista\n* Bagongbong\n* Bagong Buhay\n* Bantigue\n* Barangay District 1  ([[Poblacion|Pob.]])\n* Barangay District 2 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 3 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 4 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 5 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 6 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 7 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 8 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 9 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 10 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 11 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 12 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 13 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 14 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 15 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 16 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 17 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 18 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 19 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 20 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 21 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 22 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 23 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 24 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 25 (Malbasag) ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 26 (Isla Verde)([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 27 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 28 ([[Poblacion]])\n* Barangay District 29 (Nadongholan) ([[Poblacion]])\n* Batuan\n* Bayog\n* Biliboy\n* Cabaon-an\n* Cabintan\n* Cabulihan\n* Cagbuhangin\n* Camp Downes\n* Can-adieng\n* Can-untog\n* Catmon\n* Cogon Combado\n* Concepcion\n* Curva\n* Danhug (Lili-on)\n* Dayhagan\n* Dolores\n* Domonar\n* Don Carlos B.

It is located 20&nbsp;km west of its sister city [[C\u00f3rdoba, Veracruz|C\u00f3rdoba]], and is adjacent to [[R\u00edo Blanco, Veracruz|R\u00edo Blanco]] and [[Ixtaczoquitl\u00e1n]], on [[Mexican Federal Highway|Federal Highways 180 and 190]]. The city had a 2005 census population of 117,273 and is almost coextensive with its small municipality, with only a few small areas outside the city. The municipality's population was 117,289 and it has an area of 27.97&nbsp;km\u00b2 (10.799 sq mi).\n\n==Naming==\nIt is generally understood that the name ''Orizaba'' comes from a Hispanicized pronunciation of the [[Nahuatl]] name ''\u0100huiliz\u0101pan'' [''a: wi li sa: pan''], which means \"place of pleasing waters.\" Another possibility, however, is the word Harish ([[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Andalusia]], in 16th-century Spanish pronunciation), this place being the hometown of the first Spanish settlers (1521) of Orizaba. Harish or\u2014in a simplified form\u2014Ariz, with the addition (under the influence of the Arabic language) of the gentilic \"i\" and/or with the ending \"aba\", meaning fortification, would have become Ariziba or Arizaba, from which Orizaba would have derived. (The word Harish\u2014in turn\u2014is, according to some authors, linked to the capital of Tartessus and could refer to the biblical Tarshish. Its Semitic meaning could be \"trading post\" or \"foundry site\", since Tartessus was a major Phoenician center of tin commerce and bronze production.)\n\n==Geography and inhabitants==\nOrizaba has an unusually wet dry-winter [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''Cwb''').\n\n[[Image:Orizaba and Pico.jpg|thumb|250px|The Orizaba Valley<br>Looking north, Orizaba in the middle distance, the Pico de Orizaba on the horizon]]\nThe town lies at 1,200 m. (4000&nbsp;ft.), at the confluence of the ''R\u00edo Blanco'' with several tributaries, including the R\u00edo Orizaba, near the mouth of a large valley heading westward into the eastern [[Sierra Madre Oriental]]. This location, at the bottom of the ascent into the mountains, is an important transition point along what has been for centuries the main trade route between [[Mexico City]] and Veracruz on the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] Coast. The climate is generally pleasant, though often cloudy and rainy, and the soil of the Orizaba valley is extraordinarily fertile. Overlooking the valley from the north is the [[Pico de Orizaba]] (Citlalt\u00e9petl), a volcano that, at 5,636 m. (18,490&nbsp;ft.), is the highest mountain in Mexico and third highest in North America.\n\nIn the town of Ixhuatlancillo north of Orizaba, and in a large mountainous area to the south (the [[Sierra de Zongolica]]), live many thousands of people who speak a variant of [[Nahuatl]] which is often called [[Orizaba Nahuatl]] ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] code nlv).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Orizaba (1981\u20132000)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 31.5\n|Feb record high C = 33.2\n|Mar record high C = 36.2\n|Apr record high C = 37.3\n|May record high C = 38.4\n|Jun record high C = 35.2\n|Jul record high C = 30.0\n|Aug record high C = 29.6\n|Sep record high C = 31.0\n|Oct record high C = 31.0\n|Nov record high C = 32.5\n|Dec record high C = 30.0\n|year record high C = 38.4\n|Jan high C = 21.0\n|Feb high C = 22.2\n|Mar high C = 24.1\n|Apr high C = 26.5\n|May high C = 27.4\n|Jun high C = 26.4\n|Jul high C = 25.1\n|Aug high C = 25.5\n|Sep high C = 25.2\n|Oct high C = 23.6\n|Nov high C = 23.0\n|Dec high C = 21.3\n|year high C = 24.3\n|Jan mean C = 14.8\n|Feb mean C = 15.9\n|Mar mean C = 17.4\n|Apr mean C = 19.5\n|May mean C = 20.9\n|Jun mean C = 20.8\n|Jul mean C = 19.6\n|Aug mean C = 19.8\n|Sep mean C = 20.1\n|Oct mean C = 18.4\n|Nov mean C = 17.1\n|Dec mean C = 15.7\n|year mean C = 18.3\n|Jan low C = 8.5\n|Feb low C = 9.5\n|Mar low C = 10.7\n|Apr low C = 12.6\n|May low C = 14.3\n|Jun low C = 15.1\n|Jul low C = 14.2\n|Aug low C = 14.1\n|Sep low C = 15.0\n|Oct low C = 13.3\n|Nov low C = 11.3\n|Dec low C = 10.1\n|year low C = 12.4\n|Jan record low C = -1.0\n|Feb record low C = 0.5\n|Mar record low C = 1.0\n|Apr record low C = 3.2\n|May record low C = 6.5\n|Jun record low C = 8.8\n|Jul record low C = 8.5\n|Aug record low C = 6.4\n|Sep record low C = 1.2\n|Oct record low C = 1.3\n|Nov record low C = 1.0\n|Dec record low C = 0.2\n|year record low C = -1.0\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 33.1\n|Feb precipitation mm = 44.2\n|Mar precipitation mm = 36.0\n|Apr precipitation mm = 57.3\n|May precipitation mm = 92.8\n|Jun precipitation mm = 360.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 422.2\n|Aug precipitation mm = 397.6\n|Sep precipitation mm = 426.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 200.0\n|Nov precipitation mm = 69.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 54.1\n|year precipitation mm = 2193.3\n|Jan humidity = 79\n|Feb humidity = 76\n|Mar humidity = 73\n|Apr humidity = 72\n|May humidity = 74\n|Jun humidity = 78\n|Jul humidity = 81\n|Aug humidity = 80\n|Sep humidity = 82\n|Oct humidity = 82\n|Nov humidity = 80\n|Dec humidity = 81\n|year humidity = 78\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 11.1\n|Feb precipitation days = 11.0\n|Mar precipitation days = 9.6\n|Apr precipitation days = 10.7\n|May precipitation days = 11.0\n|Jun precipitation days = 23.7\n|Jul precipitation days = 26.4\n|Aug precipitation days = 26.5\n|Sep precipitation days = 25.5\n|Oct precipitation days = 20.6\n|Nov precipitation days = 11.4\n|Dec precipitation days = 12.5\n|year precipitation days = 200.0\n|Jan sun = 135\n|Feb sun = 125\n|Mar sun = 143\n|Apr sun = 147\n|May sun = 136\n|Jun sun = 122\n|Jul sun = 119\n|Aug sun = 137\n|Sep sun = 102\n|Oct sun = 114\n|Nov sun = 130\n|Dec sun = 128\n|year sun = 1539\n|source 1 = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional<ref name=obs>{{cite web\n |url         = http://smn.cna.gob.mx/observatorios/historica/orizaba.pdf\n |title       = NORMALES CLIMATOL\u00d3GICAS 1981\u20132000\n |publisher   = Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional\n |language    = Spanish\n |accessdate  = February 13, 2016\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160213172213/http://smn.cna.gob.mx/observatorios/historica/orizaba.pdf\n |archivedate = February 13, 2016\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==History==\n\n=== Prehistory and conquest ===\nOrizaba was already an important town at the time of the Spanish conquest, and it was in Orizaba that [[La Malinche]], [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]'s interpreter and mistress, was married to the Spanish gentleman [[Juan Jaramillo]]. A plaque at the Temple of \"The Immaculate Conception\" in [[Huiloapan de Cuauht\u00e9moc|Huiloapan]] commemorates this event.\n\n=== Colonial period ===\nDuring the colonial period, Orizaba became an important city. On January 27, 1774, the Spanish king [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] conceded town status (''villa'') to Orizaba, and on November 29, 1830 Orizaba was declared a city.\n\n=== Independence war ===\nIn October 1812, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]] captured the city for the insurgent army. In 1821 to the end of the war, [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] was in Orizaba before and after the signature of the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] in the neighbor city.\n\n=== Independent period ===\n[[File:Palacio de Hierro en 1910.jpg|thumb|Orizaba during the [[History of Mexico#The Porfiriato (1876\u20131910)|Porfiriato]].]]\nWhen [[Lucas Alam\u00e1n]] established, in 1836, the first textile factory (''Cocolapan'' factory) of Orizaba, the city started its economic life as an industrial city.\n\nIn 1839 the newspaper ''La Luz'' was created and the Veracruz by the governor Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez y Hern\u00e1ndez gave the name of ''Veracruz-Llave'' (remembering the General [[Ignacio de la Llave]], who was born in Orizaba) to this state of Mexico.\n\nOn May 8, 1874, Orizaba was declared the capital city of [[Veracruz]] by the governor Apolinar Castillo, but in 1878 the status was transferred to [[Xalapa]].\n\nDuring the government of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]],  Orizaba was declared the most educated city in the Mexican province.\n\nIn the late years of Porfirio D\u00edaz' Government, two important workers' strikes occurred, those of [[Cananea strike|Cananea]] and [[R\u00edo Blanco strike|R\u00edo Blanco]], the latter taking place in Orizaba and being an important prelude to the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nThe American World War I and World War II transport ship [[USS Orizaba (ID-1536)]] was named after this town.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Orizaba5.jpg|thumbnail|The ''Palacio Municipal'']]\nThe Orizaba's area (including the municipalities of [[Ixtaczoquitl\u00e1n]], [[R\u00edo Blanco, Veracruz|R\u00edo Blanco]], [[Nogales, Veracruz|Nogales]] and Cd. Mendoza) economy has grown significantly in the last years due to the safety of the area, being of great confidence for national and foreign investors who wants to establish in a safe place. Another important reason is the presence of recognised Universities like [[Universidad Veracruzana]], Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Orizaba or Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey Campus Central de Veracruz en C\u00f3rdoba.\nThe industry is mainly focused in the following areas: breweries, paper, cement, pharmaceutical, iron and steel sector, soft drinks and food, leather and shoemaker companies among others. Also in the last years the commercial area experiments a significant growth due to the opening of new Malls & Major Retailers.\nIt is one of the cheapest cities to live and invest in M\u00e9xico, as Mercer consultory  published in the \"Estudio de costo de la vida nacional 2012\"; this study includes 42 localities of M\u00e9xico, and was done comparing 182 products and services.\n\nThe inquiry also disclose that Orizaba's Valley will grow 10% in 2013, due to the lack of pollution, existence of enough water and other points like price of housing.\n\n==Main sights==\n[[File:Orizaba palacio hierro.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Art Nouveau]] ''Palacio de Hierro'']]\nThe old city hall ''El Palacio de Hierro'' (The Iron Palace) in the centre of the city was designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]] and built from 1891 to 1894.<ref name=\"LPM\">{{cite book |last1=Planet |first1=Lonely |last2=Noble |first2=John |last3=Armstrong |first3=Kate |last4=Butler |first4=Stuart |last5=Hecht |first5=John |last6=Kaminski |first6=Anna |last7=Masters |first7=Tom |last8=Quintero |first8=Josephine |last9=Sainsbury |first9=Brendan |last10=Symington |first10=Andy |title=Lonely Planet Mexico |date=2016 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=9781786572981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_bXMDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT542&dq=palacio+de+hierro+gustave+eiffel+orizaba&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLrsvJi_LdAhXNT98KHQjgCwkQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=palacio%20de%20hierro%20gustave%20eiffel%20orizaba&f=false |language=en}}</ref> Built with 600 tons of Belgian steel, its parts were shipped from [[Belgium]] during the ''Porfiriato'' (the government of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], 1876\u20131911), to be assembled in Orizaba. The palace cost 100,000 pesos (gold), equivalent to about 21.3 million pesos or 1.1 million [[United States dollar|USD]] as of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://0cmb.atwebpages.com/calce.html|title=Mexico Inflation Calculator|website=0cmb.atwebpages.com|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref> It was Don [[Manuel Carrillo Tablas]] who not only loaned the money to the city, but also had to pay the additional cost of unloading the palace from the port and having it reassembled at its present location, the Plaza de Armas. Unfortunately, Don Manuel died New Year's Eve of 1899 without ever having received a cent from the city for his loan. He was a very charitable man, though, having donated the land where the present Cathedral of Orizaba now stands, as well as the adjacent shopping center known as \"El Mercado.\" El Palacio de Hierro served as the City Hall until the city felt it was not large enough for the growing needs of the local government and therefore moved to its present location.\n\nOrizaba has an important industrial life. There is, for example, the [[Cervecer\u00eda Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma]] company (a [[brewery]]), which was established in 1896 in Orizaba.\n\nOther attractions for visitors include:\n\n* The new Telef\u00e9rico or cable-car to the top of Cerro Borrego, which offers views of Pico de Orizaba.

It is located 20&nbsp;km west of its sister city [[C\u00f3rdoba, Veracruz|C\u00f3rdoba]], and is adjacent to [[R\u00edo Blanco, Veracruz|R\u00edo Blanco]] and [[Ixtaczoquitl\u00e1n]], on [[Mexican Federal Highway|Federal Highways 180 and 190]]. The city had a 2005 census population of 117,273 and is almost coextensive with its small municipality, with only a few small areas outside the city. The municipality's population was 117,289 and it has an area of 27.97&nbsp;km\u00b2 (10.799 sq mi).\n\n==Naming==\nIt is generally understood that the name ''Orizaba'' comes from a Hispanicized pronunciation of the [[Nahuatl]] name ''\u0100huiliz\u0101pan'' [''a: wi li sa: pan''], which means \"place of pleasing waters.\" Another possibility, however, is the word Harish ([[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Andalusia]], in 16th-century Spanish pronunciation), this place being the hometown of the first Spanish settlers (1521) of Orizaba. Harish or\u2014in a simplified form\u2014Ariz, with the addition (under the influence of the Arabic language) of the gentilic \"i\" and/or with the ending \"aba\", meaning fortification, would have become Ariziba or Arizaba, from which Orizaba would have derived. (The word Harish\u2014in turn\u2014is, according to some authors, linked to the capital of Tartessus and could refer to the biblical Tarshish. Its Semitic meaning could be \"trading post\" or \"foundry site\", since Tartessus was a major Phoenician center of tin commerce and bronze production.)\n\n==Geography and inhabitants==\nOrizaba has an unusually wet dry-winter [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''Cwb''').\n\n[[Image:Orizaba and Pico.jpg|thumb|250px|The Orizaba Valley<br>Looking north, Orizaba in the middle distance, the Pico de Orizaba on the horizon]]\nThe town lies at 1,200 m. (4000&nbsp;ft.), at the confluence of the ''R\u00edo Blanco'' with several tributaries, including the R\u00edo Orizaba, near the mouth of a large valley heading westward into the eastern [[Sierra Madre Oriental]]. This location, at the bottom of the ascent into the mountains, is an important transition point along what has been for centuries the main trade route between [[Mexico City]] and Veracruz on the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] Coast. The climate is generally pleasant, though often cloudy and rainy, and the soil of the Orizaba valley is extraordinarily fertile. Overlooking the valley from the north is the [[Pico de Orizaba]] (Citlalt\u00e9petl), a volcano that, at 5,636 m.

On January 27, 1774, the Spanish king [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]] conceded town status (''villa'') to Orizaba, and on November 29, 1830 Orizaba was declared a city.\n\n=== Independence war ===\nIn October 1812, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]] captured the city for the insurgent army. In 1821 to the end of the war, [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] was in Orizaba before and after the signature of the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] in the neighbor city.\n\n=== Independent period ===\n[[File:Palacio de Hierro en 1910.jpg|thumb|Orizaba during the [[History of Mexico#The Porfiriato (1876\u20131910)|Porfiriato]].]]\nWhen [[Lucas Alam\u00e1n]] established, in 1836, the first textile factory (''Cocolapan'' factory) of Orizaba, the city started its economic life as an industrial city.\n\nIn 1839 the newspaper ''La Luz'' was created and the Veracruz by the governor Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez y Hern\u00e1ndez gave the name of ''Veracruz-Llave'' (remembering the General [[Ignacio de la Llave]], who was born in Orizaba) to this state of Mexico.\n\nOn May 8, 1874, Orizaba was declared the capital city of [[Veracruz]] by the governor Apolinar Castillo, but in 1878 the status was transferred to [[Xalapa]].\n\nDuring the government of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]],  Orizaba was declared the most educated city in the Mexican province.\n\nIn the late years of Porfirio D\u00edaz' Government, two important workers' strikes occurred, those of [[Cananea strike|Cananea]] and [[R\u00edo Blanco strike|R\u00edo Blanco]], the latter taking place in Orizaba and being an important prelude to the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nThe American World War I and World War II transport ship [[USS Orizaba (ID-1536)]] was named after this town.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Orizaba5.jpg|thumbnail|The ''Palacio Municipal'']]\nThe Orizaba\u2019s area (including the municipalities of [[Ixtaczoquitl\u00e1n]], [[R\u00edo Blanco, Veracruz|R\u00edo Blanco]], [[Nogales, Veracruz|Nogales]] and Cd. Mendoza) economy has grown significantly in the last years due to the safety of the area, being of great confidence for national and foreign investors who wants to establish in a safe place. Another important reason is the presence of recognised Universities like [[Universidad Veracruzana]], Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Orizaba or Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey Campus Central de Veracruz en C\u00f3rdoba.\nThe industry is mainly focused in the following areas: breweries, paper, cement, pharmaceutical, iron and steel sector, soft drinks and food, leather and shoemaker companies among others. Also in the last years the commercial area experiments a significant growth due to the opening of new Malls & Major Retailers.\nIt is one of the cheapest cities to live and invest in M\u00e9xico, as Mercer consultory  published in the \"Estudio de costo de la vida nacional 2012\"; this study includes 42 localities of M\u00e9xico, and was done comparing 182 products and services.\n\nThe inquiry also disclose that Orizaba's Valley will grow 10% in 2013, due to the lack of pollution, existence of enough water and other points like price of housing.\n\n==Main sights==\n[[File:Orizaba palacio hierro.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Art Nouveau]] ''Palacio de Hierro'']]\nThe old city hall ''El Palacio de Hierro'' (The Iron Palace) in the centre of the city was designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]] and built from 1891 to 1894.<ref name=\"LPM\">{{cite book |last1=Planet |first1=Lonely |last2=Noble |first2=John |last3=Armstrong |first3=Kate |last4=Butler |first4=Stuart |last5=Hecht |first5=John |last6=Kaminski |first6=Anna |last7=Masters |first7=Tom |last8=Quintero |first8=Josephine |last9=Sainsbury |first9=Brendan |last10=Symington |first10=Andy |title=Lonely Planet Mexico |date=2016 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=9781786572981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_bXMDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT542&dq=palacio+de+hierro+gustave+eiffel+orizaba&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLrsvJi_LdAhXNT98KHQjgCwkQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=palacio%20de%20hierro%20gustave%20eiffel%20orizaba&f=false |language=en}}</ref> Built with 600 tons of Belgian steel, its parts were shipped from [[Belgium]] during the ''Porfiriato'' (the government of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], 1876\u20131911), to be assembled in Orizaba. The palace cost 100,000 pesos (gold), equivalent to about 21.3 million pesos or 1.1 million [[United States dollar|USD]] as of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://0cmb.atwebpages.com/calce.html|title=Mexico Inflation Calculator|website=0cmb.atwebpages.com|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref> It was Don [[Manuel Carrillo Tablas]] who not only loaned the money to the city, but also had to pay the additional cost of unloading the palace from the port and having it reassembled at its present location, the Plaza de Armas. Unfortunately, Don Manuel died New Year's Eve of 1899 without ever having received a cent from the city for his loan. He was a very charitable man, though, having donated the land where the present Cathedral of Orizaba now stands, as well as the adjacent shopping center known as \"El Mercado.\" El Palacio de Hierro served as the City Hall until the city felt it was not large enough for the growing needs of the local government and therefore moved to its present location.\n\nOrizaba has an important industrial life. There is, for example, the [[Cervecer\u00eda Cuauht\u00e9moc Moctezuma]] company (a [[brewery]]), which was established in 1896 in Orizaba.\n\nOther attractions for visitors include:\n\n* The new Telef\u00e9rico or cable-car to the top of Cerro Borrego, which offers views of Pico de Orizaba.

It was established in 1911 by [[Vickers|Vickers Limited]] (the aircraft and weapons manufacturer) who used it as an airfield and testing ground. At the [[outbreak of World War I]] in 1914, the RFC followed and established a base. Subject to frequent flooding and a reputation as being unsuitable and too dangerous for training, it was eventually replaced by a more suitable site at [[RAF Biggin Hill]].\n\nThere were two parts to Joyce Green's military operations; the RFC, and the Wireless Experimental establishment. The latter were the first to move out in 1917 (after exhaustive searching south of London) when they found an ideal site on a farmer's field near the village of [[Biggin Hill]]; the RFC were soon to recognize the new site's suitability for flying and its strategic location, and soon followed, transferring there on 13 February 1917. The RFC took with them their [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]], leaving Joyce Green with only a pilots pool and ground crew.<ref name=bhphist>{{cite web | url = http://www.bigginhill.co.uk/rafstation.htm | title = R.A.F. Station Biggin Hill | publisher = Biggin Hill Productions | accessdate = 6 January 2007}}</ref> Once the RFC moved out the aerodrome, Vickers continued their testing work, until moving to [[Brooklands]] aerodrome. Following the [[Armistice with Germany]] the airfield was closed by December 1919.\n\n== The site ==\nJoyce Green farm, a cattle farm to the north of Dartford, lent its name to the largely uninhabited area {{convert|15|mi}} downstream of London Bridge, located between Dartford and the River Thames. The aerodrome itself was on part of a plot once known as Franks Farm, on ground reclaimed from the Dartford salt marshes.\n\nThe only habitation in the area, apart from the odd farm, was the isolated \"Long Reach Tavern\", known for organized [[bare-knuckle boxing]] matches in the 19th century, notably [[Tom Sayers]] who fought there between 1851-1854, and a ferry to [[Purfleet]] on the opposite bank of the Thames. A 'reach' is a length of a river between two bends and the longest reach on the Thames is 'Long Reach' hence the name of the Tavern. The surrounds of the tavern were to become the RFC encampment.\n\n1:62260/1:50000 OS map sheets 171/177 : (51): OS survey grid reference: TQ 542774. County: Kent, Area : 121 acres : 1200 x 1000 yards. Slightly below sea level.\n\nThe airfield consisted of a grass landing field, slightly below sea level, criss-crossed by ditches covered with boards; a {{convert|121|acre|ha}} site, 1200 x 1000 yards of low-lying marshland below [[Chart datum|mean tide level]], bordered by the [[River Darent]] to the west, the Thames to the north, the tavern's access road \"Joyce Green Lane\" (running north to south) to the east, and the grounds of the Joyce Green Hospitals to the south.\n\nFurther to the west of the tavern across the estuary of the River Darent was the Thames Ammunition factory. Along the river to its east was the nearby Long Reach Hospital, where the three [[smallpox]] isolation hospital ships had been moored on the Reach; they had been scrapped in 1904 leaving just the adjacent land-based hospital facilities intact. Further to the south and east were the Dartford [[salt marsh]]es. \n\nAlso in the area to the south were the Joyce Green and Orchard Hospitals with a small military (Army) unit attached to them. The hospitals were set up for the isolation of smallpox patients from London. Further to the south the main [[A206 road]] gave access to London. It is two miles from [[Dartford railway station]] and 1\u00bd miles from [[Erith railway station]].\n\nThe RFC buildings and camp were at the north end by the Thames, grouped to the immediate south and west of the Long Reach Tavern. The RFC had six [[hangar]]s in total; three aeroplane sheds, 80 x 60 feet, as a treble unit, and another three sheds, 80 x 50 feet, as a treble unit.\n\n== Vickers 1910-1919 ==\n\nThe site was first used in 1910 by [[Hiram Maxim]] who in conjunction with Vickers had built a [[biplane]] at Crayford, and at Joyce Green unsuccessfully attempted a test flight; without funds to continue developing his ideas, Maxim parted company with Vickers to form a new company with [[Louis Bleriot]] and [[Claude Grahame White]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Daniel |first1=Peter |title=Crayford A Magnificent Town and Its Flying Machines |url=http://www.bexley.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=5055&p=0|website=bexley.gov.uk|publisher=London Borough of Bexley |accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nVickers were to persist with aircraft development and establishing an (Aviation Department) in 1911, and promptly built hangars and workshop facilities at Joyce Green for testing the aeroplanes constructed at their [[Erith]] works. Vickers had factories at nearby [[Bexleyheath]], [[Crayford]], Erith and [[Dartford]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Vickers factories|url=http://www.bexley.gov.uk/article/10690/Vickers-of-Crayford-1888-1979|website=bexley.gov.uk|accessdate=18 February 2017}}</ref> The Vickers hangars and buildings were grouped at the south end of the site near to the entrance gates.\n\nOnce assembled aircraft were stripped down piece-small and moved by road from Erith, through the streets of Crayford to Joyce Green and returned the same way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vickers and streets of Dartford|url=http://www.kenthistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=3213.0|website=Kent History Forum|accessdate=18 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nVickers' first [[Vickers R.E.P.

(the rest of the components being Vickers-built), it made its maiden flight, piloted by Captain [[Herbert F. Wood]], the manager of Vickers' aviation department.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p35\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 35.</ref> \n\nDevelopment of the aircraft was rapid; the No. 8 monoplane was built by 1913 at the Erith factory. However the Army Manoeuvres in the autumn of 1912 proved disastrous for the type: four RFC officers were killed using monoplanes, and this led to a suspension of the type by the Military Wing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monoplane suspension|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/rfc_centenary/the-rfc/the-early-years.aspx|website=rafmuseum.org.uk|accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nShortly before the war started, among the many designs initiated by the Drawing Office was one known as the 'Hydravion', based on the notion that an aeroplane should be able to take off from water as well as from land. Floats, made of [[Duralumin]] at the Dartford works, were tested in the nearby River Darent. Archives at the company headquarters imply that the Hydravion was to be constructed at Dartford, despite the factory only producing explosives and projectiles at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vickers and Dartford|url=http://www.dartfordarchive.org.uk/technology/engin_vickers.shtml|website=dartfordarchive.org.uk|accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912 Vickers commenced work on a two-seat [[Pusher configuration|pusher]] [[biplane]], the [[Vickers E.F.B.1|F.B.1 (Fighting Biplane 1)]], it was one of the first aircraft designed to carry a machine gun, the FB5 (fighting biplane) [[Gun Bus]]. The company abandoned plans for float planes at the start of the war and concentrated on land-based aircraft.\n\nVickers No. 8 monoplane at the Erith factory 1913.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vickers Monoplane No. 8|url=http://www.kenthistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=3213.0|website=kenthistoryforum.co.uk|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1914, the company's works at Crayford took over the production of Vickers aircraft. Development of variants of F.B. series continued apace. The last of these variants the F.B.5, eventually emerged as the [[Vickers Gunbus|Gunbus]]; of the first batches two were sent to the RFC to be based at the airfield. Experimental work continued during the war evolving the basic Gunbus into the FB9, known as the 'Streamline Gunbus'.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] it produced the [[Vickers Vimy|Vimy]] heavy bomber; the FB27 Vimy Prototype built at the Vickers [[Crayford]] works was assembled and flown out of Joyce Green. The plane was found to be too large for the hangars; Vickers had to dig out the ground inside them, for them to fit. See photo, right.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vickers at the airfield|url=https://www.greatwarforum.org/topic/76646-rfc-joyce-green-dartford-marshes-kent/|website=greatwarforum.org|accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref>\n\nThis first prototype B9952 made its first flight on 30 November 1917 at Joyce Green, piloted by Capt. Gordon Bell. The company had planned to use a pair of Royal Aircraft Factory 200&nbsp;hp 4d air-cooled V-12 engines, however they were not ready in time (production was later abandoned) and the plane was fitted two 200&nbsp;hp [[Hispano-Suiza]]s instead. By April 1918 it was decided use a [[Rolls-Royce Eagle]] engine instead. The aeroplane went into production that month and was at that point named the Vickers Vimy. Ironically, it was never used operationally in the First World War. \n\nIn 1919 Vickers moved their aircraft production from Crayford to [[Brooklands ]] aerodrome at [[Weybridge]] in [[Surrey]]. The plane's main claim to fame was that on 14/15 June 1919, Captain Jack Alcock and Lieutenant Arthur Whitten-Brown in a converted Vimy (built at Weybridge), made the world's first [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|non-stop trans-oceanic flight]], across the Atlantic. Later at the end of 1919 [[1919 England to Australia flight|Ross and Keith Smith flew a Vimy all the way to Australia]], thus highlighting the possibility of organising scheduled overseas longhaul flights.\n\nVickers would soon by December 1919 move their test facilities to [[Brooklands]] in [[Surrey]].\n\n== Royal Flying Corps 1914\u20131919 ==\n\nThe Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was established in May 1912. Initially the RFC regularly visited Joyce Green for testing and reviewing prototype aircraft. After the outbreak of war in 1914, Joyce Green became an \u2018air defence\u2019 airfield to protect London from [[German strategic bombing during World War I|bombing raids]] by [[Zeppelin]]s. The airfield was to house a permanent RFC unit, under No. 6 Wing, and the first occupants were No. 10 Reserve Squadron with a variety of aircraft including Henry Farman's, Vickers FB5 and FB9, DH2 and FE8 machines. The role of this unit was to receive pupils from preliminary training schools for final training for their wings. Each course consisted of about 20 pupils and lasted two or three weeks. This included time spent at [[Lydd]] where aerial gunnery was practised at the [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] range. On gaining their wings the young pilots would get a 48-hour pass before being posted to the Front.\n\nIt was decided that the aerodrome should house two FB5 Gunbuses, and they were transferred from [[Netheravon Airfield|Netheravon]]. No.6 Wing was appointed to oversee operations, and the training of potential pilots.\n\nConcurrently the erection of hangars, workshops and ground staff quarters commenced at the northern edge of the landing field alongside the Long Reach Tavern.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1914, the field was to see its first action when 2Lt M. R. Chidson and gunner Cpl Martin were in a Gunbus were sent up in pursuit of a German plane, [[Friedrichshafen FF.29]], a single-engined, two-seater float plane belonging to See [[Flieger-Abteilung]] I (Flyer department I) of the [[Imperial German Navy]], based at [[Zeebrugge]] in Belgium. Unfortunately the gun jammed over [[Purfleet]], and the gunner (having forgotten his gloves) found his hands too cold could not clear the mechanism, thus leaving the German free to drop two bombs on [[Cliffe railway station]]. Nevertheless, the Gunship did chase the German aircraft as far as the [[Nore]] sandbank. At the time the German plane was mistaken as a [[Taube monoplane]] it being an aircraft type that people knew (in the same way that Second World War German pilots always claimed to have been shot down by a Spitfire, when it was probably a Hurricane).\n\nThe airfield soon proved unpopular, being situated primarily on marshland.\n\nEarly in 1915, the construction of the Royal Flying Corps base at Joyce Green was completed and No.10 Reserve Squadron moved in. Equipped with [[Farman Aviation Works|Henry Farman]], Vickers FB5 and FB9, DH2 and FE8 aeroplanes, the squadron's main function was to receive pupils from preliminary training schools for final training and qualifications for their wings. There were many accidents and quite a few trainee pilots were killed. The Long Reach Tavern, was closed, the Salmon family were moved out, and the RFC took it over as a canteen and used it for sleeping quarters.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Long Reach Tavern|url=http://www.nwkfhs.org.uk/salmon.pdf|website=nwkfhs.org.uk|accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 19\u201320 January 1915 the Imperial German Navy mounted the first airship raid on Britain. Three Zeppelins (L3, L4 and L6) were despatched; one was forced to turn back with engine difficulties 90 miles from the English coast. The remaining airships bombed Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn, killing 2 civilians of Yarmouth and injuring 3, and killing 2 and injuring 13 civilians of King's Lynn. These were the first British Military casualties due to air attack.\n\nThe first night air defence sorties are flown by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). Following the attack by Zeppelins L3 and L4, two Vickers FB5 Gunbuses of No.7 Squadron were ordered to take-off from Joyce Green and patrol over the southern outskirts of London, without result.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Zeppelin attacks|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/history-of-aviation-timeline/interactive-aviation-timeline/british-military-aviation/1915.aspx|website=rafmuseum.org.uk|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nJames Thomas Byford McCudden VC DSO (and Bar), MC (and Bar), Croix de Guerre, one of the most highly decorated air aces in the First World War, arrived at Joyce Green in March 1917 to take up the appointment of Wing Fighting Instructor. McCudden had shot down fifty-seven German aeroplanes by the time he was 22. His job involved teaching combat duties to the more advanced pupils.<ref>{{cite web|title=The RFC base early days and Training ops|url=http://sussexhistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=8541.0|website=sussexhistoryforum.co.uk|accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn mid April 1915, No. 39 Home Defence Squadron was formed bringing together all units and detachments detailed for anti-Zeppelin raid duties in the London area.\n\nIn October 1915 a BE2c was posted here, and the machine fitted with a bomb rack. On October 13 the station would put up five aircraft against Zeppelins L13, L14, L15, and L16; two would land safely after the action. In particular 2/Lt [[Claude Alward Ridley|Claude Ridley]] took off from Joyce Green in a BE2c and spotted the airship for a brief moment in searchlights. He fired off 20 rounds at extreme range but then lost sight of the airship.\n\nDartford played an important role in the defence of London. Anti-aircraft guns were sited on the [[River Brent]], [[Dartford Heath]] and the Dartford Marshes, and dozens of searchlights and listening posts were erected in the district. The total number of air raids in or near Dartford (1914\u201318) was thirty-seven. Despite large numbers of high explosive and incendiary bombs dropped on the area, no-one was killed in Dartford as a direct result of these air raids.\n\nZeppelins generated enough fear that the lord mayor of London offered a \u00a3500 prize to the first pilot or gun crew to shoot one down on British soil, an award claimed by members of an anti-aircraft gun emplacement sited on the Brent at Dartford. The gun crew played an important part in bringing down Zeppelin L15.\n\nThe units and detachments under No.19 reserve squadron around London for anti-zeppelin defence were reorganized on 15 April 1916 as the No.39 Home Defence Squadron. Zeppelin operations moved to the north of London leaving Joyce Green on the southern perimeter.\n\nOn 22 March 1917 McCudden arrived to instruct advanced students (including Mannock) on combat techniques. McCudden would return here two more times in his career in Nov 1917 and Apr 1918.\n\nLater in Autumn 1917 the threat came from [[Gotha bomber]]s which had started raiding London. The Gotha had been based at [[Ostend]] as early as the spring of 1917.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mackersey|first1=Ian|title=No Empty Chairs: The Short and Heroic Lives of the Young Aviators Who Fought and Died in the First World War|date=2012|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|isbn=0297859943|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/noemptychairssho0000mack}}</ref> In one week that year, the German planes passed over Dartford three nights in succession; the Brent guns firing nearly a thousand rounds at the raiders.<ref>{{cite web|title=joyce Green and enemy action over Dartford|url=http://www.dartfordarchive.org.uk/20th_century/military_ww1.shtml|website=dartfordarchive.org.uk|accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Aviation in Kent|url=http://webapps.kent.gov.uk/kcc.exploringkentspast.web.sites.public/SingleResult.aspx?uid=Tke1054|website=webapps.kent.gov.uk|accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n63 TS were moved to [[Redcar]] on 13 February 1919, and the aerodrome was left only a pilots pool; and ground crew mainly composed of USAAF personnel on final training duties awaiting deployment to France.\n\n== Wireless Testing Park ==\n\nIn 1914 the RFC took over the [[Marconi Company]] experimental section at Brooklands in Surrey (formed in early 1911) and turned it into a wireless training school for pilots and engineers; under the command of Major Charles Prince, a former a Marconi engineer. The existing regulations had been that all communications work for the RFC had to be undertaken by the [[Royal Engineers]]. This resulted in conflicts of interest and views between the two organisations and things rapidly came to a head, and a decision was taken to separate the two bodies, resulting was that in August 1915 most of the wireless research work was sent to Woolwich, and the RFC wireless staff were despatched to a new site at Joyce Green.\n\nThe move was at first welcomed, as despite its pre-war success the Brooklands aerodrome was unsuitable for training and testing due to close proximity of high obstacles and electrical interference.\n\nThe Wireless Testing Park moved to this busy airfield in August 1915 on a convoy of trucks. Training, testing and wireless experiments, and work started. immediately while around them young men practised war, throwing flour bombs as they tried to make their cumbersome Henry Farman Trainers fly. The first ground to air upward message was sent in 1915 at the aerodrome by Major Prince, calling Captain J. M. Furnival as he circled the field in his aircraft. \n'Hello Furnie. If you can hear me now it will be the first time speech has ever been communicated to an aeroplane in flight.' 'Hello Furnie if you can hear me dip your wings\". The aeroplane, at its top speed of 50&nbsp;mph, responded with 'an obedient lurch.'\n\nDespite ongoing bureaucratic difficulties the team successfully and developed a practical aircraft telephony set towards the end of 1915; the Mark One weighing only 20&nbsp;lbs (9&nbsp;kg). This being the first operational air to ground wireless telephony equipment in the world. Prince made a report:\n\u2018It seemed almost beyond hope to achieve really practical wireless telephony from an aeroplane, but the difficulties have been overcome, and the new set is by no means a toy, or only of scientific interest. A new and amazing power is conferred by it.\u2019\n\nBy May 1916, 306 aircraft and 542 ground stations were equipped with spark wireless and crystal set receivers.\n\nAlso, despite Princes best attempts, four-fifths of the work for the RFC was officially still undertaken by the Royal Engineers Signals Experimental Establishment. Only one RFC officer was allowed on the premises at any one time, and he was unable to bring any influence to bear the designs and equipment they produced. Of a dozen new sets the RFC submitted to the Wireless Testing Park, all were subjected to damning comments such as \u2018a monument of incompetence\u2019 \u2018hopelessly bad design\u2019 and \u2018a primitive attempt to get round real difficulties\u2019.\n\nAs time progressed it became ever more apparent that the field of aviation radiophonics was too different from that of the army that the two services required to be separated.\n\n== Reasons why Joyce Green was replaced by Biggin Hill ==\n\n[[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Arthur Lee (RAF officer)|Gould Lee]] wrote in his book \"Open Cockpit\", chapter 17: \u2018To use this waterlogged field for testing every now and then was reasonable and to take advantage of it as an emergency landing ground for Home Defence forces was credible, but to employ it as a flying training station was folly and as a [[Sopwith Camel|Camel]] training station was lunacy. A pupil taking off with a choked or failing engine had to choose, according to wind direction, between drowning in the Thames (half a mile wide at this point), or crashing into the Vickers [[TNT]] works, or hitting one of their several high [[chimney stack]]s, or sinking into a vast [[sewage farm]], or killing himself and numerous patients in a large isolation hospital, or being electrocuted in an [[electrical substation]] with acres of [[Electricity pylon|pylon]]s and cables; or trying to turn and get back to the aerodrome. Unfortunately, many pupils confronted with disaster tried the last course and span to their deaths.\u2019\n<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Kents airfields |url=http://www.kentpast.co.uk/history_of_kents_airfields.html |website=kentpast.co.uk |accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=RFC Joyce Green - Dartford Marshes - Great War Forum|url=https://www.greatwarforum.org/topic/76646-rfc-joyce-green-dartford-marshes-kent/|website=greatwarforum.org|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[James McCudden|Jimmy McCudden]] VC in his book \"Flying Fury\" described the airfield (where he and others like of [[Mick Mannock]] VC spent much time) as a \"quiet little spot near Dartford\", below sea level at the side of the Thames. The Corp resided in a wooden barrack block, and the actual airfield (grass runways) were located almost next to the River Thames, where many pilots lost their lives by drowning.\n\nThe Wireless Radio Unit found the foul weather, incessant mist, the state of the ground, the cold, and damp at Joyce Green non conducive to the best research. Numerous accidents, several fatalities and the planned formation of the Royal Air Force in 1918, led to the Wireless Testing Park eventually being moved in February 1917 to Biggin Hill.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wireless Testing Park|url=http://marconiheritage.org/ww1-air.html|website=marconiheritage.org|accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoyce Green can't take all the blame for pilot losses however, the Sopwith Camel<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hale|first1=Julian|title=The Sopwith Camel|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/blog/camels-dolphins/|website=www.rafmuseum.org.uk/blog/camels-dolphins/|publisher=RAF Museum|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref> was a demanding plane of all but the most experienced pilot, and had had a fearsome reputation for spinning out of control during tight turns, causing the deaths of many young pilots during their training period.

A considerable number of USAS squadrons were construction squadrons and had no flying or maintenance personnel; they were charged with aerodrome construction.\n\nGround crew from the [[149th Aero Squadron]] an Instructional flying squadron (Pursuit), were here in May 2018. The squadron was established 7 December 1917, and assigned to the [[American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF) from 5 March 1918.

The Orchard Hospital to its immediate left.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n\nSome notable accidents and incidents involving military aircraft:\n\nThe first fatalities occurred on 13 January 1913 when a new biplane design, converted from a [[Vickers No.6 Monoplane]], on a test flight, came down in the River Thames. The Vicker's pilot, Leslie McDonald, and his mechanic, Harry English, were drowned. The publican of the Tavern (and retired waterman) Richard Salmon (1843-1915), witnessed the accident and gave evidence at the inquest in Dartford. The Coroner concluded that the accident had occurred as a result of a sudden loss of power to the engine.\nThe incident didn't deter Richard from flying as he later experienced a joyride from the aerodrome, at age 69/70.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Long Reach Tavern|url=http://www.nwkfhs.org.uk/salmon.pdf|website=nwkfhs.org.uk|accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nCaptain Gilbert William Mapplebeck [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (22) (Gibb Mapplebeck) 1892-1915. was posted to No 2 Reserve Air Squadron in August 1915 to carry out flight tests. On 24 August Mapplebeck (a recognized ace) after taking off in a [[Morane-Saulnier N]] \u201cBullet\u201d climbed to 80 feet and then entered a sharp right-hand turn. The plane stalled and spun into the ground. Mapplebeck was killed. [[Noel Pemberton-Billing]] MP asked questions in Parliament and it was investigated in 1916. Billing claimed that the plane was of a type condemned by the French air force and that there was a problem with the safety belt. The verdict of the Board of Inquiry on 25 August concluded that the French had indeed in large part taken the plane out of service, and that it would have been negligent to put an inexperienced pilot in such a machine, however Mapplebeck was an \u2018expert\u2019 so it was not negligent; the crash was caused by \u2018an unfortunate error of judgment on the pilot\u2019s part\u2019, and \u201cthat the accident was due to the machine \u2018spinning\u2019 on a heavily banked turn, the pilot not having sufficient height to regain control before hitting the earth.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gilbert Mapplebeck biography|title=Gilbert Mapplebeck biography|url=http://www.bedales.org.uk/home/about-bedales/history-bedales/wwi/gilbert-william-r-mapplebeck-26081892-24081915|website=bedales.org.uk|accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gibb Mapplebeck biography|url=https://greatwarlondon.wordpress.com/2015/08/18/gibb-mapplebeck-early-aviator-and-escaper/|website=greatwarlondon.wordpress.com|accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nMajor Ernest Frederic Unwin (35), died 22 March 1916 in a B.E.2c, 10 RS, hit a tree on a night approach and caught fire, at Joyce Green.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cawsey|title=Ernest Unwin|url=http://www.rcawsey.co.uk/Acc1916.htm|website=rcawsey.co.uk|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nCapt Bert James (22) RAF, was killed at Joyce Green May 1918, within sight of the airfield as witnessed by Carroll Bunch.\n\n2Lt Edwin John Leslie Lonnen (27) killed 16 August 1916 in Vickers FB.9 5273, 10 RS, at Joyce Green.

A part of the aerodrome site was included; where the RAF Officers mess had been located near the main gate. Wells had been originally established in 1837 at [[Earlsfield]] and [[Camberwell]] in London. To meet increasing demands and compliance with the requirements of the [[Explosives Act 1875]], they had opened a new factory at [[Honor Oak Park]] in 1878, just north of the [[Honor Oak railway station|railway station]]. \n\nThey also opened a factory in 1915 at [[Colchester]] to supplement Honor Oaks' production. Colchester was closed in 1938 when the new factory was built at Joyce Green, Dartford. The Honor Oak factory was closed in 1947 and the construction sheds from the old factory were transported to the Joyce Green site. Wells carried on production of fireworks until the family sold the site in 1968.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lancaster|first1=Ronald|title=FIREWORKS Principles and Practice|date=1998|publisher=Chemical Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-8206-0354-6|pages=21\u201323|edition=3rd|url=https://exploders.info/Files/Library/eng/pyrotechnics/firevorks_printsiples_and_pratstitse__ronald_lantsaster__-_1998_462s..pdf|accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Lawrence|first1=Andy|title=Bonfire Night - the local history of an international fireworks factory|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1032365563494152&id=972794832784559|website=Facebook|publisher=Crofton Park History|accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=McCudden|first=James Byford|title=Flying Fury: Five Years in the Royal Flying Corps|year=1987|publisher=Lionel Leventhal|location= London|isbn=0-947898-60-3}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Joyce Green airfield}}\n\n*[http://www.airwar1.org.uk/raf%20personnel%20list.htm List of RFC/RAF Personnel 1915-18 at the airfield, including personnel from Nos 2, 3RS, 16, 27, 32, 62, 80 and 103 Squadrons]\n\n{{Royal Air Force}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joyce Green, RAF}}\n[[Category:Royal Air Force stations in Kent]]\n[[Category:Royal Flying Corps airfields]]\n[[Category:Royal Flying Corps airfields in Kent]]\n[[Category:Borough of Dartford]]\n[[Category:History of Kent]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Military Structure\n|name=Royal Air Force Station Joyce Green\n|ensign=Ensign of the Royal Air Force.svg\n|ensign_size=90px\n|partof=\n|location= Located near Long Reach, [[Dartford]], [[Kent]], [[England]]\n|image=RFC Joyce Green - Long Reach Tavern with RFC hangars in the background 1929.jpg\n|caption=Long Reach Tavern with RFC hangars\n|type=Airfield\n|code=\n|built=1911\n|builder=\n|materials=\n|height= beneath mean tide level\n|used=1911\u20131919\n|demolished= Oct 1919 \n|condition=Closed\n|commanders=\n|occupants=[[File:RAF roundel.svg|15px]]&nbsp;[[Royal Flying Corps]]<br>[[File:US Army Air Roundel.svg|15px]]&nbsp; [[Air Service, United States Army]]\n|battles=[[First World War]]\n|events=\n|map_type=Kent\n|coordinates = {{coord|51.4743|0.2167|type:landmark_region:GB-KEN|format=dms|display=inline}}\n}}\n'''Joyce Green,''' at Long Reach, near [[Dartford]] was one of the first [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) airfields. It was established in 1911 by [[Vickers|Vickers Limited]] (the aircraft and weapons manufacturer) who used it as an airfield and testing ground. At the [[outbreak of World War I]] in 1914, the RFC followed and established a base. Subject to frequent flooding and a reputation as being unsuitable and too dangerous for training, it was eventually replaced by a more suitable site at [[RAF Biggin Hill]].\n\nThere were two parts to Joyce Green's military operations; the RFC, and the Wireless Experimental establishment. The latter were the first to move out in 1917 (after exhaustive searching south of London) when they found an ideal site on a farmer's field near the village of [[Biggin Hill]]; the RFC were soon to recognize the new site's suitability for flying and its strategic location, and soon followed, transferring there on 13 February 1917. The RFC took with them their [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighters]], leaving Joyce Green with only a pilots pool and ground crew.<ref name=bhphist>{{cite web | url = http://www.bigginhill.co.uk/rafstation.htm | title = R.A.F. Station Biggin Hill | publisher = Biggin Hill Productions | accessdate = 6 January 2007}}</ref> Once the RFC moved out the aerodrome, Vickers continued their testing work, until moving to [[Brooklands]] aerodrome. Following the [[Armistice with Germany]] the airfield was closed by December 1919.\n\n== The site ==\nJoyce Green farm, a cattle farm to the north of Dartford, lent its name to the largely uninhabited area {{convert|15|mi}} downstream of London Bridge, located between Dartford and the River Thames. The aerodrome itself was on part of a plot once known as Franks Farm, on ground reclaimed from the Dartford salt marshes.\n\nThe only habitation in the area, apart from the odd farm, was the isolated \"Long Reach Tavern\", known for organized [[bare-knuckle boxing]] matches in the 19th century, notably [[Tom Sayers]] who fought there between 1851-1854, and a ferry to [[Purfleet]] on the opposite bank of the Thames. A 'reach' is a length of a river between two bends and the longest reach on the Thames is 'Long Reach' hence the name of the Tavern. The surrounds of the tavern were to become the RFC encampment.\n\n1:62260/1:50000 OS map sheets 171/177 : (51): OS survey grid reference: TQ 542774. County: Kent, Area : 121 acres : 1200 x 1000 yards. Slightly below sea level.\n\nThe airfield consisted of a grass landing field, slightly below sea level, criss-crossed by ditches covered with boards; a {{convert|121|acre|ha}} site, 1200 x 1000 yards of low-lying marshland below [[Chart datum|mean tide level]], bordered by the [[River Darent]] to the west, the Thames to the north, the tavern's access road \"Joyce Green Lane\" (running north to south) to the east, and the grounds of the Joyce Green Hospitals to the south.\n\nFurther to the west of the tavern across the estuary of the River Darent was the Thames Ammunition factory. Along the river to its east was the nearby Long Reach Hospital, where the three [[smallpox]] isolation hospital ships had been moored on the Reach; they had been scrapped in 1904 leaving just the adjacent land-based hospital facilities intact. Further to the south and east were the Dartford [[salt marsh]]es. \n\nAlso in the area to the south were the Joyce Green and Orchard Hospitals with a small military (Army) unit attached to them. The hospitals were set up for the isolation of smallpox patients from London. Further to the south the main [[A206 road]] gave access to London. It is two miles from [[Dartford railway station]] and 1\u00bd miles from [[Erith railway station]].\n\nThe RFC buildings and camp were at the north end by the Thames, grouped to the immediate south and west of the Long Reach Tavern. The RFC had six [[hangar]]s in total; three aeroplane sheds, 80 x 60 feet, as a treble unit, and another three sheds, 80 x 50 feet, as a treble unit.\n\n== Vickers 1910-1919 ==\n\nThe site was first used in 1910 by [[Hiram Maxim]] who in conjunction with Vickers had built a [[biplane]] at Crayford, and at Joyce Green unsuccessfully attempted a test flight; without funds to continue developing his ideas, Maxim parted company with Vickers to form a new company with [[Louis Bleriot]] and [[Claude Grahame White]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Daniel |first1=Peter |title=Crayford A Magnificent Town and Its Flying Machines |url=http://www.bexley.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=5055&p=0|website=bexley.gov.uk|publisher=London Borough of Bexley |accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nVickers were to persist with aircraft development and establishing an (Aviation Department) in 1911, and promptly built hangars and workshop facilities at Joyce Green for testing the aeroplanes constructed at their [[Erith]] works. Vickers had factories at nearby [[Bexleyheath]], [[Crayford]], Erith and [[Dartford]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Vickers factories|url=http://www.bexley.gov.uk/article/10690/Vickers-of-Crayford-1888-1979|website=bexley.gov.uk|accessdate=18 February 2017}}</ref> The Vickers hangars and buildings were grouped at the south end of the site near to the entrance gates.\n\nOnce assembled aircraft were stripped down piece-small and moved by road from Erith, through the streets of Crayford to Joyce Green and returned the same way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vickers and streets of Dartford|url=http://www.kenthistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=3213.0|website=Kent History Forum|accessdate=18 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nVickers' first [[Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane|monoplane]] was tested at their new airfield in July 1911, using an under-license French-built rear fuselage and engine designed and made by the Frenchman Robert Esnault-Pelterie (hence R.E.P.) (the rest of the components being Vickers-built), it made its maiden flight, piloted by Captain [[Herbert F. Wood]], the manager of Vickers' aviation department.<ref name=\"Andrews Vickers p35\">Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 35.</ref> \n\nDevelopment of the aircraft was rapid; the No. 8 monoplane was built by 1913 at the Erith factory. However the Army Manoeuvres in the autumn of 1912 proved disastrous for the type: four RFC officers were killed using monoplanes, and this led to a suspension of the type by the Military Wing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monoplane suspension|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/rfc_centenary/the-rfc/the-early-years.aspx|website=rafmuseum.org.uk|accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nShortly before the war started, among the many designs initiated by the Drawing Office was one known as the 'Hydravion', based on the notion that an aeroplane should be able to take off from water as well as from land. Floats, made of [[Duralumin]] at the Dartford works, were tested in the nearby River Darent. Archives at the company headquarters imply that the Hydravion was to be constructed at Dartford, despite the factory only producing explosives and projectiles at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vickers and Dartford|url=http://www.dartfordarchive.org.uk/technology/engin_vickers.shtml|website=dartfordarchive.org.uk|accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912 Vickers commenced work on a two-seat [[Pusher configuration|pusher]] [[biplane]], the [[Vickers E.F.B.1|F.B.1 (Fighting Biplane 1)]], it was one of the first aircraft designed to carry a machine gun, the FB5 (fighting biplane) [[Gun Bus]]. The company abandoned plans for float planes at the start of the war and concentrated on land-based aircraft.\n\nVickers No. 8 monoplane at the Erith factory 1913.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vickers Monoplane No. 8|url=http://www.kenthistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=3213.0|website=kenthistoryforum.co.uk|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1914, the company's works at Crayford took over the production of Vickers aircraft. Development of variants of F.B. series continued apace. The last of these variants the F.B.5, eventually emerged as the [[Vickers Gunbus|Gunbus]]; of the first batches two were sent to the RFC to be based at the airfield. Experimental work continued during the war evolving the basic Gunbus into the FB9, known as the 'Streamline Gunbus'.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] it produced the [[Vickers Vimy|Vimy]] heavy bomber; the FB27 Vimy Prototype built at the Vickers [[Crayford]] works was assembled and flown out of Joyce Green. The plane was found to be too large for the hangars; Vickers had to dig out the ground inside them, for them to fit. See photo, right.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vickers at the airfield|url=https://www.greatwarforum.org/topic/76646-rfc-joyce-green-dartford-marshes-kent/|website=greatwarforum.org|accessdate=2018-09-25}}</ref>\n\nThis first prototype B9952 made its first flight on 30 November 1917 at Joyce Green, piloted by Capt. Gordon Bell. The company had planned to use a pair of Royal Aircraft Factory 200&nbsp;hp 4d air-cooled V-12 engines, however they were not ready in time (production was later abandoned) and the plane was fitted two 200&nbsp;hp [[Hispano-Suiza]]s instead. By April 1918 it was decided use a [[Rolls-Royce]] Eagle engine instead. The aeroplane went into production that month and was at that point named the Vickers Vimy. Ironically, it was never used operationally in the First World War. \n\nIn 1919 Vickers moved their aircraft production from Crayford to [[Brooklands ]] aerodrome at [[Weybridge]] in [[Surrey]]. The plane's main claim to fame was that on 14/15 June 1919, Captain Jack Alcock and Lieutenant Arthur Whitten-Brown in a converted Vimy (built at Weybridge), made the world's first [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|non-stop trans-oceanic flight]], across the Atlantic. Later at the end of 1919 [[1919 England to Australia flight|Ross and Keith Smith flew a Vimy all the way to Australia]], thus highlighting the possibility of organising scheduled overseas longhaul flights.\n\nVickers would soon by December 1919 move their test facilities to [[Brooklands]] in [[Surrey]].\n\n== Royal Flying Corps 1914\u20131919 ==\n\nThe Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was established in May 1912. Initially the RFC regularly visited Joyce Green for testing and reviewing prototype aircraft. After the outbreak of war in 1914, Joyce Green became an \u2018air defence\u2019 airfield to protect London from [[German strategic bombing during World War I|bombing raids]] by [[Zeppelin]]s. The airfield was to house a permanent RFC unit, under No. 6 Wing, and the first occupants were No. 10 Reserve Squadron with a variety of aircraft including Henry Farman's, Vickers FB5 and FB9, DH2 and FE8 machines. The role of this unit was to receive pupils from preliminary training schools for final training for their wings. Each course consisted of about 20 pupils and lasted two or three weeks. This included time spent at [[Lydd]] where aerial gunnery was practised at the [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] range. On gaining their wings the young pilots would get a 48-hour pass before being posted to the Front.\n\nIt was decided that the aerodrome should house two FB5 Gunbuses, and they were transferred from [[Netheravon Airfield|Netheravon]]. No.6 Wing was appointed to oversee operations, and the training of potential pilots.\n\nConcurrently the erection of hangars, workshops and ground staff quarters commenced at the northern edge of the landing field alongside the Long Reach Tavern.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1914, the field was to see its first action when 2Lt M. R. Chidson and gunner Cpl Martin were in a Gunbus were sent up in pursuit of a German plane, [[Friedrichshafen FF.29]], a single-engined, two-seater float plane belonging to See [[Flieger-Abteilung]] I (Flyer department I) of the [[Imperial German Navy]], based at [[Zeebrugge]] in Belgium. Unfortunately the gun jammed over [[Purfleet]], and the gunner (having forgotten his gloves) found his hands too cold could not clear the mechanism, thus leaving the German free to drop two bombs on [[Cliffe railway station]]. Nevertheless, the Gunship did chase the German aircraft as far as the [[Nore]] sandbank. At the time the German plane was mistaken as a [[Taube monoplane]] it being an aircraft type that people knew (in the same way that Second World War German pilots always claimed to have been shot down by a Spitfire, when it was probably a Hurricane).\n\nThe airfield soon proved unpopular, being situated primarily on marshland.\n\nEarly in 1915, the construction of the Royal Flying Corps base at Joyce Green was completed and No.10 Reserve Squadron moved in. Equipped with [[Farman Aviation Works|Henry Farman]], Vickers FB5 and FB9, DH2 and FE8 aeroplanes, the squadron's main function was to receive pupils from preliminary training schools for final training and qualifications for their wings. There were many accidents and quite a few trainee pilots were killed. The Long Reach Tavern, was closed, the Salmon family were moved out, and the RFC took it over as a canteen and used it for sleeping quarters.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Long Reach Tavern|url=http://www.nwkfhs.org.uk/salmon.pdf|website=nwkfhs.org.uk|accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 19\u201320 January 1915 the Imperial German Navy mounted the first airship raid on Britain. Three Zeppelins (L3, L4 and L6) were despatched; one was forced to turn back with engine difficulties 90 miles from the English coast. The remaining airships bombed Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn, killing 2 civilians of Yarmouth and injuring 3, and killing 2 and injuring 13 civilians of King's Lynn. These were the first British Military casualties due to air attack.\n\nThe first night air defence sorties are flown by the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). Following the attack by Zeppelins L3 and L4, two Vickers FB5 Gunbuses of No.7 Squadron were ordered to take-off from Joyce Green and patrol over the southern outskirts of London, without result.<ref>{{cite web|title=First Zeppelin attacks|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/history-of-aviation-timeline/interactive-aviation-timeline/british-military-aviation/1915.aspx|website=rafmuseum.org.uk|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nJames Thomas Byford McCudden VC DSO (and Bar), MC (and Bar), Croix de Guerre, one of the most highly decorated air aces in the First World War, arrived at Joyce Green in March 1917 to take up the appointment of Wing Fighting Instructor. McCudden had shot down fifty-seven German aeroplanes by the time he was 22. His job involved teaching combat duties to the more advanced pupils.<ref>{{cite web|title=The RFC base early days and Training ops|url=http://sussexhistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=8541.0|website=sussexhistoryforum.co.uk|accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn mid April 1915, No. 39 Home Defence Squadron was formed bringing together all units and detachments detailed for anti-Zeppelin raid duties in the London area.\n\nIn October 1915 a BE2c was posted here, and the machine fitted with a bomb rack. On October 13 the station would put up five aircraft against Zeppelins L13, L14, L15, and L16; two would land safely after the action. In particular 2/Lt [[Claude Alward Ridley|Claude Ridley]] took off from Joyce Green in a BE2c and spotted the airship for a brief moment in searchlights. He fired off 20 rounds at extreme range but then lost sight of the airship.\n\nDartford played an important role in the defence of London. Anti-aircraft guns were sited on the [[River Brent]], [[Dartford Heath]] and the Dartford Marshes, and dozens of searchlights and listening posts were erected in the district. The total number of air raids in or near Dartford (1914\u201318) was thirty-seven. Despite large numbers of high explosive and incendiary bombs dropped on the area, no-one was killed in Dartford as a direct result of these air raids.\n\nZeppelins generated enough fear that the lord mayor of London offered a \u00a3500 prize to the first pilot or gun crew to shoot one down on British soil, an award claimed by members of an anti-aircraft gun emplacement sited on the Brent at Dartford. The gun crew played an important part in bringing down Zeppelin L15.\n\nThe units and detachments under No.19 reserve squadron around London for anti-zeppelin defence were reorganized on 15 April 1916 as the No.39 Home Defence Squadron. Zeppelin operations moved to the north of London leaving Joyce Green on the southern perimeter.\n\nOn 22 March 1917 McCudden arrived to instruct advanced students (including Mannock) on combat techniques. McCudden would return here two more times in his career in Nov 1917 and Apr 1918.\n\nLater in Autumn 1917 the threat came from [[Gotha bomber]]s which had started raiding London. The Gotha had been based at [[Ostend]] as early as the spring of 1917.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mackersey|first1=Ian|title=No Empty Chairs: The Short and Heroic Lives of the Young Aviators Who Fought and Died in the First World War|date=2012|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|isbn=0297859943|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/noemptychairssho0000mack}}</ref> In one week that year, the German planes passed over Dartford three nights in succession; the Brent guns firing nearly a thousand rounds at the raiders.<ref>{{cite web|title=joyce Green and enemy action over Dartford|url=http://www.dartfordarchive.org.uk/20th_century/military_ww1.shtml|website=dartfordarchive.org.uk|accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Aviation in Kent|url=http://webapps.kent.gov.uk/kcc.exploringkentspast.web.sites.public/SingleResult.aspx?uid=Tke1054|website=webapps.kent.gov.uk|accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n63 TS were moved to [[Redcar]] on 13 February 1919, and the aerodrome was left only a pilots pool; and ground crew mainly composed of USAAF personnel on final training duties awaiting deployment to France.\n\n== Wireless Testing Park ==\n\nIn 1914 the RFC took over the [[Marconi Company]] experimental section at Brooklands in Surrey (formed in early 1911) and turned it into a wireless training school for pilots and engineers; under the command of Major Charles Prince, a former a Marconi engineer. The existing regulations had been that all communications work for the RFC had to be undertaken by the [[Royal Engineers]]. This resulted in conflicts of interest and views between the two organisations and things rapidly came to a head, and a decision was taken to separate the two bodies, resulting was that in August 1915 most of the wireless research work was sent to Woolwich, and the RFC wireless staff were despatched to a new site at Joyce Green.\n\nThe move was at first welcomed, as despite its pre-war success the Brooklands aerodrome was unsuitable for training and testing due to close proximity of high obstacles and electrical interference.\n\nThe Wireless Testing Park moved to this busy airfield in August 1915 on a convoy of trucks. Training, testing and wireless experiments, and work started. immediately while around them young men practised war, throwing flour bombs as they tried to make their cumbersome Henry Farman Trainers fly. The first ground to air upward message was sent in 1915 at the aerodrome by Major Prince, calling Captain J. M. Furnival as he circled the field in his aircraft. \n'Hello Furnie. If you can hear me now it will be the first time speech has ever been communicated to an aeroplane in flight.' 'Hello Furnie if you can hear me dip your wings\". The aeroplane, at its top speed of 50&nbsp;mph, responded with 'an obedient lurch.'\n\nDespite ongoing bureaucratic difficulties the team successfully and developed a practical aircraft telephony set towards the end of 1915; the Mark One weighing only 20&nbsp;lbs (9&nbsp;kg). This being the first operational air to ground wireless telephony equipment in the world. Prince made a report:\n\u2018It seemed almost beyond hope to achieve really practical wireless telephony from an aeroplane, but the difficulties have been overcome, and the new set is by no means a toy, or only of scientific interest. A new and amazing power is conferred by it.\u2019\n\nBy May 1916, 306 aircraft and 542 ground stations were equipped with spark wireless and crystal set receivers.\n\nAlso, despite Princes best attempts, four-fifths of the work for the RFC was officially still undertaken by the Royal Engineers Signals Experimental Establishment. Only one RFC officer was allowed on the premises at any one time, and he was unable to bring any influence to bear the designs and equipment they produced. Of a dozen new sets the RFC submitted to the Wireless Testing Park, all were subjected to damning comments such as \u2018a monument of incompetence\u2019 \u2018hopelessly bad design\u2019 and \u2018a primitive attempt to get round real difficulties\u2019.\n\nAs time progressed it became ever more apparent that the field of aviation radiophonics was too different from that of the army that the two services required to be separated.\n\n== Reasons why Joyce Green was replaced by Biggin Hill ==\n\n[[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Arthur Lee (RAF officer)|Gould Lee]] wrote in his book \"Open Cockpit\", chapter 17: \u2018To use this waterlogged field for testing every now and then was reasonable and to take advantage of it as an emergency landing ground for Home Defence forces was credible, but to employ it as a flying training station was folly and as a [[Sopwith Camel|Camel]] training station was lunacy. A pupil taking off with a choked or failing engine had to choose, according to wind direction, between drowning in the Thames (half a mile wide at this point), or crashing into the Vickers [[TNT]] works, or hitting one of their several high [[chimney stack]]s, or sinking into a vast [[sewage farm]], or killing himself and numerous patients in a large isolation hospital, or being electrocuted in an [[electrical substation]] with acres of [[Electricity pylon|pylon]]s and cables; or trying to turn and get back to the aerodrome. Unfortunately, many pupils confronted with disaster tried the last course and span to their deaths.\u2019\n<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Kents airfields |url=http://www.kentpast.co.uk/history_of_kents_airfields.html |website=kentpast.co.uk |accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=RFC Joyce Green - Dartford Marshes - Great War Forum|url=https://www.greatwarforum.org/topic/76646-rfc-joyce-green-dartford-marshes-kent/|website=greatwarforum.org|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[James McCudden|Jimmy McCudden]] VC in his book \"Flying Fury\" described the airfield (where he and others like of [[Mick Mannock]] VC spent much time) as a \"quiet little spot near Dartford\", below sea level at the side of the Thames. The Corp resided in a wooden barrack block, and the actual airfield (grass runways) were located almost next to the River Thames, where many pilots lost their lives by drowning.\n\nThe Wireless Radio Unit found the foul weather, incessant mist, the state of the ground, the cold, and damp at Joyce Green non conducive to the best research. Numerous accidents, several fatalities and the planned formation of the Royal Air Force in 1918, led to the Wireless Testing Park eventually being moved in February 1917 to Biggin Hill.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wireless Testing Park|url=http://marconiheritage.org/ww1-air.html|website=marconiheritage.org|accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoyce Green can't take all the blame for pilot losses however, the Sopwith Camel<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hale|first1=Julian|title=The Sopwith Camel|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/blog/camels-dolphins/|website=www.rafmuseum.org.uk/blog/camels-dolphins/|publisher=RAF Museum|accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref> was a demanding plane of all but the most experienced pilot, and had had a fearsome reputation for spinning out of control during tight turns, causing the deaths of many young pilots during their training period.

When further such units were formed, numbering was introduced.\n*RS = Reserve Squadron: the RAS was re-tiled RS in January 1916 and by July of that year was classified as either Elementary (for initial training) or Higher (for type specialisation). 10 RS was one of the latter, being dedicated to turning out pilots for 'pusher' scouts, DH2 and FE8.\n*TDS = Training Depot Station: these were introduced during the autumn of 1917 in an attempt to streamline the training system. Hitherto, pilots had undertaken elementary training at one station and moved to another for higher training - a waste of time and resources. TDS provided all-through training and had type specialisations.\n*TS = Training Squadron: the RS were re-designated TS on 31 May 1917, to more accurately reflect their role. That coincided with 10 TS switching bases with 63 TS, as a response to the Gotha raids on SE England - 63 TS had Sopwith Pups and DH5s as part of its equipment and was given temporary HD duty.\n*The Wireless Testing Park had arrived as a nucleus from Brooklands and was an out-station of the Signals Experimental Establishment at [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich]]. \n*No. 63 TS was given temporary HD duty during the summer of 1917. \n*The Pool of Pilots comprised a concentration of pilots awaiting posting to units at home and overseas.\n* Above three tables are from the National Archives.

The RFC/RAF buildings were mainly on the northern boundary, in and around Long Reach Tavern. The Vickers buildings to the far south. The plan was drawn on existing 25 mile to the inch OS maps, so existing surrounding buildings show, e.g. Outside the base is the Joyce Green hospital in the far SE corner. The Orchard Hospital to its immediate left.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n\nSome notable accidents and incidents involving military aircraft:\n\nThe first fatalities occurred on 13 January 1913 when a new biplane design, converted from a [[Vickers No.6 Monoplane]], on a test flight, came down in the River Thames. The Vicker's pilot, Leslie McDonald, and his mechanic, Harry English, were drowned. The publican of the Tavern (and retired waterman) Richard Salmon (1843-1915), witnessed the accident and gave evidence at the inquest in Dartford. The Coroner concluded that the accident had occurred as a result of a sudden loss of power to the engine.\nThe incident didn't deter Richard from flying as he later experienced a joyride from the aerodrome, at age 69/70.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Long Reach Tavern|url=http://www.nwkfhs.org.uk/salmon.pdf|website=nwkfhs.org.uk|accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nCaptain Gilbert William Mapplebeck [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (22) (Gibb Mapplebeck) 1892-1915. was posted to No 2 Reserve Air Squadron in August 1915 to carry out flight tests. On 24 August Mapplebeck (a recognized ace) after taking off in a [[Morane-Saulnier N]] \u201cBullet\u201d climbed to 80 feet and then entered a sharp right-hand turn. The plane stalled and spun into the ground. Mapplebeck was killed. [[Noel Pemberton-Billing]] MP asked questions in Parliament and it was investigated in 1916. Billing claimed that the plane was of a type condemned by the French air force and that there was a problem with the safety belt. The verdict of the Board of Inquiry on 25 August concluded that the French had indeed in large part taken the plane out of service, and that it would have been negligent to put an inexperienced pilot in such a machine, however Mapplebeck was an \u2018expert\u2019 so it was not negligent; the crash was caused by \u2018an unfortunate error of judgment on the pilot\u2019s part\u2019, and \u201cthat the accident was due to the machine \u2018spinning\u2019 on a heavily banked turn, the pilot not having sufficient height to regain control before hitting the earth.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gilbert Mapplebeck biography|title=Gilbert Mapplebeck biography|url=http://www.bedales.org.uk/home/about-bedales/history-bedales/wwi/gilbert-william-r-mapplebeck-26081892-24081915|website=bedales.org.uk|accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gibb Mapplebeck biography|url=https://greatwarlondon.wordpress.com/2015/08/18/gibb-mapplebeck-early-aviator-and-escaper/|website=greatwarlondon.wordpress.com|accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nMajor Ernest Frederic Unwin (35), died 22 March 1916 in a B.E.2c, 10 RS, hit a tree on a night approach and caught fire, at Joyce Green.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cawsey|title=Ernest Unwin|url=http://www.rcawsey.co.uk/Acc1916.htm|website=rcawsey.co.uk|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nCapt Bert James (22) RAF, was killed at Joyce Green May 1918, within sight of the airfield as witnessed by Carroll Bunch.\n\n2Lt Edwin John Leslie Lonnen (27) killed 16 August 1916 in Vickers FB.9 5273, 10 RS, at Joyce Green.

A part of the aerodrome site was included; where the RAF Officers mess had been located near the main gate. Wells had been originally established in 1837 at [[Earlsfield]] and [[Camberwell]] in London. To meet increasing demands and compliance with the requirements of the [[Explosives Act 1875]], they had opened a new factory at [[Honor Oak Park]] in 1878, just north of the [[Honor Oak railway station|railway station]]. \n\nThey also opened a factory in 1915 at [[Colchester]] to supplement Honor Oaks' production. Colchester was closed in 1938 when the new factory was built at Joyce Green, Dartford. The Honor Oak factory was closed in 1947 and the construction sheds from the old factory were transported to the Joyce Green site. Wells carried on production of fireworks until the family sold the site in 1968.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lancaster|first1=Ronald|title=FIREWORKS Principles and Practice|date=1998|publisher=Chemical Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-8206-0354-6|pages=21\u201323|edition=3rd|url=https://exploders.info/Files/Library/eng/pyrotechnics/firevorks_printsiples_and_pratstitse__ronald_lantsaster__-_1998_462s..pdf|accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Lawrence|first1=Andy|title=Bonfire Night - the local history of an international fireworks factory|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1032365563494152&id=972794832784559|website=Facebook|publisher=Crofton Park History|accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|last=McCudden|first=James Byford|title=Flying Fury: Five Years in the Royal Flying Corps|year=1987|publisher=Lionel Leventhal|location= London|isbn=0-947898-60-3}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Joyce Green airfield}}\n\n*[http://www.airwar1.org.uk/raf%20personnel%20list.htm List of RFC/RAF Personnel 1915-18 at the airfield, including personnel from Nos 2, 3RS, 16, 27, 32, 62, 80 and 103 Squadrons]\n\n{{Royal Air Force}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joyce Green, RAF}}\n[[Category:Royal Air Force stations in Kent]]\n[[Category:Royal Flying Corps airfields]]\n[[Category:Royal Flying Corps airfields in Kent]]\n[[Category:Borough of Dartford]]\n[[Category:History of Kent]]\n", "name_user": "LittleWink", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVickers 1910-1919:fix link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Joyce_Green"}

Among other things, the Maryland Constitution guarantees [[jury trial|trial by jury]], [[due process]], [[freedom of the press]], and [[freedom of religion|of religion]]. It also forbids, among other things, the passage of [[ex post facto law]]s and [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. Notably, juries in criminal cases are declared to be judges of law as well as fact, thus ensconcing in the constitution the right of (what is commonly called) [[jury nullification]]\u2014commonplace in the early 19th century. By 1867 this principle was already in decline as a result of abuse (in such conflicts as the Mormons in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] and the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.), and today very much the minority position. The right of the jury to be judge of the law has since been declared unconstitutional, at least with respect to matters implicating federal constitutional rights, by the Maryland Court Appeals in Unger vs. Maryland (2012). <ref>https://law.justia.com/cases/maryland/court-of-appeals/2012/111-09.html</ref> <ref>https://www.npr.org/2016/02/18/467057603/from-a-life-term-to-life-on-the-outside-when-aging-felons-are-freed</ref>\n\nWhile the Declaration of Rights does say that \"a well regulated [[Militia]] is the proper and natural defence of a free Government,\" it does not guarantee a [[right to arms|right to bear arms]]. The Maryland Constitution is one of the few state constitutions that lacks the equivalent of the federal [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]].\n\nReflecting Maryland's history of religious toleration, it limits the guarantee against religious disabilities to those who believe in God and divine rewards and punishments. Article 36 includes the wording:\n \n<blockquote>nor shall any person, otherwise competent, be deemed incompetent as a witness, or juror, on account of his religious belief; provided, he believes in the existence of God, and that under His dispensation such person will be held morally accountable for his acts, and be rewarded or punished therefor either in this world or in the world to come.</blockquote>\n\nA unanimous 1961 decision by US Supreme court in the case of ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'' found that an attempt to enforce this provision violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments to the [[United States Constitution]]. In 1970, this article was amended to include the sentence \"Nothing in this article shall constitute an establishment of religion\". The original wording of the article was left in place, presumably as symbolic rather than effective.\n\nMaryland's Constitution describes the [[separation of powers]] doctrine, which is implied in the federal constitution. The Maryland Constitution states that \"the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\"\n\n===Elective Franchise===\nArticle I defines the requirements for holding elections, the qualifications to be allowed to vote, and penalties for voter misconduct (such as intentionally voting in a district one does not reside in, or voting more than once in an election).\n\n===Executive Department===\nArticle II creates the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor, establishes the qualifications for candidates, the rules for counting ballots, deciding who shall become governor or Lieutenant governor in the event of a tie, impeachment for misconduct, and the process for replacement if the office becomes vacant temporarily or permanently due to death, resignation, disability or impeachment.\n\n===Legislative Department===\nArticle III creates the Legislature, styled the General Assembly, separated into two houses, a Senate and House of delegates, defines the qualification and number of members of each house, the means of election and provisions for removal from office for misconduct, and process for replacement of members whose office becomes vacant.\n\n===Judicial Department===\nArticle IV creates the [[Supreme Court of Maryland]] and various lower courts, sets the requirement for judges, length of tenure, and removal from office. It also provides for a Sheriff to be elected for each county\n\n===Attorney General and State's Attorney===\nArticle V creates the office of the Attorney General and a State's Attorney in each county, provides for their election, qualifications for candidates, procedure for impeachment and replacement in the event the office becomes vacant.\n\n===Treasury Department===\nArticle VI creates a Treasury Department and establishes the procedure for appointment of a Comptroller and a Treasurer, as well as their duties, procedure for removal for misconduct and replacement if the office becomes vacant.\n\n===Sundry Officers===\nArticle VII provides for the election of County Commissioners.\n\n===Education===\nArticle VIII requires the legislature to establish a set of Free Public Schools, and to support them \"by taxation or other means.\"\n\n===Militia and Military Affairs===\nArticle IX provides for the creation of a Militia and for the appointment of an Adjutant General by the Governor to manage the Militia.\n\n===City of Baltimore===\nArticle X creates the City of Baltimore, provides it with a mayor and a two-part City Council with a maximum 90 day period of operation, and provides for several additional sub-articles within article XI regarding the operation of the City.\n\n==Amendments==\n\n===Amendment process===\n[[Constitutional amendment|Amendment]]s to the constitution are proposed by the [[Maryland General Assembly|state legislature]] with a three-fifths vote in both chambers. Amendments must then be ratified by a simple majority of the people voting on the question in a [[referendum]] held simultaneously with the next [[general election]]. Unlike the [[United States Constitution|federal constitution]], when the Maryland Constitution is amended the official text of the document is edited, removing language that is no longer in force.  However, most printed versions of the constitution include annotations which indicate which portions were amended or removed and at what times.\n\nA provision in the document requires that every 20 years the people of the state be asked if a state [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] should be convened. Such a convention is called if a majority of the voters request it. At the latest election where this question could be asked in 2010, the voters did not choose to call a convention.\n\n===Notable amendments===\nWhile the average state constitution has been amended approximately 115 times, {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, the Maryland Constitution has been amended almost 200 times, most recently in 2012. In 1910, the [[Digges Amendment]] was proposed, to increase property requirements for voter registration. It would have effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most [[African Americans]] and many [[poor whites]] (including recent [[European immigrants]]), as had been accomplished by other states through various means, beginning with Mississippi's new constitution of 1890. Other Maryland laws had already reduced black voter rolls, but this amendment was rejected by voters at the general election.\n\nIn 1970, voters approved an amendment that created the office of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Maryland]]. In 1972, an amendment that created the current [[legislative district]] system of the [[Maryland General Assembly]] was approved.\n\n===2008 amendments===\nIn 2008, two amendments were proposed on the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 U.S. presidential election]] ballot for the state of Maryland.<ref name=\"state2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2008/questions/general/Statewide_Ballot_Question_Results.html |title=2008 General Election Results: Maryland State Board of Elections |publisher=elections.state.md.us |date=December 3, 2008 |accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref> The first amendment proposed to allow [[early voting]] in state and allow qualified voters to vote at [[polling place]]s outside of their home district.

The Maryland Constitution states that \"the Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\"\n\n===Elective Franchise===\nArticle I defines the requirements for holding elections, the qualifications to be allowed to vote, and penalties for voter misconduct (such as intentionally voting in a district one does not reside in, or voting more than once in an election).\n\n===Executive Department===\nArticle II creates the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor, establishes the qualifications for candidates, the rules for counting ballots, deciding who shall become governor or Lieutenant governor in the event of a tie, impeachment for misconduct, and the process for replacement if the office becomes vacant temporarily or permanently due to death, resignation, disability or impeachment.\n\n===Legislative Department===\nArticle III creates the Legislature, styled the General Assembly, separated into two houses, a Senate and House of delegates, defines the qualification and number of members of each house, the means of election and provisions for removal from office for misconduct, and process for replacement of members whose office becomes vacant.\n\n===Judicial Department===\nArticle IV creates the [[Supreme Court of Maryland]] and various lower courts, sets the requirement for judges, length of tenure, and removal from office. It also provides for a Sheriff to be elected for each county\n\n===Attorney General and State's Attorney===\nArticle V creates the office of the Attorney General and a State's Attorney in each county, provides for their election, qualifications for candidates, procedure for impeachment and replacement in the event the office becomes vacant.\n\n===Treasury Department===\nArticle VI creates a Treasury Department and establishes the procedure for appointment of a Comptroller and a Treasurer, as well as their duties, procedure for removal for misconduct and replacement if the office becomes vacant.\n\n===Sundry Officers===\nArticle VII provides for the election of County Commissioners.\n\n===Education===\nArticle VIII requires the legislature to establish a set of Free Public Schools, and to support them \"by taxation or other means.\"\n\n===Militia and Military Affairs===\nArticle IX provides for the creation of a Militia and for the appointment of an Adjutant General by the Governor to manage the Militia.\n\n===City of Baltimore===\nArticle X creates the City of Baltimore, provides it with a mayor and a two-part City Council with a maximum 90 day period of operation, and provides for several additional sub-articles within article XI regarding the operation of the City.\n\n==Amendments==\n\n===Amendment process===\n[[Constitutional amendment|Amendment]]s to the constitution are proposed by the [[Maryland General Assembly|state legislature]] with a three-fifths vote in both chambers. Amendments must then be ratified by a simple majority of the people voting on the question in a [[referendum]] held simultaneously with the next [[general election]]. Unlike the [[United States Constitution|federal constitution]], when the Maryland Constitution is amended the official text of the document is edited, removing language that is no longer in force.  However, most printed versions of the constitution include annotations which indicate which portions were amended or removed and at what times.\n\nA provision in the document requires that every 20 years the people of the state be asked if a state [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] should be convened. Such a convention is called if a majority of the voters request it. At the latest election where this question could be asked in 2010, the voters did not choose to call a convention.\n\n===Notable amendments===\nWhile the average state constitution has been amended approximately 115 times, {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, the Maryland Constitution has been amended almost 200 times, most recently in 2012. In 1910, the [[Digges Amendment]] was proposed, to increase property requirements for voter registration. It would have effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most [[African Americans]] and many [[poor whites]] (including recent [[European immigrants]]), as had been accomplished by other states through various means, beginning with Mississippi's new constitution of 1890. Other Maryland laws had already reduced black voter rolls, but this amendment was rejected by voters at the general election.\n\nIn 1970, voters approved an amendment that created the office of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Maryland]]. In 1972, an amendment that created the current [[legislative district]] system of the [[Maryland General Assembly]] was approved.\n\n===2008 amendments===\nIn 2008, two amendments were proposed on the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 U.S. presidential election]] ballot for the state of Maryland.<ref name=\"state2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2008/questions/general/Statewide_Ballot_Question_Results.html |title=2008 General Election Results: Maryland State Board of Elections |publisher=elections.state.md.us |date=December 3, 2008 |accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref> The first amendment proposed to allow [[early voting]] in state and allow qualified voters to vote at [[polling place]]s outside of their home district.
