His lawn was regularly littered with refuse and his home and garage had been broken into a combined five times, with the most recent robbery committed by a man McDonald recognized from his own neighborhood.<ref name=\"cm2010\"/> An experienced hunter, McDonald legally owned shotguns, but believed them too unwieldy in the event of a robbery, and wanted to purchase a handgun for personal home defense. Due to Chicago's requirement that all firearms in the city be registered, yet refusing all handgun registrations after 1982 when a citywide handgun ban was passed, he was unable to legally own a handgun. As a result, in 2008, he joined three other Chicago residents in filing a lawsuit which became ''McDonald v. Chicago''.<ref name=\"cm2010\"/>\n\n==''McDonald v. Chicago'' as compared to ''NRA v. Chicago''==\nDespite being consolidated at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, the cases are different in scope in terms of the specific regulations challenged and the legal argument for applying the Second Amendment against state and local governments. The Second Amendment Foundation brought the McDonald case to the Supreme Court with its lead attorney Alan Gura. The cases were appealed separately to the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/a-new-second-amendment-case/ |title=A new Second Amendment case |work=SCOTUSblog |accessdate=July 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617185336/http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/a-new-second-amendment-case/ |archivedate=June 17, 2009 }}</ref>\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100704230556/http://www.chicagoguncase.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mcdonald_cert_petition1.pdf McDonald Petition for Certiorari]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100210145552/http://www.chicagoguncase.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/chicago_bio.pdf Chicago Brief in Opposition to Cert Petition]\n\n===Regulations challenged===\nMcDonald challenged four broad aspects of Chicago's gun registration law, which, according to the plaintiffs:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagoguncase.com/faqs/#laws-challenging|title=ChicagoGunCase.com \u00bb FAQs|work=www.chicagoguncase.com|accessdate=July 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413115007/http://www.chicagoguncase.com/faqs/#laws-challenging|archive-date=April 13, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n* Prohibit the registration of handguns, thus effecting a broad handgun ban\n* Require that guns be registered prior to their acquisition by Chicago residents\n* Mandate that guns be re-registered annually, with another payment of the fee\n* Render any gun permanently non-registrable if its registration lapses\n\n===Legal basis for incorporation===\nAll of the post-''Heller'' cases, including ''McDonald'', ''NRA v. Chicago'', ''Nordyke'' and ''Maloney'', argued that the Second Amendment, in addition to applying to federal jurisdictions, should also be applied against state and local governments, using a judicial process called [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|selective incorporation]]. Selective incorporation involves convincing the court that a right is \"fundamental\" by being \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\" or \"deeply rooted in our nation's history and traditions\" as defined most recently in the Supreme Court case ''[[Duncan v. Louisiana]]'', {{ussc|391|145|1968}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn addition to claiming the Second Amendment should be incorporated through the selective incorporation process, ''McDonald'' is unique among post-Heller gun cases in that it asked the court to overturn the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'', {{ussc|83|36|1873}}. ''Slaughter-House'' determined that the 14th Amendment's [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]] did not apply the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to the actions of states (and by extension, local governments). If it had been overturned, the Selective Incorporation process may have become unnecessary, since the entire Bill of Rights, including the 2nd Amendment, would arguably be applied to the states.<ref>\"[T]he words 'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' seems to me an eminently reasonable way of expressing the idea that henceforth the Bill of Rights shall apply to the States.\" Erwin Chemerinsky et al., Constitutional Law \u00a7 6.3.2 (3d ed. 2006) (''quoting'' ''Duncan v. Louisiana'', 391 U.S. 145, 166 (1968) (Black, dissenting))</ref><ref>More precisely, the Privileges or Immunities Clause would incorporate the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights; since the 9th and 10th Amendments refer to the unenumerated rights of individuals and reserved powers of the states respectively, their incorporation, at least for the 10th Amendment, would be paradoxical or meaningless.</ref>\n\nIn attempting to overturn ''Slaughter-House'', this case garnered the attention and support of both conservative and liberal legal scholars interested in its potential application in areas outside of firearms law. Their interest was that if ''Slaughter-House'' had been overturned, it would have been possible that constitutional guarantees such as the right to a jury in civil cases, right to a grand jury in felony cases, and other parts of the Bill of Rights, as well as future court rulings and existing federal precedent, not universally guaranteed in actions by the states, would have been applied against the states automatically.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202428529045|title=Liberals Use Supreme Court Gun Case to Bolster Other Rights|publisher=www.law.com|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theusconstitution.org/page_module.php?id=12&mid=9|title=Constitutional Accountability Center filed brief in NRA v.

City of Chicago'', Chicago resident Otis McDonald, a 76-year-old (in 2010) retired maintenance engineer, had lived in the [[Morgan Park, Chicago|Morgan Park]] neighborhood since buying a house there in 1971.<ref name=\"cm2010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/January-2010/In-Their-Sights-Lawsuit-challenging-Chicagos-1982-handgun-ban-to-be-heard-by-Supreme-Court/|title=On Otis McDonald and his lawsuit challenging Chicago\u2019s 1982 handgun ban|last=Tanaka|first=Jennifer|date=January 2010|work=Chicago Magazine|accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref> McDonald described the decline of his neighborhood, claiming it was being taken over by [[gang]]s and [[drug dealers]]. His lawn was regularly littered with refuse and his home and garage had been broken into a combined five times, with the most recent robbery committed by a man McDonald recognized from his own neighborhood.<ref name=\"cm2010\"/> An experienced hunter, McDonald legally owned shotguns, but believed them too unwieldy in the event of a robbery, and wanted to purchase a handgun for personal home defense. Due to Chicago's requirement that all firearms in the city be registered, yet refusing all handgun registrations after 1982 when a citywide handgun ban was passed, he was unable to legally own a handgun. As a result, in 2008, he joined three other Chicago residents in filing a lawsuit which became ''McDonald v. Chicago''.<ref name=\"cm2010\"/>\n\n==''McDonald v. Chicago'' as compared to ''NRA v. Chicago''==\nDespite being consolidated at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, the cases are different in scope in terms of the specific regulations challenged and the legal argument for applying the Second Amendment against state and local governments. The Second Amendment Foundation brought the McDonald case to the Supreme Court with its lead attorney Alan Gura. The cases were appealed separately to the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/a-new-second-amendment-case/ |title=A new Second Amendment case |work=SCOTUSblog |accessdate=July 4, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617185336/http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/a-new-second-amendment-case/ |archivedate=June 17, 2009 }}</ref>\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100704230556/http://www.chicagoguncase.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mcdonald_cert_petition1.pdf McDonald Petition for Certiorari]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100210145552/http://www.chicagoguncase.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/chicago_bio.pdf Chicago Brief in Opposition to Cert Petition]\n\n===Regulations challenged===\nMcDonald challenged four broad aspects of Chicago's gun registration law, which, according to the plaintiffs:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagoguncase.com/faqs/#laws-challenging|title=ChicagoGunCase.com \u00bb FAQs|work=www.chicagoguncase.com|accessdate=July 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413115007/http://www.chicagoguncase.com/faqs/#laws-challenging|archive-date=April 13, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n* Prohibit the registration of handguns, thus effecting a broad handgun ban\n* Require that guns be registered prior to their acquisition by Chicago residents\n* Mandate that guns be re-registered annually, with another payment of the fee\n* Render any gun permanently non-registrable if its registration lapses\n\n===Legal basis for incorporation===\nAll of the post-''Heller'' cases, including ''McDonald'', ''NRA v. Chicago'', ''Nordyke'' and ''Maloney'', argued that the Second Amendment, in addition to applying to federal jurisdictions, should also be applied against state and local governments, using a judicial process called [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|selective incorporation]]. Selective incorporation involves convincing the court that a right is \"fundamental\" by being \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\" or \"deeply rooted in our nation's history and traditions\" as defined most recently in the Supreme Court case ''[[Duncan v. Louisiana]]'', {{ussc|391|145|1968}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn addition to claiming the Second Amendment should be incorporated through the selective incorporation process, ''McDonald'' is unique among post-Heller gun cases in that it asked the court to overturn the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'', {{ussc|83|36|1873}}. ''Slaughter-House'' determined that the 14th Amendment's [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]] did not apply the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to the actions of states (and by extension, local governments). If it had been overturned, the Selective Incorporation process may have become unnecessary, since the entire Bill of Rights, including the 2nd Amendment, would arguably be applied to the states.<ref>\"[T]he words 'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' seems to me an eminently reasonable way of expressing the idea that henceforth the Bill of Rights shall apply to the States.\" Erwin Chemerinsky et al., Constitutional Law \u00a7 6.3.2 (3d ed. 2006) (''quoting'' ''Duncan v. Louisiana'', 391 U.S. 145, 166 (1968) (Black, dissenting))</ref><ref>More precisely, the Privileges or Immunities Clause would incorporate the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights; since the 9th and 10th Amendments refer to the unenumerated rights of individuals and reserved powers of the states respectively, their incorporation, at least for the 10th Amendment, would be paradoxical or meaningless.</ref>\n\nIn attempting to overturn ''Slaughter-House'', this case garnered the attention and support of both conservative and liberal legal scholars interested in its potential application in areas outside of firearms law. Their interest was that if ''Slaughter-House'' had been overturned, it would have been possible that constitutional guarantees such as the right to a jury in civil cases, right to a grand jury in felony cases, and other parts of the Bill of Rights, as well as future court rulings and existing federal precedent, not universally guaranteed in actions by the states, would have been applied against the states automatically.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202428529045|title=Liberals Use Supreme Court Gun Case to Bolster Other Rights|publisher=www.law.com|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theusconstitution.org/page_module.php?id=12&mid=9|title=Constitutional Accountability Center filed brief in NRA v.

Set in the early to mid [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], the series follows the story of con-man turned small-time lawyer Jimmy McGill (played by [[Bob Odenkirk]]), beginning six years before the events of ''Breaking Bad'' and showing his transformation into the persona of criminal for hire [[Saul Goodman]]. McGill becomes the lawyer for former police officer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), whose skills allow him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. The show premiered on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] on February 8, 2015, airing five seasons to date. A sixth and final season is scheduled to air in 2021.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thorne |first=Will |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/better-call-saul-renewed-final-season-1203470181/ |title='Better Call Saul' Renewed for 6th and Final Season at AMC |work=Variety |date=January 16, 2020 |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMcGill is initially working as a low-paid lawyer with the back room of a nail salon as his home and office. His friend and romantic interest [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]) works as a lawyer at the firm of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), where she and Jimmy once worked in the mailroom. Partners at HHM include Jimmy's nemesis [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) and his brother [[Chuck McGill]] ([[Michael McKean]]). Ehrmantraut conducts illegal drug distribution with [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), in addition to becoming right-hand man for drug lord [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) who runs a chain of fast food restaurants as a business front. Their operations are disrupted by members of the Salamanca crime family, including [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]). Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito all reprise their roles from ''Breaking Bad''.\n\n''Better Call Saul'' has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its acting, characters, and cinematography; many critics have called it a worthy successor to ''Breaking Bad'' and one of the best prequels ever made, with some deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"sallgoodman\">{{cite web |last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |title='S'all good, man': How Better Call Saul became superior to Breaking Bad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/11/sall-good-man-how-better-call-saul-became-superior-to-breaking-bad |website=The Guardian |date=October 11, 2018 |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/20/better-call-saul-breaking-bad-vince-gilligan |title=The perfect prequel: how Better Call Saul left Breaking Bad in its dust |work=The Guardian |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Julia |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/04/18/better_call_saul_is_better_than_breaking_bad.html |title=Better Call Saul Is Better Than Breaking Bad |work=Slate |date=April 18, 2016 |accessdate=September 25, 2018}}</ref> It has garnered many nominations, including a [[Peabody Award]], 23 [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], eleven [[Writers Guild of America Awards]], five [[Critics' Choice Television Awards]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

This includes the uneasy truce between the Salamanca family that serves the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]] drug interest and later led by [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]) when their patriarch falls ill, and [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]), a restaurant entrepreneur that uses his stores as a front for the drug trade. Among those caught up in these events include [[Ignacio Varga|Ignacio \"Nacho\" Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), an enforcer for the Salamancas who only wants to protect his father from harm, and [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), a former police officer who becomes a [[fixer (person)|fixer]] for Gus.\n\nThe show also includes flash-forwards at the start of each season's premiere following the events of ''Breaking Bad'', where Saul has paid to take on a new identity as Gene Takovic, the manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|align=right|total_width=300\n|image1=Vince_Gilligan_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg\n|image2=Peter Gould by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n|footer=''Better Call Saul'' was developed by [[Vince Gilligan]] (left) and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n}}\n[[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] began planning a [[television spinoff]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' as early as 2009.

Jimmy cares for his brother Chuck, who is housebound without electricity because he believes he has electromagnetic hypersensitivity. While pursuing an elder law career, Jimmy discovers clients being defrauded by the Sandpiper retirement home and begins a class action lawsuit with Chuck. When the case grows, Chuck suggests giving it to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out. The case continues growing and HHM brings on Davis & Main. Unhappy at Howard's treatment of him, Kim recommends Jimmy to D&M.\n\n=== Season 2 (2016) ===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy works at D&M but quits after being reprimanded for his client outreach methods. Kim is demoted because of Jimmy's actions. To reclaim her status, she secures Mesa Verde Bank as a client for HHM but Howard denies her credit. Kim quits at HHM, and she and Jimmy begin separate private practices in a shared office. Jimmy secretly causes Chuck to make an error that delays a new branch construction, so Mesa Verde drops HHM to hire Kim. Nacho hires Mike to remove Tuco from the Salamanca organization. Mike goads Tuco into fighting and Tuco is imprisoned. Hector is suspicious so Mike prepares to assassinate him but is interrupted.\n\n=== Season 3 (2017) ===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck discovers Jimmy's fraud and tricks him into confessing, leading to suspension of Jimmy's law license. Chuck's ouster at HHM leads to his suicide.  Gus stops Mike from killing Hector. Mike attacks Hector's trucks and steals $250,000 from one. Mike asks for help laundering the money. Gus arranges for Mike's hire as a contracted security expert at Madrigal and payment of monthly consulting fees. Hector plans to take over Manuel's business so Nacho attempts to kill Hector by changing his angina medication for a placebo. Hector suffers a stroke and Gus\u2019 first aid saves him, though he remains comatose.\n\n=== Season 4 (2018) ===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy regains his outgoing demeanor after Howard shoulders blame for Chuck's death. Jimmy manages a cell phone store but makes more reselling prepaid phones. His law license reinstatement request is denied over lack of remorse for Chuck. After faking mourning, he successfully appeals, but reveals he is going to practice as Saul Goodman. Gus learns Nacho attempted to kill Hector and blackmails him into undermining the Salamancas. Mike escorts engineers who evaluate the laundry's potential as a meth lab and Gus hires Werner to oversee construction. Hector recovers mentally and can move his right index finger. Lalo Salamanca arrives to run Hector's business.\n\n===Season 5 (2020)===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's new business as Saul Goodman draws him into the drug trade within Alburquerque. Kim herself balances her Mesa Verde and ''pro bono'' work with her own feelings for Jimmy, and finds herself toying with the same conman-style tactics Jimmy employs within her casework. Lalo's presence forces Gus to halt the superlab construction, and both Nacho and Mike become pawns in the ongoing feud between the Salamancas and Gus.\n\n==''Talking Saul''==\n''Talking Saul'' is a [[live television|live]] [[aftershow]] hosted by [[Chris Hardwick]], which features guests discussing episodes of ''Better Call Saul''.

Gould]], and a prequel and spin-off of Gilligan's prior series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. Set in the early to mid [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], the series follows the story of con-man turned small-time lawyer Jimmy McGill (played by [[Bob Odenkirk]]), beginning six years before the events of ''Breaking Bad'' and showing his transformation into the persona of criminal for hire [[Saul Goodman]]. McGill becomes the lawyer for former police officer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), whose skills allow him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. The show premiered on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] on February 8, 2015, airing five seasons to date. A sixth and final season is scheduled to air in 2021.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thorne |first=Will |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/better-call-saul-renewed-final-season-1203470181/ |title='Better Call Saul' Renewed for 6th and Final Season at AMC |work=Variety |date=January 16, 2020 |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMcGill is initially working as a low-paid lawyer with the back room of a nail salon as his home and office. His friend and romantic interest [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]) works as a lawyer at the firm of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), where she and Jimmy once worked in the mailroom. Partners at HHM include Jimmy's nemesis [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) and his brother [[Chuck McGill]] ([[Michael McKean]]). Ehrmantraut conducts illegal drug distribution with [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), in addition to becoming right-hand man for drug lord [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) who runs a chain of fast food restaurants as a business front. Their operations are disrupted by members of the Salamanca crime family, including [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]). Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito all reprise their roles from ''Breaking Bad''.\n\n''Better Call Saul'' has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its acting, characters, and cinematography; many critics have called it a worthy successor to ''Breaking Bad'' and one of the best prequels ever made, with some deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"sallgoodman\">{{cite web |last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |title='S'all good, man': How Better Call Saul became superior to Breaking Bad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/11/sall-good-man-how-better-call-saul-became-superior-to-breaking-bad |website=The Guardian |date=October 11, 2018 |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/20/better-call-saul-breaking-bad-vince-gilligan |title=The perfect prequel: how Better Call Saul left Breaking Bad in its dust |work=The Guardian |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Julia |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/04/18/better_call_saul_is_better_than_breaking_bad.html |title=Better Call Saul Is Better Than Breaking Bad |work=Slate |date=April 18, 2016 |accessdate=September 25, 2018}}</ref> It has garnered many nominations, including a [[Peabody Award]], 23 [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], eleven [[Writers Guild of America Awards]], five [[Critics' Choice Television Awards]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

This includes the uneasy truce between the Salamanca family that serves the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]] drug interest and later led by [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]) when their patriarch falls ill, and [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]), a restaurant entrepreneur that uses his stores as a front for the drug trade. Among those caught up in these events include [[Ignacio Varga|Ignacio \"Nacho\" Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), an enforcer for the Salamancas who only wants to protect his father from harm, and [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), a former police officer who becomes a [[fixer (person)|fixer]] for Gus.\n\nThe show also includes flash-forwards at the start of each season's premiere following the events of ''Breaking Bad'', where Saul has paid to take on a new identity as Gene Takovic, the manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|align=right|total_width=300\n|image1=Vince_Gilligan_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg\n|image2=Peter Gould by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n|footer=''Better Call Saul'' was developed by [[Vince Gilligan]] (left) and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n}}\n[[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] began planning a [[television spinoff]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' as early as 2009.

Jimmy cares for his brother Chuck, who is housebound without electricity because he believes he has electromagnetic hypersensitivity. While pursuing an elder law career, Jimmy discovers clients being defrauded by the Sandpiper retirement home and begins a class action lawsuit with Chuck. When the case grows, Chuck suggests giving it to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out. The case continues growing and HHM brings on Davis & Main. Unhappy at Howard's treatment of him, Kim recommends Jimmy to D&M.\n\n=== Season 2 (2016) ===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy works at D&M but quits after being reprimanded for his client outreach methods. Kim is demoted because of Jimmy's actions. To reclaim her status, she secures Mesa Verde Bank as a client for HHM but Howard denies her credit. Kim quits at HHM, and she and Jimmy begin separate private practices in a shared office. Jimmy secretly causes Chuck to make an error that delays a new branch construction, so Mesa Verde drops HHM to hire Kim. Nacho hires Mike to remove Tuco from the Salamanca organization. Mike goads Tuco into fighting and Tuco is imprisoned. Hector is suspicious so Mike prepares to assassinate him but is interrupted.\n\n=== Season 3 (2017) ===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck discovers Jimmy's fraud and tricks him into confessing, leading to suspension of Jimmy's law license. Chuck's ouster at HHM leads to his suicide.  Gus stops Mike from killing Hector. Mike attacks Hector's trucks and steals $250,000 from one. Mike asks for help laundering the money. Gus arranges for Mike's hire as a contracted security expert at Madrigal and payment of monthly consulting fees. Hector plans to take over Manuel's business so Nacho attempts to kill Hector by changing his angina medication for a placebo. Hector suffers a stroke and Gus\u2019 first aid saves him, though he remains comatose.\n\n=== Season 4 (2018) ===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy regains his outgoing demeanor after Howard shoulders blame for Chuck's death. Jimmy manages a cell phone store but makes more reselling prepaid phones. His law license reinstatement request is denied over lack of remorse for Chuck. After faking mourning, he successfully appeals, but reveals he is going to practice as Saul Goodman. Gus learns Nacho attempted to kill Hector and blackmails him into undermining the Salamancas. Mike escorts engineers who evaluate the laundry's potential as a meth lab and Gus hires Werner to oversee construction. Hector recovers mentally and can move his right index finger. Lalo Salamanca arrives to run Hector's business.\n\n===Season 5 (2020)===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's new business as Saul Goodman draws him into the drug trade within Alburquerque. Kim herself balances her Mesa Verde and ''pro bono'' work with her own feelings for Jimmy, and finds herself toying with the same conman-style tactics Jimmy employs within her casework. Lalo's presence forces Gus to halt the superlab construction, and both Nacho and Mike become pawns in the ongoing feud between the Salamancas and Gus.\n\n==''Talking Saul''==\n''Talking Saul'' is a [[live television|live]] [[aftershow]] hosted by [[Chris Hardwick]], which features guests discussing episodes of ''Better Call Saul''.
