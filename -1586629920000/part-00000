Their first studio album of this period, released in mid-1970, was ''[[Deep Purple in Rock|In Rock]]'' (a name supported by the album's [[Mount Rushmore]]-inspired cover), which contained the then-concert staples \"[[Speed King]]\", \"Into The Fire\" and \"[[Child in Time]]\".

He would play something, and I'd have to see if I could match it. That provided a sense of humour, a sense of tension to the band, a sense of, 'what the hell's going to happen next?'

This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the ''Billboard'' Top 100. Soon after the third album's eventual release, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. (Tetragrammaton's assets were assumed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], who would release Deep Purple's records in the US throughout the 1970s.)\n\nDuring the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to take the band in a heavier direction. Feeling that Evans and Simper would not fit well with a heavy rock style, both were replaced that summer.<ref>Joel Whitburn (2007). \"The Billboard Albums: Includes Every Album That Made the Billboard 200 Chart\". p.227. Record Research Inc., 2007</ref> Paice stated, \"A change had to come.

He had also jammed with such luminaries as [[Dr. John]], [[Albert King]], [[the Good Rats]], [[Moxy (band)|Moxy]] and [[Alphonse Mouzon]], and was busy working on his first solo album, ''[[Teaser (Tommy Bolin album)|Teaser]]'', when he accepted the invitation to join Deep Purple.<ref name=\"Talevski\"/>\n\nThe resulting album, ''[[Come Taste the Band]]'', was released in October 1975, one month before Bolin's ''Teaser'' album.

Despite Bolin's talents, his personal problems with hard drugs began to manifest themselves. During the ''Come Taste the Band'' tour many fans openly booed Bolin's inability to play solos like Ritchie Blackmore, not realising that Bolin was physically hampered by his addiction. At this same time, as he admitted in interviews years later, Hughes was suffering from a cocaine addiction.<ref name=MkIV-story>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liGRWQECxZc |title=Gettin' Tighter: The Story Of Deep Purple Mk.

She is best known from her cinematic metal band [[Dark Sarah]] and as the former lead singer of Finnish [[power metal]] band [[Amberian Dawn]]. Before working with Amberian Dawn, she played keyboards and provided background vocals for a band called Iconofear. \n\n==Early life==\nHeidi's musical history started quite early in a children's music playschool. Later on, at a primary school, she went to a music-oriented class. She started taking piano lessons at the age of 11, but soon she said it became very clear that she wanted more than just classical piano playing. After various teachers, she quit taking piano lessons and has played by herself. At the age of 14, she started classical singing studies in a music institute with the diploma singer Raisa Lahtiranta. During more than ten years she had also sung in various choirs and ensembles.<ref name=\"spirit-of-metal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/membre_groupe/membre_groupe-nom-Heidi_Parviainen-id-14007-l-en.html|title=Parviainen Heidi (Amberian Dawn)- Musician Profile|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===Agonia, Iconofear (1997\u20132006)===\nThe first contact with heavy music came in 1997 at high school, when a couple of high school heavy-metal guys asked her to sing on their EP.

At the end of ''Horrid Henry and the Silly Siblings'' it is revealed that his nickname is \"Silly Simon\".

Henry is then given tickets to the next Killer Boy Rats concert. While on TV Ed says he is going back to being a Killer Boy Rats member and his manager explains that it was Henry inspired him to return to the music group. Henry and his family then go to the concert where the Killer Boy Rats sing a song (\"Gonna Be A Rock Star\") as a token of thanks and appreciation to Henry who is on stage with them as a drummer.\n\n===Evil Eddy Edwards===\nEvil Eddy Edwards is a milkman who has a rivalry with Pimply Paul as seen in Horrid Henry Delivers The Milk.\n\n==F==\n\n===Fang the Hamster===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Fang\n| series             = Horrid Henry\n| first              = Horrid Henry's Horrid Hamster\n| last               = TBA\n| creator            = Francessa Simon\n| family             = Henry,Peter,Mum,Dad\n| relatives          = None\n}}\n\nFang is Henry's loyal, vicious [[hamster]].

She thinks that Henry is a little girl called Henrietta (or Henny in ''Horrid Henry's Underpants''), and that Peter is a teenager. This is reflected in the presents that she sends to the boys. Although Henry's Mum and Dad have told her countless times that Henry is a boy and that Peter is six, Greta refuses to believe this, and usually doesn't hear, most likely due to her senility. Her senility is such that she once cooked cat food for the boys and believed that Fluffy is a dog named Fido. She also mistook it to be the middle of the night when in fact it was only half past five in the afternoon. She wears a light pink sweater, a gold button studded in her white blouse, dark pink skirt, lavender shoes and a walking stick.\n\n===Greedy Graham===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Graham\n| series             = Horrid Henry\n| portrayer          = Wayne Forester\n| nickname           = Greedy Graham\n| gender             = Male\n}}\nGreedy Graham is a brown-haired obese boy who is always hungry and is often seen eating carrots and junk food in the earlier episodes.

He believes that life is unfair as the rest of the world is against him, so he fights \"against the tyranny of adults\". He is resistant to defeat as teachers, relatives and babysitters in the series try their best to avoid him. Even his parents argue over whose turn it is to look after him.\n\nHenry is very selfish, inconsiderate, stubborn, and rarely learns from his mistakes. He can also be bluntly honest, as seen when he tells his mother's boss what she calls her at work behind her back and is unafraid of telling people how much he hates them right to their faces. However, he is willing to act nice and collude with Margaret and even Peter, but only if it means he will get to have his own way. Most likely because of his young age, Henry can get frightened by talk of ghosts or monsters, and in one episode, is revealed to have a [[fear of needles]]. He is very imaginative, as he indulges in fantasies, usually transforming into terrifying creatures and attacking the source of his frustrations, and often has \"Eureka moments\" when the stories mention what he thinks is a \"spectacularly wonderful idea\". In every story, there is something Henry has to get or do (or occasionally avoid doing) and the ensuing chaos is the consequence of this overriding desire.\n\nWhenever Henry thinks of a plan it is simply to get his own way, never to make trouble purely for its own sake. He is more often than not seen taking life very seriously and he sincerely believes in what he is doing, making him something of a complex character as well. It has also been further hinted that deep down, Henry never really means to be horrid, and only acts that way as a wanting to get attention and needing to feel important, especially when dealing with his younger brother Peter, implying he has low self-esteem.\n\n===Helpful Hari===\nShe is invited to Peter's party in ''Perfect Peter's Pirate Party'' and is in Peter's class.\n\n==I==\n\n===Inky Ian===\n\nInky Ian is a pupil who isn't very much in Henry's [[classroom]] who is only seen in the book version ''Horrid Henry and the Football Fiend''.\n\n==J==\n\n===Jazzy Jim===\nJazzy Jim is a minor character in Henry's class who likes music.

She teaches [[Horrid Henry (Character)|Horrid Henry]], and many of his classmates such as [[Rude Ralph]], [[Moody Margaret]] and [[Sour Susan]]. She seems to have a particular disliking towards Henry, which would be because it is usually his horrid behaviour which disrupts her class. She once said that Henry's class was the worst she ever taught. In very few episodes, her mother, Mrs Battle-Axe, has appeared, who appears to discipline her daughter greatly. She wears pointy glasses and has gray hair. She also wears a green cardigan, pale chartreuse top, brown skirt, and brownish stockings.

She is a spoilt brat. She is portrayed as the secondary main antagonist in the series and serves as Horrid Henry's archenemy. She lives next door to Horrid Henry and her best friend is Sour Susan. She has magenta hair in a spiky ponytail.\nHenry and Margaret are enemies; Margaret has a secret club and Henry has the Purple Hand Gang. She has an ability of screaming and always competes with Henry. She might have a crush on Henry, because in ''Perfect Peter's Revenge'', she is happy when Peter sends her a forged letter that said Henry loves and wants to marry Margaret. This is also seen in other episodes. She wears a violet [[tank top]] with white stripes, green [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] and a bottle-green skirt. Margaret, however, occasionally assists Henry in his plans, as seen in ''Horrid Henry's Horrid Revenge'' and ''Horrid Henry and the Big Dig'', though under the word of being the leader of the Purple Hand Gang for a day or a month or even a whole year you will never know how long it will be maybe a week or even every month/year/day/second/minute. She is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols. In the episode ''Horrid Henry Rockstar'' it is suggested that her full name is Margaret Millicent Maudita Smythe which she also uses in subsequent episodes. However she denies this when Rude Ralph asks her if this is true.\n\nAs the primary antagonist of the series, Moody Margaret is the most prominent arch-enemy of the series' protagonist, [[Horrid Henry]]. When Francesca Simon was in the process of creating this character, she suggested a boy called Moody Martin. However, her husband did not approve of the idea as it would be too much like Horrid Henry the main character. Thus, Martin became a female called Margaret. Margaret is depicted as being a self-absorbed, grumpy, spiteful, and cantankerous girl who shares an intense rivalry with Henry, and their opposing neighborhood clubs continuously develop practical jokes or conspiracies against one another. They have resorted to each other's companionship when left with no other options, but nonetheless detest one another and continuously plot against one another, especially in an attempt to soil each other's reputations. Margaret has a tendency to gloat about her various accomplishments in a ridiculously [[narcissistic]] fashion, looking down on others and domineering her friends and peers. True to this, she is resented by her best friend Sour Susan because of her rudeness, but Susan seems to have no other choice than to reluctantly obey Margaret's constant commands. Margaret viciously domineers the Secret Club in various plots formulated against Henry's corresponding Purple Hang Gang, and the two opposing sides share a mutual animosity. She is used to having her own way and is capable of releasing violent, piercing screeches when her demands remain unfulfilled.\n\n====Live-action====\n\n[[File:Scarlet Stitt Moody Margaret.jpg|150px|thumb|Movie poster for ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'' featuring Scarlet Stitt as Moody Margaret.]]\n* Scarlet Stitt portrays Moody Margaret in the 2011 movie, ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]''. At the beginning of the movie, She, Sour Susan and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Singing Soroya|Singing Soroya]] are in the Secret Club treehouse eating biscuits and arguing. Henry disguises himself as a spy, steals the biscuits and runs away but Margaret has also stolen his mighty magnet yoyo. Later, on his way home from school, Henry dodges a water balloon thrown by Margaret. He ducks behind a lamppost, waits for Margaret to walk past, throws a balloon filled with water that hovers over her head and finally, flicks a yoyo at the balloon which bursts and soaks Margaret. Margaret shrieks and throws another balloon at Henry but he ducks and it hits [[Perfect Peter]] instead.<br>The next day at school, Margaret hangs a pail filled with purple paint over the door, ties one end of a rope to it and the other end to the door's handle. Instead of Henry who gets painted, it is their teacher [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Battle-Axe|Miss Battle-Axe]] who falls for the trick. Battle-Axe blames it on Henry, giving Margaret a lucky escape. The next day, Miss Battle Axe's class is moved to [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Lovely|Miss Lovely]]'s class after the head sacks Miss Battle-Axe for not controlling the pupils. Margaret snatches Henry's bag and Henry tries to pull it back, resulting in a pot of \"Exploding Gross-Glue\" placed by the school inspectors to fly out. The glue bursts and hits Miss Lovely in the face. She too gets sacked and the head, and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Oddbod|Miss Oddbod]] bans Henry from entering the school's talent contest. As the school is going bankrupt, many children transfer to another school. Margaret and Henry both get transferred to a girls' school (Henry's Great-Aunt Greta transferred him there as she thinks he is a girl).<br>The girls in the school attack Henry for being a boy and try to attack Margaret too for being with Henry. The two of them escape and form an alliance to save their school. They do this by making Henry sneak into the talent contest and win it so he would be so famous but the plan fails. They try another plan which involves Henry going onto a game show to win the big cash prize so he can give it to Miss Oddbod so she can give it to the school inspectors to bribe them away as they were the ones trying to get the school closed down under the order of the head of a boys' school called [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Vic Van Wrinkle|Vic Van Wrinkle]]. However, although Henry wins, the Best Boy's Club, Miss Lovely and Miss Oddbod had got Vic and the inspectors arrested so she lets Henry keep the money. At the very end, Margaret is seen in a fairy costume at Henry's party.\n\n====Animation====\n\n* In 2006's ''[[Horrid Henry (TV series)|Horrid Henry]]'' TV series, Moody Margaret is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols and is the series' most recurring villain.

He is often referred to as a \"worm\" by Henry. Peter has a very effeminate attitude, liking flowers much like [[Walter the Softy]] in the [[Dennis the Menace (UK comics)|Dennis the Menace]] comic strips and [[Dennis the Menace (1996 TV series)|cartoon series]], believes in fairy tales, and is known to always do as he is told and treat others with respect. On several occasions, however, he has revealed that he is in reality, very whiny and spoiled. It is obvious that Peter likes to get back at Henry with the help of his parents, and he always [[Emotional blackmail|emotionally bribes]] them (e.g.: \"You're the best mum in the world! So Henry won't be getting any biscuits will he?\"), resulting in his parents favouring him. Aside from being spoiled, he shows aspects of being sort of like Moody Margaret, except that instead of using a bossy tone, he adopts a crying and sorrowful look to get what he wants.\n\nOften, Henry gets into trouble as a result of Peter telling Mum or Dad when he has done something wrong, usually with the phrases \"Mum/Dad! Henry's being horrid/mean!\" or \"Mum/Dad! Henry called me a [[worm]]/a toad/told me to shut up!\", and he even blames Henry for the most minor offences. He has been known to blame Henry for things Henry doesn't do. He is also similar to his friends as he hates dirt, is always tidy and always does as he is told, unlike Henry. He also expects praise for even the most minor things, such as \"being normal\", using his fork and knife, and also shows off how good he is, especially when Henry is being reprimanded. This, and the fact that he always asks them politely.\n\nAt times, Peter can be desperate for praise and attention; he gets his toys out just to tidy them again in the episode \"Horrid Henry And The Best Boys Club\". In the same episode, it is hinted he sees the other members of \"The Best Boys Club\" as underlings rather than actual friends as he immediately refuses Gordon's suggestion of taking turns to decide things. This suggests that he only acts perfect because he gets praised. At times, he tries to take credit for Henry's rare good deeds, as shown in ''Horrid Henry's Perfect Day'', and in ''Horrid Henry Horrid Headmaster'', when he recorded what Henry said when Henry discovered he had to fill end of term reports (\"No holiday for me, then.\"), then modified it into \"No holiday!\", causing the students to rebel. He seldom defies orders or complains about said orders, though it has been revealed that his sweet-natured personality is soiled with narcissism; he has indeed defied adults or rules in revenge against Henry or while attempting to frame him, and he derives pleasure from Henry's suffering and punishments for poor behavior, implying that he may actually not be much better than his brother. Despite all this, Henry will still help Peter out on occasion, such as rescuing him from a falling shelf in the cellar in ''Horrid Henry Trapped''.\n\n====Live-action====\n* In 2011's ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'', Perfect Peter is shown as a pure goody-goody and never shows his bad side. He is one of the very few people who help save the school from [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Vic Van Wrinkle|Vic Van Wrinkle]].\n\n====Animation====\n* In 2006's ''[[Horrid Henry (TV series)|Horrid Henry]]'' TV series, Perfect Peter is the most recurring character apart from Henry.\n\n===Perky Parveen===\nShe is in Peter's class and is invited to Peter's birthday party.

A good example was that Peter sprayed Henry with a hose deliberately, even chasing him around the garden, but he ended up telling Henry that he should have got out of the way when Peter was \"watering the flowers\".  Although strict he appears to be more tolerant of Henry by giving him second chances. Also, he is often shown to be capable of distracting Henry enough that he behaves.

At the end of ''Horrid Henry and the Silly Siblings'' it is revealed that his nickname is \"Silly Simon\".

After Henry gets up on stage during a concert and sings (loud and off-key) one of his Killer Boys Rats songs, his manager phones Henry and congratulates him. Henry is then given tickets to the next Killer Boy Rats concert. While on TV Ed says he is going back to being a Killer Boy Rats member and his manager explains that it was Henry inspired him to return to the music group.

Like Peter, she seems to have a vindictive streak towards Henry as she once framed him for eating several packets of a snack that Mum likes.

Although Henry's Mum and Dad have told her countless times that Henry is a boy and that Peter is six, Greta refuses to believe this, and usually doesn't hear, most likely due to her senility. Her senility is such that she once cooked cat food for the boys and believed that Fluffy is a dog named Fido.

Even his parents argue over whose turn it is to look after him.\n\nHenry is very selfish, inconsiderate, stubborn, and rarely learns from his mistakes.

However, he is willing to act nice and collude with Margaret and even Peter, but only if it means he will get to have his own way. Most likely because of his young age, Henry can get frightened by talk of ghosts or monsters, and in one episode, is revealed to have a [[fear of needles]]. He is very imaginative, as he indulges in fantasies, usually transforming into terrifying creatures and attacking the source of his frustrations, and often has \"Eureka moments\" when the stories mention what he thinks is a \"spectacularly wonderful idea\". In every story, there is something Henry has to get or do (or occasionally avoid doing) and the ensuing chaos is the consequence of this overriding desire.\n\nWhenever Henry thinks of a plan it is simply to get his own way, never to make trouble purely for its own sake. He is more often than not seen taking life very seriously and he sincerely believes in what he is doing, making him something of a complex character as well. It has also been further hinted that deep down, Henry never really means to be horrid, and only acts that way as a wanting to get attention and needing to feel important, especially when dealing with his younger brother Peter, implying he has low self-esteem.\n\n===Helpful Hari===\nShe is invited to Peter's party in ''Perfect Peter's Pirate Party'' and is in Peter's class.\n\n==I==\n\n===Inky Ian===\n\nInky Ian is a pupil who isn't very much in Henry's [[classroom]] who is only seen in the book version ''Horrid Henry and the Football Fiend''.\n\n==J==\n\n===Jazzy Jim===\nJazzy Jim is a minor character in Henry's class who likes music.

She is a spoilt brat. She is portrayed as the secondary main antagonist in the series and serves as Horrid Henry's archenemy. She lives next door to Horrid Henry and her best friend is Sour Susan. She has magenta hair in a spiky ponytail.\nHenry and Margaret are enemies; Margaret has a secret club and Henry has the Purple Hand Gang. She has an ability of screaming and always competes with Henry. She might have a crush on Henry, because in ''Perfect Peter's Revenge'', she is happy when Peter sends her a forged letter that said Henry loves and wants to marry Margaret. This is also seen in other episodes. She wears a violet [[tank top]] with white stripes, green [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] and a bottle-green skirt. Margaret, however, occasionally assists Henry in his plans, as seen in ''Horrid Henry's Horrid Revenge'' and ''Horrid Henry and the Big Dig'', though under the word of being the leader of the Purple Hand Gang for a day or a month or even a whole year you will never know how long it will be maybe a week or even every month/year/day/second/minute. She is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols. In the episode ''Horrid Henry Rockstar'' it is suggested that her full name is Margaret Millicent Maudita Smythe which she also uses in subsequent episodes. However she denies this when Rude Ralph asks her if this is true.\n\nAs the primary antagonist of the series, Moody Margaret is the most prominent arch-enemy of the series' protagonist, [[Horrid Henry]]. When Francesca Simon was in the process of creating this character, she suggested a boy called Moody Martin. However, her husband did not approve of the idea as it would be too much like Horrid Henry the main character. Thus, Martin became a female called Margaret. Margaret is depicted as being a self-absorbed, grumpy, spiteful, and cantankerous girl who shares an intense rivalry with Henry, and their opposing neighborhood clubs continuously develop practical jokes or conspiracies against one another. They have resorted to each other's companionship when left with no other options, but nonetheless detest one another and continuously plot against one another, especially in an attempt to soil each other's reputations. Margaret has a tendency to gloat about her various accomplishments in a ridiculously [[narcissistic]] fashion, looking down on others and domineering her friends and peers. True to this, she is resented by her best friend Sour Susan because of her rudeness, but Susan seems to have no other choice than to reluctantly obey Margaret's constant commands. Margaret viciously domineers the Secret Club in various plots formulated against Henry's corresponding Purple Hang Gang, and the two opposing sides share a mutual animosity. She is used to having her own way and is capable of releasing violent, piercing screeches when her demands remain unfulfilled.\n\n====Live-action====\n\n[[File:Scarlet Stitt Moody Margaret.jpg|150px|thumb|Movie poster for ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'' featuring Scarlet Stitt as Moody Margaret.]]\n* Scarlet Stitt portrays Moody Margaret in the 2011 movie, ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]''. At the beginning of the movie, She, Sour Susan and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Singing Soroya|Singing Soroya]] are in the Secret Club treehouse eating biscuits and arguing. Henry disguises himself as a spy, steals the biscuits and runs away but Margaret has also stolen his mighty magnet yoyo. Later, on his way home from school, Henry dodges a water balloon thrown by Margaret. He ducks behind a lamppost, waits for Margaret to walk past, throws a balloon filled with water that hovers over her head and finally, flicks a yoyo at the balloon which bursts and soaks Margaret. Margaret shrieks and throws another balloon at Henry but he ducks and it hits [[Perfect Peter]] instead.<br>The next day at school, Margaret hangs a pail filled with purple paint over the door, ties one end of a rope to it and the other end to the door's handle. Instead of Henry who gets painted, it is their teacher [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Battle-Axe|Miss Battle-Axe]] who falls for the trick. Battle-Axe blames it on Henry, giving Margaret a lucky escape. The next day, Miss Battle Axe's class is moved to [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Lovely|Miss Lovely]]'s class after the head sacks Miss Battle-Axe for not controlling the pupils. Margaret snatches Henry's bag and Henry tries to pull it back, resulting in a pot of \"Exploding Gross-Glue\" placed by the school inspectors to fly out. The glue bursts and hits Miss Lovely in the face. She too gets sacked and the head, and [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Miss Oddbod|Miss Oddbod]] bans Henry from entering the school's talent contest. As the school is going bankrupt, many children transfer to another school. Margaret and Henry both get transferred to a girls' school (Henry's Great-Aunt Greta transferred him there as she thinks he is a girl).<br>The girls in the school attack Henry for being a boy and try to attack Margaret too for being with Henry. The two of them escape and form an alliance to save their school. They do this by making Henry sneak into the talent contest and win it so he would be so famous but the plan fails. They try another plan which involves Henry going onto a game show to win the big cash prize so he can give it to Miss Oddbod so she can give it to the school inspectors to bribe them away as they were the ones trying to get the school closed down under the order of the head of a boys' school called [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Vic Van Wrinkle|Vic Van Wrinkle]]. However, although Henry wins, the Best Boy's Club, Miss Lovely and Miss Oddbod had got Vic and the inspectors arrested so she lets Henry keep the money. At the very end, Margaret is seen in a fairy costume at Henry's party.\n\n====Animation====\n\n* In 2006's ''[[Horrid Henry (TV series)|Horrid Henry]]'' TV series, Moody Margaret is voiced by Sue Elliot-Nichols and is the series' most recurring villain.

It has been hinted in some episodes, especially in series 4, that she may in fact admire Henry and wants to be his friend. She has shown a very keen interest in wanting to join The Purple Hand Gang. She might have a crush on Henry, e.g. in \"Perfect Peter's Revenge\", she was happy when Peter send her a forged letter that said Henry loves and wants to marry Margaret. On Henry's side he pictures himself marrying Margaret when he imagines himself in the future in the episodes ''Horrid Henry Gets Married'' and ''Horrid Henry's Birthday Bonanza'' although he does not know why this is.

He is often referred to as a \"worm\" by Henry. Peter has a very effeminate attitude, liking flowers much like [[Walter the Softy]] in the [[Dennis the Menace (UK comics)|Dennis the Menace]] comic strips and [[Dennis the Menace (1996 TV series)|cartoon series]], believes in fairy tales, and is known to always do as he is told and treat others with respect. On several occasions, however, he has revealed that he is in reality, very whiny and spoiled. It is obvious that Peter likes to get back at Henry with the help of his parents, and he always [[Emotional blackmail|emotionally bribes]] them (e.g.: \"You're the best mum in the world! So Henry won't be getting any biscuits will he?\"), resulting in his parents favouring him. Aside from being spoiled, he shows aspects of being sort of like Moody Margaret, except that instead of using a bossy tone, he adopts a crying and sorrowful look to get what he wants.\n\nOften, Henry gets into trouble as a result of Peter telling Mum or Dad when he has done something wrong, usually with the phrases \"Mum/Dad! Henry's being horrid/mean!\" or \"Mum/Dad! Henry called me a [[worm]]/a toad/told me to shut up!\", and he even blames Henry for the most minor offences. He has been known to blame Henry for things Henry doesn't do. He is also similar to his friends as he hates dirt, is always tidy and always does as he is told, unlike Henry. He also expects praise for even the most minor things, such as \"being normal\", using his fork and knife, and also shows off how good he is, especially when Henry is being reprimanded. This, and the fact that he always asks them politely.\n\nAt times, Peter can be desperate for praise and attention; he gets his toys out just to tidy them again in the episode \"Horrid Henry And The Best Boys Club\". In the same episode, it is hinted he sees the other members of \"The Best Boys Club\" as underlings rather than actual friends as he immediately refuses Gordon's suggestion of taking turns to decide things. This suggests that he only acts perfect because he gets praised. At times, he tries to take credit for Henry's rare good deeds, as shown in ''Horrid Henry's Perfect Day'', and in ''Horrid Henry Horrid Headmaster'', when he recorded what Henry said when Henry discovered he had to fill end of term reports (\"No holiday for me, then.\"), then modified it into \"No holiday!\", causing the students to rebel. He seldom defies orders or complains about said orders, though it has been revealed that his sweet-natured personality is soiled with narcissism; he has indeed defied adults or rules in revenge against Henry or while attempting to frame him, and he derives pleasure from Henry's suffering and punishments for poor behavior, implying that he may actually not be much better than his brother. Despite all this, Henry will still help Peter out on occasion, such as rescuing him from a falling shelf in the cellar in ''Horrid Henry Trapped''.\n\n====Live-action====\n* In 2011's ''[[Horrid Henry: The Movie]]'', Perfect Peter is shown as a pure goody-goody and never shows his bad side. He is one of the very few people who help save the school from [[List of Horrid Henry characters#Vic Van Wrinkle|Vic Van Wrinkle]].\n\n====Animation====\n* In 2006's ''[[Horrid Henry (TV series)|Horrid Henry]]'' TV series, Perfect Peter is the most recurring character apart from Henry.\n\n===Perky Parveen===\nShe is in Peter's class and is invited to Peter's birthday party.

Fran\u00e7ais la r\u00e9volution qui vous r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e8re a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 en vous de grandes vertus ; mais craignez, qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait affaibli dans vos \u00e2mes le sentiment de l\u2019humanit\u00e9, sans lequel il ne peut y en avoir que de fausses ! Entendez d\u2019avance l\u2019Histoire, qui redira \u00e0 la renomm\u00e9e : \"Louis \u00e9tait mont\u00e9 sur le tr\u00f4ne \u00e0 vingt ans, et \u00e0 vingt ans il donna l\u2019exemple des m\u0153urs : il n\u2019y porta aucune faiblesse coupable ni aucune passion corruptrice ; il fut \u00e9conome, juste et s\u00e9v\u00e8re ; il s\u2019y montra toujours l\u2019ami constant du peuple. Le peuple d\u00e9sirait la destruction d\u2019un imp\u00f4t d\u00e9sastreux qui pesait sur lui, il le d\u00e9truisit ; le peuple demandait l\u2019abolition de la servitude, il commen\u00e7a par l\u2019abolir lui-m\u00eame dans ses domaines ; le peuple sollicitait des r\u00e9formes dans la l\u00e9gislation criminelle pour l\u2019adoucissement du sort des accus\u00e9s, il fit ces r\u00e9formes ; le peuple voulait que des milliers de Fran\u00e7ais que la rigueur de nos usages avait priv\u00e9s jusqu\u2019alors des droits qui appartient aux citoyens, acquissent ces droits ou les recouvrassent, il les en fit jouir par ses lois. Le peuple voulut la libert\u00e9, il la lui donna ! Il vint m\u00eame au devant de lui par ses sacrifices, et cependant c\u2019est au nom de ce m\u00eame peuple qu\u2019on demande aujourd\u2019hui... Citoyens, je n\u2019ach\u00e8ve pas... JE M\u2019ARR\u00caTE DEVANT L\u2019HISTOIRE : songez qu\u2019elle jugera votre jugement et que le sien sera celui des si\u00e8cles\". En venant \u00e0 la r\u00e9futation des chefs d\u2019accusation, Romain de S\u00e8ze les divisa adroitement : tenant pour nuls ceux qui \u00e9taient ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la Constitution ou qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 amnisti\u00e9s par elle, et ceux qui lui \u00e9taient post\u00e9rieurs mais dont les ministres assumaient l\u00e9galement, la responsabilit\u00e9, il nia l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger et d\u00e9clara Louis XVI irresponsable des tractations men\u00e9es par ses fr\u00e8res avec l\u2019Autriche. Il nia pareillement l\u2019envoi des subsides aux \u00e9migr\u00e9s, l\u2019accusation manquant \u00e0 vrai dire de preuves formelles. Ce fut la partie la moins solide de la d\u00e9fense, ce qui importait d\u2019ailleurs assez peu, les d\u00e9put\u00e9s de la Convention ayant la conviction que Louis XVI avait pactis\u00e9 avec l\u2019ennemi.}}\n--->\n\n==The defense, 26 December 1792==\n\n=== The defense team ===\n\nLouis XVI sought the most illustrious legal minds in France as his defense team. He first asked [[Gui-Jean-Baptiste Target]], former deputy of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] and hero of the [[Parlement]]s of the [[ancien r\u00e9gime]], to lead his defense, but the elderly lawyer refused on account of his age. The task of lead counsel fell to [[Raymond Des\u00e8ze]], who was assisted by [[Fran\u00e7ois Denis Tronchet]] (Target's closest colleague, who came on board reluctantly, only at the King's insistence) and [[Guillaume-Chr\u00e9tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes]] (Louis XVI's former [[Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi|Secretary of State]]).\n\nThough he had only two weeks to prepare his defense arguments. Des\u00e8ze's brilliance so shone through in a first draft that, although it was moving, Louis rejected it as too rhetorical, saying, \"I do not want to play on their (the Convention's) feelings\".\n\nWhen the time came to deliver the defense (26 December 1792), despite having had no sleep for over four days, he pleaded the king's case for three hours, arguing eloquently yet discreetly that the revolution spare his life. Beginning with a description of why the charges were invalid (under the terms of the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]] Louis, as king, was immune from prosecution), he attacked the right of [[National Convention]] to stand as judge and jury. Finally, he moved to a rejection of the charges in the ''acte enonciatif'' drawn up by the constitution charge by charge, with a royalist history of the revolution, portraying Louis as \"the restorer of French Liberty\". He finished, like many of the set-piece speeches of the revolution, with an appeal to history:\n{{quote|Louis ascended the throne at the age of twenty, and at the age of twenty he gave to the throne the example of character. He brought to the throne no wicked weaknesses, no corrupting passions. He was economical, just, severe. He showed himself always the constant friend of the people. The people wanted the abolition of servitude. He began by abolishing it on his own lands. The people asked for reforms in the criminal law... he carried out these reforms. The people wanted liberty: he gave it to them. The people themselves came before him in his sacrifices. Nevertheless, it is in the name of these very people that one today demands... Citizens, I cannot finish... I stop myself before History. Think how it will judge your judgement, and that the judgement of him will be judged by the centuries.}}\n\n=== Declaration of Louis XVI in his defense. ===\n\"You have heard my defense, I would not repeat the details. In talking to you perhaps for the last time, I declare that my conscience reproaches me with nothing, and my defenders have told you the truth. I never feared the public examination of my conduct, but my heart is torn by the imputation that I would want to shed the blood of the people and especially that the misfortunes of August 10th be attributed to me. I avow that the many proofs that I have always acted from my love of the people, and the manner in which I have always conducted myself, seemed to prove that I did not fear to put myself forward in order to spare their blood, and forever prevent such an imputation.\"\n<!---\n{{On vient de vous exposer mes moyens de d\u00e9fense, je ne les renouvellerai point !

Ultimately, 693 deputies voted to convict the former king. Not a single deputy voted \"no,\" though 26 attached some condition to their votes.  Twenty-six deputies were absent from the vote, most on official business. Twenty-three deputies abstained, for various reasons. Several abstained because they felt they had been elected to make laws rather than to judge.\n\n==The punishment, 16\u201317 January==\n\n===The Mailhe amendment===\nFor the king's sentence, deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]] proposed  \"Death, but [...] I think it would be worthy of the Convention to consider whether it would be useful to policy to delay the execution\" which was supported by twenty-six deputies. This \"Mailhe amendment\" was regarded by some of Mailhe's contemporaries as a conspiracy to save the king's life. It was even suggested that Mailhe had been paid, perhaps by Spanish gold.\n\n===The vote===\nParis voted overwhelmingly for death, 21 to 3. Robespierre voted first, and said \"The sentiment that led me to call for the abolition of the death penalty is the same that today forces me to demand that it be applied to the tyrant of my country.\" [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9]], formerly the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and Louis' own cousin, voted for his execution, a cause of much future bitterness among French monarchists.\n\nThere were 721 voters in total. 34 voted for death with attached conditions (23 of whom invoked the Mailhe amendment), 2 voted for life imprisonment in irons, 319 voted for imprisonment until the end of the war (to be followed by banishment). 361 voted for death without conditions, just carrying the vote by a marginal majority. Louis was to be put to death.\n\n===Execution===\n{{main|Execution of Louis XVI}} \nLouis was [[guillotine]]d on 21 January 1793 in the Place de la R\u00e9volution (renamed [[Place de la Concorde]] in 1795).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* David P.

Citoyens je vous parlerai avec la franchise d\u2019un homme libre : je cherche parmi vous des juges, et je n\u2019y vois que des accusateurs ! Vous voulez prononcer sur le sort de Louis, et c\u2019est vous m\u00eames qui l\u2019accusez ! Vous voulez et vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9mis votre v\u0153u ! Vous voulez prononcez sur le sort de Louis  et vos opinions parcourent l\u2019Europe ! Louis sera donc le seul Fran\u00e7ais pour lequel il n\u2019existe aucune loi, ni aucune forme ! Il ne jouira ni de son ancienne condition ni de la nouvelle ! Quelle \u00e9trange et inconcevable destin\u00e9e ! Fran\u00e7ais la r\u00e9volution qui vous r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e8re a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 en vous de grandes vertus ; mais craignez, qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait affaibli dans vos \u00e2mes le sentiment de l\u2019humanit\u00e9, sans lequel il ne peut y en avoir que de fausses ! Entendez d\u2019avance l\u2019Histoire, qui redira \u00e0 la renomm\u00e9e : \"Louis \u00e9tait mont\u00e9 sur le tr\u00f4ne \u00e0 vingt ans, et \u00e0 vingt ans il donna l\u2019exemple des m\u0153urs : il n\u2019y porta aucune faiblesse coupable ni aucune passion corruptrice ; il fut \u00e9conome, juste et s\u00e9v\u00e8re ; il s\u2019y montra toujours l\u2019ami constant du peuple. Le peuple d\u00e9sirait la destruction d\u2019un imp\u00f4t d\u00e9sastreux qui pesait sur lui, il le d\u00e9truisit ; le peuple demandait l\u2019abolition de la servitude, il commen\u00e7a par l\u2019abolir lui-m\u00eame dans ses domaines ; le peuple sollicitait des r\u00e9formes dans la l\u00e9gislation criminelle pour l\u2019adoucissement du sort des accus\u00e9s, il fit ces r\u00e9formes ; le peuple voulait que des milliers de Fran\u00e7ais que la rigueur de nos usages avait priv\u00e9s jusqu\u2019alors des droits qui appartient aux citoyens, acquissent ces droits ou les recouvrassent, il les en fit jouir par ses lois. Le peuple voulut la libert\u00e9, il la lui donna ! Il vint m\u00eame au devant de lui par ses sacrifices, et cependant c\u2019est au nom de ce m\u00eame peuple qu\u2019on demande aujourd\u2019hui... Citoyens, je n\u2019ach\u00e8ve pas... JE M\u2019ARR\u00caTE DEVANT L\u2019HISTOIRE : songez qu\u2019elle jugera votre jugement et que le sien sera celui des si\u00e8cles\". En venant \u00e0 la r\u00e9futation des chefs d\u2019accusation, Romain de S\u00e8ze les divisa adroitement : tenant pour nuls ceux qui \u00e9taient ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la Constitution ou qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 amnisti\u00e9s par elle, et ceux qui lui \u00e9taient post\u00e9rieurs mais dont les ministres assumaient l\u00e9galement, la responsabilit\u00e9, il nia l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger et d\u00e9clara Louis XVI irresponsable des tractations men\u00e9es par ses fr\u00e8res avec l\u2019Autriche. Il nia pareillement l\u2019envoi des subsides aux \u00e9migr\u00e9s, l\u2019accusation manquant \u00e0 vrai dire de preuves formelles. Ce fut la partie la moins solide de la d\u00e9fense, ce qui importait d\u2019ailleurs assez peu, les d\u00e9put\u00e9s de la Convention ayant la conviction que Louis XVI avait pactis\u00e9 avec l\u2019ennemi.}}\n--->\n\n==The defense, 26 December 1792==\n\n=== The defense team ===\n\nLouis XVI sought the most illustrious legal minds in France as his defense team. He first asked [[Gui-Jean-Baptiste Target]], former deputy of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] and hero of the [[Parlement]]s of the [[ancien r\u00e9gime]], to lead his defense, but the elderly lawyer refused on account of his age. The task of lead counsel fell to [[Raymond Des\u00e8ze]], who was assisted by [[Fran\u00e7ois Denis Tronchet]] (Target's closest colleague, who came on board reluctantly, only at the King's insistence) and [[Guillaume-Chr\u00e9tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes]] (Louis XVI's former [[Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi|Secretary of State]]).\n\nThough he had only two weeks to prepare his defense arguments. Des\u00e8ze's brilliance so shone through in a first draft that, although it was moving, Louis rejected it as too rhetorical, saying, \"I do not want to play on their (the Convention's) feelings\".\n\nWhen the time came to deliver the defense (26 December 1792), despite having had no sleep for over four days, he pleaded the king's case for three hours, arguing eloquently yet discreetly that the revolution spare his life. Beginning with a description of why the charges were invalid (under the terms of the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]] Louis, as king, was immune from prosecution), he attacked the right of [[National Convention]] to stand as judge and jury. Finally, he moved to a rejection of the charges in the ''acte enonciatif'' drawn up by the constitution charge by charge, with a royalist history of the revolution, portraying Louis as \"the restorer of French Liberty\". He finished, like many of the set-piece speeches of the revolution, with an appeal to history:\n{{quote|Louis ascended the throne at the age of twenty, and at the age of twenty he gave to the throne the example of character. He brought to the throne no wicked weaknesses, no corrupting passions. He was economical, just, severe. He showed himself always the constant friend of the people. The people wanted the abolition of servitude. He began by abolishing it on his own lands. The people asked for reforms in the criminal law... he carried out these reforms. The people wanted liberty: he gave it to them. The people themselves came before him in his sacrifices. Nevertheless, it is in the name of these very people that one today demands... Citizens, I cannot finish... I stop myself before History. Think how it will judge your judgement, and that the judgement of him will be judged by the centuries.}}\n\n=== Declaration of Louis XVI in his defense. ===\n\"You have heard my defense, I would not repeat the details. In talking to you perhaps for the last time, I declare that my conscience reproaches me with nothing, and my defenders have told you the truth. I never feared the public examination of my conduct, but my heart is torn by the imputation that I would want to shed the blood of the people and especially that the misfortunes of August 10th be attributed to me. I avow that the many proofs that I have always acted from my love of the people, and the manner in which I have always conducted myself, seemed to prove that I did not fear to put myself forward in order to spare their blood, and forever prevent such an imputation.\"\n<!---\n{{On vient de vous exposer mes moyens de d\u00e9fense, je ne les renouvellerai point ! En vous parlant peut-\u00eatre pour la derni\u00e8re fois, je vous d\u00e9clare que ma conscience ne me reproche rien, et que mes d\u00e9fenseurs ne vous ont dit que la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\nJe n\u2019ai jamais craint que ma conduite f\u00fbt examin\u00e9e publiquement, mais mon c\u0153ur est d\u00e9chir\u00e9 de trouver dans l\u2019acte d\u2019accusation l\u2019imputation d\u2019avoir voulu r\u00e9pandre le sang du peuple, et surtout que les malheurs du 10 ao\u00fbt me soient attribu\u00e9s.\nJ\u2019avoue que les preuves multipli\u00e9es que j\u2019avais donn\u00e9es dans tous les temps de mon amour pour le peuple, et la mani\u00e8re dont je m\u2019\u00e9tais toujours conduit, me paraissaient devoir prouver que je craignais peu de m\u2019exposer pour \u00e9pargner son sang, et \u00e9loigner \u00e0 jamais de moi une pareille imputation}}m\n--->\n\n==The verdict, 14\u201315 January==\nGiven overwhelming evidence of Louis' collusion with the invaders, the verdict was a foregone conclusion.  Ultimately, 693 deputies voted to convict the former king. Not a single deputy voted \"no,\" though 26 attached some condition to their votes.  Twenty-six deputies were absent from the vote, most on official business. Twenty-three deputies abstained, for various reasons. Several abstained because they felt they had been elected to make laws rather than to judge.\n\n==The punishment, 16\u201317 January==\n\n===The Mailhe amendment===\nFor the king's sentence, deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]] proposed  \"Death, but [...] I think it would be worthy of the Convention to consider whether it would be useful to policy to delay the execution\" which was supported by twenty-six deputies. This \"Mailhe amendment\" was regarded by some of Mailhe's contemporaries as a conspiracy to save the king's life. It was even suggested that Mailhe had been paid, perhaps by Spanish gold.\n\n===The vote===\nParis voted overwhelmingly for death, 21 to 3. Robespierre voted first, and said \"The sentiment that led me to call for the abolition of the death penalty is the same that today forces me to demand that it be applied to the tyrant of my country.\" [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9]], formerly the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and Louis' own cousin, voted for his execution, a cause of much future bitterness among French monarchists.\n\nThere were 721 voters in total. 34 voted for death with attached conditions (23 of whom invoked the Mailhe amendment), 2 voted for life imprisonment in irons, 319 voted for imprisonment until the end of the war (to be followed by banishment). 361 voted for death without conditions, just carrying the vote by a marginal majority. Louis was to be put to death.\n\n===Execution===\n{{main|Execution of Louis XVI}} \nLouis was [[guillotine]]d on 21 January 1793 in the Place de la R\u00e9volution (renamed [[Place de la Concorde]] in 1795).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n* David P.

Following the 1967 elections, Indira Gandhi gradually started moving towards socialist policies. In 1969, she fell out with senior Congress party leaders on a number of issues. Chief among them was the decision by Indira to support [[V. V.

The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

In 1971, on a nationalisation platform, Gandhi proceeded to nationalise the coal, steel, copper, refining, cotton textiles, and insurance industries. Most of these nationalisations were made to protect employment and the interest of the organised labour. The remaining private sector industries were placed under strict regulatory control. During the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], foreign-owned private oil companies had refused to supply fuel to the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force.

Gandhi embarked on a massive redistribution program. The provisions included rapid enforcement of land ceilings, housing for landless labourers, the abolition of bonded labour and a moratorium on the debts of the poor. North India was at the centre of the reforms; millions of acres of land were acquired and redistributed. The government was also successful in procuring houses for landless labourers; according to [[Francine Frankel|Frankel]], three-fourths of the targeted four million houses was achieved in 1975 alone. Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours. Rosser wrote that \"some have even seen the declaration of emergency rule in 1975 as a move to suppress dissent against Gandhi's policy shift to the right\". Regardless of the controversy over the nature of the reforms, the long-term effects of the social changes gave rise to prominence of middle-ranking farmers from intermediate and lower castes in North India.\n\n===Administration & language===\nGandhi played a major role in reorganizing the states and successfully solved the internal rifts of the country. She accepted the demands of the Akali Dal in 1966 and reorganized Punjab on linguistic lines. This led to the formation of the state of Himanchal Pradesh, Chandigarh(U&T) and the Punjab. Victory over Pakistan in 1971 consolidated Indian power in Kashmir. Gandhi indicated that she would make no major concessions on Kashmir. The most prominent of the Kashmiri separatists, [[Sheikh Abdullah]], had to recognize India's control over Kashmir in light of the new order in South Asia. The situation was normalized in the years following the war after Abdullah [[1975 Indira\u2013Sheikh accord|agreed to an accord]] with Gandhi, by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in return for a [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special autonomous status for Kashmir]]. In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}</ref> In 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura, while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and was renamed Arunachal Pradesh, followed by the annexation of [[Sikkim]] in 1975.\n\nIn 1967, Gandhi made a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official languages. This established the official government policy of bilingualism in India and satisfied the non-Hindi speaking Indian states.\n\n===Social reform===\nThe principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women was started in the tenure of Indira Gandhi. Some of the other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs for the community through a rural works program. In 1971, Gandhi motioned to abolish the [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]], a payment made to the ruling (royal or lower) families of erstwhile [[princely states]] as part of their agreements to first integrate with India in 1947 after the independence of India, and later to merge their states in 1949 whereby they lost all ruling rights. Gandhi argued, the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The motion successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]]. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges. Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections. They, however, received a final setback when many of them were defeated by huge margins.\n\n===National security===\n[[File:Research and Analysis Wing.svg|thumb|alt=Secret agency|Seal of the Research and Analysis Wing, established in 1968]]\nFollowing the intelligence failures of the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1968, Gandhi decided to create a specialised, independent agency dedicated to foreign intelligence gathering.

Prior to the inception of the R&AW, overseas intelligence collection was primarily the responsibility of the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB), which was created by the [[British raj]]. Gandhi established the [[National Security Act (India)|National Security Act]] in on 23 September, 1980; a stringent law that allows preventive detention for months, if authorities are satisfied that a person is a threat to national security or law and order.

In 1966, the [[March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising|Mizo uprising]] took place against the government of India and overran almost the whole of the [[Mizoram|Mizoram region]]. Gandhi ordered the [[Indian Army]] to launch massive retaliatory strikes in response. Mizo leaders came to the negotiating table, Gandhi upgraded Mizoram to the status of a union territory. Responding to the insurgency in [[Nagaland]], Gandhi \"unleashed a powerful military offensive\" in the 1970s. The insurgents soon agreed to surrender and signed the [[Shillong Accord of 1975|Shillong Accord]] in 1975.\n\n===Nuclear Program===\n{{Main|Smiling Buddha}}\nGandhi promoted the views of Nehru to establish India\u2019s stability and security interests as independent from those of the [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear superpowers]]. In 1974, unofficially code named as [[Smiling Buddha]], India successfully conducted an underground [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear test]] in the desert village of [[Pokhran]] in Rajasthan. \nWith the Smiling Buddha, India became the world's sixth nuclear power after the United States, Soviet Union, [[Britain]], [[France]] and China to successfully test out a nuclear bomb.<ref name=\"success\">{{cite news |last1=Smiling Buddha |first1=Success |title=Success of Smiling Buddha |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/how-smiling-buddha-caught-us-off-guard-in-1974/us-was-more-focused-on-vietnam/slideshow/58276902.cms |accessdate=11 April 2020 |work=Economic Times |agency=The Times Group |date=20 April 2017}}</ref> The test became the center of attention as there was widespread outrage and concern over the move since this nuclear bomb was tested by the country, which was outside the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], and the experiments took place without any warning to the international community.<ref name=\"Buddha\">{{cite news |last1=Pokhran I |first1='Smiling Buddha' |title=Pokhran I: India's first nuclear bomb test was carried out underground and code named 'Smiling Buddha' |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/pokharan-i-first-nuclear-atomic-bomb-test-of-india-324141-2016-05-18 |accessdate=11 April 2020 |work=India Today |agency=Living Media India Limited |date=18 May 2016}}</ref> As a result, the US took offense to India barging into the nuclear society without any warning and then, blocked aid to India and imposed numerous sanctions.

Gandhi herself was elected to Lok Sabha from the [[Raebareli (Lok Sabha constituency)|Raebareli constituency]]. Indira Gandhi had started on a rocky note after agreeing to a [[devaluation]] of the [[Indian rupee|rupee]], which created much hardship for Indian businesses and consumers, and the import of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.<ref name=\"Kapila1\"/>\n\nThe party also for the first time lost power or lost majority in a number of states across the country. Following the 1967 elections, Indira Gandhi gradually started moving towards socialist policies. In 1969, she fell out with senior Congress party leaders on a number of issues. Chief among them was the decision by Indira to support [[V. V. Giri]], the independent candidate rather than the official Congress party candidate [[Neelam Sanjiva Reddy]] for the vacant position of [[President of India]]. The other was the announcement by the prime minister of Bank nationalization without consulting the finance minister, Morarji Desai. These steps culminated in Party president [[S. Nijalingappa]] expelling her from the party for indiscipline.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/march-to-socialism-under-prime-minister-indira-gandhi-offers-an-interesting-parallel/articleshow/9715049.cms|title=March to socialism under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi offers an interesting parallel|date=24 August 2011|work=The Economic Times|access-date=19 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/1969-congress-splits/1/155566.html|title=1969: S.

The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted.

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969.

In 1971, on a nationalisation platform, Gandhi proceeded to nationalise the coal, steel, copper, refining, cotton textiles, and insurance industries. Most of these nationalisations were made to protect employment and the interest of the organised labour. The remaining private sector industries were placed under strict regulatory control. During the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], foreign-owned private oil companies had refused to supply fuel to the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force. In response, Gandhi nationalised oil companies in 1973.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=4 July 2015|title=Energy Geopolitics \u2013 An Overview|url=http://greatgameindia.com/energy-geopolitics-an-overview/|journal=GreatGameIndia Magazine|issue=July\u2013Sept 2015 issue|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> After nationalisation the oil majors such as the [[Indian Oil Corporation]] (IOC), the [[Hindustan Petroleum|Hindustan Petroleum Corporation]] (HPCL) and the [[Bharat Petroleum|Bharat Petroleum Corporation]] (BPCL) it became mandatory for these companies to maintain minimum stock level of oil for the need of the military when needed.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ved |last=Luthra|title=Poverty And Economic Reforms|location=New Delhi|publisher=Sarup & Sons|year=2005|page=293|isbn=978-8178901367}}</ref>\n\nGandhi claimed that only \"clear vision, iron will and the strictest discipline\" can remove poverty. Gandhi embarked on a massive redistribution program. The provisions included rapid enforcement of land ceilings, housing for landless labourers, the abolition of bonded labour and a moratorium on the debts of the poor. North India was at the centre of the reforms; millions of acres of land were acquired and redistributed. The government was also successful in procuring houses for landless labourers; according to [[Francine Frankel|Frankel]], three-fourths of the targeted four million houses was achieved in 1975 alone. Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours. Rosser wrote that \"some have even seen the declaration of emergency rule in 1975 as a move to suppress dissent against Gandhi's policy shift to the right\". Regardless of the controversy over the nature of the reforms, the long-term effects of the social changes gave rise to prominence of middle-ranking farmers from intermediate and lower castes in North India.\n\n===Administration & language===\nGandhi played a major role in reorganizing the states and successfully solved the internal rifts of the country. She accepted the demands of the Akali Dal in 1966 and reorganized Punjab on linguistic lines. This led to the formation of the state of Himanchal Pradesh, Chandigarh(U&T) and the Punjab. Victory over Pakistan in 1971 consolidated Indian power in Kashmir. Gandhi indicated that she would make no major concessions on Kashmir. The most prominent of the Kashmiri separatists, [[Sheikh Abdullah]], had to recognize India's control over Kashmir in light of the new order in South Asia. The situation was normalized in the years following the war after Abdullah [[1975 Indira\u2013Sheikh accord|agreed to an accord]] with Gandhi, by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in return for a [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special autonomous status for Kashmir]]. In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}</ref> In 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura, while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and was renamed Arunachal Pradesh, followed by the annexation of [[Sikkim]] in 1975.\n\nIn 1967, Gandhi made a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official languages. This established the official government policy of bilingualism in India and satisfied the non-Hindi speaking Indian states.\n\n===Social reform===\nThe principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women was started in the tenure of Indira Gandhi. Some of the other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs for the community through a rural works program. In 1971, Gandhi motioned to abolish the [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]], a payment made to the ruling (royal or lower) families of erstwhile [[princely states]] as part of their agreements to first integrate with India in 1947 after the independence of India, and later to merge their states in 1949 whereby they lost all ruling rights. Gandhi argued, the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The motion successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]]. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges. Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections. They, however, received a final setback when many of them were defeated by huge margins.\n\n===National security===\n[[File:Research and Analysis Wing.svg|thumb|alt=Secret agency|Seal of the Research and Analysis Wing, established in 1968]]\nFollowing the intelligence failures of the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1968, Gandhi decided to create a specialised, independent agency dedicated to foreign intelligence gathering.

In 1966, the [[March 1966 Mizo National Front uprising|Mizo uprising]] took place against the government of India and overran almost the whole of the [[Mizoram|Mizoram region]]. Gandhi ordered the [[Indian Army]] to launch massive retaliatory strikes in response. Mizo leaders came to the negotiating table, Gandhi upgraded Mizoram to the status of a union territory. Responding to the insurgency in [[Nagaland]], Gandhi \"unleashed a powerful military offensive\" in the 1970s.

Several books on Gandhi mention her interest in [[Joan of Arc]]. In her own accounts through her letters, she wrote to her friend Dorothy Norman, in 1952 she wrote: \"At about eight or nine I was taken to France; Jeanne d'Arc became a great heroine of mine.

Gandhi did not see the purpose of feminism. Gandhi saw her own success as a woman, and also noted that \"Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once.\"<ref name=\"Norman, Dorothy 1985\"/>\n\nGandhi felt guilty about her inability to fully devote her time to her children. She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 127.</ref> At another point, she went into more detail: \"To a woman, motherhood is the highest fulfilment...To bring a new being into this world, to see its perfection and to dream of its future greatness is the most moving of all experiences and fills one with wonder and exaltation.\"<ref>Malhotra, Inder.

Gandhi did not make a special effort to appoint women to cabinet positions. She did not appoint any women to full cabinet rank during her terms in office.<ref name=\"Genovese, Michael A. 1993\"/> Yet despite this, many women saw Gandhi as a symbol for feminism and an image of women's power.<ref name=\"Genovese, Michael A. 1993\"/>\n\n==Legacy== \n\nAfter leading India to victory against Pakistan in the [[Bangladesh liberation war]] in 1971, President [[V.

He is the manager of [[Ascoli Calcio 1898 F.C.|Ascoli]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nSon of former footballer [[Gaetano Stellone]], Roberto Stellone starter his career at hometown club [[A.S. Lodigiani|Lodigiani]], where he met [[David Di Michele]], his team-mate at Reggina and Torino. After 4 seasons in [[Serie C1]], he left for [[A.S. Lucchese Libertas 1905|Lucchese]] of [[Serie B]] in mid-1997. In the summer of 1998, he left for [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], but he had limited opportunities at the club and left for fellow Serie B side [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] on loan, in January 1999. He made a name for himself throughout the remainder of the season, as he scored 6 goals in 19 league matches, helping the team to win Serie A promotion, and receiving a call-up to the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy U21 team]].\n\n===Napoli===\nIn the summer of 1999, he left for Serie B side [[S.S.C. Napoli]] in a [[Co-ownership (football)|co-ownership]] deal. He added 10 more goals to his Serie B tally, which also helped Napoli win Serie A promotion, after finishing the [[1999\u20132000 Serie B|season]] in 4th place. At the end of the season, Napoli bought Stellone's remaining registration rights, keeping him at the club. However, despite scoring on his [[Serie A]] debut the [[2000\u201301 Serie A|following season]], in a 2\u20131 home defeat to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on 30 September 2000, Stellone's league appearances in his first Serie A season were limited to just 3 due to injury,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2001/luglio/31/Stellone_riprende_Napoli_ga_0_010731383.shtml|title=Stellone si riprende il Napoli|date=31 July 2001|accessdate=19 December 2009|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian}}</ref> and as a result, Napoli were unable to avoid relegation. Stellone remained with Napoli in Serie B for the [[2001\u201302 Serie B|2001\u201302]] and [[2002\u201303 Serie B|2002\u201303]] seasons, scoring 19 goals in 51 matches, but missing out on several matches once again due to injury, however;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2002/marzo/27/Stellone_arrende_sara_operato_ga_0_0203275389.shtml|title=Stellone s' arrende: sar\u00e0 operato|date=27 March 2002|accessdate=19 December 2009|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian}}</ref> in the summer of 2002, he was named the club's new [[Captain (association football)|captain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttonapoli.net/notizie/stellone-a-il-nuovo-capitano-del-napoli-290|title=Stellone \u00e8 il nuovo capitano del Napoli|publisher=tuttonapoli.net|language=Italian|date=20 July 2002|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref> Facing financial difficulties, Napoli loaned Stellone to Serie A side [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]] during the [[2003\u201304 Serie A|2003\u201304]] season. Due to the presence of strikers [[David Di Michele]] and [[Emiliano Bonazzoli]], Stellone struggled to find space in the team, and scored only once in 16 league appearances.\n\nThe next season, he left for Serie B side [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], where he partnered with [[Diego Milito]] and [[Stephen Makinwa]] up-front, and scored over 70% of team's total goals. Although the team won the Serie B championship, the club was later penalised and awarded last place due to their involvement in the [[Caso Genoa]], and as a result suffered relegation to [[Serie C]].\n\n===Torino===\nStellone was signed by Serie B runner-up [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] in [[Co-ownership (football)|co-ownership]] deal in August 2005, who were forced to remain at Serie B due to financial difficulty. Now partnered with [[Enrico Fantini]] and [[Roberto Muzzi]] in attack, Stellone failed to replicate his prolific performances at Geona, scoring 7 goals in 31 appearances, but Torino still bought him outright, outbidding Genoa. Despite Stellone's struggle to find the back of the net consistently, Torino still managed to obtain Serie A promotion [[2005\u201306 Serie B|that season]]. With Torino in [[2006\u201307 Serie A|Serie A the following season]], he alternated playing as a starter and as a substitute for the club. Although Stellone and the club's other strikers failed to score, with help of [[Alessandro Rosina]] and a strong defensive line, the team still managed to avoid Serie B relegation. The [[2007\u201308 Serie A|next season]], with the signings of [[David Di Michele]], [[Nicola Ventola]] and [[\u00c1lvaro Recoba]], Stellone only made 18 starts, scoring just 4 goals. In his [[Serie A 2008\u201309|last season]] with the club, the 31-year-old forward faced competition from [[Rolando Bianchi]] and [[Nicola Amoruso]]; following the team's change of formation, which only used one striker, usually Bianchi, Stellone made half of his appearances as substitute. With the departure of Alessandro Rosina in January 2009, the team struggled to score, and ultimately failed to stay in Serie A on the final match-day of the season.\n\n===Frosinone===\nAfter the relegation of Torino in 2009, he became [[free agent]] in June. After months without a club, he signed a 3-year contract with Serie B club [[Frosinone Calcio|Frosinone]] in November 2009 where he was coached by [[Francesco Moriero]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.frosinonecalcio.com/news.php?id=2451|title=COLPO FROSINONE, PRESO STELLONE|date=12 November 2009|accessdate=19 December 2009|publisher=Frosinone Calcio|language=Italian}}</ref> In the 2009\u201310 season his goals contributed to helping the team avoid relegation; following the club's relegation to [[Lega Pro]] the following year, on 28 June 2011, he announced his retirement from football.\n\n==Style of play==\nA complete striker, Stellone could act either as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|main striker]] or as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]], due to his vision, ability to score goals, hold up the ball in tight spaces, and create chances for team-mates. Despite his height and imposing physique, which enabled him excel in the air, he was also known for his dynamism and technique; indeed, his main qualities a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] were his [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] and heading ability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spazionapoli.it/2014/06/23/profili-azzurri-roberto-stellone/|title=Profili azzurri: Roberto Stellone|publisher=Spazio Napoli|language=Italian|date=23 June 2014|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Managerial career ==\nAfter his retirement, he stayed at Frosinone as a youth coach in charge of the under-19 team (''Berretti'') for the 2011\u201312 season. Under his tenure, the team won the national ''Berretti'' title.\n\n===Frosinone===\nThanks also to his impressive results with the youth team, Stellone was appointed as [[Frosinone Calcio|Frosinone]] head coach role for the season 2012\u201313 in [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione]]. In his first season in charge, Stellone guided the team to seventh place and was confirmed for one more year.\n\nIn the [[2013\u201314 Lega Pro Prima Divisione]], Stellone's Frosinone immediately emerged as one of the promotion favourites, losing direct promotion only on the last matchday to [[A.C. Perugia Calcio|Perugia]]. In the subsequent playoff tournament, however, Frosinone managed to achieve the ultimate goal of getting back into [[Serie B]], defeating Salernitana in the first round, [[A.C. Pisa 1909|Pisa]] in the semi-finals and, most notably, a [[Fabrizio Miccoli]]-led [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] in a two-legged final after extra time.\n\nOn 16 May 2015, he led Frosinone to second place in Serie B and direct promotion to [[Serie A]] with a game to spare, with victory against [[F.C.

He is the manager of [[Ascoli Calcio 1898 F.C.|Ascoli]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nSon of former footballer [[Gaetano Stellone]], Roberto Stellone starter his career at hometown club [[A.S. Lodigiani|Lodigiani]], where he met [[David Di Michele]], his team-mate at Reggina and Torino. After 4 seasons in [[Serie C1]], he left for [[A.S. Lucchese Libertas 1905|Lucchese]] of [[Serie B]] in mid-1997. In the summer of 1998, he left for [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], but he had limited opportunities at the club and left for fellow Serie B side [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] on loan, in January 1999. He made a name for himself throughout the remainder of the season, as he scored 6 goals in 19 league matches, helping the team to win Serie A promotion, and receiving a call-up to the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy U21 team]].\n\n===Napoli===\nIn the summer of 1999, he left for Serie B side [[S.S.C. Napoli]] in a [[Co-ownership (football)|co-ownership]] deal. He added 10 more goals to his Serie B tally, which also helped Napoli win Serie A promotion, after finishing the [[1999\u20132000 Serie B|season]] in 4th place. At the end of the season, Napoli bought Stellone's remaining registration rights, keeping him at the club. However, despite scoring on his [[Serie A]] debut the [[2000\u201301 Serie A|following season]], in a 2\u20131 home defeat to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on 30 September 2000, Stellone's league appearances in his first Serie A season were limited to just 3 due to injury,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2001/luglio/31/Stellone_riprende_Napoli_ga_0_010731383.shtml|title=Stellone si riprende il Napoli|date=31 July 2001|accessdate=19 December 2009|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian}}</ref> and as a result, Napoli were unable to avoid relegation. Stellone remained with Napoli in Serie B for the [[2001\u201302 Serie B|2001\u201302]] and [[2002\u201303 Serie B|2002\u201303]] seasons, scoring 19 goals in 51 matches, but missing out on several matches once again due to injury, however;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2002/marzo/27/Stellone_arrende_sara_operato_ga_0_0203275389.shtml|title=Stellone s' arrende: sar\u00e0 operato|date=27 March 2002|accessdate=19 December 2009|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian}}</ref> in the summer of 2002, he was named the club's new [[Captain (association football)|captain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttonapoli.net/notizie/stellone-a-il-nuovo-capitano-del-napoli-290|title=Stellone \u00e8 il nuovo capitano del Napoli|publisher=tuttonapoli.net|language=Italian|date=20 July 2002|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref> Facing financial difficulties, Napoli loaned Stellone to Serie A side [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]] during the [[2003\u201304 Serie A|2003\u201304]] season. Due to the presence of strikers [[David Di Michele]] and [[Emiliano Bonazzoli]], Stellone struggled to find space in the team, and scored only once in 16 league appearances.\n\nThe next season, he left for Serie B side [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], where he partnered with [[Diego Milito]] and [[Stephen Makinwa]] up-front, and scored over 70% of team's total goals. Although the team won the Serie B championship, the club was later penalised and awarded last place due to their involvement in the [[Caso Genoa]], and as a result suffered relegation to [[Serie C]].\n\n===Torino===\nStellone was signed by Serie B runner-up [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] in [[Co-ownership (football)|co-ownership]] deal in August 2005, who were forced to remain at Serie B due to financial difficulty. Now partnered with [[Enrico Fantini]] and [[Roberto Muzzi]] in attack, Stellone failed to replicate his prolific performances at Geona, scoring 7 goals in 31 appearances, but Torino still bought him outright, outbidding Genoa. Despite Stellone's struggle to find the back of the net consistently, Torino still managed to obtain Serie A promotion [[2005\u201306 Serie B|that season]]. With Torino in [[2006\u201307 Serie A|Serie A the following season]], he alternated playing as a starter and as a substitute for the club. Although Stellone and the club's other strikers failed to score, with help of [[Alessandro Rosina]] and a strong defensive line, the team still managed to avoid Serie B relegation. The [[2007\u201308 Serie A|next season]], with the signings of [[David Di Michele]], [[Nicola Ventola]] and [[\u00c1lvaro Recoba]], Stellone only made 18 starts, scoring just 4 goals. In his [[Serie A 2008\u201309|last season]] with the club, the 31-year-old forward faced competition from [[Rolando Bianchi]] and [[Nicola Amoruso]]; following the team's change of formation, which only used one striker, usually Bianchi, Stellone made half of his appearances as substitute. With the departure of Alessandro Rosina in January 2009, the team struggled to score, and ultimately failed to stay in Serie A on the final match-day of the season.\n\n===Frosinone===\nAfter the relegation of Torino in 2009, he became [[free agent]] in June. After months without a club, he signed a 3-year contract with Serie B club [[Frosinone Calcio|Frosinone]] in November 2009 where he was coached by [[Francesco Moriero]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.frosinonecalcio.com/news.php?id=2451|title=COLPO FROSINONE, PRESO STELLONE|date=12 November 2009|accessdate=19 December 2009|publisher=Frosinone Calcio|language=Italian}}</ref> In the 2009\u201310 season his goals contributed to helping the team avoid relegation; following the club's relegation to [[Lega Pro]] the following year, on 28 June 2011, he announced his retirement from football.\n\n==Style of play==\nA complete striker, Stellone could act either as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|main striker]] or as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]], due to his vision, ability to score goals, hold up the ball in tight spaces, and create chances for team-mates. Despite his height and imposing physique, which enabled him excel in the air, he was also known for his dynamism and technique; indeed, his main qualities a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] were his [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] and heading ability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spazionapoli.it/2014/06/23/profili-azzurri-roberto-stellone/|title=Profili azzurri: Roberto Stellone|publisher=Spazio Napoli|language=Italian|date=23 June 2014|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Managerial career ==\nAfter his retirement, he stayed at Frosinone as a youth coach in charge of the under-19 team (''Berretti'') for the 2011\u201312 season. Under his tenure, the team won the national ''Berretti'' title.\n\n===Frosinone===\nThanks also to his impressive results with the youth team, Stellone was appointed as [[Frosinone Calcio|Frosinone]] head coach role for the season 2012\u201313 in [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione]]. In his first season in charge, Stellone guided the team to seventh place and was confirmed for one more year.\n\nIn the [[2013\u201314 Lega Pro Prima Divisione]], Stellone's Frosinone immediately emerged as one of the promotion favourites, losing direct promotion only on the last matchday to [[A.C. Perugia Calcio|Perugia]]. In the subsequent playoff tournament, however, Frosinone managed to achieve the ultimate goal of getting back into [[Serie B]], defeating Salernitana in the first round, [[A.C. Pisa 1909|Pisa]] in the semi-finals and, most notably, a [[Fabrizio Miccoli]]-led [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] in a two-legged final after extra time.\n\nOn 16 May 2015 he led Frosinone to second place in Serie B and direct promotion to [[Serie A]] with a game to spare, with victory against [[F.C.
