He is remembered for his travels in the [[Far East]] and [[Central Asia]]; especially the [[British expedition to Tibet|1904 British expedition]] to [[Tibet]], led by him, and for his writings on Asia and foreign policy. Younghusband held positions including British commissioner to Tibet and President of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].\n\n== Early life ==\nFrancis Younghusband was born in 1863 at [[Murree]], [[British India]] (now Pakistan), to a British military family, being the brother of Major-General [[George Younghusband]] and the second son of Major-General John W. Younghusband<ref name=\"IndianBio\" /> and his wife Clara Jane Shaw. Clara's brother, [[Robert Barkley Shaw|Robert Shaw]], was a noted explorer of [[Central Asia]]. His uncle Lieutenant-General [[Charles Younghusband]] CB FRS, was a British Army officer and meteorologist.\n\nAs an infant, Francis was taken to live in England by his mother. When Clara returned to India in 1867 she left her son in the care of two austere and strictly religious aunts. In 1870 his mother and father returned to England and reunited the family. In 1876 at age thirteen, Francis entered [[Clifton College]], [[Bristol]]. In 1881 he entered the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and was commissioned as a [[Subaltern (rank)|subaltern]] in the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards]] in 1882.<ref name=\"IndianBio\" />\n\n== Military career ==\n[[File:Long White Mountain - p235 - Interior of an inn.png|thumb|left|A one-room inn in a then-wild area east of [[Tonghua]], [[Jilin Province|Jilin]], where Younghusband and his companions stayed in 1887<ref>{{harvnb|James|1887|pp=235\u2013238}}</ref>]]\n\nHaving read [[Charles MacGregor|General MacGregor]]'s book ''Defence of India'' he could have justifiably called himself an expert on the \"[[The Great Game|Great Game]]\" of espionage that was unfolding on the Steppes of Asia.<ref>General Sir C MacGregor, The Defence of India, (Simla, 1884)</ref>  In 1886-1887, on leave from his regiment, Younghusband made an expedition across Asia though still a young officer.  Sailing to China his party set out with Colonel Mark Bell's permission to cross 1200 miles of desert with the ostensible authority to survey the geography; but in reality the purposes were to ascertain the strength of the Russian physical threats to the Raj.  Departing Peking with a senior colleague, [[H. E. M. James|Henry E. M. James]] (on leave from his [[Indian Civil Service]] position) and a young British consular officer from [[Newchwang]], [[Harry English Fulford]], on April 4, 1887, Lieut Younghusband explored [[Manchuria]], visiting the frontier areas of [[Chuang Guandong|Chinese settlement]] in the region of the [[Changbai Mountains]].<ref name=yh1896/><ref>{{citation|first=Sir Henry Evan Murchison |last=James|authorlink=Evan James (civil servant) | publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co. |year=1888|title=The Long White Mountain, or, A journey in Manchuria: with some account of the history, people, administration and religion of that country|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4bICAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\nOn arrival in India he was granted three months leave by the C-in-C [[Field Marshal Lord Roberts]]; the scientific results of this travel would prove vital information to the [[Royal Geographical Society|RGS]].  Younghusband had already carried out numerous scientific observation (in particular, showing that the [[Changbai Mountains]]'s highest peak, [[Baekdu Mountain]] is only around 8,000 feet tall, even though the British maps the travelers had showed [nonexistent] snow-capped peaks 10,000-12,000&nbsp;ft tall in the area<ref>{{harvnb|pp=254,262}})</ref>), while Fulford was providing the travelers with a language and cultural expertise.<ref>{{harvnb|pp=125,217}})</ref> Younghusband crossed the most inhospitable terrain in the world to the Himalayas before being ordered to make his way home.  Parting with his British companions, Younghusband then crossed the [[Taklamakan Desert]] to the [[Chinese Turkestan]], and pioneered a route from [[Kashgar]] to [[India]] through the uncharted [[Mustagh Pass]].<ref name=yh1896>Younghusband, Francis E.

In the 1880s the region of the Upper Oxus was still largely unmapped.  For this achievement, aged still only 24 he was elected the youngest member of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and received the society's 1890 [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]].\n\n[[Image:Younghusband PekingToYarkand Map.jpg|thumb|450px|right|\"From Peking To Yarkand and Kashmir via the Mustagh Pass\"]]\nIn 1889,  he made captain, and was dispatched with a small escort of [[Gurkha]] soldiers to investigate an uncharted region north of [[Ladakh]], where raiders from [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] had disrupted trade between [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] and India the previous year.<ref>''The Heart of a Continent'', pp. 186ff</ref>  Whilst encamped in the valley of the [[Yarkand River]], Younghusband received a messenger at his camp, inviting him to dinner with Captain [[Bronislav Grombchevsky]], his Russian counterpart in \"The Great Game\". Younghusband accepted the invitation to Grombchevsky's camp, and after dinner the two rivals talked into the night, sharing brandy and vodka, and discussing the possibility of a Russian invasion of British India. Grombchevsky impressed Younghusband with the horsemanship skills of his [[Cossack]] escort, and Younghusband impressed Grombchevsky with the rifle drill of his Gurkhas.<ref>''The Heart of a Continent'', pp. 234ff</ref> After their meeting in this remote frontier region, Grombchevsky resumed his expedition in the direction of [[Tibet]] and Younghusband continued his exploration of the [[Karakoram]].\n\nYounghusband received a telegram from Simla, to attend the Intelligence Department (ID) to be interviewed by Foreign Secretary, [[Sir Mortimer Durand]] transferred to the [[Indian Political Service]].  He served as a political officer on secondment from the British Army.  He refused a request to visit Lhasa as an interpreter, disguised as a Yarkandi trader, a cover not guaranteed to fool the Russians, after Scots merchant, [[Andrew Dalgleish]] had been brutally hacked to death.  Younghusband was accompanied by a Gurkha escort, celebrated for their ferocity in combat.  The Forward policy was circumscribed by a legal offer to all travellers of a peaceable security crossing borders.  Departure from [[Leh]] on 8 August 1889 on the caravan route took them up the mountain pass of [[Shimshal]] towards Hunza; his aim being to restore the tea trade to Xinjiang and prevent any further raids into Kashmir.  Colonel Durand from [[Gilgit]] joined him.  Younghusband probed the villages to gauge the reception: calculating it was a den of thieves, they ascended the steep ravine.  The Hunza was barred to them, a trap was sprung; the parley terms took him inside to negotiate.  The nervous reception over, they were all relieved to find safety; Younghusband wanted to know why and who was way-laying innocent civilian traders?  The ruler, [[Safdar Ali]] extended a letter of welcome to his Kashmiri kingdom; the British investigated from whence came the Russian infiltrators under Agent Gromchevsky. Further south at [[Ladakh]], he kept close watch on their movements. Reluctantly, Younghusband dined with the Cossack leaders who divulged the secrets of their common rivalry. Gromchevsky explained that the Raj had invited enmity for meddling in the Black Sea ports. The Russian displayed little grasp of strategy, but basic raw courage; he betrayed the confidence of [[Abdul Rahman]] as no friend to the British. Younghusband tentatively concluded that their possessions at Bokhara and Samarkand were vulnerable. Having drunk large quantities of vodka and brandy, the Cossacks presented arms in cordial salute and they parted in peace. Woefully unprepared for winter, the British garrison at Ladakh refused them entry.\n\nYounghusband finally arrived at [[Gulmit]] to a 13-gun salute. In khaki, the envoy greeted [[Safdar Ali]] at the marquee on the Karakoram Highway, the men of Hunza kneeling at their ruler's feet. This was colonial diplomacy, based on protocol and etiquette, but Younghusband had not come for merely trivial discussions. Reinforced by Durand's troops, Younghusband's arguments were to prevent the criminal looting, murder and highway robbery. Impervious to reason though he was, Younghusband was not prepared to allow Safdar Ali to laugh at the Raj. A demonstration of firepower \"caused quite a sensation\" he wrote in his diaries. The British major was disdainful, but content when he left on November 23, to return to India, which he reached by Christmas.\n\nIn 1890, Younghusband was sent on a mission to [[Chinese Turkestan]], accompanied by [[George Macartney (British consul)|George Macartney]] as interpreter. He spent the winter in [[Kashgar]], where he left Macartney as British consul.<ref>Dictionary of National Biography ''Sir George Macartney''</ref> Younghusband wanted to investigate the Pamir Gap, a possible Russian entry route to India. But he had had to ensure the Chinese at Kashgar were sorted out to prevent a tripartite attempt by the Hunza clans. It was for this reason he recruited a Mandarin-interpreter, junior officer, George Macartney to accompany his missions into the frozen mountains. They wintered in Kashgar, as a listening post: meeting in conference with the Russian [[Nikolai Petrovsky]], who had always resisted trade with Xinjiang ([[Sinkiang]]). The Russian agent was well-informed about British India, but proved unscrupulous. Believing he had succeeded, Younghusband did not reckon on Petrovsky's deal with the ''[[Taotai]],'' the Chinese governor of Hunza.\n\nIn July 1891, they were still in the Pamirs when news reached them the Russians intended to send troops \"to note and report with the Chinese and Afghans\". At [[Bozai Gumbaz]] in the [[Little Pamir]] on 12 August he encountered Cossack soldiers, who forced him to leave the area.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Riddick | first = John | title = The history of British India | year = 2006 | page=82 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Es6x4u_g19UC&lpg=PP1&dq=Riddick&pg=PA82#v=onepage&q | isbn = 978-0-313-32280-8}}</ref> This was one of the incidents which provoked the [[Hunza-Nagar Campaign]]. The troop of 20 or so soldiers planted a flag on what they anticipated was unclaimed territory, 150 miles south of the Russian border. But to the British the area was Afghan territory. Colonel [[:ru:\u0418\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0415\u0444\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|Yonov]], decorated with the [[Order of St George]], approached his camp to announce that the area now belonged to the Tsar. Younghusband learnt that they had raided the [[Chitral]] territory; furthermore they had penetrated the [[Darkot Pass]] into the [[Yasin Valley]]. They were joined by eager intelligence officer Lieutenant Davison; but the British were disabused by Ivanov of British sovereignty: Younghusband remained polite, maintained protocol but hospitable to the big Russian bear hug.\n\nDuring his service in Kashmir, he wrote a book called '''Kashmir''' at the request of [[Edward Molyneux]]. Younghusband's descriptions went hand in glove with Molyneux's paintings of the valley. In the book, Younghusband declared his immense admiration of the natural beauty of Kashmir and its history. The Great Game, between Britain and Russia, continued beyond the start of the 20th century until officially ended by the 1907 Anglo-Russian Treaty. Younghusband, among other explorers such as [[Sven Hedin]], [[Nikolay Przhevalsky]], [[Shoqan Walikhanov]] and [[Aurel Stein|Sir Auriel Stein]], had participated in earnest.<ref name=\"Nalle\">{{cite journal|author=David Nalle |date=June 2000 |title=Book Review&nbsp;\u2013 Tournament of Shadows: The Great Game and the Race for Empire in Central Asia |journal=[[Middle East Policy]] |volume= VII |issue=3 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Washington DC |issn=1061-1924 |url=http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol7/0006_nalle.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601233205/http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol7/0006_nalle.asp |archivedate=1 June 2006 }}</ref> Rumours of Russian expansion into the [[Hindu Kush]] with a Russian presence in Tibet prompted the new [[Viceroy of India]] [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] to appoint Younghusband, by then a major, British commissioner to Tibet from 1902-1904.\n\n=== Invasion of Tibet and massacre at Guru ===\nIn 1903, Curzon appointed Younghusband head of the [[Tibet Frontier Commission]] with [[John Claude White]], political officer of [[Sikkim]], and [[E.

The incident, portrayed by Chinese sources as a \"massacre\", embarrassed the British Government, which desired good relations with China for the sake of the coastal Chinese trade. Accordingly, the British repudiated the treaty known as the [[Treaty of Lhasa]] that Younghusband's services had obtained.\n\nIn 1891, Younghusband received the Companion of the [[Order of the Indian Empire]], which was upgraded to Knight Commander in 1904;<ref name=\"IndianBio\">{{cite book|title=The Indian Biographical Dictionary|editor=C.

In 1908, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. During the [[World War I|First World War]], his patriotic [[Fight for Right]] campaign commissioned the song [[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]].\n\n== Himalaya and mountaineering ==\nYounghusband was elected President of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1919, and two years later became Chairman of the [[Mount Everest Committee]] which was set up to coordinate the initial [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition]] to [[Mount Everest]].<ref>[http://www.mountain-portal.co.uk/text/everest/Evrst02.htm Text of ''The Epic of Mount Everest'', Sir Francis Younghusband.]</ref> He actively encouraged the accomplished climber [[George Mallory]] to attempt the first ascent of Mount Everest, and they followed the same initial route as the earlier Tibet Mission. Younghusband remained Chairman through the subsequent [[1922 British Mount Everest expedition|1922]] and [[1924 British Mount Everest expedition|1924]] British Expeditions.\n\nIn 1938 Younghusband encouraged [[Ernst Sch\u00e4fer]], who was about to lead a German expedition to \"sneak over the border\" when faced with British intransigence towards Sch\u00e4fer's efforts to reach Tibet.<ref>Hale, Christopher.

Geographical Review 32(4):681</ref> He was buried in the village churchyard.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n== Spiritual life ==\nBiographer [[Patrick French]] described Younghusband's religious belief as one who was\n<blockquote>brought up an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christian, read his way into [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoyan]] simplicity, experienced a revelatory vision in the mountains of Tibet, toyed with [[telepathy]] in [[Kashmir]], proposed a new faith based on virile [[racial theory]], then transformed it into what [[Bertrand Russell]] called 'a religion of [[atheism]].'<ref>French, p.313.</ref></blockquote> Ultimately he became a spiritualist and \"premature hippie\" who \"had great faith in the power of [[cosmic ray]]s, and claimed that there are extraterrestrials with translucent flesh on the planet [[Altair]].\"<ref>French, p. xx</ref>\n\nDuring his 1904 retreat from Tibet, Younghusband had a mystical experience which suffused him with \"love for the whole world\" and convinced him that \"men at heart are divine.\"<ref>quoted in French, p.252.</ref> This conviction was tinged with regret for the invasion of Tibet, and eventually, in 1936, profound religious convictions invited a founder's address to the [[World Congress of Faiths]] (in imitation of the [[World Parliament of Religions]]). Younghusband published a number of books with what one might call [[New Age]] themes, with titles like ''The Gleam: Being an account of the life of Nija Svabhava, pseud.'' (1923); ''Mother World (in Travail for the Christ that is to be)'' (1924); and ''Life in the Stars: An Exposition of the View that on some Planets of some Stars exist Beings higher than Ourselves, and on one a World-Leader, the Supreme Embodiment of the Eternal Spirit which animates the Whole'' (1927). The last drew the admiration of Lord [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]], the Boy Scouts founder.<ref>French, p. 321</ref> Key concepts consisted of the central belief that would come to be known as the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[pantheism]], and a Christlike \"world leader\" living on the planet \"Altair\" (or \"Stellair\"), exploring the theology of spiritualism, and guidance by means of telepathy.\n\nYounghusband allegedly believed in [[free love]] (\"freedom to unite when and how a man and a woman please\"), marriage laws examined as a matter of \"outdated custom.\"<ref>French, p. 283</ref> One of Younghusband's domestic servants, [[Gladys Aylward]], became a Christian missionary in China.\n\n=== Fictional portrayal ===\nThe [[Ingrid Bergman]] film ''[[The Inn of the Sixth Happiness]]'' (1958) is based on Gladys Aylward's life, with [[Ronald Squire]] portraying Younghusband.<ref>French., p. 364</ref>\n\n== Works ==\nYounghusband wrote 26 books in all between 1885 and 1942.

He is remembered for his travels in the [[Far East]] and [[Central Asia]]; especially the [[British expedition to Tibet|1904 British expedition]] to [[Tibet]], led by himself, and for his writings on Asia and foreign policy. Younghusband held positions including British commissioner to Tibet and President of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].\n\n== Early life ==\nFrancis Younghusband was born in 1863 at [[Murree]], [[British India]] (now Pakistan), to a British military family, being the brother of Major-General [[George Younghusband]] and the second son of Major-General John W. Younghusband<ref name=\"IndianBio\" /> and his wife Clara Jane Shaw. Clara's brother, [[Robert Barkley Shaw|Robert Shaw]], was a noted explorer of [[Central Asia]]. His uncle Lieutenant-General [[Charles Younghusband]] CB FRS, was a British Army officer and meteorologist.\n\nAs an infant, Francis was taken to live in England by his mother. When Clara returned to India in 1867 she left her son in the care of two austere and strictly religious aunts. In 1870 his mother and father returned to England and reunited the family. In 1876 at age thirteen, Francis entered [[Clifton College]], [[Bristol]]. In 1881 he entered the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and was commissioned as a [[Subaltern (rank)|subaltern]] in the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards]] in 1882.<ref name=\"IndianBio\" />\n\n== Military career ==\n[[File:Long White Mountain - p235 - Interior of an inn.png|thumb|left|A one-room inn in a then-wild area east of [[Tonghua]], in [[Jilin Province|Jilin]], China, where Younghusband and his companions stayed in 1887.<ref>{{harvnb|James|1887|pp=235\u2013238}}</ref>]]\n\nHaving read [[Charles MacGregor|General MacGregor]]'s book ''Defence of India'' he could have justifiably called himself an expert on the \"[[The Great Game|Great Game]]\" of espionage that was unfolding on the Steppes of Asia.<ref>General Sir C MacGregor, The Defence of India, (Simla, 1884)</ref> In 1886\u20131887, on leave from his regiment, Younghusband made an expedition across Asia though still a young officer.  After sailing to China his party set out, with Colonel Mark Bell's permission, to cross 1200 miles of desert with the ostensible authority to survey the geography; but in reality the purposes were to ascertain the strength of the Russian physical threats to the Raj.  Departing Peking with a senior colleague, [[H. E. M. James|Henry E. M. James]] (on leave from his [[Indian Civil Service]] position) and a young British consular officer from [[Newchwang]], [[Harry English Fulford]], on 4 April 1887, Lieut Younghusband explored [[Manchuria]], visiting the frontier areas of [[Chuang Guandong|Chinese settlement]] in the region of the [[Changbai Mountains]].<ref name=yh1896/><ref>{{citation|first=Sir Henry Evan Murchison |last=James|authorlink=Evan James (civil servant) | publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co. |year=1888|title=The Long White Mountain, or, A journey in Manchuria: with some account of the history, people, administration and religion of that country|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4bICAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\nOn arrival in India he was granted three months' leave by the Commander-in-Chief [[Field Marshal Lord Roberts]]; the scientific results of this travel would prove vital information to the [[Royal Geographical Society]].  Younghusband had already carried out numerous scientific observations in particular, showing that the [[Changbai Mountains]]'s highest peak, [[Baekdu Mountain]], is only around 8,000 feet tall, even though the travellers' British maps showed [nonexistent] snow-capped peaks 10,000-12,000&nbsp;ft tall in the area.<ref>{{harvnb|pp=254,262}})</ref> Fulford provided the travellers with language and cultural expertise.<ref>{{harvnb|pp=125,217}})</ref> Younghusband crossed the most inhospitable terrain in the world to the Himalayas before being ordered to make his way home. Parting with his British companions, he crossed the [[Taklamakan Desert]] to [[Chinese Turkestan]], and pioneered a route from [[Kashgar]] to [[India]] through the uncharted [[Mustagh Pass]].<ref name=yh1896>Younghusband, Francis E. (1896). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Avk88OI8bQkC The Heart of a Continent]'', pp. 58-290. John Murray, London. Facsimile reprint: (2005) Elbiron Classics.</ref> He reported to the Viceroy, [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], his crossing through the [[Karakoram]] Range, the [[Hindu Kush]], the [[Pamirs]] and where the range converged with the Himalayas; the nexus of three great empires.  In the 1880s the region of the Upper Oxus was still largely unmapped.  For this achievement, aged still only 24, he was elected the youngest member of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and received the society's 1890 [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]].\n\n[[Image:Younghusband PekingToYarkand Map.jpg|thumb|450px|right|\"From Peking To Yarkand and Kashmir via the Mustagh Pass\"]]\nIn 1889, he made captain, and was dispatched with a small escort of [[Gurkha]] soldiers to investigate an uncharted region north of [[Ladakh]], where raiders from [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] had disrupted trade between [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] and India the previous year.<ref>''The Heart of a Continent'', pp. 186ff</ref> Whilst encamped in the valley of the [[Yarkand River]], Younghusband received a messenger at his camp, inviting him to dinner with Captain [[Bronislav Grombchevsky]], his Russian counterpart in \"The Great Game\". Younghusband accepted the invitation to Grombchevsky's camp, and after dinner the two rivals talked into the night, sharing brandy and vodka, and discussing the possibility of a Russian invasion of British India. Grombchevsky impressed Younghusband with the horsemanship skills of his [[Cossack]] escort, and Younghusband impressed Grombchevsky with the rifle drill of his Gurkhas.<ref>''The Heart of a Continent'', pp. 234ff</ref> After their meeting in this remote frontier region, Grombchevsky resumed his expedition in the direction of [[Tibet]] and Younghusband continued his exploration of the [[Karakoram]].\n\nYounghusband received a telegram from Simla, to attend the Intelligence Department (ID) to be interviewed by Foreign Secretary [[Sir Mortimer Durand]], transferred to the [[Indian Political Service]].  He served as a political officer on secondment from the British Army.  He refused a request to visit Lhasa as an interpreter, disguised as a Yarkandi trader, a cover not guaranteed to fool the Russians, after [[Andrew Dalgleish]], a Scots merchant, had been brutally hacked to death.  Younghusband was accompanied by a Gurkha escort, celebrated for their ferocity in combat.  The Forward policy was circumscribed by a legal offer to all travellers of a peaceable security crossing borders.  Departure from [[Leh]] on 8 August 1889 on the caravan route took them up the mountain pass of [[Shimshal]] towards Hunza, his aim being to restore the tea trade to Xinjiang and prevent any further raids into Kashmir.  Colonel Durand from [[Gilgit]] joined him.  Younghusband probed the villages to gauge the reception: calculating it was a den of thieves, they ascended the steep ravine.  The Hunza was barred to them, a trap was sprung; the parley terms took him inside to negotiate.  The nervous reception over, they were all relieved to find safety; Younghusband wanted to know who was waylaying innocent civilian traders, and why.  The ruler, [[Safdar Ali]] extended a letter of welcome to his Kashmiri kingdom; the British investigated from whence came the Russian infiltrators under Agent Gromchevsky. Further south at [[Ladakh]], he kept close watch on their movements. Reluctantly, Younghusband dined with the Cossack leaders, who divulged the secrets of their common rivalry. Gromchevsky explained that the Raj had invited enmity for meddling in the Black Sea ports. The Russian displayed little grasp of strategy, but basic raw courage; he betrayed the confidence of [[Abdul Rahman]] as no friend to the British. Younghusband tentatively concluded that their possessions at Bokhara and Samarkand were vulnerable. Having drunk large quantities of vodka and brandy, the Cossacks presented arms in cordial salute and they parted in peace. Woefully unprepared for winter, the British garrison at Ladakh refused them entry.\n\nYounghusband finally arrived at [[Gulmit]] to a 13-gun salute. In khaki, the envoy greeted Safdar Ali at the marquee on the Karakoram Highway, the men of Hunza kneeling at their ruler's feet. This was colonial diplomacy, based on protocol and etiquette, but Younghusband had not come for merely trivial discussions. Reinforced by Durand's troops, Younghusband's arguments were to prevent the criminal looting, murder and highway robbery. Impervious to reason though Safdar Ali was, Younghusband was not prepared to allow him to laugh at the Raj. A demonstration of firepower \"caused quite a sensation\", he wrote in his diaries. The British major was disdainful, but content when he<!-- =Younghusband? --> left on 23 November to return to India, which he reached by Christmas.\n\nIn 1890, Younghusband was sent on a mission to [[Chinese Turkestan]], accompanied by [[George Macartney (British consul)|George Macartney]] as interpreter. He spent the winter in [[Kashgar]], where he left Macartney as British consul.<ref>Dictionary of National Biography ''Sir George Macartney''</ref> Younghusband wanted to investigate the Pamir Gap, a possible Russian entry route to India, but he had had to ensure that the Chinese at Kashgar were sorted out, to prevent a tripartite attempt by the Hunza clans. It was for this reason he recruited a Mandarin interpreter, junior officer George Macartney, to accompany his missions into the frozen mountains. They wintered in Kashgar as a listening post, meeting in conference with the Russian [[Nikolai Petrovsky]], who had always resisted trade with Xinjiang ([[Sinkiang]]). The Russian agent was well-informed about British India, but proved unscrupulous. Believing he had succeeded, Younghusband did not reckon on Petrovsky's deal with the ''[[Taotai]],'' the Chinese governor of Hunza.\n\nIn July 1891, they were still in the Pamirs when news reached them that the Russians intended to send troops \"to note and report with the Chinese and Afghans\". At [[Bozai Gumbaz]] in the [[Little Pamir]] on 12 August he encountered Cossack soldiers, who forced him to leave the area.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Riddick | first = John | title = The history of British India | year = 2006 | page=82 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Es6x4u_g19UC&lpg=PP1&dq=Riddick&pg=PA82#v=onepage&q | isbn = 978-0-313-32280-8}}</ref> This was one of the incidents which provoked the [[Hunza-Nagar Campaign]]. The troop of 20 or so soldiers planted a flag on what they anticipated was unclaimed territory, 150 miles south of the Russian border. However, the British considered the area to be Afghan territory. Colonel [[:ru:\u0418\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0415\u0444\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|Yonov]], decorated with the [[Order of St George]], approached his camp to announce that the area now belonged to the Tsar. Younghusband learnt that they had raided the [[Chitral]] territory; furthermore, they had penetrated the [[Darkot Pass]] into the [[Yasin Valley]]. They were joined by eager intelligence officer Lieutenant Davison, but the British were disabused by Ivanov of British sovereignty: Younghusband remained polite, maintained protocol but hospitable to the big Russian bear hug.\n\nDuring his service in Kashmir, he wrote a book called ''Kashmir'' at the request of [[Edward Molyneux]]. Younghusband's descriptions went hand in glove with Molyneux's paintings of the valley. In the book, Younghusband declared his immense admiration of the natural beauty of Kashmir and its history. The Great Game, between Britain and Russia, continued beyond the start of the 20th century until officially ended by the 1907 Anglo-Russian Treaty. Younghusband, among other explorers such as [[Sven Hedin]], [[Nikolay Przhevalsky]], [[Shoqan Walikhanov]] and [[Aurel Stein|Sir Auriel Stein]], had participated in earnest.<ref name=\"Nalle\">{{cite journal|author=David Nalle |date=June 2000 |title=Book Review&nbsp;\u2013 Tournament of Shadows: The Great Game and the Race for Empire in Central Asia |journal=[[Middle East Policy]] |volume= VII |issue=3 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Washington DC |issn=1061-1924 |url=http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol7/0006_nalle.asp |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601233205/http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol7/0006_nalle.asp |archivedate=1 June 2006 }}</ref> Rumours of Russian expansion into the [[Hindu Kush]] with a Russian presence in Tibet prompted the new [[Viceroy of India]] [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] to appoint Younghusband, by then a major, British commissioner to Tibet from 1902\u20131904.\n\n=== Invasion of Tibet and massacre at Guru ===\nIn 1903, Curzon appointed Younghusband head of the [[Tibet Frontier Commission]] with [[John Claude White]], political officer of [[Sikkim]], and E.

Geographical Review 32(4):681</ref> He was buried in the village churchyard.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n== Spiritual life ==\nBiographer [[Patrick French]] described Younghusband's religious belief as one who was\n<blockquote>brought up an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christian, read his way into [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoyan]] simplicity, experienced a revelatory vision in the mountains of Tibet, toyed with [[telepathy]] in [[Kashmir]], proposed a new faith based on virile [[racial theory]], then transformed it into what [[Bertrand Russell]] called 'a religion of [[atheism]].'<ref>French, p.313.</ref></blockquote> Ultimately he became a spiritualist and \"premature hippie\" who \"had great faith in the power of [[cosmic ray]]s, and claimed that there are extraterrestrials with translucent flesh on the planet [[Altair]].\"<ref>French, p. xx</ref>\n\nDuring his 1904 retreat from Tibet, Younghusband had a mystical experience which suffused him with \"love for the whole world\" and convinced him that \"men at heart are divine.\"<ref>quoted in French, p.252.</ref> This conviction was tinged with regret for the invasion of Tibet, and eventually, in 1936, profound religious convictions invited a founder's address to the [[World Congress of Faiths]] (in imitation of the [[World Parliament of Religions]]). Younghusband published a number of books with what one might call [[New Age]] themes, with titles like ''The Gleam: Being an account of the life of Nija Svabhava, pseud.'' (1923); ''Mother World (in Travail for the Christ that is to be)'' (1924); and ''Life in the Stars: An Exposition of the View that on some Planets of some Stars exist Beings higher than Ourselves, and on one a World-Leader, the Supreme Embodiment of the Eternal Spirit which animates the Whole'' (1927). The last drew the admiration of Lord [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]], the Boy Scouts founder.<ref>French, p. 321</ref> Key concepts consisted of the central belief that would come to be known as the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[pantheism]], and a Christlike \"world leader\" living on the planet \"Altair\" (or \"Stellair\"), exploring the theology of spiritualism, and guidance by means of telepathy.\n\nYounghusband allegedly believed in [[free love]] (\"freedom to unite when and how a man and a woman please\"), marriage laws examined as a matter of \"outdated custom.\"<ref>French, p. 283</ref> One of Younghusband's domestic servants, [[Gladys Aylward]], became a Christian missionary in China.\n\n=== Fictional portrayal ===\nThe [[Ingrid Bergman]] film ''[[The Inn of the Sixth Happiness]]'' (1958) is based on Gladys Aylward's life, with [[Ronald Squire]] portraying Younghusband.<ref>French., p. 364</ref>\n\n== Works ==\nYounghusband wrote 26 books in all between 1885 and 1942.

Artificial 'ants' (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by moving through a [[parameter space]] representing all possible solutions.  Real ants lay down [[pheromone]]s directing each other to resources while exploring their environment.  The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions.<ref>Ant Colony Optimization by Marco Dorigo and Thomas St\u00fctzle, MIT Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-262-04219-3}}</ref>  One variation on this approach is [[bees algorithm|the bees algorithm]], which is more analogous to the foraging patterns of the [[honey bee]], another social insect.\n\nThis algorithm is a member of the '''ant colony algorithms''' family, in [[swarm intelligence]] methods, and it constitutes some [[metaheuristic]] optimizations. Initially proposed by [[Marco Dorigo]] in 1992 in his PhD thesis,<ref>A. Colorni, M. Dorigo et V.

The original idea has since diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems, and as a result, several problems have emerged, drawing on various aspects of the behavior of ants. From a broader perspective, ACO performs a model-based search<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zlochin|first1=Mark|last2=Birattari|first2=Mauro|last3=Meuleau|first3=Nicolas|last4=Dorigo|first4=Marco|title=Model-Based Search for Combinatorial Optimization: A Critical Survey|journal=Annals of Operations Research|date=1 October 2004|volume=131|issue=1\u20134|pages=373\u2013395|doi=10.1023/B:ANOR.0000039526.52305.af|language=en|issn=0254-5330|citeseerx=10.1.1.3.427}}</ref> and shares some similarities with [[estimation of distribution algorithm]]s.\n\n==Overview==\n\nIn the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander [[random]]ly,  and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down [[pheromone]] trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see [[Ant#Communication|Ant communication]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fladerer |first1=Johannes-Paul |last2=Kurzmann |first2=Ernst |title=WISDOM OF THE MANY : how to create self -organisation and how to use collective... intelligence in companies and in society from mana. |date=November 2019 |publisher=BOOKS ON DEMAND |isbn=9783750422421}}</ref>\n\nOver time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.<ref>Marco Dorigo and Thomas St\u00fcltze, Ant Colony Optimization, p.12. 2004.</ref>\n\nThe overall result is that when one ant finds a good (i.e., short) path from the colony to a food source, other ants are more likely to follow that path, and [[positive feedback]] eventually leads to many ants following a single path. The idea of the ant colony algorithm is to mimic this behavior with \"simulated ants\" walking around the graph representing the problem to solve.\n\n===Ambient networks of intelligent objects===\nNew concepts are required since \u201cintelligence\u201d is no longer centralized but can be found throughout all minuscule objects. Anthropocentric concepts have been known to lead to the production of IT systems in which data processing, control units and calculating forces are centralized. These centralized units have continually increased their performance and can be compared to the human brain. The model of the brain has become the ultimate vision of computers. [[Ambient networks]] of intelligent objects and, sooner or later, a new generation of information systems which are even more diffused and based on nanotechnology, will profoundly change this concept. Small devices that can be compared to insects do not dispose of a high intelligence on their own. Indeed, their intelligence can be classed as fairly limited. It is, for example, impossible to integrate a high performance calculator with the power to solve any kind of mathematical problem into a biochip that is implanted into the human body or integrated in an intelligent tag which is designed to trace commercial articles. However, once those objects are interconnected they dispose of a form of intelligence that can be compared to a colony of ants or bees. In the case of certain problems, this type of intelligence can be superior to the reasoning of a centralized system similar to the brain.<ref name=\"Waldner 2008 214\">{{cite book |last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste  |authorlink = Jean-Baptiste Waldner  |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[ISTE Ltd|ISTE]] John Wiley & Sons |place = London |year = 2008 |isbn = 978-1-84704-002-2  | page = 214}}</ref>\n\nNature offers several examples of how minuscule organisms, if they all follow the same basic rule, can create a form of [[collective intelligence]] on the macroscopic level. Colonies of social insects perfectly illustrate this model which greatly differs from human societies. This model is based on the co-operation of independent units with simple and unpredictable behavior.<ref>{{cite book|last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste  |authorlink = Jean-Baptiste Waldner  |title = Inventer l'Ordinateur du XXI\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle |publisher = [[Hermes Science]] |place = London |year = 2007  | pages = 259\u2013265 |isbn = 978-2-7462-1516-0}}</ref> They move through their surrounding area to carry out certain tasks and only possess a very limited amount of information to do so. A colony of ants, for example, represents numerous qualities that can also be applied to a network of ambient objects. Colonies of ants have a very high capacity to adapt themselves to changes in the environment as well as an enormous strength in dealing with situations where one individual fails to carry out a given task. This kind of flexibility would also be very useful for mobile networks of objects which are perpetually developing. Parcels of information that move from a computer to a digital object behave in the same way as ants would do. They move through the network and pass from one knot to the next with the objective of arriving at their final destination as quickly as possible.<ref>{{cite book |last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste  |authorlink = Jean-Baptiste Waldner  |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = ISTE John Wiley & Sons |place = London |year = 2008 |isbn = 978-1-84704-002-2  | page = 215}}</ref>\n\n===Artificial pheromone system===\nPheromone-based communication is one of the most effective ways of communication which is widely observed in nature.

To apply an ant colony algorithm, the optimization problem needs to be converted into the problem of finding the [[shortest path problem|shortest path]] on a weighted graph. In the first step of each iteration, each ant stochastically constructs a solution, i.e. the order in which the edges in the graph should be followed. In the second step, the paths found by the different ants are compared.  The last step consists of updating the pheromone levels on each edge.\n\n '''procedure''' ACO_MetaHeuristic '''is'''\n     '''while''' not_termination '''do'''\n         generateSolutions()\n         daemonActions()\n         pheromoneUpdate()\n     '''repeat'''\n end procedure\n\n===Edge selection===\nEach ant needs to construct a solution to move through the graph.  To select the next edge in its tour, an ant will consider the length of each edge available from its current position, as well as the corresponding pheromone level. At each step of the algorithm, each ant moves from a state <math>x</math> to state <math>y</math>, corresponding to a more complete intermediate solution. Thus, each ant <math>k</math> computes a set <math>A_k(x)</math> of feasible expansions to its current state in each iteration, and moves to one of these in probability. For ant <math>k</math>, the probability <math>p_{xy}^k</math> of moving from state <math>x</math> to state <math>y</math> depends on the combination of two values, the ''attractiveness'' <math>\\eta_{xy}</math> of the move, as computed by some heuristic indicating the ''a priori'' desirability of that move and the ''trail level'' <math>\\tau_{xy}</math> of the move, indicating how proficient it has been in the past to make that particular move. The ''trail level'' represents a posteriori indication of the desirability of that move.\n\nIn general, the <math>k</math>th ant moves from state <math>x</math> to state <math>y</math> with probability\n\n<math>\np_{xy}^k =\n\\frac\n{ (\\tau_{xy}^{\\alpha}) (\\eta_{xy}^{\\beta}) }\n{ \\sum_{z\\in \\mathrm{allowed}_x} (\\tau_{xz}^{\\alpha}) (\\eta_{xz}^{\\beta}) }\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n<math>\\tau_{xy}</math> is the amount of pheromone deposited for transition from state <math>x</math> to <math>y</math>, 0 \u2264 <math>\\alpha</math> is a parameter to control the influence of <math>\\tau_{xy}</math>, <math>\\eta_{xy}</math> is the desirability of state transition <math>xy</math> (''a priori'' knowledge, typically <math>1/d_{xy}</math>, where <math>d</math> is the distance) and <math>\\beta</math> \u2265 1 is a parameter to control the influence of <math>\\eta_{xy}</math>. <math>\\tau_{xz}</math> and <math>\\eta_{xz}</math> represent the trail level and attractiveness for the other possible state transitions.\n\n===Pheromone update===\n\nTrails are usually updated when all ants have completed their solution, increasing or decreasing the level of trails corresponding to moves that were part of \"good\" or \"bad\" solutions, respectively. An example of a global pheromone updating rule is\n\n<math>\n\\tau_{xy} \\leftarrow\n(1-\\rho)\\tau_{xy} + \\sum_{k}\\Delta \\tau^{k}_{xy}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\tau_{xy}</math> is the amount of pheromone deposited for a state transition <math>xy</math>, <math>\\rho</math> is the ''pheromone evaporation coefficient'' and <math>\\Delta \\tau^{k}_{xy}</math> is the amount of pheromone deposited by <math>k</math>th ant, typically given for a [[Travelling salesman problem|TSP]] problem (with moves corresponding to arcs of the graph) by\n\n<math>\n\\Delta \\tau^{k}_{xy} =\n\\begin{cases}\nQ/L_k & \\mbox{if ant }k\\mbox{ uses curve }xy\\mbox{ in its tour} \\\\\n0 & \\mbox{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>L_k</math> is the cost of the <math>k</math>th ant's tour (typically length) and <math>Q</math> is a constant.\n\n==Common extensions==\nHere are some of the most popular variations of ACO algorithms.\n\n===Ant System (AS)===\nThe Ant System is the first ACO algorithm. This algorithm corresponds to the one presented above. It was developed by Dorigo.<ref name=\"Ant system\" />\n\n===Ant Colony System (ACS)===\nIn the Ant Colony System algorithm, the original Ant System was modified in three aspects: (i) the edge selection is biased towards exploitation (i.e. favoring the probability of selecting the shortest edges with a large amount of pheromone); (ii) while building a solution, ants change the pheromone level of the edges they are selecting by applying a local pheromone updating rule; (iii) at the end of each iteration, only the best ant is allowed to update the trails by applying a modified global pheromone updating rule.<ref name=\"M. Dorigo et L.M. Gambardella\">M. Dorigo et L.M. Gambardella, ''[http://www.idsia.ch/~luca/acs-ec97.pdf Ant Colony System : A Cooperative Learning Approach to the Traveling Salesman Problem]'', IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, volume 1, num\u00e9ro 1, pages 53-66, 1997.</ref> \n\n===Elitist Ant System===\nIn this algorithm, the global best solution deposits pheromone on its trail after every iteration (even if this trial has not been revisited), along with all the other ants.\n\n===Max-Min Ant System (MMAS)===\nThis algorithm controls the maximum and minimum pheromone amounts on each trail. Only the global best tour or the iteration best tour are allowed to add pheromone to its trail. To avoid stagnation of the search algorithm, the range of possible pheromone amounts on each trail is limited to an interval [\u03c4<sub>max</sub>,\u03c4<sub>min</sub>]. All edges are initialized to \u03c4<sub>max</sub> to force a higher exploration of solutions.  The trails are reinitialized to \u03c4<sub>max</sub> when nearing stagnation.<ref name=\"T. St\u00fctzle et H.H. Hoos\">T. St\u00fctzle et H.H. Hoos, ''MAX MIN Ant System'', Future Generation Computer Systems, volume 16, pages 889-914, 2000</ref>\n\n===Rank-based Ant System (ASrank)===\nAll solutions are ranked according to their length. Only a fixed number of the best ants in this iteration are allowed to update their trials. The amount of pheromone deposited is weighted for each solution, such that solutions with shorter paths deposit more pheromone than the solutions with longer paths.\n\n===Continuous Orthogonal Ant Colony (COAC)===\nThe pheromone deposit mechanism of COAC is to enable ants to search for solutions collaboratively and effectively. By using an orthogonal design method, ants in the feasible domain can explore their chosen regions rapidly and efficiently, with enhanced global search capability and accuracy. The orthogonal design method and the adaptive radius adjustment method can also be extended to other optimization algorithms for delivering wider advantages in solving practical problems.<ref>[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3894/ X Hu, J Zhang, and Y Li (2008). Orthogonal methods based ant colony search for solving continuous optimization problems. ''Journal of Computer Science and Technology'', 23(1), pp.2-18.]</ref>\n\n===Recursive Ant Colony Optimization===\nIt is a recursive form of ant system which divides the whole search domain into several sub-domains and solves the objective on these subdomains.<ref>Gupta, D.K.; Arora, Y.; Singh, U.K.; Gupta, J.P., \"Recursive Ant Colony Optimization for estimation of parameters of a function,\" Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT), 2012 1st International Conference on , vol., no., pp.448-454, 15\u201317 March 2012</ref> The results from all the subdomains are compared and the best few of them are promoted for the next level. The subdomains corresponding to the selected results are further subdivided and the process is repeated until an output of desired precision is obtained. This method has been tested on ill-posed geophysical inversion problems and works well.<ref>Gupta, D.K.; Gupta, J.P.; Arora, Y.; Shankar, U., \"[http://nsg.eage.org/publication/download/?publication=68286 Recursive ant colony optimization: a new technique for the estimation of function parameters from geophysical field data],\" Near Surface Geophysics , vol. 11, no. 3, pp.325-339</ref>\n\n==Convergence==\nFor some versions of the algorithm, it is possible to prove that it is convergent (i.e., it is able to find the global optimum in finite time). The first evidence of convergence for an ant colony algorithm was made in 2000, the graph-based ant system algorithm, and later on for the ACS and MMAS algorithms. Like most [[metaheuristic]]s, it is very difficult to estimate the theoretical speed of convergence. A performance analysis of a continuous ant colony algorithm with respect to its various parameters (edge selection strategy, distance measure metric, and pheromone evaporation rate) showed that its performance and rate of convergence are sensitive to the chosen parameter values, and especially to the value of the pheromone evaporation rate.<ref>V.K.Ojha, A. Abraham and V. Snasel, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01812 ACO for Continuous Function Optimization: A Performance Analysis], 14th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA), Japan, Page 145 - 150, 2017, 978-1-4799-7938-7/14 2014 IEEE.</ref> In 2004, Zlochin and his colleagues<ref name=\"Zlochin model-based search\">M. Zlochin, M. Birattari, N. Meuleau, et M. Dorigo, ''Model-based search for combinatorial optimization: A critical survey'', Annals of Operations Research, vol. 131, pp. 373-395, 2004.</ref> showed that COAC-type algorithms could be assimilated methods of [[stochastic gradient descent]], on the [[cross-entropy]] and [[estimation of distribution algorithm]]. They proposed these [[metaheuristic]]s as a \"[[research-based model]]\".\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Knapsack ants.svg|thumb|[[Knapsack problem]]: The ants prefer the smaller drop of honey over the more abundant, but less nutritious, sugar]]\nAnt colony optimization algorithms have been applied to many [[combinatorial optimization]] problems, ranging from quadratic assignment to [[protein]] folding or [[Vehicle routing problem|routing vehicles]] and a lot of derived methods have been adapted to dynamic problems in real variables, stochastic problems, multi-targets and [[parallel computing|parallel]] implementations.\nIt has also been used to produce near-optimal solutions to the [[travelling salesman problem]]. They have an advantage over [[simulated annealing]] and [[genetic algorithm]] approaches of similar problems when the graph may change dynamically; the ant colony algorithm can be run continuously and adapt to changes in real time. This is of interest in [[network routing]] and urban transportation systems.\n\nThe first ACO algorithm was called the ant system<ref name=\"Ant system\">M. Dorigo, V. Maniezzo, et A.

The general algorithm is relatively simple and based on a set of ants, each making one of the possible round-trips along the cities. At each stage, the ant chooses to move from one city to another according to some rules:\n# It must visit each city exactly once;\n# A distant city has less chance of being chosen (the visibility);\n# The more intense the pheromone trail laid out on an edge between two cities, the greater the probability that that edge will be chosen;\n# Having completed its journey, the ant deposits more pheromones on all edges it traversed, if the journey is short;\n# After each iteration, trails of pheromones evaporate.\n\n[[File:Aco TSP.svg|thumb|600px|center]]\n\n===Scheduling problem===\n*[[Sequential Ordering Problem]] (SOP) <ref> L.M.

In combinatorial problems, it is possible that the best solution eventually be found, even though no ant would prove effective. Thus, in the example of the Travelling salesman problem, it is not necessary that an ant actually travels the shortest route: the shortest route can be built from the strongest segments of the best solutions. However, this definition can be problematic in the case of problems in real variables, where no structure of 'neighbours' exists.

This principle has led some authors to create the term \"value\" to organize methods and behavior based on search of food, sorting larvae, division of labour and cooperative transportation.<ref>A.

The temperature parameter is modified as the algorithm progresses to alter the nature of the search.\n* Reactive search optimization focuses on combining machine learning with optimization, by adding an internal feedback loop to self-tune the free parameters of an algorithm to the characteristics of the problem, of the instance, and of the local situation around the current solution.\n*[[Tabu search]] (TS) is similar to simulated annealing in that both traverse the solution space by testing mutations of an individual solution. While simulated annealing generates only one mutated solution, tabu search generates many mutated solutions and moves to the solution with the lowest fitness of those generated. To prevent cycling and encourage greater movement through the solution space, a tabu list is maintained of partial or complete solutions. It is forbidden to move to a solution that contains elements of the tabu list, which is updated as the solution traverses the solution space.\n*[[Artificial immune system]] (AIS) algorithms are modeled on vertebrate immune systems.\n*[[Particle swarm optimization]] (PSO), a [[swarm intelligence]] method\n*[[Intelligent Water Drops|Intelligent water drops]] (IWD), a swarm-based optimization algorithm based on natural water drops flowing in rivers\n*Gravitational search algorithm (GSA), a [[swarm intelligence]] method\n*Ant colony clustering method (ACCM), a method that make use of clustering approach, extending the ACO.\n* [[Stochastic diffusion search]] (SDS), an agent-based probabilistic global search and optimization technique best suited to problems where the objective function can be decomposed into multiple independent partial-functions\n\n==History==\nThe inventors are [[Frans Moyson]] and [[Bernard Manderick]].

Artificial 'ants' (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by moving through a [[parameter space]] representing all possible solutions.  Real ants lay down [[pheromone]]s directing each other to resources while exploring their environment.  The simulated 'ants' similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions.<ref>Ant Colony Optimization by Marco Dorigo and Thomas St\u00fctzle, MIT Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-262-04219-3}}</ref>  One variation on this approach is [[bees algorithm|the bees algorithm]], which is more analogous to the foraging patterns of the [[honey bee]], another social insect.\n\nThis algorithm is a member of the '''ant colony algorithms''' family, in [[swarm intelligence]] methods, and it constitutes some [[metaheuristic]] optimizations. Initially proposed by [[Marco Dorigo]] in 1992 in his PhD thesis,<ref>A. Colorni, M. Dorigo et V. Maniezzo, ''Distributed Optimization by Ant Colonies'', actes de la premi\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence europ\u00e9enne sur la vie artificielle, Paris, France, Elsevier Publishing, 134-142, 1991.</ref><ref name=\"M. Dorigo, Optimization, Learning and Natural Algorithms\">M. Dorigo, ''Optimization, Learning and Natural Algorithms'', PhD thesis, Politecnico di Milano, Italy, 1992.</ref> the first algorithm was aiming to search for an optimal path in a graph, based on the behavior of [[ants]] seeking a path between their [[ant colony|colony]] and a source of food. The original idea has since diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems, and as a result, several problems have emerged, drawing on various aspects of the behavior of ants. From a broader perspective, ACO performs a model-based search<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zlochin|first1=Mark|last2=Birattari|first2=Mauro|last3=Meuleau|first3=Nicolas|last4=Dorigo|first4=Marco|title=Model-Based Search for Combinatorial Optimization: A Critical Survey|journal=Annals of Operations Research|date=1 October 2004|volume=131|issue=1\u20134|pages=373\u2013395|doi=10.1023/B:ANOR.0000039526.52305.af|language=en|issn=0254-5330|citeseerx=10.1.1.3.427}}</ref> and shares some similarities with [[estimation of distribution algorithm]]s.\n\n==Overview==\n\nIn the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander [[random]]ly,  and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down [[pheromone]] trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see [[Ant#Communication|Ant communication]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fladerer |first1=Johannes-Paul |last2=Kurzmann |first2=Ernst |title=WISDOM OF THE MANY : how to create self -organisation and how to use collective... intelligence in companies and in society from mana. |date=November 2019 |publisher=BOOKS ON DEMAND |isbn=9783750422421}}</ref>\n\nOver time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.<ref>Marco Dorigo and Thomas St\u00fcltze, Ant Colony Optimization, p.12. 2004.</ref>\n\nThe overall result is that when one ant finds a good (i.e., short) path from the colony to a food source, other ants are more likely to follow that path, and [[positive feedback]] eventually leads to many ants following a single path. The idea of the ant colony algorithm is to mimic this behavior with \"simulated ants\" walking around the graph representing the problem to solve.\n\n===Ambient networks of intelligent objects===\nNew concepts are required since \u201cintelligence\u201d is no longer centralized but can be found throughout all minuscule objects. Anthropocentric concepts have been known to lead to the production of IT systems in which data processing, control units and calculating forces are centralized. These centralized units have continually increased their performance and can be compared to the human brain. The model of the brain has become the ultimate vision of computers. [[Ambient networks]] of intelligent objects and, sooner or later, a new generation of information systems which are even more diffused and based on nanotechnology, will profoundly change this concept. Small devices that can be compared to insects do not dispose of a high intelligence on their own. Indeed, their intelligence can be classed as fairly limited. It is, for example, impossible to integrate a high performance calculator with the power to solve any kind of mathematical problem into a biochip that is implanted into the human body or integrated in an intelligent tag which is designed to trace commercial articles. However, once those objects are interconnected they dispose of a form of intelligence that can be compared to a colony of ants or bees. In the case of certain problems, this type of intelligence can be superior to the reasoning of a centralized system similar to the brain.<ref name=\"Waldner 2008 214\">{{cite book |last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste  |authorlink = Jean-Baptiste Waldner  |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[ISTE Ltd|ISTE]] John Wiley & Sons |place = London |year = 2008 |isbn = 978-1-84704-002-2  | page = 214}}</ref>\n\nNature offers several examples of how minuscule organisms, if they all follow the same basic rule, can create a form of [[collective intelligence]] on the macroscopic level. Colonies of social insects perfectly illustrate this model which greatly differs from human societies. This model is based on the co-operation of independent units with simple and unpredictable behavior.<ref>{{cite book|last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste  |authorlink = Jean-Baptiste Waldner  |title = Inventer l'Ordinateur du XXI\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle |publisher = [[Hermes Science]] |place = London |year = 2007  | pages = 259\u2013265 |isbn = 978-2-7462-1516-0}}</ref> They move through their surrounding area to carry out certain tasks and only possess a very limited amount of information to do so. A colony of ants, for example, represents numerous qualities that can also be applied to a network of ambient objects. Colonies of ants have a very high capacity to adapt themselves to changes in the environment as well as an enormous strength in dealing with situations where one individual fails to carry out a given task. This kind of flexibility would also be very useful for mobile networks of objects which are perpetually developing. Parcels of information that move from a computer to a digital object behave in the same way as ants would do. They move through the network and pass from one knot to the next with the objective of arriving at their final destination as quickly as possible.<ref>{{cite book |last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste  |authorlink = Jean-Baptiste Waldner  |title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = ISTE John Wiley & Sons |place = London |year = 2008 |isbn = 978-1-84704-002-2  | page = 215}}</ref>\n\n===Artificial pheromone system===\nPheromone-based communication is one of the most effective ways of communication which is widely observed in nature.

To apply an ant colony algorithm, the optimization problem needs to be converted into the problem of finding the [[shortest path problem|shortest path]] on a weighted graph. In the first step of each iteration, each ant stochastically constructs a solution, i.e. the order in which the edges in the graph should be followed. In the second step, the paths found by the different ants are compared.  The last step consists of updating the pheromone levels on each edge.\n\n '''procedure''' ACO_MetaHeuristic '''is'''\n     '''while''' not_termination '''do'''\n         generateSolutions()\n         daemonActions()\n         pheromoneUpdate()\n     '''repeat'''\n end procedure\n\n===Edge selection===\nEach ant needs to construct a solution to move through the graph.  To select the next edge in its tour, an ant will consider the length of each edge available from its current position, as well as the corresponding pheromone level. At each step of the algorithm, each ant moves from a state <math>x</math> to state <math>y</math>, corresponding to a more complete intermediate solution. Thus, each ant <math>k</math> computes a set <math>A_k(x)</math> of feasible expansions to its current state in each iteration, and moves to one of these in probability. For ant <math>k</math>, the probability <math>p_{xy}^k</math> of moving from state <math>x</math> to state <math>y</math> depends on the combination of two values, the ''attractiveness'' <math>\\eta_{xy}</math> of the move, as computed by some heuristic indicating the ''a priori'' desirability of that move and the ''trail level'' <math>\\tau_{xy}</math> of the move, indicating how proficient it has been in the past to make that particular move. The ''trail level'' represents a posteriori indication of the desirability of that move.\n\nIn general, the <math>k</math>th ant moves from state <math>x</math> to state <math>y</math> with probability\n\n<math>\np_{xy}^k =\n\\frac\n{ (\\tau_{xy}^{\\alpha}) (\\eta_{xy}^{\\beta}) }\n{ \\sum_{z\\in \\mathrm{allowed}_x} (\\tau_{xz}^{\\alpha}) (\\eta_{xz}^{\\beta}) }\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n<math>\\tau_{xy}</math> is the amount of pheromone deposited for transition from state <math>x</math> to <math>y</math>, 0 \u2264 <math>\\alpha</math> is a parameter to control the influence of <math>\\tau_{xy}</math>, <math>\\eta_{xy}</math> is the desirability of state transition <math>xy</math> (''a priori'' knowledge, typically <math>1/d_{xy}</math>, where <math>d</math> is the distance) and <math>\\beta</math> \u2265 1 is a parameter to control the influence of <math>\\eta_{xy}</math>. <math>\\tau_{xz}</math> and <math>\\eta_{xz}</math> represent the trail level and attractiveness for the other possible state transitions.\n\n===Pheromone update===\n\nTrails are usually updated when all ants have completed their solution, increasing or decreasing the level of trails corresponding to moves that were part of \"good\" or \"bad\" solutions, respectively. An example of a global pheromone updating rule is\n\n<math>\n\\tau_{xy} \\leftarrow\n(1-\\rho)\\tau_{xy} + \\sum_{k}\\Delta \\tau^{k}_{xy}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\tau_{xy}</math> is the amount of pheromone deposited for a state transition <math>xy</math>, <math>\\rho</math> is the ''pheromone evaporation coefficient'' and <math>\\Delta \\tau^{k}_{xy}</math> is the amount of pheromone deposited by <math>k</math>th ant, typically given for a [[Travelling salesman problem|TSP]] problem (with moves corresponding to arcs of the graph) by\n\n<math>\n\\Delta \\tau^{k}_{xy} =\n\\begin{cases}\nQ/L_k & \\mbox{if ant }k\\mbox{ uses curve }xy\\mbox{ in its tour} \\\\\n0 & \\mbox{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>L_k</math> is the cost of the <math>k</math>th ant's tour (typically length) and <math>Q</math> is a constant.\n\n==Common extensions==\nHere are some of the most popular variations of ACO algorithms.\n\n===Ant System (AS)===\nThe Ant System is the first ACO algorithm. This algorithm corresponds to the one presented above. It was developed by Dorigo.<ref name=\"Ant system\" />\n\n===Ant Colony System (ACS)===\nIn the Ant Colony System algorithm, the original Ant System was modified in three aspects: (i) the edge selection is biased towards exploitation (i.e. favoring the probability of selecting the shortest edges with a large amount of pheromone); (ii) while building a solution, ants change the pheromone level of the edges they are selecting by applying a local pheromone updating rule; (iii) at the end of each iteration, only the best ant is allowed to update the trails by applying a modified global pheromone updating rule.<ref name=\"M. Dorigo et L.M. Gambardella\">M. Dorigo et L.M. Gambardella, ''[http://www.idsia.ch/~luca/acs-ec97.pdf Ant Colony System : A Cooperative Learning Approach to the Traveling Salesman Problem]'', IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, volume 1, num\u00e9ro 1, pages 53-66, 1997.</ref> \n\n===Elitist Ant System===\nIn this algorithm, the global best solution deposits pheromone on its trail after every iteration (even if this trial has not been revisited), along with all the other ants.\n\n===Max-Min Ant System (MMAS)===\nThis algorithm controls the maximum and minimum pheromone amounts on each trail. Only the global best tour or the iteration best tour are allowed to add pheromone to its trail. To avoid stagnation of the search algorithm, the range of possible pheromone amounts on each trail is limited to an interval [\u03c4<sub>max</sub>,\u03c4<sub>min</sub>]. All edges are initialized to \u03c4<sub>max</sub> to force a higher exploration of solutions.  The trails are reinitialized to \u03c4<sub>max</sub> when nearing stagnation.<ref name=\"T. St\u00fctzle et H.H. Hoos\">T. St\u00fctzle et H.H. Hoos, ''MAX MIN Ant System'', Future Generation Computer Systems, volume 16, pages 889-914, 2000</ref>\n\n===Rank-based Ant System (ASrank)===\nAll solutions are ranked according to their length. Only a fixed number of the best ants in this iteration are allowed to update their trials. The amount of pheromone deposited is weighted for each solution, such that solutions with shorter paths deposit more pheromone than the solutions with longer paths.\n\n===Continuous Orthogonal Ant Colony (COAC)===\nThe pheromone deposit mechanism of COAC is to enable ants to search for solutions collaboratively and effectively. By using an orthogonal design method, ants in the feasible domain can explore their chosen regions rapidly and efficiently, with enhanced global search capability and accuracy. The orthogonal design method and the adaptive radius adjustment method can also be extended to other optimization algorithms for delivering wider advantages in solving practical problems.<ref>[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/3894/ X Hu, J Zhang, and Y Li (2008). Orthogonal methods based ant colony search for solving continuous optimization problems. ''Journal of Computer Science and Technology'', 23(1), pp.2-18.]</ref>\n\n===Recursive Ant Colony Optimization===\nIt is a recursive form of ant system which divides the whole search domain into several sub-domains and solves the objective on these subdomains.<ref>Gupta, D.K.; Arora, Y.; Singh, U.K.; Gupta, J.P., \"Recursive Ant Colony Optimization for estimation of parameters of a function,\" Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT), 2012 1st International Conference on , vol., no., pp.448-454, 15\u201317 March 2012</ref> The results from all the subdomains are compared and the best few of them are promoted for the next level. The subdomains corresponding to the selected results are further subdivided and the process is repeated until an output of desired precision is obtained. This method has been tested on ill-posed geophysical inversion problems and works well.<ref>Gupta, D.K.; Gupta, J.P.; Arora, Y.; Shankar, U., \"[http://nsg.eage.org/publication/download/?publication=68286 Recursive ant colony optimization: a new technique for the estimation of function parameters from geophysical field data],\" Near Surface Geophysics , vol. 11, no. 3, pp.325-339</ref>\n\n==Convergence==\nFor some versions of the algorithm, it is possible to prove that it is convergent (i.e., it is able to find the global optimum in finite time). The first evidence of convergence for an ant colony algorithm was made in 2000, the graph-based ant system algorithm, and later on for the ACS and MMAS algorithms. Like most [[metaheuristic]]s, it is very difficult to estimate the theoretical speed of convergence. A performance analysis of a continuous ant colony algorithm with respect to its various parameters (edge selection strategy, distance measure metric, and pheromone evaporation rate) showed that its performance and rate of convergence are sensitive to the chosen parameter values, and especially to the value of the pheromone evaporation rate.<ref>V.K.Ojha, A. Abraham and V. Snasel, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01812 ACO for Continuous Function Optimization: A Performance Analysis], 14th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA), Japan, Page 145 - 150, 2017, 978-1-4799-7938-7/14 2014 IEEE.</ref> In 2004, Zlochin and his colleagues<ref name=\"Zlochin model-based search\">M.

Dorigo, ''Model-based search for combinatorial optimization: A critical survey'', Annals of Operations Research, vol. 131, pp. 373-395, 2004.</ref> showed that COAC-type algorithms could be assimilated methods of [[stochastic gradient descent]], on the [[cross-entropy]] and [[estimation of distribution algorithm]]. They proposed these [[metaheuristic]]s as a \"[[research-based model]]\".\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Knapsack ants.svg|thumb|[[Knapsack problem]]: The ants prefer the smaller drop of honey over the more abundant, but less nutritious, sugar]]\nAnt colony optimization algorithms have been applied to many [[combinatorial optimization]] problems, ranging from quadratic assignment to [[protein]] folding or [[Vehicle routing problem|routing vehicles]] and a lot of derived methods have been adapted to dynamic problems in real variables, stochastic problems, multi-targets and [[parallel computing|parallel]] implementations.\nIt has also been used to produce near-optimal solutions to the [[travelling salesman problem]]. They have an advantage over [[simulated annealing]] and [[genetic algorithm]] approaches of similar problems when the graph may change dynamically; the ant colony algorithm can be run continuously and adapt to changes in real time. This is of interest in [[network routing]] and urban transportation systems.\n\nThe first ACO algorithm was called the ant system<ref name=\"Ant system\">M. Dorigo, V. Maniezzo, et A.

The general algorithm is relatively simple and based on a set of ants, each making one of the possible round-trips along the cities. At each stage, the ant chooses to move from one city to another according to some rules:\n# It must visit each city exactly once;\n# A distant city has less chance of being chosen (the visibility);\n# The more intense the pheromone trail laid out on an edge between two cities, the greater the probability that that edge will be chosen;\n# Having completed its journey, the ant deposits more pheromones on all edges it traversed, if the journey is short;\n# After each iteration, trails of pheromones evaporate.\n\n[[File:Aco TSP.svg|thumb|600px|center]]\n\n===Scheduling problem===\n*[[Sequential Ordering Problem]] (SOP) <ref> L.M.

In combinatorial problems, it is possible that the best solution eventually be found, even though no ant would prove effective. Thus, in the example of the Travelling salesman problem, it is not necessary that an ant actually travels the shortest route: the shortest route can be built from the strongest segments of the best solutions. However, this definition can be problematic in the case of problems in real variables, where no structure of 'neighbours' exists. The collective behaviour of [[social insects]] remains a source of inspiration for researchers. The wide variety of algorithms (for optimization or not) seeking self-organization in biological systems has led to the concept of \"[[swarm intelligence]]\",<ref name=\"Waldner 2008 214\"/> which is a very general framework in which ant colony algorithms fit.\n\n==Stigmergy algorithms==\nThere is in practice a large number of algorithms claiming to be \"ant colonies\", without always sharing the general framework of optimization by canonical ant colonies.<ref>Santpal Singh Dhillon , ''Ant Routing, Searching and Topology Estimation Algorithms for Ad Hoc Networks'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=j5fOJqhwcJoC&pg=PA33&dq=Stigmergy+algorithms&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwjfaAtOrTAhWnLsAKHVPkCjYQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&q=Stigmergy%20algorithms&f=false], IOS Press, (2008)</ref> In practice, the use of an exchange of information between ants via the environment (a principle called \"[[stigmergy]]\") is deemed enough for an algorithm to belong to the class of ant colony algorithms. This principle has led some authors to create the term \"value\" to organize methods and behavior based on search of food, sorting larvae, division of labour and cooperative transportation.<ref>A.

A superior neighbor is always accepted. An inferior neighbor is accepted probabilistically based on the difference in quality and a temperature parameter. The temperature parameter is modified as the algorithm progresses to alter the nature of the search.\n* Reactive search optimization focuses on combining machine learning with optimization, by adding an internal feedback loop to self-tune the free parameters of an algorithm to the characteristics of the problem, of the instance, and of the local situation around the current solution.\n*[[Tabu search]] (TS) is similar to simulated annealing in that both traverse the solution space by testing mutations of an individual solution. While simulated annealing generates only one mutated solution, tabu search generates many mutated solutions and moves to the solution with the lowest fitness of those generated. To prevent cycling and encourage greater movement through the solution space, a tabu list is maintained of partial or complete solutions. It is forbidden to move to a solution that contains elements of the tabu list, which is updated as the solution traverses the solution space.\n*[[Artificial immune system]] (AIS) algorithms are modeled on vertebrate immune systems.\n*[[Particle swarm optimization]] (PSO), a [[swarm intelligence]] method\n*[[Intelligent Water Drops|Intelligent water drops]] (IWD), a swarm-based optimization algorithm based on natural water drops flowing in rivers\n*Gravitational search algorithm (GSA), a [[swarm intelligence]] method\n*Ant colony clustering method (ACCM), a method that make use of clustering approach, extending the ACO.\n* [[Stochastic diffusion search]] (SDS), an agent-based probabilistic global search and optimization technique best suited to problems where the objective function can be decomposed into multiple independent partial-functions\n\n==History==\nThe inventors are [[Frans Moyson]] and [[Bernard Manderick]].

Baker]], composed of 15 companies instead of the standard 10. Although raised from residents of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], it was initially designated the 1st Regiment, California Volunteer Infantry in deference to Baker's wishes. After his death at the [[Battle of Balls Bluff]] in November 1861, it was renamed the 71st Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. It was grouped with the [[69th Pennsylvania Infantry|69th]], [[72nd Pennsylvania Infantry|72nd]], and [[106th Pennsylvania Infantry|106th Pennsylvania]] regiments to form the famous [[Philadelphia Brigade]].\n\nThe 71st was assigned to the [[II Corps (ACW)|II Corps]] in time to participate in the 1862 [[Peninsula Campaign]]. During the [[Seven Days Battles]], it made several charges, losing many officers and men. After reaching Harrison's Landing, companies L, M, N, P, and R were merged into the first ten companies. The regiment, along with rest of the [[Army of the Potomac]], was transferred to northern [[Virginia]]. Here the 71st fought at the battles of [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Bull Run]] and [[Battle of Chantilly|Chantilly]]. It helped cover [[John Pope (military officer)|Pope]]'s retreat. At the [[Battle of Antietam]] that September, the regiment lost one third of its strength. It again suffered heavy losses at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] in December.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], the 71st was positioned at the famous Angle on [[Cemetery Ridge]]. On July 2, it helped defeat the attack by Brig. Gen. [[Ambrose Wright]]'s brigade. On July 3, it was briefly sent to [[Culp's Hill]] but was returned to Cemetery Ridge. Half of the regiment was placed along the advanced wall with the 69th Pennsylvania to its left, while the other half was 50 yards to its right-rear. During [[Pickett's Charge]], the left portion of the regiment was forced back from the wall and nearly routed. Brig. Gen. [[Alexander S. Webb]] managed to rally the regiment near the 72nd and 106th Pennsylvania, but was unable to convince any of the three units to [[counterattack]] at first. Finally after several minutes, they pushed the Confederates out of the Angle. The 71st lost 98 officers and men during the attack, including nine out of fifteen officers.\n\nThe 71st served through the [[Overland Campaign]], losing heavily in both men and officers. At the [[Battle of the Wilderness]], Lt. Col. [[Charles Kochersperger]] was wounded and five colorbearers were shot down, and at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]], Capt. Mitchell Smith was killed. The regiment's last battle as a unit was at [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]].\n\nAfterwards, those entitled to discharge (a total of 53) were mustered out in Philadelphia on July 2, 1864. The remainder of the regiment was merged into the 69th Pennsylvania. Out of a total of 1,665 men who served in the regiment during the war, only 153 returned uninjured.\n\n==Casualties==\n* Killed and mortally wounded: 14 officers, 147 enlisted men\n* Wounded: 24 officers, 372 enlisted men\n* Died of disease: 1 officer, 98 enlisted men\n* Captured or missing: 10 officers, 320 men\n* Total casualties: 49 officers, 1,211 enlisted men\n\n==Commanders==\n* Col.

Baker]], composed of 15 companies instead of the standard 10. Although raised from residents of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], it was initially designated the 1st California in deference to Baker's wishes. After his death at the [[Battle of Balls Bluff]] in November 1861, it was renamed the 71st Pennsylvania. It was grouped with the [[69th Pennsylvania Infantry|69th]], [[72nd Pennsylvania Infantry|72nd]], and [[106th Pennsylvania Infantry|106th Pennsylvania]] regiments to form the famous [[Philadelphia Brigade]].\n\nThe 71st was assigned to the [[II Corps (ACW)|II Corps]] in time to participate in the 1862 [[Peninsula Campaign]]. During the [[Seven Days Battles]], it made several charges, losing many officers and men. After reaching Harrison's Landing, companies L, M, N, P, and R were merged into the first ten companies. The regiment, along with rest of the [[Army of the Potomac]], was transferred to northern [[Virginia]]. Here the 71st fought at the battles of [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Bull Run]] and [[Battle of Chantilly|Chantilly]]. It helped cover [[John Pope (military officer)|Pope]]'s retreat. At the [[Battle of Antietam]] that September, the regiment lost one third of its strength. It again suffered heavy losses at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] in December.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], the 71st was positioned at the famous Angle on [[Cemetery Ridge]]. On July 2, it helped defeat the attack by Brig. Gen. [[Ambrose Wright]]'s brigade. On July 3, it was briefly sent to [[Culp's Hill]] but was returned to Cemetery Ridge. Half of the regiment was placed along the advanced wall with the 69th Pennsylvania to its left, while the other half was 50 yards to its right-rear. During [[Pickett's Charge]], the left portion of the regiment was forced back from the wall and nearly routed. Brig. Gen. [[Alexander S. Webb]] managed to rally the regiment near the 72nd and 106th Pennsylvania, but was unable to convince any of the three units to [[counterattack]] at first. Finally after several minutes, they pushed the Confederates out of the Angle. The 71st lost 98 officers and men during the attack, including nine out of fifteen officers.\n\nThe 71st served through the [[Overland Campaign]], losing heavily in both men and officers. At the [[Battle of the Wilderness]], Lt. Col. [[Charles Kochersperger]] was wounded and five colorbearers were shot down, and at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]], Capt. Mitchell Smith was killed. The regiment's last battle as a unit was at [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]].\n\nAfterwards, those entitled to discharge (a total of 53) were mustered out in Philadelphia on July 2, 1864. The remainder of the regiment was merged into the 69th Pennsylvania. Out of a total of 1,665 men who served in the regiment during the war, only 153 returned uninjured.\n\n==Casualties==\n* Killed and mortally wounded: 14 officers, 147 enlisted men\n* Wounded: 24 officers, 372 enlisted men\n* Died of disease: 1 officer, 98 enlisted men\n* Captured or missing: 10 officers, 320 men\n* Total casualties: 49 officers, 1,211 enlisted men\n\n==Commanders==\n* Col.

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his stepfather, [[Richard Stucley]]. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought in the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven his reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]]. The historian [[Christine Carpenter (historian)|Christine Carpenter]] comments, on the family's social position, that they were of sufficiently \"landed and official status to be regarded as what might be termed 'super-knights'{{tsp}}\";{{Sfn|Carpenter|2012|p=76}} she echoed the medievalist [[K. B. McFarlane]], who had previously described the family as \"a powerful and respected element in Devon...there was no need for them to stand in dread of the great, for they were not small themselves\".{{Sfn|McFarlane|1981|p=16}}\n[[File:OldShuteHouseGreatHallFromWest.jpg|upright=1.2|alt=Late fourteenth-century section of Bonville's birthplace.|left|thumb|Very little of the original medieval manor house remains of Bonville's birthplace; the section shown here is from the late fourteenth century.]]\nWilliam Bonville was born on either 12 or 31 August 1392{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} or 1393 in [[Shute, Devon]], to John Bonville (d. 1396) and Elizabeth Fitzroger (c. 1370\u2013c. 1414).{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} William Bonville's grandfather was his namesake Sir William Bonville, who had been [[member of Parliament]] for [[Somerset]] and Devon on multiple occasions{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} and has been described by a historian as one of \"the most prominent west-country gentry in the late fourteenth century\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} On hearing of the birth of his grandson, a contemporary reports, Sir William \"raised his hands to heaven and praised God\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Along with the [[Newenham Abbey|Abbot of Newenham]], he stood [[godparent]] to the young William.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} The younger William was heir to both his father and grandfather; the latter\u2014who had married twice\u2014had substantially expanded the family [[Inheritance|patrimony]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} He has been described by the scholar [[Ralph A. Griffiths|Ralph Griffiths]] as a \"capable, energetic and well-connected man\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}}\n\nBonville's father died when his son was four,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} and young William probably grew up in his grandfather's household.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Grandfather Bonville died in 1408,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} while Bonville was still legally a [[Minor (law)|minor]].{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|p=218}} As was customary, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]] took both Bonville's [[Ward (law)|wardship]] and marriage into his own hands. This was valuable [[Royal Patronage|royal patronage]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} which the King granted firstly to Sir [[John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft|John Tiptoft]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1983|p=111}} and then to [[Edward, Duke of York]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} Bonville had a younger brother, Thomas, who, by the time William came of age, had already married a cousin of Robert, Baron Poynings. This connection to the Poynings family, the historian [[J. S. Roskell]] has suggested, was instrumental in Bonville's own marriage.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\n\n=== Marriages and children ===\nBonville married twice. In 1414 he married Margaret Grey, daughter of [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Reginald, Baron Grey of Ruthin]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=574}} Lord Grey promised to pay 200 marks{{Refn|A medieval English mark was an [[Unit of account|accounting unit]] equivalent to two-thirds of a pound.{{sfn|Harding|2002|p=xiv}}|group=note}} to Bonville on the wedding day, and Bonville likewise contracted to settle estates to the value of \u00a3100 on himself and his wife, [[Jointure|jointly]]. Grey also paid another 200 marks in instalments over the following four years.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Sometime between April 1426 and October 1427{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014when Bonville received a [[papal dispensation]] to marry again\u2014Margaret Grey died. Bonville made his next marriage to Elizabeth Courtenay, widow of [[John Harington, 4th Baron Harington|John, Baron Harington]]. Elizabeth was the daughter of Bonville's grandfather's local associate, Edward Earl of Devon.{{Sfn|Cokayne|1912|pp=218\u2013219}} The couple required a dispensation to marry because Elizabeth was already a godmother to one of Bonville's daughters; in the eyes of the church, this placed her within a prohibited degree of [[consanguinity]].{{sfn|Attreed|2001|p=128}} Elizabeth was already well connected\u2014her brother-in-law was Lord Harington, and the Earl of Devon her nephew{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\u2014and this marriage greatly increased Bonville's links to the [[Peerage of England|peerage]].\n\nBonville's son and heir by Margaret, also named [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington|William]], married Lord Harington's only daughter Elizabeth around 1443.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=121}} Two of Bonville's daughters\u2014Margaret and Philippa{{Refn|name=\"P\"|group=note}}\u2014married William Courtenay and William Grenville respectively; they were both scions of cadet branches of the Courtenay family. Bonville's third daughter, Elizabeth,{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} married an important Midlands landowner, [[William Tailboys|Sir William Tailboys]] by November 1446.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=580}} These marriages further enhanced Bonville's aristocratic and political connections.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nBonville had an illegitimate son, John, by Isabel Kirkby.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} John married Alice Denys and was [[Financial endowment|endowed]] in 1453.{{sfn|Kleineke|2015|p=122}} On Bonville's death, he bequeathed John a \"substantial\" property. He died in 1499.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} {{Location map|Devon|width=230|float=right|caption=The location of Shute, Bonville's birthplace, within Devon and England.|label=Shute|mark=Red_pog.svg|lat_deg=|lon_deg=|lat=50.7712|long=-3.0602}}\n\n=== Estates and wealth ===\nBonville's father and grandfather had both had successful careers.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993a}} As such, when Bonville [[Age of majority|came of age]] in 1414{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} he inherited an income of approximately \u00a3900 per annum; for context, the historian [[Martin Cherry]] says this was \"a figure not far short of that enjoyed by the fifteenth-century earls of Devon themselves\".{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} His lands\u2014comprising 18 manors{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}}\u2014were situated all over England, although concentrated in Devon, particularly around Shute in the southeast of the county, and Somerset.{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} These lands encompassed his grandfather's patrimony, with manors in Devon, Somerset, Dorset and [[Wiltshire]]. The Fitzroger estates were mainly in [[Leicestershire]], the [[East Midlands]], and the southeast of England in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]].{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}}\n\nOwing to the deaths of their husbands in 1396 and 1408 respectively,{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=153}} Bonville's mother and grandmother each held a third of his inheritance in [[dower]].{{Refn|The legal concept of dower had existed since the late twelfth century as a means of protecting a woman from being left landless if her husband died first.

By the fifteenth century, the widow was deemed entitled to her dower;{{sfn|Kenny|2003|pp=59\u201360}} the historian [[Rowena Archer]] argues that this made it \"one of the most destructive of baronial incidents\" on account of how a long-lived [[dowager]] could reduce an inheritance over generations.{{sfn|Archer|1984|p=16}}|group=note}} His mother had remarried in 1397, to [[Richard Stucley]],{{refn|Also spelled Styuecle.{{Sfn|Roskell|Clark|Rawcliffe|1993b}}|group=note}} an important [[Essex]] landowner.

This struggle took over six years, but he succeeded in establishing his rights to the estates by 1422.

In February that year York rebelled and marched on London with a large force. He faced the King's army at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], southeast of London. Courtenay stood alongside him.

Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished.

York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.''

The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.

This act effectively granted York the throne on Henry's death, and thus disinherited the Prince of Wales. Margaret and her nobles withdrew to the north, where they gathered an army and began to [[pillage]] the [[House of York|Yorkist lords']] estates there. York and the Earl of Salisbury, with their smaller army, marched north the following month; Bonville remained in London. Bonville's son William marched with York, and died with him at the [[Battle of Wakefield]], where the Yorkist army went down to a crushing defeat by the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian army]] on 30 December 1460.{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}}\n\n====Second Battle of St Albans====\nThe Lancastrians proceeded to march south; Salisbury's son, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]], had been left in charge of the King in London.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville, who had been in the southwest raising an army, returned to London.

Bonville's father died before Bonville reached adulthood. As a result, he grew up in the household of his grandfather and namesake, who was a prominent member of the Devon gentry. Both Bonville's father and grandfather had been successful in politics and land acquisition, and when Bonville came of age, he gained control of a large estate. He augmented this further by a series of lawsuits against his stepfather, [[Richard Stucley]]. Bonville undertook royal service, which then meant fighting in France in the later years of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In 1415, he joined the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|English invasion of France]] in the retinue of [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s brother, and fought in the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt campaign]]. Throughout his life, Bonville was despatched on further operations in France, but increasingly events in the southwest of England took up more of his time and energy, as he became [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|involved in a feud]] with his powerful neighbour [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]].\n\nIn 1437, King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] granted Bonville the profitable office of steward of the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. This had traditionally been a hereditary office of the earls of Devon, and the Earl was enraged at its loss. The dispute soon descended into violence, and Bonville and Courtenay ravaged each other's properties. The situation was exacerbated in 1442 when the Crown appointed Courtenay to effectively the same stewardship it had appointed Bonville, which inflamed the situation even more. The feud between them continued intermittently for the next decade. Generally, Henry and his government failed to intervene between the two parties; when it did, its efforts were ineffectual. On one occasion Bonville was persuaded to undertake further service in France\u2014primarily to get Bonville out of the region\u2014but the mission was poorly funded, a military failure, and when Bonville returned the feud reignited. In 1453, King Henry became ill and entered a [[catatonic state]] for eighteen months, heightening the political factionalism that had riven his reign.\n\nBonville generally seems to have remained loyal to the king, although his guiding motivation was to support whoever would aid him in his struggle against Courtenay. Their feud was part of a broader breakdown in law and order which eventually evolved into the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455. Bonville seems to have managed to avoid implication in the variable swings in political fortune which followed until 1460. At this point, he threw in his lot with the rebellious [[Richard, Duke of York]]. His new allegiance brought him little profit; his son was killed alongside York at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, while Bonville himself took part in the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] two months later on the losing side; with [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th Earl of Devon|the new Earl of Devon]] watching, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] on 18 February 1461.\n\n== Background and early life ==\nThe Bonvilles were one of the major [[gentry]] families of late-fourteenth-century Devon, often working in close co-operation with their neighbours. The most important of these were the [[House of Courtenay|Courtenay]] [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]]. Bonville's grandfather had been a [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] of the 11th Earl, [[Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon|Edward]].

Courtenay saw his newly-reinforced position as sufficiently secure to allow him to reignite the feud with Bonville,{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} who in Taunton was recruiting men to his banner at [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] a day.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=93}} To this end he launched a series of raids onto Bonville properties, which culminated in Courtenay's [[Besiege|besieging]] of Bonville's [[Taunton Castle]]{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=254}} with a force of over 5,000 men{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=576}}\u2014a crisis that the contemporary [[chronicle]]r [[William Worcester]] described as \"''maxima perturbatio''\".{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}{{Refn|Translated to English, Worcester described it as \"the greatest disturbance\".{{sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}}|group=note}} Fighting alongside Courtenay was [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham|Edward Brooke, Lord Cobham]], son of the Thomas Brooke whom Bonville had feuded with over a decade previously.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Courtenay's alliance with York was not as strong as the Earl believed, and when York arrived in Devon to restore order, he promptly cast both Bonville and Courtenay, with many of their retainers, into prison{{Sfn|Cherry|2004}} for a month.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}} Bonville was forced to put Taunton Castle into the duke's custody.{{Sfn|Gillingham|1993|p=72}} This particular phase of the feud was suspended by the holding of a [[Loveday (arbitration)|loveday]] (''dies amoris'') between Bonville and Courtenay at [[Colcombe Castle|Colcombe]] in 1451. This was an important enough political event for it to warrant the attendance of [[Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers|Richard, Lord Rivers]] and his wife [[Jacquetta of Luxembourg|Jacquetta, Lady Rivers]] as the King's representatives.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=596}}\n\nThe Earl of Devon's continuing alliance with York brought Courtenay further problems in 1452. By then, York felt excluded from the government as the King had a new favourite, [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund, Duke of Somerset]]. In February that year York rebelled and marched on London with a large force. He faced the King's army at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], southeast of London. Courtenay stood alongside him. Somerset and much of the rest of the nobility faced York and Courtenay down: they surrendered without a fight.{{Sfn|Radford|1912|p=255}} Bonville had raised a body of men to join the King's army,{{Sfn|Goodman|1981|p=20}} and subsequently profited from Courtenay's disfavour with the King.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=128}} The historian [[A. J. Pollard]] suggests that Bonville was given \"a free hand\" in the region as a result of York's and Devon's eclipse{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=136}} and according to Cherry, this allowed Bonville to become the predominant figure in county politics.{{Sfn|Cherry|1981b|p=132}} He was commissioned to oversee the arrest and prosecution of the Earl of Devon's men after Blackheath, and the following year King Henry demonstrated the esteem Bonville stood in when, during Henry's [[royal progress]] through the southwest, he stayed at Bonville's [[Caput baroniae|''caput'']] of Shute.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=259}} Bonville received further offices and responsibilities. He was confirmed as steward of the Duchy of Cornwall, reappointed seneschal of Gascony and also made [[lieutenant of Aquitaine]]. Bonville has been described by historians connected to ''The [[Gascon Rolls]] Project'' as being \"an excellent choice for lieutenant\"{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}}{{refn|The office of lieutenant of Aquitaine went back to at least 1278,{{sfn|Gascon Rolls|2014}} and since the [[Duke of Aquitaine]] was also King of England, the lieutenant ruled directly on the King's behalf. It was a royal appointment, usually to a close relative of the King, although it was a sporadic one, being mostly filled during periods of war or civil disturbance.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|p=13}} It was not a particularly profitable office, notes the economist [[Michael Postan]], and indeed was \"as likely to be a source of loss as gain\" for the appointee, and the King was regularly forced to provide financial inducements to those he wished to take up the post.{{sfn|Postan|1973|p=74}}|group=note}} and received the constableship of [[Exeter Castle]].{{Sfn|Storey|1999|p=165}} He also received grants of lands and estates in [[South Teign River|South Teign]], the [[Lydford Castle|castle]], borough and [[manor]] of Lydford, the [[conservancy]] of the [[River Exe]], and [[forestry rights]] in [[Dartmoor]],{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=154}} making him, wrote the historian [[Bertram Wolffe]], \"exalted in the west country\".{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|p=262}} Bonville never took up his seneschalcy as what remained of England's territorial possessions in France were lost at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in July 1453.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} King Henry\u2014now in Exeter\u2014appointed Bonville to a large commission of [[oyer and terminer]] to investigate sympathy for York's rebellion in the area, and the King made him a gift of \u00a350.{{Sfn|Wolffe|1981|pp=259\u2013260}}\n\n=== Henry's illness and Yorkist government ===\n[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=map showing location of the Clyst battlefield in Devon|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]In August 1453, King Henry suffered a period of illness and mental collapse during which he was unable to respond to people or stimulus. He was, therefore, unable to carry out his royal duties. The Lancastrian regime, already weakened by factionalism, was paralysed,{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=715}} and the national political scene became increasingly tense. Bonville attended a council at Westminster in early 1454. This, a [[Paston Letters|Paston]] correspondent reported, was only after he had \"maken all the puissance they can and may to come hider [to Westminster] with theym\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=723}} It was rumoured that Bonville was planning to join up with other lords\u2014those of Beaumont, Poynings, Clifford and Egremont\u2014and march on London itself, although in the event this did not occur.{{Sfn|Jacob|1993|p=508}}{{Refn|In other words, it was rumoured that Bonville ordered the gathering of the largest force of men (a ''puissaunce''{{sfn|MED|2014a}}) that he could, and that having done so, he brought them (''hider''{{sfn|MED|2014b}}) to Westminster with him; from a letter of 19 January 1454 from John Studley to John Paston.{{sfn|Gairdner|1986|p=299}}|group=note}} Everyone, including Bonville, was preparing for war on a national scale.{{Sfn|Tuck|1999|p=271}}\n\nThe [[House of Lords]] eventually appointed the Duke of York as [[Lord Protector|protector]] of the realm during the King's incapacitation, and York appointed Salisbury [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]]. Although Courtenay was nominally York's ally, the Earl did not see any major benefits from this relationship. (York's other allies, argues John Watts, the Nevilles, received York's assistance in their on-going feud with the Percies in Yorkshire.) Bonville experienced no lessening of his position during the protectorate;{{Sfn|Watts|1996|pp=324 + n.274, 338 n.328}} indeed, he had committed flagrant acts of piracy against foreign shipping off the southwest coast, which went unpunished. The most prominent victims of Bonville's actions were the Duke of Burgundy's merchants; Burgundy was England's ally on the continent, a position which Bonville's ships endangered.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=151}}\n\n=== Battle of St Albans and Bonville's ascendancy ===\nIn early 1455 King Henry made a sudden recovery. York and Salisbury were removed from their positions in government and retired to their estates. National politics, already heavily partisan, was tense. The King summoned a great council to be held in Leicester in May. Several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was poisoning the King's mind against York.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} He and the Nevilles may have feared imminent arrest. In any case, they reacted swiftly and with violence. They ambushed the King's small army at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] on the 22nd in a [[pre-emptive strike]]. Courtenay fought for the King and was wounded.{{Sfn|Roskell|1954|p=155}} Bonville may also have been sympathetic to the royal cause, as one of his [[pursuivant]]s was used as a messenger by the King's councillors. He did not join the royal army, however.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Michael Hicks has suggested that both Bonville and Courtenay were more interested in prosecuting their own feud than the national one.{{Sfn|Hicks|1998|p=94}} King Henry had been captured by the Yorkists after the battle: once again they controlled the government.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although clearly unwilling to turn against his King at this point,{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=59}} Bonville did attend the Yorkist parliament of September 1455, where he voted in favour of the Duke of York's appointment as protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1984|p=78}} Bonville was appointed to the parliamentary committee set up to improve naval defence.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} He also used his local influence to ensure that the vacant [[Bishop of Exeter|Bishopric of Exeter]] was reserved for the Earl of Salisbury's youngest son, [[George Neville (Archbishop)|George Neville]],{{Sfn|Pollard|2000|p=149}} and in November Bonville received a general [[Royal pardon|pardon]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=770 n.202}}\n\nIn the southwest, Bonville and his ally, [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire]] (also at this time very close to the court) were recruiting heavily.{{Sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=36}} They caused a proclamation \"to be cryed at Taunton in Somersetshire that every man that is likely and wole go with theym and serve theym shalle have ''vjd.'' [sixpence] every day as long as he abideth with theym\".{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Bonville's dominance in the southwest forced the Earl of Devon to respond drastically,{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=166}} and at the end of April 1454 Devon brought an armed force of hundreds of men into Exeter in a planned [[ambush]]. The plan failed, but Bonville was prevented from carrying out his duty as a collector of a royal loan.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} Although in the following June both Bonville and Courtenay were instructed by the King to keep the peace\u2014and each bound over for \u00a34,000 to do so\u2014they appear to have continued their war of attrition. Such was the \"anarchic state of affairs\"{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} in Devon following St Albans that the [[Michaelmas term]] judicial sessions that were due to be held in Exeter had to be cancelled. Courtenay went on to terrorise the county with his army and ransacked Bonville's houses.{{sfn|Roskell|Woodger|1993}} This culminated on 23 October 1455 with what has been described as the \"most notorious private crime of the century\",{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=167}} when Courtenay's son\u2014also [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas]]\u2014and a small force of men attacked and brutally murdered one of Bonville's close councillors, the prominent local lawyer [[Nicholas Radford]].{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=168}} Carpenter comments: \"there were other enormities, principally directed against Lord Bonville.

During the war, the company was a major supplier for the U.S. military, producing over a billion dollars worth of steel and aluminum products. In 1944, a record workforce of some 31,000 men and women built a wide variety of items, including aircraft gun turrets, wings, stabilizers, ailerons, tank hulls, bomb and wheel doors for the [[B-29]], to mention only a few.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1973|title=Body by Briggs|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=19|pages=29|via=}}</ref> But by September 1944, when Pietsch signed on, they were already looking ahead to post-war car designs, and efforts were underway to secure contracts for automotive bodies from [[Packard]] and [[Chrysler]], among other companies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Early styling projects assigned to Pietsch included work on the [[Packard]] Clipper as well as some formal limousines on [[Chrysler]] chassis, and \"special sedans,\" some designed specifically for [[Walter P.

In October 1947, with samples of his work in tow, he interviewed successfully and by mid-November of that year, he was working at [[Ford]] as the new assistant head of styling in the Ford studio, working initially in exteriors under the supervision of Adrian Gil Spear. For most U.S. automobile companies, designs for the first two or three postwar years were not much more than facelifts of 1941 and 1942 models. This was certainly true for Ford\u2014efforts in 1946 were nearly all directed toward the first all-new model, which turned out to be the highly successful 1949 Ford.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bridges|first=John|title=Bob Bourke Designs for Studebaker|publisher=J.

Exner had the salesmanship and persuasiveness required to make badly needed changes that would by the mid-1950s bring [[Chrysler]] to the forefront of American automobile design.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Godshall|first=Jeff|date=1975|title=The last DeSoto: Styling by Virgil Exner|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=26|pages=14|via=}}</ref> Now as Director of Styling, Exner set about rebuilding the department, turning it into the talk of the town, not only among Detroit's styling circles but of the entire country. Pietsch played a decisive role in this domestic success as well as in Chrysler's association with Italian auto makers\u2014first, a short-lived relationship with [[Pinin Farina]] in 1950, and then, in the following year, with [[Carrozzeria Ghia]] of [[Turin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|date=1975|title=Thinking ahead: Ghia-Chrysler showcars|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=30|pages=18|via=}}</ref> By 1953, a half a dozen Italian-built Chrysler show-cars had been created. Under these ideal working conditions, it's a wonder that Pietsch didn't stay longer with Exner\u2014the potential at [[Chrysler]] for new and exciting things was enormous, but once again the thrill of a new challenge was too great. Responding in early 1952 to an attractive offer from [[Raymond Loewy]], brokered in part by his old friend Bob Koto, he moved from Detroit to [[South Bend, Indiana]], to join [[Raymond Loewy and Associates]], which at the time held the [[Studebaker]] design contract.\n<br />\n[[File:Banshee, two-door coupe, with transparent Plexiglass top, by T.

Shortly thereafter, all kinds of lucrative contracts came his way. By the late 1930s and early 40s, he had sold designs for [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, Pensy railcars and locomotives, [[TWA]] sleeper planes, [[Matson, Inc.|Matson]] ships and large ocean liners, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste tubes, [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric shavers, buildings of all kinds, including supermarkets, and hundreds of other products, not the least of which were [[Studebaker]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1971|title=Before the new wore off: What the \"Stude Graveyard\" cars looked like when new|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=6|pages=13|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Reese|first=Elizabeth|title=Raymond Loewy: Pioneer of American Industrial Design|publisher=Prestel-Verlag|year=1990|isbn=|location=Munich, Germany|pages=39-41}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 31, 1949|title=Up from the Egg|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=54(18)|pages=68-74|via=}}</ref>\n<br />\n[[File:White Speedster, with red underbody, by T.

Pietsch, 1955]]\nWorking for [[Raymond Loewy]] and Associates, which at that time was responsible for all [[Studebaker]] styling, was a unique experience. There were no individual studios set up with all sorts of titles for the designers, just several large rooms located in the old Chippewa Avenue truck plant in [[South Bend]] where [[Studebaker]] had manufactured its aircraft engines and army trucks during the war. The designers had just one boss, Bob Bourke, and his assistant, Bob Koto, and everyone, including Bourke and Koto, wore many hats. They sketched, and modeled in clay; in fact, the emphasis was on modeling. They often worked into the small hours of the morning with no overtime pay. The clay work was new to Pietsch and by his own admission he never became very adept at it because designers in [[Detroit]], where he had received all his prior training, were not involved in modeling. He strongly believed, however, that designers should be skilled at drawing and rendering as well as modeling.\n[[File:Design for a Studebaker, high-speed express truck, by T. W.

Pietsch remembers management complaining about how European styling ruined [[Studebaker]], but it was, in his opinion, all misplaced condemnation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=165}}</ref>\n\nThings were so bad by late 1953 that discussion turned to the idea of teaming up with another car company, and by the following June, with sales for 1954 worse than ever, a merger with [[Packard]] was approved.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=72}}</ref> The new [[Studebaker-Packard]] management decided to sever the expensive relationship with [[Loewy]] and Associates, thinking that their own in-house styling team should be given full control of [[Studebaker]] design efforts.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=81}}</ref> Thus, in early 1955, the contract with [[Raymond Loewy]], which had existed since 1938, was not renewed, and Pietsch, along with everyone else, was given the option of staying with [[Loewy]] or switching over to [[Studebaker]] proper. Pietsch decided that the [[Loewy]] situation was much too tenuous and, even as shabby as [[Studebaker]] was at the time, opted to stay with the sinking ship.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Design for a Studebaker, cab-forward, pick-up truck, by T.

Now, for the first time in his career, Pietsch was unable to immediately step into another automotive design job. After several months looking for work in the [[South Bend]] area, he went to [[Chicago]], where he was soon offered a position by the industrial design firm of Dave Chapman, Incorporated. Commuting weekly by train between [[South Bend]] and [[Chicago]], he was responsible for the account of a department of [[Montgomery Ward]] and Company, which included, among other things, the design of water heaters, water softeners, water pumps, furnaces, air-conditioners, incinerators, and ventilating fans. He also did considerable work on the design of boats, outboard motors, and radios.\n[[File:Sovereign Coupe, black airbrush on red paper, by T. W.

Randal D. Faurot, newly appointed head of styling, called on Pietsch to help rebuild the department, offering him a position as his assistant that he couldn't refuse. In June 1962, however, frustrated and angry over management's abrupt decision to cancel a project that he had worked for many months\u2014the design for an all-new version of the [[Studebaker]] Lark for 1962\u2014Pietsch lost his temper and was fired.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was a tumultuous and abrupt ending to a frustrating, decade-long struggle at [[Studebaker]].\n\n<br />\n==A last Stint at Chrysler, American Motors, and Retirement: 1962\u20131972==\nOnce again out of work, Pietsch wrote on July 2, 1962, to his old friend Cliff Voss in [[Detroit]], one of \"Exner's boys,\" with whom he had worked at [[Chrysler]] back in the early 1950s. Within a few weeks, Pietsch was back for a third and final hitch with the [[Chrysler Corporation]], but these turned out to be unhappy years. [[Chrysler]] was by now a completely different place. There was no longer the camaraderie and warm atmosphere that had been there before. The studios were now segregated and the old feeling of team effort, along with most of his old friends, was gone. Styling had become a big well-structured and impersonal organization much like the situation at [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]].\n<br />\n[[File:Lynx, two-seater convertible, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969.jpg|left|thumb|Lynx, Two-seater Convertible, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969]]\nAdding to the disappointment, Pietsch was assigned from the start to \"interiors,\" which meant dashboards\u2014sketches and more sketches of instruments and instrument panels, reminiscent of the work that had \"bored him to death\" back at [[Ford]] in the late 1940s. Soon this narrowed down to nothing but \"ornamentation,\" in which he was obliged to spend all his time designing nameplates, lettering, and the configuration of numerals on speedometers, tachometers, and other instruments, all extremely tedious work. But he stuck with it for seven and a half years, exclaiming later that he didn't know how he managed to do it for so long.\n[[File:Mercedes Benz Model S Roadster, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969.jpg|left|thumb|Mercedes Benz Model S Roadster, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969]]\n\nIn February 1970, Pietsch was caught one last time in one of the many [[Chrysler]] lay-offs, but, lucky once again, he got a call a short time later from [[American Motors]], asking if he'd like to go to work for [[Jeep]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foster|first=P.R.|title=The Story of Jeep, 2nd edition|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2004|isbn=|location=Lola, Wisconsin|pages=132}}</ref> But before Pietsch realized it, he was right back where he had been at [[Chrysler]] the year before, \"doing mostly calibrations of the numerals on dashboard instruments.\" That his graphics were used without change on the instrument panels of the '72 and '73 [[Jeep Wagoneer]] provided little satisfaction. There was nothing about the [[Jeep]] line that interested him. Although he did his best every day to appear enthusiastic, Pietsch was so bored at work that he \"could hardly see straight,\" and he worried also that his health was beginning to fail. In February 1972, after only two years with Jeep, he decided to retire.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Theodore Wells Pietsch II, working at home, Highland Park, Michigan, 1938.jpg|thumb|Theodore Wells Pietsch II, working at home, Highland Park, Michigan, 1938]]\n<br />\n==Personal life==\nOn June 24, 1938, Pietsch married Louise Mary Shamlian (December 1, 1914, Watertown, Massachusetts \u2212 January 15, 1987, Seal Beach, California), with whom he had three children: Priscilla Esther Pietsch, born December 22, 1941; [[Theodore Wells Pietsch III]], March 6, 1945; and Louise Jean Pietsch May 11, 1948.

During the war, the company was a major supplier for the U.S. military, producing over a billion dollars worth of steel and aluminum products. In 1944, a record workforce of some 31,000 men and women built a wide variety of items, including aircraft gun turrets, wings, stabilizers, ailerons, tank hulls, bomb and wheel doors for the [[B-29]], to mention only a few.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1973|title=Body by Briggs|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=19|pages=29|via=}}</ref> But by September 1944, when Pietsch signed on, they were already looking ahead to post-war car designs, and efforts were underway to secure contracts for automotive bodies from [[Packard]] and [[Chrysler]], among other companies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Early styling projects assigned to Pietsch included work on the [[Packard]] Clipper as well as some formal limousines on [[Chrysler]] chassis, and \"special sedans,\" some designed specifically for [[Walter P.

For most U.S. automobile companies, designs for the first two or three postwar years were not much more than facelifts of 1941 and 1942 models. This was certainly true for Ford\u2014efforts in 1946 were nearly all directed toward the first all-new model, which turned out to be the highly successful 1949 Ford.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bridges|first=John|title=Bob Bourke Designs for Studebaker|publisher=J.

Pietsch played a decisive role in this domestic success as well as in Chrysler's association with Italian auto makers\u2014first, a short-lived relationship with [[Pinin Farina]] in 1950, and then, in the following year, with [[Carrozzeria Ghia]] of [[Turin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|date=1975|title=Thinking ahead: Ghia-Chrysler showcars|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=30|pages=18|via=}}</ref> By 1953, a half a dozen Italian-built Chrysler show-cars had been created. Under these ideal working conditions, it's a wonder that Pietsch didn't stay longer with Exner\u2014the potential at [[Chrysler]] for new and exciting things was enormous, but once again the thrill of a new challenge was too great. Responding in early 1952 to an attractive offer from [[Raymond Loewy]], brokered in part by his old friend Bob Koto, he moved from Detroit to [[South Bend, Indiana]], to join [[Raymond Loewy and Associates]], which at the time held the [[Studebaker]] design contract.\n<br />\n[[File:Banshee, two-door coupe, with transparent Plexiglass top, by T.

Shortly thereafter, all kinds of lucrative contracts came his way. By the late 1930s and early 40s, he had sold designs for [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, Pensy railcars and locomotives, [[TWA]] sleeper planes, [[Matson, Inc.|Matson]] ships and large ocean liners, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste tubes, [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric shavers, buildings of all kinds, including supermarkets, and hundreds of other products, not the least of which were [[Studebaker]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1971|title=Before the new wore off: What the \"Stude Graveyard\" cars looked like when new|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=6|pages=13|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Reese|first=Elizabeth|title=Raymond Loewy: Pioneer of American Industrial Design|publisher=Prestel-Verlag|year=1990|isbn=|location=Munich, Germany|pages=39-41}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 31, 1949|title=Up from the Egg|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=54(18)|pages=68-74|via=}}</ref>\n<br />\n[[File:White Speedster, with red underbody, by T.

There were no individual studios set up with all sorts of titles for the designers, just several large rooms located in the old Chippewa Avenue truck plant in [[South Bend]] where [[Studebaker]] had manufactured its aircraft engines and army trucks during the war. The designers had just one boss, Bob Bourke, and his assistant, Bob Koto, and everyone, including Bourke and Koto, wore many hats. They sketched, and modeled in clay; in fact, the emphasis was on modeling. They often worked into the small hours of the morning with no overtime pay. The clay work was new to Pietsch and by his own admission he never became very adept at it because designers in [[Detroit]], where he had received all his prior training, were not involved in modeling. He strongly believed, however, that designers should be skilled at drawing and rendering as well as modeling.\n[[File:Design for a Studebaker, high-speed express truck, by T. W.

Now, for the first time in his career, Pietsch was unable to immediately step into another automotive design job. After several months looking for work in the [[South Bend]] area, he went to [[Chicago]], where he was soon offered a position by the industrial design firm of Dave Chapman, Incorporated. Commuting weekly by train between [[South Bend]] and [[Chicago]], he was responsible for the account of a department of [[Montgomery Ward]] and Company, which included, among other things, the design of water heaters, water softeners, water pumps, furnaces, air-conditioners, incinerators, and ventilating fans. He also did considerable work on the design of boats, outboard motors, and radios.\n[[File:Sovereign Coupe, black airbrush on red paper, by T. W.

Randal D. Faurot, newly appointed head of styling, called on Pietsch to help rebuild the department, offering him a position as his assistant that he couldn't refuse. In June 1962, however, frustrated and angry over management's abrupt decision to cancel a project that he had worked for many months\u2014the design for an all-new version of the [[Studebaker]] Lark for 1962\u2014Pietsch lost his temper and was fired.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was a tumultuous and abrupt ending to a frustrating, decade-long struggle at [[Studebaker]].\n\n==A last Stint at Chrysler, American Motors, and Retirement: 1962\u20131972==\nOnce again out of work, Pietsch wrote on July 2, 1962, to his old friend Cliff Voss in [[Detroit]], one of \"Exner's boys,\" with whom he had worked at [[Chrysler]] back in the early 1950s. Within a few weeks, Pietsch was back for a third and final hitch with the [[Chrysler Corporation]], but these turned out to be unhappy years. [[Chrysler]] was by now a completely different place. There was no longer the camaraderie and warm atmosphere that had been there before. The studios were now segregated and the old feeling of team effort, along with most of his old friends, was gone. Styling had become a big well-structured and impersonal organization much like the situation at [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]].\n<br />\n[[File:Lynx, two-seater convertible, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969.jpg|left|thumb|Lynx, Two-seater Convertible, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969]]\nAdding to the disappointment, Pietsch was assigned from the start to \"interiors,\" which meant dashboards\u2014sketches and more sketches of instruments and instrument panels, reminiscent of the work that had \"bored him to death\" back at [[Ford]] in the late 1940s. Soon this narrowed down to nothing but \"ornamentation,\" in which he was obliged to spend all his time designing nameplates, lettering, and the configuration of numerals on speedometers, tachometers, and other instruments, all extremely tedious work. But he stuck with it for seven and a half years, exclaiming later that he didn't know how he managed to do it for so long.\n[[File:Mercedes Benz Model S Roadster, by T. W.

There was nothing about the [[Jeep]] line that interested him. Although he did his best every day to appear enthusiastic, Pietsch was so bored at work that he \"could hardly see straight,\" and he worried also that his health was beginning to fail. In February 1972, after only two years with Jeep, he decided to retire.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Theodore Wells Pietsch II, working at home, Highland Park, Michigan, 1938.jpg|thumb|Theodore Wells Pietsch II, working at home, Highland Park, Michigan, 1938]]\n<br />\n==Personal life==\nOn June 24, 1938, Pietsch married Louise Mary Shamlian (December 1, 1914, Watertown, Massachusetts \u2212 January 15, 1987, Seal Beach, California), with whom he had three children: Priscilla Esther Pietsch, born December 22, 1941; [[Theodore Wells Pietsch III]], March 6, 1945; and Louise Jean Pietsch May 11, 1948.
