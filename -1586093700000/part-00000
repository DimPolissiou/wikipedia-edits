Hal meets and eventually marries a mean woman named Fiona. When the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] strikes, Hal is killed. As he supposedly left no will, Fiona receives all of his belongings, including the diner. Eight years later, Sam is employed at the diner and tormented by Fiona and her two daughters, Brianna and Gabriella who think they are more poular than they are. Sam struggles to fit in at North Valley High School, where head cheerleader Shelby Cummings calls her names such as \"Diner Girl.\" Sam confides in her online [[pen pal]] \"Nomad,\" who shares her dream to attend [[Princeton University]]. \"Nomad\"'s true identity is Austin Ames, the popular - yet unhappy - quarterback of the school's football team and Shelby's reluctant boyfriend; he attempts to break up with Shelby who \"chooses to ignore that\". \"Nomad\" proposes that they meet in person at the school's [[Halloween]] dance. Initially reluctant, Sam is convinced by her friend Carter Farrell  to go to the dance and meet her mysterious online friend.\n\nOn the night of the dance, Fiona forces Sam to work the night shift at the diner, then leaves to drive Brianna and Gabriella to the dance. Carter and Rhonda, Sam's amiable co-worker at the diner, take Sam to find a costume for the dance. Sam, wearing a mask, meets \"Nomad\" at the dance, and is surprised to learn that he is Austin. After sharing a romantic dance together, Sam's cell phone alarm goes off, warning her to return to the diner before Fiona comes back at midnight. She leaves without revealing her identity to Austin, and drops her phone on her way out. Austin picks it up and begins a search to figure out who his \"Cinderella\" really is.\n\nLater, Brianna and Gabriella discover Sam's emails to Austin and realize that Sam is Cinderella. They later present them to Shelby and convince her that Sam persuaded him to leave Shelby to be with her. To retaliate, Shelby, Brianna and Gabriella perform a mean-spirited skit at a school pep rally where the emails are read aloud and Sam's identity is revealed to Austin. Sam, who (like Austin) had been accpeted to Princeton University, is then duped by Fiona into believing she was rejected so Fiona can keep her working as her slave. Shortly after, frustrated with Fiona's persistent emotional abuse and her schoolwide humiliation, Sam quits her job at the diner and moves out to live with Rhonda.\n\nBefore a school football game, Sam confronts Austin about his cowardice and lies. Before the final play of the game, he sees Sam making leaving the stands and runs to apologize to her. She accepts his apology and they share a kiss as rain falls over the drought-plagued valley. Soon after, Sam finds Hal's will hidden in her childhood fairytale book, which stated that all of his belongings would go to her. Sam sells her stepfamily's fancy cars so that she can pay for college, and Fiona, who signed the will as a witness, is arrested. Fiona and her daughters are made to work at the diner, which is restored to the way it was before Hal's death by its new owners, Sam and Rhonda.

It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.\n\n===Early estimates ===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year.

Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).<ref>In \"Mind Children\" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997, <{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}> Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.</ref> (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]\" \u2013  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.\n\n===Modelling the neurons in more detail===\nThe [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.<ref name=\"Discover2011JanFeb\">{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia\u2014the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071350/http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|archive-date=8 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Current research===\nThere are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures.

His results do not depend on the number of glial cells, nor on what kinds of processing neurons perform where.\n\nThe actual complexity of modeling biological neurons has been explored in [[OpenWorm|OpenWorm project]] that was aimed on complete simulation of a worm that has only 302 neurons in its neural network (among about 1000 cells in total). The animal's neural network has been well documented before the start of the project. However, although the task seemed simple at the beginning, the models based on a generic neural network did not work. Currently, the efforts are focused on precise emulation of biological neurons (partly on the molecular level), but the result cannot be called a total success yet. Even if the number of issues to be solved in a human-brain-scale model is not proportional to the number of neurons, the amount of work along this path is obvious.\n\n===Criticisms of simulation-based approaches===\nA fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Vega|Glenberg|Graesser|2008}}. A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree</ref> If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body). Goertzel{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} proposes virtual embodiment (like in ''[[Second Life]]''), but it is not yet known whether this would be sufficient.\n\nDesktop computers using microprocessors capable of more than 10<sup>9</sup> cps (Kurzweil's non-standard unit \"computations per second\", see above) have been available since 2005.

(The word \"mind\" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in \"the [[mind body problem]]\" or \"the [[philosophy of mind]]\".)\n* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.\nThe first one is called \"the ''strong'' AI hypothesis\" and the second is \"the ''weak'' AI hypothesis\" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the \"strong AI hypothesis\" as \"strong AI\". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.<ref>For example:\n* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203103022/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html |date=3 December 2007 }} (quoted in \"High Beam Encyclopedia\"),\n* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074502/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html |date=19 July 2008 }} (quoted in \"AITopics\")\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919012830/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html |date=19 September 2007 }}\n* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031753/http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm |date=13 May 2008 }} Anthony Tongen</ref>\n\nThe weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\nIn contrast to Searle, [[Ray Kurzweil]] uses the term \"strong AI\" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,<ref name=K/> regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.\nIn science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to Searle, it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. \"Strong AI\" (as defined above by Kurzweil) should not be confused with Searle's \"[[strong AI hypothesis]].\" The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.\n\n===Consciousness===\nThere are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].<ref>Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}</ref>\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. As such, preliminary work has been conducted on approaches to integrating full ethical agents with existing legal and social frameworks. These approaches have focused on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sotala|first=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | journal=Wired |date=April 2000 }}</ref> It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].\n\n==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==\n{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}\n\nSince the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nWhile most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] who deny the possibility of achieving strong AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}\n\nConceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: \"the framework starts from Weizenbaum's observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts\".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nFurthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do ([[Moravec's paradox]]).{{Examples|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}\n\nThe problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nOther possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers in emulating the function of the human brain in computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously, people can then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nClocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}\n\nThe practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}\n\nA possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.\n\nThere have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, \"No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.\"{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Kaplan Andreas and Haelein Michael (2019) Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

The most notable AI researcher to endorse the thesis is [[Stuart J. Russell]]. Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states he \"can't understand why some people are not concerned\",<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong. If a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, 'We'll arrive in a few decades,' would we just reply, 'OK, call us when you get here{{endash}}we'll leave the lights on?' Probably not{{endash}}but this is more or less what is happening with AI.'<ref name=\"hawking editorial\">{{cite news |title=Stephen Hawking: 'Transcendence looks at the implications of artificial intelligence&nbsp;\u2013 but are we taking AI seriously enough?' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-transcendence-looks-at-the-implications-of-artificial-intelligence--but-are-we-taking-ai-seriously-enough-9313474.html |accessdate=3 December 2014 |publisher=[[The Independent (UK)]]}}</ref>}}\n\nMany of the scholars who are concerned about existential risk believe that the best way forward would be to conduct (possibly massive) research into solving the difficult \"[[AI control problem|control problem]]\" to answer the question: what types of safeguards, algorithms, or architectures can programmers implement to maximize the probability that their recursively-improving AI would continue to behave in a friendly, rather than destructive, manner after it reaches superintelligence?<ref name=\"superintelligence\" >{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|author-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|isbn=978-0199678112|edition=First|quote=|title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies}}<!-- preface --></ref><ref name=\"physica_scripta\" >{{cite journal|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=[[Physica Scripta]]|date=19 December 2014|volume=90|issue=1|author1=Kaj Sotala|author2-link=Roman Yampolskiy|author2=Roman Yampolskiy}}</ref>\n\nThe thesis that AI can pose existential risk also has many strong detractors. Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is \"an illusion\" and a \"stupendous con\" by the wealthy.<ref name=\"atlantic-but-what\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |magazine=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term: computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the [[technological singularity]]. [[Gordon Moore]], the original proponent of [[Moore's Law]], declares that \"I am a skeptic. I don't believe (a technological singularity) is likely to happen, at least for a long time. And I don't know why I feel that way.\" [[Baidu]] Vice President [[Andrew Ng]] states AI existential risk is \"like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet

MIT presented a course in AGI in 2018, organized by Lex Fridman and featuring a number of guest lecturers. However, as yet, most AI researchers have devoted little attention to AGI, with some claiming that intelligence is too complex to be completely replicated in the near term. However, a small number of computer scientists are active in AGI research, and many of this group are contributing to a series of [[Conference on Artificial General Intelligence|AGI conferences]]. The research is extremely diverse and often pioneering in nature. In the introduction to his book,{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} Goertzel says that estimates of the time needed before a truly flexible AGI is built vary from 10 years to over a century, but the consensus in the AGI research community seems to be that the timeline discussed by [[Ray Kurzweil]] in ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''<ref name=\"K\">{{Harv|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} or see [http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html Advanced Human Intelligence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630032301/http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html |date=30 June 2011 }} where he defines strong AI as \"machine intelligence with the full range of human intelligence.\"</ref> (i.e. between 2015 and 2045) is plausible.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nHowever, most mainstream AI researchers doubt that progress will be this rapid.{{citation_needed|date=January 2017}} Organizations explicitly pursuing AGI include the Swiss AI lab [[IDSIA]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nnaisense,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=When A.I.

It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.\n\n===Early estimates ===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year.

Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).<ref>In \"Mind Children\" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997, <{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}> Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.</ref> (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]\" \u2013  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.\n\n===Modelling the neurons in more detail===\nThe [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.<ref name=\"Discover2011JanFeb\">{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia\u2014the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071350/http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|archive-date=8 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Current research===\nThere are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures.

His results do not depend on the number of glial cells, nor on what kinds of processing neurons perform where.\n\nThe actual complexity of modeling biological neurons has been explored in [[OpenWorm|OpenWorm project]] that was aimed on complete simulation of a worm that has only 302 neurons in its neural network (among about 1000 cells in total). The animal's neural network has been well documented before the start of the project. However, although the task seemed simple at the beginning, the models based on a generic neural network did not work. Currently, the efforts are focused on precise emulation of biological neurons (partly on the molecular level), but the result cannot be called a total success yet. Even if the number of issues to be solved in a human-brain-scale model is not proportional to the number of neurons, the amount of work along this path is obvious.\n\n===Criticisms of simulation-based approaches===\nA fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Vega|Glenberg|Graesser|2008}}. A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree</ref> If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body). Goertzel{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} proposes virtual embodiment (like in ''[[Second Life]]''), but it is not yet known whether this would be sufficient.\n\nDesktop computers using microprocessors capable of more than 10<sup>9</sup> cps (Kurzweil's non-standard unit \"computations per second\", see above) have been available since 2005.

(The word \"mind\" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in \"the [[mind body problem]]\" or \"the [[philosophy of mind]]\".)\n* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.\nThe first one is called \"the ''strong'' AI hypothesis\" and the second is \"the ''weak'' AI hypothesis\" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the \"strong AI hypothesis\" as \"strong AI\". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.<ref>For example:\n* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203103022/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html |date=3 December 2007 }} (quoted in \"High Beam Encyclopedia\"),\n* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074502/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html |date=19 July 2008 }} (quoted in \"AITopics\")\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919012830/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html |date=19 September 2007 }}\n* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031753/http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm |date=13 May 2008 }} Anthony Tongen</ref>\n\nThe weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\nIn contrast to Searle, [[Ray Kurzweil]] uses the term \"strong AI\" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,<ref name=K/> regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.\nIn science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to Searle, it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. \"Strong AI\" (as defined above by Kurzweil) should not be confused with Searle's \"[[strong AI hypothesis]].\" The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.\n\n===Consciousness===\nThere are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].<ref>Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}</ref>\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. As such, preliminary work has been conducted on approaches to integrating full ethical agents with existing legal and social frameworks. These approaches have focused on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sotala|first=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | journal=Wired |date=April 2000 }}</ref> It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].\n\n==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==\n{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}\n\nSince the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nWhile most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] who deny the possibility of achieving strong AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}\n\nConceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: \"the framework starts from Weizenbaum's observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts\".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nFurthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do ([[Moravec's paradox]]).{{Examples|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}\n\nThe problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nOther possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers in emulating the function of the human brain in computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously, people can then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nClocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}\n\nThe practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}\n\nA possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.\n\nThere have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, \"No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.\"{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Kaplan Andreas and Haelein Michael (2019) Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

The most notable AI researcher to endorse the thesis is [[Stuart J. Russell]]. Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states he \"can't understand why some people are not concerned\",<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong. If a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, 'We'll arrive in a few decades,' would we just reply, 'OK, call us when you get here{{endash}}we'll leave the lights on?' Probably not{{endash}}but this is more or less what is happening with AI.'<ref name=\"hawking editorial\">{{cite news |title=Stephen Hawking: 'Transcendence looks at the implications of artificial intelligence&nbsp;\u2013 but are we taking AI seriously enough?' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-transcendence-looks-at-the-implications-of-artificial-intelligence--but-are-we-taking-ai-seriously-enough-9313474.html |accessdate=3 December 2014 |publisher=[[The Independent (UK)]]}}</ref>}}\n\nMany of the scholars who are concerned about existential risk believe that the best way forward would be to conduct (possibly massive) research into solving the difficult \"[[AI control problem|control problem]]\" to answer the question: what types of safeguards, algorithms, or architectures can programmers implement to maximize the probability that their recursively-improving AI would continue to behave in a friendly, rather than destructive, manner after it reaches superintelligence?<ref name=\"superintelligence\" >{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|author-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|isbn=978-0199678112|edition=First|quote=|title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies}}<!-- preface --></ref><ref name=\"physica_scripta\" >{{cite journal|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=[[Physica Scripta]]|date=19 December 2014|volume=90|issue=1|author1=Kaj Sotala|author2-link=Roman Yampolskiy|author2=Roman Yampolskiy}}</ref>\n\nThe thesis that AI can pose existential risk also has many strong detractors. Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is \"an illusion\" and a \"stupendous con\" by the wealthy.<ref name=\"atlantic-but-what\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |magazine=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term: computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the [[technological singularity]]. [[Gordon Moore]], the original proponent of [[Moore's Law]], declares that \"I am a skeptic. I don't believe (a technological singularity) is likely to happen, at least for a long time. And I don't know why I feel that way.\" [[Baidu]] Vice President [[Andrew Ng]] states AI existential risk is \"like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet
