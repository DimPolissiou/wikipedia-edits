On September 5, the rookie defeated [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]] in Baltimore. On the October 24 episode of Power Pro Wrestling he became involved in his first televised angle when he was attacked by Tiger Conway Jr. and Shaska Whatley in an interview.\n\nHe remained undefeated in singles actions until finally losing to Ivan Koloff on a house show at the Omni in Atlanta on February 14, 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/jcp88.htm |title= JCP 88 |accessdate=September 6, 2019 |website=The History of WWE}}</ref> Simmons was dominant through the first half of the year against lower level competition on house shows, including Whatley and [[The Terminator (wrestler)|The Terminator]]. Simmons teamed with [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] at the 3rd Annual Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup in Greenville, South Carolina on April 22, 1988. They were defeated in the opening round by [[Mike Rotunda]] and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] when Simmons was hit with a foreign object. In December, he finally entered the first sustained losing streak of his career as he dropped multiple house show matches to Mike Rotunda.\n\n==== Doom (1989&ndash;1991) ====\n{{main|Doom (professional wrestling)|l1=Doom}}\nSoon after, in March 1989, Simmons began showing signs of a heel turn as he got more aggressive in his matches, including a non-title match against fellow babyface, then-[[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]] and a match on the April 29, 1989 episode of World Championship Wrestling, where he broke the rules during what was supposed to be a face vs. face match against [[Junkyard Dog]].  Simmons won the match when the referee, Ron's future manager [[Theodore Long|Teddy Long]] made a fast count (Long was fired (kayfabe) as referee by [[Jim Herd]] immediately following this match).  He completed his heel turn on the May 27 episode of World Championship Wrestling during a tag team match, where he teamed with [[Ranger Ross]] against the [[The Headshrinkers|Samoan Swat Team]] as part of a tournament for the vacant [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag Team Championship]], leaving him in the ring alone when Long came out. Simmons later teamed up with [[Butch Reed]] to form [[Doom (professional wrestling)|Doom]]. In the beginning, the members of Doom were masked and only known as Doom #1 and Doom #2, managed by [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]]. In their [[pay-per-view]] debut at [[Halloween Havoc 1989]], Doom defeated [[The Steiner Brothers]]. In the \"Iron Team Tournament\" at [[Starrcade (1989)|Starrcade 1989]], Doom finished fourth, losing all three of their matches. Doom's misfortune continued as Woman soon dropped the team to manage [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]]. Then on February 6, 1990, at [[Clash of the Champions X]], Doom hit rock bottom when they were defeated by Rick and Scott Steiner and as a result of the stipulation were forced to unmask.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#X |title=NWA Clash of the Champions Results (X) |accessdate=April 9, 2007 |publisher=prowrestlinghistory.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623095650/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html |archivedate=June 23, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWith new manager Long, they rebounded and defeated [[The Steiner Brothers]] for the NWA World Tag Team Championship at [[Capital Combat]] in 1990.  They held the title for nine months, defeating teams like [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] and [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuding]] with [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]]. Among their most memorable encounters during their title reign was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|street fight]] against Horsemen [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Barry Windham]] at [[Starrcade (1990)|Starrcade 1990]] which ended in a no-contest when Windham pinned Simmons while Reed simultaneously pinned Anderson. Doom were recognized as the first holders of the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] in January 1991, finally losing the titles to [[The Fabulous Freebirds|The Freebirds]] at [[WrestleWar (1991)|WrestleWar]] in February 1991. Subsequently, Doom broke up, with Simmons turning face and feuding with Reed, defeating him in a [[cage match]] at the very first [[SuperBrawl I|SuperBrawl]]. Simmons defeated midcarders including [[Kevin Nash|Oz]] and [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|The Diamond Studd]], then unsuccessfully challenged [[Lex Luger]] for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[Halloween Havoc 1991|Halloween Havoc]], losing the [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|best-of-three-falls match]] one fall to two.\n\n==== World Heavyweight Champion (1992) ====\nSimmons spent the first half of 1992 feuding with [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], whom he defeated via pinfall at [[SuperBrawl II]].

He continued to feud with [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], with Jack bringing in [[Sione Vailahi|The Barbarian]] to challenge Simmons at [[Halloween Havoc 1992|Halloween Havoc]]. At [[Starrcade 1992|Starrcade]], Simmons was scheduled to wrestle [[Rick Rude]], but due to Rude being injured he faced [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]] instead, wrestling to a double [[countout]] that was changed to a [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] win for Simmons when Williams attacked him after the match. His title reign ended two days later on December 30, 1992, when Vader defeated him to regain the title.\n\n==== Final years (1993&ndash;1994) ====\nAfterwards, Simmons was relegated to mid-card status, eventually becoming a bitter heel who felt like the fans abandoned him after he lost the championship. Simmons unsuccessfully challenged [[Dustin Rhodes]] for the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Championship]] and [[Paul Orndorff]] for the [[WCW World Television Championship|World Television Championship]] during his last months with [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]. In the spring of 1994, Simmons was working for WCW without being signed to a contract, also Simmons was briefly managed by Sherri Martel during this time. Simmons competed in the European Cup Tournament, winning his 1st round match against Marcus Bagwell but lost the next round to Sting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrestlingforum.com/classic-wrestling/2001906-wrestling-observer-1994-a.html|title=Wrestling Observer 1994 - Wrestling Forum: WWE, AEW, New Japan, Indy Wrestling, Women of Wrestling Forums|website=www.wrestlingforum.com}}</ref> He would go on to feud with Sting and Bagwell, mostly competing in tag matches. His final match was a win over [[Scott Armstrong (wrestler)|Scott Armstrong]] on the September 10, 1994 edition of WCW Worldwide.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw94.htm</ref>\n\n===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994\u20131995)===\nSimmons appeared in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) from late 1994 to early 1995. During that time he unsuccessfully challenged [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Shane Douglas]] at [[November to Remember 1994|November to Remember]] and had matches with [[Mikey Whipwreck]] and [[911 (wrestler)|911]].\n\n===World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment===\n====Nation of Domination (1996\u20131998)====\n{{Main|The Nation of Domination}}\nAfter ECW, Simmons joined the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) and made his debut on the July 22, 1996, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. His first [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] was that of Faarooq Asad, a [[gladiator]] who wore a black and blue gladiator outfit with a misshaped helmet and was managed by [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]]. Simmons started his first [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Ahmed Johnson]] before shortening his ring name to Faarooq. The feud was started when Faarooq attacked Ahmed during a tag team match pitting Johnson and Shawn Michaels against the Smoking Gunns. As a result of the injuries sustained, Johnson vacated the Intercontinental title. In the subsequent tournament, Faarooq lost in finals to [[Marc Mero]]. Faarooq dropped his gladiator gimmick, parted ways with [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]] and formed the [[Nation of Domination]] (NOD), a [[Professional wrestling stable|stable]] loosely based on the [[Nation of Islam]]{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} and the [[Black Panther Party]]{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}, although the members of the stable were not exclusively [[African Americans|African American]]. They mostly feuded with [[Anthony Norris|Ahmed Johnson]]. At the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|Royal Rumble 1997]], Faarooq defeated Johnson by disqualification. In the [[Royal Rumble]] match, Johnson eliminated himself when he saw Faarooq in the aisle and chased after him. Later in the same match Faarooq was eliminated when Johnson returned and attacked him with a 2x4. At [[WrestleMania 13]] Johnson recruited the [[The Road Warriors|Legion of Doom]] in a winning effort against the entire Nation in a Chicago Street Fight.\n\nAfter losing to [[WWE Championship|WWF World Champion]], The Undertaker, at the 1997 King of the Ring, Faarooq blamed [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]] and [[Savio Vega]] for his loss and threw them out of the NOD. Both formed their rival factions, known respectively as [[The Disciples of Apocalypse]] and [[Los Boricuas]], and Faarooq recruited more African American members for the Nation, including half-Samoan [[Dwayne Johnson|Rocky Maivia]]. The three stables feuded with one another throughout 1997. In the Summer of 1997 Faarooq again lost a tournament final for the Intercontinental title, this time to Owen Hart after Stone Cold Steve Austin interfered. Austin, who had forfeited the title due an injury inflicted by Hart, wanted Hart to win so he could again beat him for the title.\n\nIn early 1998, Faarooq's leadership of the NOD was increasingly challenged by Maivia, who had shortened his name to The Rock and felt he should be the leader as he was now Intercontinental Champion. In the Royal Rumble match, all five NOD members were in the ring at the same time and frequently brawled with each other, Faarooq even eliminating his fellow members D'lo Brown and Mark Henry; he was one of the final three along with the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Faarooq wanted the Rock to help him eliminate Austin but the Rock refused and eliminated Faarooq. The following month at [[No Way Out of Texas: In Your House|No Way Out]], the Nation of Domination lost a 10-man tag to Ken Shamrock, Ahmed Johnson, Chainz, [[The Harris Brothers|Skull and 8 ball]] when Rock submitted to an ankle lock by Shamrock. After the match Faarooq and Rock almost came to blows. At [[Wrestlemania XIV]], Faarooq and Kama were unsuccessful in the tag team battle royal. Later in the evening, Faarooq was the only NOD member absent from Rock's title defense against Ken Shamrock. When Shamrock put Rock in an ankle lock, Faarooq ran down to the ring but decided against helping him and walked off, with the crowd cheering his decision. The following night on ''RAW'', Rock assumed leadership of the NOD and kicked Faarooq out of the group. Faarooq spent the next several months feuding with his former stablemates.\n\n====Acolytes/APA (1998\u20132004)====\n{{Main|The Acolytes Protection Agency}}\nAfter being dumped from the Nation, Faarooq feuded with the Rock but failed to win the Intercontinental title. Simmons then teamed briefly with [[2 Cold Scorpio]]. In late 1998, Simmons began teaming with [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]] as [[The Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]], a violent tag team sporting occult symbolism on their tights and chests. They were managed by [[Don Callis|The Jackyl]] until he left the WWF, at which point they were reintroduced as members of [[The Ministry of Darkness]] led by [[The Undertaker]]. The Acolytes recruited [[Dennis Knight|Phineas I. Godwinn]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Mabel]] to the Ministry by [[kidnapping]] and [[brainwashing]] them (renaming them Mideon and Viscera, respectively), and feuded with The Undertaker's rivals, such as [[D-Generation X]] and [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]], the latter of which later joined the Ministry as well.\n\nDuring this time the Acolytes had two short reigns as tag team champions; they defeated the team of [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] but lost the title to [[the Hardy Boyz]]. At the [[Fully Loaded (1999)|Fully Loaded]] pay-per-view in 1999, they won the title back in a no disqualification handicap match against the Hardyz and [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]]. Their second reign ended when they lost the title to Kane and X-Pac.\n\nAfter the Undertaker suffered an injury in late 1999, the Ministry of Darkness disbanded. Faarooq and Bradshaw continued to team with one another, and eventually adopted the gimmick of two brawlers who enjoyed drinking beer and smoking cigars. After Bradshaw began hiring out the services of the Acolytes as [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] and [[bodyguard]]s, the tag team was renamed the \"Acolytes Protection Agency\" (APA). Around this time, Faarooq adopted his \"Damn!\" catchphrase. The team won their third tag team title by defeating [[the Dudley Boyz]] in June 2001 but lost the titles the following month to [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] when [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] interfered.\n\nThe APA teamed together until 2002, when Faarooq was [[WWE Draft|drafted]] to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brand. Around this time, Ron Simmons began wrestling under his real name, as the terrorist group [[Al-Qaeda]] had a training camp called Al-Faarooq.<ref name=\"OWW\" /> Simmons had a brief heel run when he teamed with [[D-Von Dudley|Reverend D-Von]] until he left television in December 2002, but in June 2003 he returned to WWE with Bradshaw and the APA reunited.\n\nIn his last [[WWE]] [[Angle (professional wrestling)|storyline]], he was fired by temporary ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' General Manager [[Paul Heyman]] after the APA lost another match for the Tag Team Championship. It was assumed that the APA was fired, but Paul Heyman told Bradshaw he was allowed to stay. Simmons retired from his in-ring career, accusing Bradshaw of not being a faithful friend in storyline. In reality, Simmons, who had been planning to retire due to his health and age and become a backstage agent for the company, was let go the day this [[Angle (professional wrestling)|angle]] aired on ''SmackDown''.\n\n====Sporadic appearances and Hall of Famer (2006\u2013present)====\n[[File:Ron simmons.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Simmons making a promotional appearance for WWE in 2005]]\nIn 2006, during a rebroadcast of the 1981 [[Orange Bowl]] on [[Sun Sports]], Simmons stated that since his retirement from professional wrestling, he would like to continue or even improve his role within [[WWE]]. Starting on October 23, 2006, he began making short cameos on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' to say his catchphrase \"Damn\", often in awe of or shock at odd occurrences.\n\nOn the November 20, 2006 edition of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', Simmons was chosen by [[Ric Flair]] to replace the injured [[Roddy Piper]] at the [[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series]] to take on the [[Spirit Squad]]. He was the first to be eliminated, via countout. On the January 15, 2007 episode of ''Raw'', he was seen in the ring with [[Chris Masters]] in the \"[[Chris Masters#Debut and Master Lock Challenge|Master Lock Challenge]]\", which ended prematurely after interference from [[Super Crazy]]. Simmons's escaping the Master Lock, was not recognized. On the July 27, 2007 edition of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'', Simmons was named the [[Wedding ceremony participants#Best man|best man]] for [[Theodore Long]] and [[Kristal Marshall|Kristal]]'s [[wedding]].\n\nSimmons also feuded with [[Santino Marella]]. On the September 10, 2007 episode of ''Raw'', Simmons was attacked by Marella. On the September 24, 2007, edition of ''Raw'', Simmons returned to the ring and defeated [[Santino Marella]] by countout after Marella left the ring and walked out. Simmons occasionally competed on ''[[WWE Heat]]'', taking on [[Job (professional wrestling)#Jobbers|jobbers]] from the town in which the show is being taped. At the end of each match, Simmons held a microphone, pulling it toward and away from his mouth while the crowd cheered him until he eventually uttered his catchphrase. On the December 3, 2007 episode of \"Raw\", Simmons and [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]] were hired by [[Hornswoggle]] to help him in a [[Hardcore wrestling|no disqualification]] handicap match against [[Jonathan Coachman]] and [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]].<ref>Robinson, Bryan.

In December, he finally entered the first sustained losing streak of his career as he dropped multiple house show matches to Mike Rotunda.\n\n==== Doom (1989&ndash;1991) ====\n{{main|Doom (professional wrestling)|l1=Doom}}\nSoon after, in March 1989, Simmons began showing signs of a heel turn as he got more aggressive in his matches, including a non-title match against fellow babyface, then-[[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]] and a match on the April 29, 1989 episode of World Championship Wrestling, where he broke the rules during what was supposed to be a face vs. face match against [[Junkyard Dog]].  Simmons won the match when the referee, Ron's future manager [[Theodore Long|Teddy Long]] made a fast count (Long was fired (kayfabe) as referee by [[Jim Herd]] immediately following this match).  He completed his heel turn on the May 27 episode of World Championship Wrestling during a tag team match, where he teamed with [[Ranger Ross]] against the [[The Headshrinkers|Samoan Swat Team]] as part of a tournament for the vacant [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag Team Championship]], leaving him in the ring alone when Long came out. Simmons later teamed up with [[Butch Reed]] to form [[Doom (professional wrestling)|Doom]]. In the beginning, the members of Doom were masked and only known as Doom #1 and Doom #2, managed by [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]]. In their [[pay-per-view]] debut at [[Halloween Havoc 1989]], Doom defeated [[The Steiner Brothers]]. In the \"Iron Team Tournament\" at [[Starrcade (1989)|Starrcade 1989]], Doom finished fourth, losing all three of their matches. Doom's misfortune continued as Woman soon dropped the team to manage [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]]. Then on February 6, 1990, at [[Clash of the Champions X]], Doom hit rock bottom when they were defeated by Rick and Scott Steiner and as a result of the stipulation were forced to unmask.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html#X |title=NWA Clash of the Champions Results (X) |accessdate=April 9, 2007 |publisher=prowrestlinghistory.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623095650/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash.html |archivedate=June 23, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWith new manager Long, they rebounded and defeated [[The Steiner Brothers]] for the NWA World Tag Team Championship at [[Capital Combat]] in 1990.  They held the title for nine months, defeating teams like [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] and [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuding]] with [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]]. Among their most memorable encounters during their title reign was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|street fight]] against Horsemen [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Barry Windham]] at [[Starrcade (1990)|Starrcade 1990]] which ended in a no-contest when Windham pinned Simmons while Reed simultaneously pinned Anderson. Doom were recognized as the first holders of the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] in January 1991, finally losing the titles to [[The Fabulous Freebirds|The Freebirds]] at [[WrestleWar (1991)|WrestleWar]] in February 1991. Subsequently, Doom broke up, with Simmons turning face and feuding with Reed, defeating him in a [[cage match]] at the very first [[SuperBrawl I|SuperBrawl]]. Simmons defeated midcarders including [[Kevin Nash|Oz]] and [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|The Diamond Studd]], then unsuccessfully challenged [[Lex Luger]] for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[Halloween Havoc 1991|Halloween Havoc]], losing the [[Professional wrestling match types#Series variations|best-of-three-falls match]] one fall to two.\n\n==== World Heavyweight Champion (1992) ====\nSimmons spent the first half of 1992 feuding with [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], whom he defeated via pinfall at [[SuperBrawl II]]. On August 2, 1992 at a house show in Baltimore, Maryland, a scheduled title match between [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[WCW World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Big Van Vader]] was canceled after [[Jake Roberts]] ([[kayfabe]]) injured Sting.<ref name=\"mf225\">Foley, Mick (2000).

He continued to feud with [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], with Jack bringing in [[Sione Vailahi|The Barbarian]] to challenge Simmons at [[Halloween Havoc 1992|Halloween Havoc]]. At [[Starrcade 1992|Starrcade]], Simmons was scheduled to wrestle [[Rick Rude]], but due to Rude being injured he faced [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]] instead, wrestling to a double [[countout]] that was changed to a [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] win for Simmons when Williams attacked him after the match. His title reign ended two days later on December 30, 1992, when Vader defeated him to regain the title.\n\n==== Final years (1993&ndash;1994) ====\nAfterwards, Simmons was relegated to mid-card status, eventually becoming a bitter heel who felt like the fans abandoned him after he lost the championship. Simmons unsuccessfully challenged [[Dustin Rhodes]] for the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Championship]] and [[Paul Orndorff]] for the [[WCW World Television Championship|World Television Championship]] during his last months with [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]. In the spring of 1994, Simmons was working for WCW without being signed to a contract, also Simmons was briefly managed by Sherri Martel during this time. Simmons competed in the European Cup Tournament, winning his 1st round match against Marcus Bagwell but lost the next round to Sting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrestlingforum.com/classic-wrestling/2001906-wrestling-observer-1994-a.html|title=Wrestling Observer 1994 - Wrestling Forum: WWE, AEW, New Japan, Indy Wrestling, Women of Wrestling Forums|website=www.wrestlingforum.com}}</ref> He would go on to feud with Sting and Bagwell, mostly competing in tag matches. His final match was a win over [[Scott Armstrong (wrestler)|Scott Armstrong]] on the September 10, 1994 edition of WCW Worldwide.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw94.htm</ref>\n\n===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994\u20131995)===\nSimmons appeared in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) from late 1994 to early 1995. During that time he unsuccessfully challenged [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Shane Douglas]] at [[November to Remember 1994|November to Remember]] and had matches with [[Mikey Whipwreck]] and [[911 (wrestler)|911]].\n\n===World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment===\n====Nation of Domination (1996\u20131998)====\n{{Main|The Nation of Domination}}\nAfter ECW, Simmons joined the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) and made his debut on the July 22, 1996, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. His first [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] was that of Faarooq Asad, a [[gladiator]] who wore a black and blue gladiator outfit with a misshaped helmet and was managed by [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]]. Simmons started his first [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Ahmed Johnson]] before shortening his ring name to Faarooq. The feud was started when Faarooq attacked Ahmed during a tag team match pitting Johnson and Shawn Michaels against the Smoking Gunns. As a result of the injuries sustained, Johnson vacated the Intercontinental title. In the subsequent tournament, Faarooq lost in finals to [[Marc Mero]]. Faarooq dropped his gladiator gimmick, parted ways with [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]] and formed the [[Nation of Domination]] (NOD), a [[Professional wrestling stable|stable]] loosely based on the [[Nation of Islam]]{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} and the [[Black Panther Party]]{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}, although the members of the stable were not exclusively [[African Americans|African American]]. They mostly feuded with [[Anthony Norris|Ahmed Johnson]]. At the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|Royal Rumble 1997]], Faarooq defeated Johnson by disqualification. In the [[Royal Rumble]] match, Johnson eliminated himself when he saw Faarooq in the aisle and chased after him. Later in the same match Faarooq was eliminated when Johnson returned and attacked him with a 2x4. At [[WrestleMania 13]] Johnson recruited the [[The Road Warriors|Legion of Doom]] in a winning effort against the entire Nation in a Chicago Street Fight.\n\nAfter losing to [[WWE Championship|WWF World Champion]], The Undertaker, at the 1997 King of the Ring, Faarooq blamed [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]] and [[Savio Vega]] for his loss and threw them out of the NOD. Both formed their rival factions, known respectively as [[The Disciples of Apocalypse]] and [[Los Boricuas]], and Faarooq recruited more African American members for the Nation, including half-Samoan [[Dwayne Johnson|Rocky Maivia]]. The three stables feuded with one another throughout 1997. In the Summer of 1997 Faarooq again lost a tournament final for the Intercontinental title, this time to Owen Hart after Stone Cold Steve Austin interfered. Austin, who had forfeited the title due an injury inflicted by Hart, wanted Hart to win so he could again beat him for the title.\n\nIn early 1998, Faarooq's leadership of the NOD was increasingly challenged by Maivia, who had shortened his name to The Rock and felt he should be the leader as he was now Intercontinental Champion. In the Royal Rumble match, all five NOD members were in the ring at the same time and frequently brawled with each other, Faarooq even eliminating his fellow members D'lo Brown and Mark Henry; he was one of the final three along with the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Faarooq wanted the Rock to help him eliminate Austin but the Rock refused and eliminated Faarooq. The following month at [[No Way Out of Texas: In Your House|No Way Out]], the Nation of Domination lost a 10-man tag to Ken Shamrock, Ahmed Johnson, Chainz, [[The Harris Brothers|Skull and 8 ball]] when Rock submitted to an ankle lock by Shamrock. After the match Faarooq and Rock almost came to blows. At [[Wrestlemania XIV]], Faarooq and Kama were unsuccessful in the tag team battle royal. Later in the evening, Faarooq was the only NOD member absent from Rock's title defense against Ken Shamrock. When Shamrock put Rock in an ankle lock, Faarooq ran down to the ring but decided against helping him and walked off, with the crowd cheering his decision. The following night on ''RAW'', Rock assumed leadership of the NOD and kicked Faarooq out of the group. Faarooq spent the next several months feuding with his former stablemates.\n\n====Acolytes/APA (1998\u20132004)====\n{{Main|The Acolytes Protection Agency}}\nAfter being dumped from the Nation, Faarooq feuded with the Rock but failed to win the Intercontinental title. Simmons then teamed briefly with [[2 Cold Scorpio]]. In late 1998, Simmons began teaming with [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]] as [[The Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]], a violent tag team sporting occult symbolism on their tights and chests. They were managed by [[Don Callis|The Jackyl]] until he left the WWF, at which point they were reintroduced as members of [[The Ministry of Darkness]] led by [[The Undertaker]]. The Acolytes recruited [[Dennis Knight|Phineas I. Godwinn]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Mabel]] to the Ministry by [[kidnapping]] and [[brainwashing]] them (renaming them Mideon and Viscera, respectively), and feuded with The Undertaker's rivals, such as [[D-Generation X]] and [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]], the latter of which later joined the Ministry as well.\n\nDuring this time the Acolytes had two short reigns as tag team champions; they defeated the team of [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] but lost the title to [[the Hardy Boyz]]. At the [[Fully Loaded (1999)|Fully Loaded]] pay-per-view in 1999, they won the title back in a no disqualification handicap match against the Hardyz and [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]]. Their second reign ended when they lost the title to Kane and X-Pac.\n\nAfter the Undertaker suffered an injury in late 1999, the Ministry of Darkness disbanded. Faarooq and Bradshaw continued to team with one another, and eventually adopted the gimmick of two brawlers who enjoyed drinking beer and smoking cigars. After Bradshaw began hiring out the services of the Acolytes as [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] and [[bodyguard]]s, the tag team was renamed the \"Acolytes Protection Agency\" (APA). Around this time, Faarooq adopted his \"Damn!\" catchphrase. The team won their third tag team title by defeating [[the Dudley Boyz]] in June 2001 but lost the titles the following month to [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] when [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] interfered.\n\nThe APA teamed together until 2002, when Faarooq was [[WWE Draft|drafted]] to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brand. Around this time, Ron Simmons began wrestling under his real name, as the terrorist group [[Al-Qaeda]] had a training camp called Al-Faarooq.<ref name=\"OWW\" /> Simmons had a brief heel run when he teamed with [[D-Von Dudley|Reverend D-Von]] until he left television in December 2002, but in June 2003 he returned to WWE with Bradshaw and the APA reunited.\n\nIn his last [[WWE]] [[Angle (professional wrestling)|storyline]], he was fired by temporary ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' General Manager [[Paul Heyman]] after the APA lost another match for the Tag Team Championship. It was assumed that the APA was fired, but Paul Heyman told Bradshaw he was allowed to stay. Simmons retired from his in-ring career, accusing Bradshaw of not being a faithful friend in storyline. In reality, Simmons, who had been planning to retire due to his health and age and become a backstage agent for the company, was let go the day this [[Angle (professional wrestling)|angle]] aired on ''SmackDown''.\n\n====Sporadic appearances and Hall of Famer (2006\u2013present)====\n[[File:Ron simmons.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Simmons making a promotional appearance for WWE in 2005]]\nIn 2006, during a rebroadcast of the 1981 [[Orange Bowl]] on [[Sun Sports]], Simmons stated that since his retirement from professional wrestling, he would like to continue or even improve his role within [[WWE]]. Starting on October 23, 2006, he began making short cameos on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' to say his catchphrase \"Damn\", often in awe of or shock at odd occurrences.\n\nOn the November 20, 2006 edition of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', Simmons was chosen by [[Ric Flair]] to replace the injured [[Roddy Piper]] at the [[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series]] to take on the [[Spirit Squad]]. He was the first to be eliminated, via countout. On the January 15, 2007 episode of ''Raw'', he was seen in the ring with [[Chris Masters]] in the \"[[Chris Masters#Debut and Master Lock Challenge|Master Lock Challenge]]\", which ended prematurely after interference from [[Super Crazy]]. Simmons's escaping the Master Lock, was not recognized. On the July 27, 2007 edition of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'', Simmons was named the [[Wedding ceremony participants#Best man|best man]] for [[Theodore Long]] and [[Kristal Marshall|Kristal]]'s [[wedding]].\n\nSimmons also feuded with [[Santino Marella]]. On the September 10, 2007 episode of ''Raw'', Simmons was attacked by Marella. On the September 24, 2007, edition of ''Raw'', Simmons returned to the ring and defeated [[Santino Marella]] by countout after Marella left the ring and walked out. Simmons occasionally competed on ''[[WWE Heat]]'', taking on [[Job (professional wrestling)#Jobbers|jobbers]] from the town in which the show is being taped. At the end of each match, Simmons held a microphone, pulling it toward and away from his mouth while the crowd cheered him until he eventually uttered his catchphrase. On the December 3, 2007 episode of \"Raw\", Simmons and [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]] were hired by [[Hornswoggle]] to help him in a [[Hardcore wrestling|no disqualification]] handicap match against [[Jonathan Coachman]] and [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]].<ref>Robinson, Bryan.

During the [[Slammy Awards#2008|2008 Slammy Awards]], he gave [[The Great Khali]] the award for the DAMN Moment of the year. Simmons was released from [[WWE]] on January 13, 2009, due to budget cuts but repeatedly reappeared on various WWE events to interrupt awkward situations with his catchphrase. Occasions include episodes of ''[[WWE Raw#Special Episodes|WWE Old School Raw]]'' (November 15, 2010 and January 6, 2014) and ''Raw'' (May 2, 2011 and January 28, 2013), ''[[Hell in a Cell (2012)|Hell in a Cell 2012]]'' and WrestleManias [[WrestleMania 30|30]] and [[WrestleMania 31|31]].<ref name=\"vids.wwe.com\">[http://www.wwe.com/videos/2012-wwe-hall-of-fame-inductee-ron-simmons-25060730 \"2012 WWE Hall of Fame Inductee: Ron Simmons.\"] [[WWE]], February 20, 2012.

Thus, it contains three subsystems, namely autocatalytic network for metabolism, a lipid bilayer for structural organisation, and a replicating machinery for information. Unlike cellular metabolic reactions, metabolism of chemoton in autonomous chemical cycle and is not dependent on enzymes. Autocatalysis produces its own structures and functions. Hence, the process itself has no hereditary variation. The model reaction however asserts that another molecule (''T'' in the diagram) is spontaneously produced that is incorporated into the structure. This molecule is [[amphipathic]] like [[membrane lipids]], but it is highly dynamic, leaving small gaps that close and open frequently. This unstable structure is important for new amphipathic molecules to be added, so that a membrane is subsequently formed. This will become a microsphere. Due to metabolic reaction, [[osmotic pressure]] will build up inside the microsphere, and this will generate a force for invaginating the membrane, and ultimately division. In fact, this is close to the cell division of cell wall-less bacteria, such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]''. Continuous reactions will also invariably produce variable polymers that can be inherited by daughter cells.
