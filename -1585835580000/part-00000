Kirby|Matthew Kriby]] and [[Gordon Doherty]] is a collection of novels set within the ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' video game universe. The books follow various time periods and revolve around the Assassins at war with the [[Knights Templar]].\n\n==''Renaissance''==\nThe first novel of this collection, ''Renaissance'', was published on November 20, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Assassin's Creed Novel Coming Later This Month|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2009/11/assassins-creed-novel-coming-later-this-month/|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|last=Good|first=Owen|date=9 November 2009|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>  The novel features [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], a man who seeks revenge for the murder of his family. Ezio begins to train himself as an assassin and becomes drawn into a war between the Assassin's Brotherhood and the Templar Order. The two secret organizations have been combating each other for centuries to secure an ancient technology, called the \"Apple of Eden\", a relic which can control human minds. Both groups also seek a vault in Italy, which contains the knowledge and technology of an ancient, technologically superior civilization.\n\n==''Brotherhood''==\n\n''Brotherhood''\u2014the second novel in the series, was released in 2010. It's a novelized version of the popular game ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]''. Just like its previous book, ''Assassin's Creed: Renaissance'', it does not contain any of the game's present-day events including Desmond, only a reference to a \"phantom\" by Ezio. The story takes place four years after the video game's story (1499), in 1503. Ezio Auditore struggles to free the city of [[Rome]] from the tyranny of [[Cesare Borgia]], who seeks to take over [[Italy]].\n\n==''The Secret Crusade''==\n''The Secret Crusade'''s story follows [[Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad|Alta\u00efr]], as told by [[Niccolo Polo]]. It details the life of Alta\u00efr, an Assassin; beginning with the death of his father. Alta\u00efr watches his father's execution; which was carried out for causing the unintended death of a noble. Some time later, he also watches one of his father's fellow Assassins kill himself out of guilt over the death of Alta\u00efr's father. The book then progresses to many years later where an older Alta\u00efr, with his wife Maria and their son Darim, are returning to Masyaf Alta\u00efr's home after successfully assassinating Genghis Khan. In their absence, Abbas proclaimed himself \"Master of the Assassins\" and took over Masyaf, ruling with tyranny. Alta\u00efr is met with cold indifference. He discovers that despite being told that his son Sef had traveled to Alamut, his son was actually murdered by Malik. Malik has been imprisoned but claims innocence. Alta\u00efr breaks him out of jail planning to confront Abbas and reclaim his place as Master Assassin. These plans are thwarted when Abbas has Malik killed and frames Alta\u00efr for his death. Out of anger, Alta\u00efr uses the Apple of Eden to kill the man responsible for Sef's death but also inadvertently causes Maria's death. Devastated, Alta\u00efr flees Masyaf.\n\nYears later a merchant named Muhklis is saved from desert bandits by Alta\u00efr, now an old man in his seventies. Muhklis takes an injured Alta\u00efr back to his home in Masyaf and agrees to help him reclaim his place. They hope to take back Masyaf with as little bloodshed as possible. They are joined by a few young men who are aligned against Abbas and are training in the traditional ways of the Assassins, which have been ignored during Abbas' reign. They, along with the people of Masyaf, storm the castle fighting through Abbas' men but only killing if absolutely necessary. Alta\u00efr faces Abbas for the last time, killing him with his pistol. With the death of their leader, Abbas' men lay down their arms and Alta\u00efr is proclaimed the leader of the Assassins. The final chapter shows that Ezio Auditore da Firenze (''Da Firenze'' means ''from Firenze/Florence'') is the narrator and he is on a boat arriving in Constantinople, in the second sequence of events in ''Revelations''. ''The Secret Crusade'' was released in June 2011.\n\n==''Revelations''==\n\n''Revelations'' once again follows Ezio Auditore as he leaves his life behind in search of the truth about the Assassin Order and \"those who came before\". The resulting journey leads him to [[Constantinople]] where a growing army of Byzantine Templars threatens the region. Ezio goes through many obstacles then decides to give up his life as an Assassin to save Desmond. This book was released on 24 November 2011 in the United Kingdom and on 29 November 2011 in the United States.\n\n==''Forsaken''==\n\nSet in 1735, ''Forsaken'' is Haytham Kenway's (Edward Kenway's son) personal journal and tracks his life, from his early childhood in England, through his rise up the Templar ranks. Unlike ''Revelations'', it is written in the first person and follows Haytham Kenway only. ''Forsaken'' was released on 4 December 2012.\n\n==''Black Flag''==\n\n''Black Flag'' follows the journal of Edward Kenway, the father of Haytham Kenway and grandfather of Connor Kenway. Edward Kenway is a young privateer who sets out to become the world's deadliest pirate, only to be drawn into the centuries-old war between the Assassins and the Templars.  ''Black Flag'' was released on 26 November 2013 and is based on the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''.\n\n==''Unity''==\n''Assassin's Creed Unity'' follows Elise and Arno's side of the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]'' that takes place during the [[French Revolution]]. The book is based on this installment and was released in November 2014.\n\n== ''Underworld'' ==\n''Assassin's Creed Underworld'' follows Henry Green and Detective Abberline 6 years before the events of ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate|Syndicate]]'', eventually ending with the game's final missions in Evie's perspective.\n\n== ''Desert Oath'' ==\n''Assassin's Creed Origins: Desert Oath'' follows Bayek, a young boy who lives in Siwa in ancient Egypt. The events take place before the events of the game ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]''.

Most of the continent lies in the [[tropics]].\n\nThe continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] with European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves.

These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export [[commodity]] often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.\n\nSouth America is one of the most biodiverse continents on earth. South America is home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the [[llama]], [[anaconda]], [[piranha]], [[jaguar]], [[vicu\u00f1a]], and [[tapir]]. The Amazon rainforests possess high [[biodiversity]], containing a major proportion of the Earth's [[species]].\n\nBrazil is the largest country in South America, encompassing around half of the continent's land area and population.

Between the [[Maracaibo Lake]] and the mouth of the Orinoco, predominates an [[equatorial climate]] of the type Congolese, that also includes parts of the Brazilian territory.<ref name=\"Climate\"/>\n\nThe east-central Brazilian plateau has a humid and warm tropical climate. The northern and eastern parts of the Argentine pampas have a [[Subtropics|humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters and humid summers of the Chinese type, while the western and eastern ranges have a subtropical climate of the dinaric type. At the highest points of the Andean region, climates are colder than the ones occurring at the highest point of the Norwegian fjords. In the Andean plateaus, the warm climate prevails, although it is tempered by the altitude, while in the coastal strip, there is an equatorial climate of the Guinean type. From this point until the north of the Chilean coast appear, successively, [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean oceanic climate]], temperate of the Breton type and, already in [[Tierra del Fuego]], cold climate of the Siberian type.<ref name=\"Climate\"/>\n\nThe distribution of rainfall is related to the regime of winds and air masses. In most of the [[tropical region]] east of the Andes, winds blowing from the northeast, east and southeast carry moisture from the Atlantic, causing abundant rainfall. However, due to a consistently strong [[wind shear]] and a weak [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], [[South Atlantic tropical cyclone]]s are rare.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G6.html\n | title =Why doesn't the South Atlantic Ocean experience tropical cyclones?\n | last =Landsea\n | first =Chris\n | date =13 July 2005\n | website =Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorlogical Laboratory\n | publisher =National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration\n | access-date =9 June 2018\n | quote = }}</ref> In the [[Los Llanos (South America)|Orinoco Llanos]] and in the [[The Guianas|Guianas plateau]], the precipitation levels go from moderate to high.

In the [[pampas]] of Argentina, Uruguay and South of Brazil the rainfall is moderate, with rains well distributed during the year. The moderately dry conditions of the Chaco oppose the intense rainfall of the eastern region of Paraguay. In the [[semiarid]] coast of the Brazilian Northeast the rains are linked to a monsoon regime.<ref name=\"Climate\"/>\n\nImportant factors in the determination of climates are sea currents, such as the current Humboldt and [[Falklands]]. The equatorial current of the South Atlantic strikes the coast of the Northeast and there is divided into two others: the current of Brazil and a coastal current that flows to the northwest towards the [[Antilles]], where there it moves towards northeast course thus forming the most Important and famous ocean current in the world, the [[Gulf Stream]].<ref name=\"Climate\"/><ref name=\"Know.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411062149/http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |archivedate=11 April 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of South America}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{further|History of South America#Pre-Columbian era}}\n[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|The prehistoric [[Cueva de las Manos]], or \"Cave of the Hands\", in Argentina]]\nSouth America is believed to have been joined with Africa from the late [[Paleozoic Era]] to the early [[Mesozoic Era]], until the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago. Therefore, South America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers.\n\nSouth America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] (now the [[Bering Strait]]) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day Russia. They migrated south through North America, and eventually reached South America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]].\n\nThe first evidence for the existence of the human race in South America dates back to about 9000 BC, when [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], [[chili pepper]]s and [[bean]]s began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]], which remains a [[staple food]] today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BC.<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\">O'Brien, Patrick. (General Editor). Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 25</ref>\n\nBy 2000 BC, many [[agrarian society|agrarian]] communities had been settled throughout the [[Andes]] and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an [[agrarian society]].<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\"/>\n\nSouth American cultures began domesticating [[llama]]s, [[vicu\u00f1a]]s, [[guanaco]]s, and [[alpaca]]s in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\"/>\n\n===Pre-Columbian civilizations===\n{{Main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}\n[[File:Machu Picchu, Per\u00fa, 2015-07-30, DD 39.JPG|alt=|thumb|The Inca estate of [[Machu Picchu]], [[Peru]] is one of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World#Winners|New Seven Wonders of the World]].]]\n\nThe rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.\n\nOne of the earliest known South American civilizations was at [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], on the central [[Peru]]vian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Norte Chico governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by [[Chavin culture|Chav\u00edn]] by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called [[Chav\u00edn de Huantar]] in modern Peru at an elevation of {{convert|3177|m|sp=us||}}. Chav\u00edn civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.\n\nIn the central coast of Peru, around the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] (100 BC&nbsp;\u2013 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] (400 BC&nbsp;\u2013 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through [[irrigation]] and new styles of ceramic art. At the [[Altiplano]], Tiahuanaco or [[Tiwanaku]] (100 BC&nbsp;\u2013 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial network based on religion.\n\nAround the 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari or [[Wari culture|Huari]] Empire (600\u20131200, Central and northern Peru) expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism and Tiahuanaco religious iconography.\n\nThe [[Muisca people|Muisca]] were the main indigenous civilization in what is now Colombia. They established the [[Muisca Confederation]] of many clans, or ''[[cacique|cacicazgos]]'', that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.\n\nOther important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s (in south central Ecuador), [[Chim\u00fa Empire]] (1300\u20131470, Peruvian northern coast), [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000\u20131450, Western Bolivia and southern Peru).\nHolding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as ''Tawantin suyu'', and \"the land of the four regions,\" in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the [[Inca Empire]] was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some nine to fourteen million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture.\n\nThe [[Mapuche]] in Central and Southern Chile resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the [[Arauco War]] for more than 300 years.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===European colonization===\n{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Vespucci's first voyage, from Letter to Soderini.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut depicting Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s first voyage (1497-98) to the New World, from the first known published edition of Vespucci's 1504 letter to [[Piero Soderini]].]]\n\nIn 1494, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries.\n\nThe treaty established an imaginary line along a north\u2013south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46\u00b0 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.\n\n[[File:Inca-Spanish confrontation.JPG|thumb|The [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Inca\u2013Spanish confrontation]] in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] left thousands of natives dead.]]\n\nBeginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it in colonies.\n\nEuropean infectious diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[typhus]]) \u2013 to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]] had no immune resistance&nbsp;\u2013 caused large-scale depopulation of the native population under Spanish control. Systems of forced labor, such as the [[hacienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mit'a]] also contributed to the depopulation. After this, African [[Slavery|slaves]], who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.\n\n[[File:Desembarque de Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral em Porto Seguro em 1500 by Oscar Pereira da Silva (1865\u20131939).jpg|thumb|left|The Portuguese arrival in Brazil on 22 April 1500 was led by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].]]\n[[File:Waterkant seen from Suriname river III.JPG|thumb|The Dutch colonial houses in the historic center of [[Paramaribo]], Suriname.]]\n[[File:Plate 6 Provisional Battalion.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the Demerara rebellion in [[British Guiana]] in 1823.]]\n\nThe Spaniards were committed to converting their native subjects to [[Christianity]] and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, many initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended [[Catholicism]] with their established beliefs and practices. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion, although the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s evangelization in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.\n\nEventually, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[mestizo]] class. At the beginning, many mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos had native fathers and European or mestizo mothers.\n\nMany native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent, and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of Latin American.\n\n[[Guyana]] was first a Dutch, and then a [[British Empire|British colony]], though there was a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars when it was colonized by the French. The country was once partitioned into three parts, each being controlled by one of the colonial powers until the country was finally taken over fully by the British.\n\n===Slavery in South America===\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}\n[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|left|Public flogging of a slave in 19th-century Brazil.]]\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries. The colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of European settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought African slaves primarily to South American colonies, beginning with the Portuguese since 1502.<ref>Anstey, Roger: ''The Atlantic Slave Trade and British abolition, 1760\u20131810''. London: Macmillan, 1975, p. 5.</ref> The main destinations of this phase were the [[Caribbean]] colonies and [[Brazil]], as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the [[New World]]. Nearly 40% of all African slaves trafficked to the Americas went to Brazil. An estimated 4.9 million slaves from Africa came to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vergonha Ainda Maior: Novas informa\u00e7\u00f5es dispon\u00edveis em um enorme banco de dados mostram que a escravid\u00e3o no Brasil foi muito pior do que se sabia antes (|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|website=Veja|accessdate=16 March 2015|language=Portuguese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313000755/http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|archivedate=13 March 2015|df=}}</ref><ref>Stephen D.

In 1750 Portugal abolished native slavery in the colonies because they considered them unfit for labour and began to import even more African slaves. Slaves were brought to the mainland on [[slave ships]], under inhuman conditions and ill-treatment, and those who survived were sold into the slave markets.\n\nAfter independence, all South American countries maintained slavery for some time. The first South American country to abolish slavery was Chile in 1823, Uruguay in 1830, Bolivia in 1831, Colombia and Ecuador in 1851, Argentina in 1853, Peru and Venezuela in 1854, Suriname in 1863, Paraguay in 1869, and in 1888 Brazil was the last South American nation and the last country in [[western world]] to abolish slavery.\n\n===Independence from Spain and Portugal===\n{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence|Independence of Brazil}}\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Guayaquil conference]] between [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]]]\n[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|thumb|The proclamation of the [[Independence of Brazil]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]] on 7 September 1822]]\n[[File:Coroa\u00e7ao pedro I 001.jpg|thumb|Coronation of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] as 1st [[Emperor of Brazil]]]]\n[[File:JuraIndependencia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]] swears officially the independence of [[Chile]].]]\n\nThe European [[Peninsular War]] (1807\u20131814), a theater of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon invaded Portugal, but the [[House of Braganza]] avoided capture by [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|escaping to Brazil]]. Napoleon also captured King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], and appointed his own brother instead. This appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]] to rule in the name of the captured king.\n\nMany cities in the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] between the patriots, who promoted such autonomy, and the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the [[Absolutist Restoration]] as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict.\n\nThe independence of South America was secured by [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] (Venezuela) and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] (Argentina), the two most important ''[[Libertadores]]''. Bol\u00edvar led a great uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards [[Lima]], the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Meanwhile, San Mart\u00edn led an army across the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile. He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, [[Ecuador]], where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil]], [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese King [[Dom Jo\u00e3o VI]], proclaimed the independent [[Kingdom of Brazil]] in 1822, which later became the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Despite the Portuguese loyalties of garrisons in [[Bahia]], [[Cisplatine Province|Cisplatina]] and [[Par\u00e1]], independence was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal in 1825, on condition of a high compensation paid by Brazil mediatized by the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===Nation-building and fragmentation===\n[[File:Juan Manuel Blanes - El Juramento de los Treinta y Tres Orientales.jpg|thumb|The [[Thirty-Three Orientals]] proclaimed the independence of [[Cisplatine Province]].]]\n[[File:Oscar Pereira da Silva - Cena de Batalha no Sul do Brasil.jpg|thumb|Battle of Fanfa, battle scene in Southern Brazil during the [[Ragamuffin War]]]]\n\nThe newly independent nations began a process of fragmentation, with several civil and international wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern times (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries (such as the [[Republic of Entre R\u00edos]] and the [[Riograndense Republic]]).\n\nThe first separatist attempt was in 1820 by the Argentine province of [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre R\u00edos]], led by a [[caudillo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilescola.com/historia-da-america/caudilhismo.htm|title=Caudillo}}</ref> In spite of the \"Republic\" in its title, [[Francisco Ram\u00edrez (governor)|General Ram\u00edrez]], its caudillo, never really intended to declare an independent Entre Rios. Rather, he was making a political statement in opposition to the monarchist and centralist ideas that back then permeated [[Buenos Aires]] politics. The \"country\" was reincorporated at the United Provinces in 1821.\n\nIn 1825 the [[Cisplatine Province]] declared its independence from the [[Empire of Brazil]], which led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between the imperials and the Argentine from the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] to control the region. Three years later, the [[United Kingdom]] intervened in the question by proclaiming a tie and creating in the former Cisplatina a new independent country: The [[Oriental Republic of Uruguay]].\n\nLater in 1836, while Brazil was experiencing the chaos of the regency, [[Rio Grande do Sul]] [[Ragamuffin War|proclaimed its independence]] motivated by a tax crisis. With the anticipation of the coronation of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] to the throne of Brazil, the country could stabilize and fight the separatists, which the province of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] had joined in 1839. The Conflict came to an end by a process of compromise by which both [[Riograndense Republic]] and [[Juliana Republic]] were reincorporated as provinces in 1845.<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | title= Ragamuffin War | last= Day | first= Peter | date= 17 December 1997 | publisher= Brasil Escola | accessdate= 27 March 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070303074424/http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | archivedate= 3 March 2007 | df=  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/revolucao-farroupilha.htm |title= Ragamuffin Revolution |last= Souza |first=Rainer |date=20 January 2002|publisher=RioGrande |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Peru\u2013Bolivian Confederation]], a short-lived union of Peru and Bolivia, was blocked by Chile in the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836\u20131839) and again during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883). Paraguay was virtually destroyed by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay in the [[Paraguayan War]].\n\n===Wars and conflicts===\n[[File:Brazilians during the siege of Paysandu.jpg|thumb|[[Imperial Brazilian Navy]] and army troops during the [[Siege of Paysand\u00fa]], 1865]]\n[[File:Battle of Potrero Sauce 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Uruguayan Army]] at the [[Battle of Sauce]], 1866]]\n[[File:Procession in Paraguay 1868.jpg|thumb|The [[Imperial Brazilian Army]] during a procession in [[Paraguay]], 1868]]\n[[File:Batalla de Chorrillos.jpg|thumb|The [[Chilean Army]] in the battlefield of the [[Battle of Chorrillos]], 1883]]\n[[File:U-199Flyover.jpg|thumb|A German submarine under attack by [[Brazilian Air Force]] PBY Catalina, 31 July 1943]]\n\nSouth American history in early [[19th century]] was built almost exclusively on wars. Despite the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] and the [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazilian War of Independence]], the new nations quickly began to suffer with internal conflicts and wars among themselves.\n\nIn 1825 the proclamation of independence of Cisplatina led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between historical rivals the [[Empire of Brazil]] and the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], Argentina's predecessor. The result was a stalemate, ending with the British arranging for the independence of Uruguay. Soon after, another Brazilian province proclaimed its independence leading to the [[Ragamuffin War]] which Brazil won.\n\nBetween 1836 and 1839 the [[War of the Confederation]] broke out between the short-lived [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] and [[Chile]], with the support of the [[Argentine Confederation]]. The war was fought mostly in the actual territory of [[Peru]] and ended with a Confederate defeat and the dissolution of the Confederacy and annexation of many territories by Argentina.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Argentine Civil Wars]] plagued Argentina since its independence. The conflict was mainly between those who defended the centralization of power in Buenos Aires and those who defended a confederation. During this period it can be said that \"there were two Argentines\": the [[Argentine Confederation]] and the [[Argentine Republic]]. At the same time the political instability in Uruguay led to the [[Uruguayan Civil War]] among the main political factions of the country. All this instability in the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin|platine region]] interfered with the goals of other countries such as Brazil, which was soon forced to take sides. In 1851 the [[Brazilian Empire]], supporting the centralizing unitarians, and the [[Uruguay|Uruguayan government]] invaded Argentina and deposed the caudillo, [[Juan Manuel Rosas]], who ruled the confederation with an iron hand. Although the [[Platine War]] did not put an end to the political chaos and civil war in Argentina, it brought temporary peace to Uruguay where the [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados faction]] won, supported by the [[Brazilian Empire]], [[British Empire]], [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] and the [[Unitarian Party]] of Argentina.<ref name=\"Latin America\u2019s Wars\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=khU0sFxgyjMC&pg=RA2-PA1844&dq=lorenzo%20latorre%20uruguay%20president#v=onepage&q=chapter%20twenty-five&f=false|title=Latin America's Wars|first=Robert L.|last=Scheina|date=31 January 2003|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1597974776}}</ref>\n\nPeace lasted only a short time: in 1864 the Uruguayan factions faced each other again in the [[Uruguayan War]]. The [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]] supported by Paraguay started to attack Brazilian and Argentine farmers near the borders. The Empire made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados without success. In 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, the imperial government declared that Brazil's military would begin reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and, for most of its duration, the Uruguayan\u2013Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war which led to the deposition of the ''Blancos'' and the rise of the pro-Brazilian ''Colorados'' to power again. This angered the Paraguayan government, which even before the end of the war invaded Brazil, beginning the biggest and deadliest war in both South American and Latin American histories: the Paraguayan War.\n\nThe Paraguayan War began when the Paraguayan dictator [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez]] ordered the invasion of the Brazilian provinces of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. His attempt to cross Argentinian territory without Argentinian approval led the pro-Brazilian Argentine government into the war. The pro-Brazilian Uruguayan government showed its support by sending troops. In 1865 the three countries signed the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance]] against Paraguay. At the beginning of the war, the Paraguayans took the lead with several victories, until the Triple Alliance organized to repel the invaders and fight effectively. This was the second [[total war]] experience in the world after the [[American Civil War]]. It was deemed the greatest war effort in the history of all participating countries, taking almost 6 years and ending with the complete devastation of Paraguay. The country lost 40% of its territory to Brazil and Argentina and lost 60% of its population, including 90% of the men. The dictator Lopez was killed in battle and a new government was instituted in alliance with Brazil, which maintained occupation forces in the country until 1876.<ref>{{cite web|language = Portuguese|url= http://www.historiadobrasil.net/guerraparaguai/ |title=A Guerra do Paraguai \u2013 Hist\u00f3ria \u2013 Resumo|last=Borges|first = Fernando Tadeu de Miranda|website=Historiadobrasil.net|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe last South American war in the 19th century was the [[War of the Pacific]] with Bolivia and Peru on one side and Chile on the other. In 1879 the war began with Chilean troops occupying Bolivian ports, followed by Bolivia declaring war on Chile which activated an alliance treaty with Peru. The Bolivians were completely defeated in 1880 and Lima was occupied in 1881. The peace was signed with Peru in 1883 while a truce was signed with Bolivia in 1884.

Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on [[Operation Condor|inter-state collaboration]]. Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of \"National Security\" against internal subversion.

There are several areas of sparse demographics such as [[tropical forest]]s, the [[Atacama Desert]] and the icy portions of [[Patagonia]]. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly [[Spaniards]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Italians]]), [[Africans]] and [[indigenous peoples]]. There is a high percentage of [[mestizos]] that vary greatly in composition by place. There is also a minor population of [[Asians]], especially in Brazil.

At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages.\n\nOther languages found in South America include [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] in Suriname; [[Italian language|Italian]] in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela; and [[German language|German]] in certain pockets of Argentina and Brazil.

Argentina is the third most populous country with {{UN_Population|Argentina}}.\n\nWhile Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. The largest cities in South America, by far, are S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Lima, and Bogot\u00e1. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and three of five in the [[Americas]]. Next in size are Caracas, Belo Horizonte, Medellin and Salvador.\n\nFive of the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Americas|top ten metropolitan areas]] are in Brazil. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 4 million and include the [[Greater S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area]], [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area]], and [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Belo Horizonte metropolitan area]]. Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within Brazil, Argentina is host to the second largest metropolitan area by population in South America: the [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires metropolitan region]] is above 13 million inhabitants.\n\nSouth America has also been witness to the growth of [[Megalopolis|megapolitan areas]]. In Brazil four megaregions exist including the [[Expanded Metropolitan Complex of S\u00e3o Paulo]] with more than 32 million inhabitants. The others are the Greater Rio, Greater Belo Horizonte and [[Greater Porto Alegre]]. Colombia also has four megaregions which comprise 72% of its population, followed by Venezuela, Argentina and Peru which are also homes of megaregions.\n\nThe top ten largest South American metropolitan areas by population as of 2015, based on national census numbers from each country:\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Metro Area'''\n| '''Population'''\n| '''Area'''\n| '''Country'''\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n| 21,090,792\n| {{convert|7947|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]]\n| 13,693,657\n| {{convert|3830|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Argentina\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro]]\n| 13,131,431\n| {{convert|6744|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Lima metropolitan area|Lima]]\n| 9,904,727\n| {{convert|2819|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Peru\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Metropolitan Area of Bogot\u00e1|Bogot\u00e1]]\n| 9,800,225\n| {{convert|4200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Colombia\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Santiago Metropolitan Region|Santiago]]\n| 6,683,852\n| {{convert|15403|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Chile\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Belo Horizonte]]\n| 5,829,923\n| {{convert|9467|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Caracas|Caracas]]\n| 5,322,310\n| {{convert|4715|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Venezuela\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Porto Alegre|Porto Alegre]]\n| 4,258,926\n| {{convert|10232|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Bras\u00edlia|Brasilia]]\n| 4,201,737\n| {{convert|56433|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|}\n<small>2015 Census figures.</small>\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of South America|List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (nominal)|List of South American countries by GDP (PPP)}}\n{{update-section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Banco del Sur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rafael Correa]], [[Evo Morales]], [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]], [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]], [[Nicanor Duarte]], and [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] signed the founding charter of the [[Bank of the South]].]]\n[[File:Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|left|Trading panel of the [[BM&F Bovespa|S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]] is the second biggest in the [[Americas]] and 13th in the world.]]\n[[File:Vista Parcial de Santiago de Chile 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Financial center of [[Santiago]], [[Chile]]]]\n[[File:Ariane 5ES liftoff from ELA-3.jpg|thumb|Launch at the [[Kourou Space Center]] in [[French Guiana]]]]\n[[File:Petrobrasbolivia2006.jpg|thumb|[[Refinery]] of Brazilian state-owned [[Petrobras]] in [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]]]]\n[[File:Chuqui001 02.jpg|thumb|[[Chuquicamata]] is the largest [[Open-pit mining|open pit mine]] in the world, near the city of [[Calama, Chile|Calama]] in Chile.]]\n[[File:Apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o KC-390 (15414135738).jpg|thumb|[[Embraer KC-390|KC-390]] is the largest military transport aircraft produced in South America by the Brazilian company [[Embraer]].]]\n[[File:Bodega chakana hacia la monta\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vineyard]] in [[Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo]], province of [[Mendoza, Argentina]]]]\n\nSouth America relies less on the export of both manufactured goods and natural resources than the world average; merchandise exports from the continent were 16% of GDP on an [[nominal GDP|exchange rate]] basis, compared to 25% for the world as a whole.<ref name=wfex/> Brazil (the seventh largest economy in the world and the largest in South America) leads [[List of countries by exports|in terms of merchandise exports]] at $251 billion, followed by Venezuela at $93 billion, Chile at $86 billion, and Argentina at $84 billion.<ref name=wfex/>\n\nSince 1930, the continent has experienced remarkable growth and diversification in most economic sectors. Most agricultural and livestock products are destined for the domestic market and local consumption. However, the export of [[agriculture|agricultural products]] is essential for the [[balance of trade]] in most countries.<ref name=\"Economy\">O Sistema Econ\u00f4mico / Am\u00e9rica do Sul.

The production of staple foods such as vegetables, corn or beans is large, but focused on domestic consumption. Livestock raising for meat exports is important in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia. In tropical regions the most important crops are [[coffee]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[bananas]], mainly in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. Traditionally, the countries producing [[sugar]] for export are Peru, Guyana and Suriname, and in Brazil, [[sugar cane]] is also used to make [[ethanol]]. On the coast of Peru, northeast and south of Brazil, [[cotton]] is grown. Fifty percent of the South American surface is covered by forests, but timber industries are small and directed to domestic markets. In recent years, however, transnational companies have been settling in the [[Amazon forest|Amazon]] to exploit noble timber destined for export. The Pacific coastal waters of South America are the most important for commercial fishing. The anchovy catch reaches thousands of tons, and tuna is also abundant (Peru is a major exporter). The capture of [[crustaceans]] is remarkable, particularly in northeastern Brazil and Chile.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nOnly Brazil and Argentina are part of the [[G20]] (industrial countries), while only Brazil is part of the [[G8+5]] (the most powerful and influential nations in the world). In the tourism sector, a series of negotiations began in 2005 to promote tourism and increase air connections within the region. [[Punta del Este]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]] and [[Mar del Plata]] are among the most important resorts in South America.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe most industrialized countries in South America are Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay respectively. These countries alone account for more than 75 percent of the region's economy and add up to a GDP of more than US$3.0 trillion. Industries in South America began to take on the economies of the region from the 1930s when the [[Great Depression]] in the United States and other countries of the world boosted industrial production in the continent. From that period the region left the agricultural side behind and began to achieve high rates of economic growth that remained until the early 1990s when they slowed due to political instabilities, economic crises and neoliberal policies.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nSince the end of the economic crisis in Brazil and Argentina that occurred in the period from 1998 to 2002, which has led to [[economic recession]], rising unemployment and falling population income, the industrial and service sectors have been recovering rapidly. Chile, Argentina and Brazil have recovered fastest, growing at an average of 5% per year. All of South America after this period has been recovering and showing good signs of economic stability, with controlled [[inflation]] and exchange rates, continuous growth, a decrease in [[social inequality]] and unemployment\u2013factors that favor industry.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe main industries are: electronics, textiles, food, automotive, metallurgy, aviation, naval, clothing, beverage, steel, tobacco, timber, chemical, among others. Exports reach almost US$400 billion annually, with Brazil accounting for half of this.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe [[Economic inequality|economic gap]] between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than on most other continents.

Some of the most famous genres include [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] from Colombia, [[pasillo]] from Colombia and Ecuador, [[samba]], [[bossa nova]] and [[m\u00fasica sertaneja]] from Brazil, and [[tango music|tango]] from Argentina and Uruguay.

In the late 20th century, [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish rock]] emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. [[Music of Brazil|Brazil]] has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres.  In the central and western regions of Bolivia, Andean and folklore music like [[Diablada]], [[Caporales]] and [[Morenada]] are the most representative of the country, which were originated by European, Aymara and Quechua influences.\n\nThe [[Spanish American literature|literature]] of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] in novels and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] in other genres. The Brazilians [[Machado de Assis]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa]] are widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian writers.\n\nBecause of South America's broad ethnic mix, [[South American cuisine]] has African, South American Indian, South Asian, East Asian, and European influences. [[Bahia]], Brazil, is especially well known for its West African\u2013influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians, Bolivians, and Venezuelans regularly consume wine. People in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Chile, Bolivia and Brazil drink [[mate (beverage)|mate]], an herb which is brewed. The Paraguayan version, [[terere]], differs from other forms of mate in that it is served cold. [[Pisco]] is a liquor distilled from grapes in Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, African, Arab, Andean, and Amazonic food.\n\n=== Plastic arts ===\n[[File:Fernando Botero, Bird (1990), Singapore - 20040616.jpg|thumb|''Bird'' (Singapore), sculpture of [[Fernando Botero]]]]\nThe artist [[Oswaldo Guayasam\u00edn]] (1919\u20131999) from [[Ecuador]], represented with his painting style the feeling of the peoples of Latin America<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.andes.info.ec/es/noticias/guayasamin-pintor-ecuatoriano-retrato-sufrimiento-pueblos-latinoamericanos.html|title=Guayasam\u00edn, el pintor ecuatoriano que retrat\u00f3 los sufrimientos latinoamericanos|last=|first=|date=|work=Andes, Agencia de Noticias|access-date=}}</ref> highlighting social injustices in various parts of the world.

Brazil holds the record at the FIFA World Cup with five titles in total. Argentina and Uruguay have two titles each. So far four South American nations have hosted the tournament including the first edition in Uruguay (1930). The other three were Brazil (1950, 2014), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978).\n\nSouth America is home to the longest running international football tournament; the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]], which has been regularly contested since 1916. Uruguay won the Copa Am\u00e9rica a record 15 times, surpassing hosts Argentina in 2011 to reach 15 titles (they were previously equal at 14 titles each during the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica).\n\nAlso, in South America, a multi-sport event, the [[South American Games]], are held every four years. The first edition was held in [[La Paz]] in 1978 and the most recent took place in [[Santiago]] in 2014.\n\n[[South American Cricket Championship]] is an international [[limited-overs cricket]] tournament played since 1995 featuring national teams from [[Sports in South America|South America]] and certain other invited sides including teams from North America, currently played annually but until 2013 was usually played every two seasons.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Molino de viento (moderno) 2014-09-21 (3).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jep\u00edrachi wind farm in the [[Guajira Peninsula]].]]\n===Energy===\nDue to the diversity of [[topography]] and pluviometric precipitation conditions, the region's water resources vary enormously in different areas. In the [[Andes]], navigation possibilities are limited, except for the Magdalena River, [[Lake Titicaca]] and the lakes of the southern regions of Chile and Argentina. Irrigation is an important factor for agriculture from northwestern Peru to Patagonia. Less than 10% of the known electrical potential of the Andes had been used until the mid-1960s.\n\nThe [[Brazilian Highlands]] has a much higher [[hydroelectric]] potential than the [[Andes|Andean region]] and its possibilities of exploitation are greater due to the existence of several large rivers with high margins and the occurrence of great differences forming huge cataracts, such as those of Paulo Afonso, Igua\u00e7u and others. The [[Amazon River]] system has about 13,000&nbsp;km of waterways, but its possibilities for hydroelectric use are still unknown.\n\nMost of the continent's energy is generated through [[hydroelectric power plants]], but there is also an important share of [[thermoelectric]] and [[wind energy]]. Brazil and Argentina are the only South American countries that generate [[nuclear power]], each with two [[nuclear power plants]]. In 1991 these countries signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement.\n\n{{wide image|Itaipu D\u00e9cembre 2007 - Vue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.jpg|1500px|Panoramic view of the [[Itaipu Dam]], the largest of the world in energy production.}}\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Ruta Panamericana Buenos Aires Florida.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stretch of the [[Pan-American Highway]] in Argentina]]\n[[File:Puerto-del-callao.jpg|thumb|The Port of Callao in Lima|alt=]]\n[[File:L\u00ednea Roja de Mi Telef\u00e9rico en La Paz, Bolivia.jpg|thumb|The La Paz cable car system in Bolivia is home to both the longest and highest urban cable car network in the world.]]\n\nSouth American transportation systems are still deficient, with low kilometric densities. The region has about 1,700,000&nbsp;km of [[highways]] and 100,000&nbsp;km of [[railways]], which are concentrated in the coastal strip, and the interior is still devoid of communication.\n\nOnly two railroads are continental: the Transandina, which connects [[Buenos Aires]], in Argentina to [[Valpara\u00edso]], in Chile, and the Brazil\u2013Bolivia Railroad, which makes it the connection between the port of [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]] in Brazil and the city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], in Bolivia. In addition, there is the [[Pan-American Highway]], which crosses the Andean countries from north to south, although some stretches are unfinished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=88271|title=A Gap in the Andes : Image of the Day|date=2 April 2015|website=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=22 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTwo areas of greater density occur in the railway sector: the platinum network, which develops around the [[Platine region]], largely belonging to Argentina, with more than 45,000&nbsp;km in length; And the [[Southeast Brazil]] network, which mainly serves the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|state of S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. Brazil and Argentina also stand out in the road sector. In addition to the modern roads that extend through northern Argentina and south-east and south of Brazil, a vast road complex aims to link [[Bras\u00edlia]], the federal capital, to the South, Southeast, Northeast and Northern regions of Brazil.\n\nThe Port of Callao is the main port of Peru.\nSouth America has one of the largest bays of navigable inland waterways in the world, represented mainly by the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Platine basin]], the S\u00e3o Francisco and the Orinoco basins, Brazil having about 54,000&nbsp;km navigable, while Argentina has 6,500&nbsp;km and Venezuela, 1,200&nbsp;km.\n\nThe two main merchant fleets also belong to Brazil and Argentina. The following are those of Chile, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia. The largest ports in commercial movement are those of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]], [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], [[Valpara\u00edso]], [[Recife]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Montevideo]], [[Paranagu\u00e1]], [[Rio Grande]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Bel\u00e9m]] and [[Maracaibo]].\n\nIn South America, [[commercial aviation]] has a magnificent expansion field, which has one of the largest traffic density lines in the world, Rio de Janeiro\u2013S\u00e3o Paulo, and large airports, such as [[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Congonhas Airport|Congonhas]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport|S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International]] and [[Viracopos International Airport|Viracopos]] (S\u00e3o Paulo), [[Rio de Janeiro\u2013Gale\u00e3o International Airport|Rio de Janeiro International]] and [[Santos Dumont Airport|Santos Dumont]] (Rio de Janeiro), [[El Dorado International Airport|El Dorado]] (Bogot\u00e1), [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Ezeiza]] (Buenos Aires), [[Tancredo Neves International Airport]] (Belo Horizonte), [[Afonso Pena International Airport|Curitiba International Airport]] (Curitiba), Brasilia, Caracas, Montevideo, Lima, [[Viru Viru International Airport]] (Santa Cruz de la Sierra), Recife, Salvador, Salgado Filho International Airport (Porto Alegre), Fortaleza, Manaus and Bel\u00e9m.\n\nThe main public transport in major cities is the bus.

These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export [[commodity]] often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.\n\nSouth America is one of the most biodiverse continents on earth. South America is home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the [[llama]], [[anaconda]], [[piranha]], [[jaguar]], [[vicu\u00f1a]], and [[tapir]].

The northern and eastern parts of the Argentine pampas have a [[Subtropics|humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters and humid summers of the Chinese type, while the western and eastern ranges have a subtropical climate of the dinaric type. At the highest points of the Andean region, climates are colder than the ones occurring at the highest point of the Norwegian fjords. In the Andean plateaus, the warm climate prevails, although it is tempered by the altitude, while in the coastal strip, there is an equatorial climate of the Guinean type. From this point until the north of the Chilean coast appear, successively, [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean oceanic climate]], temperate of the Breton type and, already in [[Tierra del Fuego]], cold climate of the Siberian type.<ref name=\"Climate\"/>\n\nThe distribution of rainfall is related to the regime of winds and air masses. In most of the [[tropical region]] east of the Andes, winds blowing from the northeast, east and southeast carry moisture from the Atlantic, causing abundant rainfall. However, due to a consistently strong [[wind shear]] and a weak [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], [[South Atlantic tropical cyclone]]s are rare.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G6.html\n | title =Why doesn't the South Atlantic Ocean experience tropical cyclones?\n | last =Landsea\n | first =Chris\n | date =13 July 2005\n | website =Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorlogical Laboratory\n | publisher =National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration\n | access-date =9 June 2018\n | quote = }}</ref> In the [[Los Llanos (South America)|Orinoco Llanos]] and in the [[The Guianas|Guianas plateau]], the precipitation levels go from moderate to high.

The moderately dry conditions of the Chaco oppose the intense rainfall of the eastern region of Paraguay. In the [[semiarid]] coast of the Brazilian Northeast the rains are linked to a monsoon regime.<ref name=\"Climate\"/>\n\nImportant factors in the determination of climates are sea currents, such as the current Humboldt and [[Falklands]]. The equatorial current of the South Atlantic strikes the coast of the Northeast and there is divided into two others: the current of Brazil and a coastal current that flows to the northwest towards the [[Antilles]], where there it moves towards northeast course thus forming the most Important and famous ocean current in the world, the [[Gulf Stream]].<ref name=\"Climate\"/><ref name=\"Know.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411062149/http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |archivedate=11 April 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of South America}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{further|History of South America#Pre-Columbian era}}\n[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|The prehistoric [[Cueva de las Manos]], or \"Cave of the Hands\", in Argentina]]\nSouth America is believed to have been joined with Africa from the late [[Paleozoic Era]] to the early [[Mesozoic Era]], until the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago. Therefore, South America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers.\n\nSouth America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] (now the [[Bering Strait]]) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day Russia. They migrated south through North America, and eventually reached South America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]].\n\nThe first evidence for the existence of the human race in South America dates back to about 9000 BC, when [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], [[chili pepper]]s and [[bean]]s began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]], which remains a [[staple food]] today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BC.<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\">O'Brien, Patrick.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 25</ref>\n\nBy 2000 BC, many [[agrarian society|agrarian]] communities had been settled throughout the [[Andes]] and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an [[agrarian society]].<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\"/>\n\nSouth American cultures began domesticating [[llama]]s, [[vicu\u00f1a]]s, [[guanaco]]s, and [[alpaca]]s in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\"/>\n\n===Pre-Columbian civilizations===\n{{Main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}\n[[File:Machu Picchu, Per\u00fa, 2015-07-30, DD 39.JPG|alt=|thumb|The Inca estate of [[Machu Picchu]], [[Peru]] is one of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World#Winners|New Seven Wonders of the World]].]]\n\nThe rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.\n\nOne of the earliest known South American civilizations was at [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], on the central [[Peru]]vian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Norte Chico governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by [[Chavin culture|Chav\u00edn]] by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called [[Chav\u00edn de Huantar]] in modern Peru at an elevation of {{convert|3177|m|sp=us||}}. Chav\u00edn civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.\n\nIn the central coast of Peru, around the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] (100 BC&nbsp;\u2013 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] (400 BC&nbsp;\u2013 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through [[irrigation]] and new styles of ceramic art. At the [[Altiplano]], Tiahuanaco or [[Tiwanaku]] (100 BC&nbsp;\u2013 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial network based on religion.\n\nAround the 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari or [[Wari culture|Huari]] Empire (600\u20131200, Central and northern Peru) expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism and Tiahuanaco religious iconography.\n\nThe [[Muisca people|Muisca]] were the main indigenous civilization in what is now Colombia. They established the [[Muisca Confederation]] of many clans, or ''[[cacique|cacicazgos]]'', that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.\n\nOther important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s (in south central Ecuador), [[Chim\u00fa Empire]] (1300\u20131470, Peruvian northern coast), [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000\u20131450, Western Bolivia and southern Peru).\nHolding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as ''Tawantin suyu'', and \"the land of the four regions,\" in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the [[Inca Empire]] was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some nine to fourteen million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture.\n\nThe [[Mapuche]] in Central and Southern Chile resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the [[Arauco War]] for more than 300 years.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===European colonization===\n{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Vespucci's first voyage, from Letter to Soderini.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut depicting Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s first voyage (1497-98) to the New World, from the first known published edition of Vespucci's 1504 letter to [[Piero Soderini]].]]\n\nIn 1494, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries.\n\nThe treaty established an imaginary line along a north\u2013south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46\u00b0 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.\n\n[[File:Inca-Spanish confrontation.JPG|thumb|The [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Inca\u2013Spanish confrontation]] in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] left thousands of natives dead.]]\n\nBeginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it in colonies.\n\nEuropean infectious diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[typhus]]) \u2013 to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]] had no immune resistance&nbsp;\u2013 caused large-scale depopulation of the native population under Spanish control. Systems of forced labor, such as the [[hacienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mit'a]] also contributed to the depopulation. After this, African [[Slavery|slaves]], who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.\n\n[[File:Desembarque de Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral em Porto Seguro em 1500 by Oscar Pereira da Silva (1865\u20131939).jpg|thumb|left|The Portuguese arrival in Brazil on 22 April 1500 was led by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].]]\n[[File:Waterkant seen from Suriname river III.JPG|thumb|The Dutch colonial houses in the historic center of [[Paramaribo]], Suriname.]]\n[[File:Plate 6 Provisional Battalion.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the Demerara rebellion in [[British Guiana]] in 1823.]]\n\nThe Spaniards were committed to converting their native subjects to [[Christianity]] and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, many initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended [[Catholicism]] with their established beliefs and practices. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion, although the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s evangelization in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.\n\nEventually, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[mestizo]] class. At the beginning, many mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos had native fathers and European or mestizo mothers.\n\nMany native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent, and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of Latin American.\n\n[[Guyana]] was first a Dutch, and then a [[British Empire|British colony]], though there was a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars when it was colonized by the French. The country was once partitioned into three parts, each being controlled by one of the colonial powers until the country was finally taken over fully by the British.\n\n===Slavery in South America===\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}\n[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|left|Public flogging of a slave in 19th-century Brazil.]]\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries. The colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of European settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought African slaves primarily to South American colonies, beginning with the Portuguese since 1502.<ref>Anstey, Roger: ''The Atlantic Slave Trade and British abolition, 1760\u20131810''. London: Macmillan, 1975, p. 5.</ref> The main destinations of this phase were the [[Caribbean]] colonies and [[Brazil]], as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the [[New World]]. Nearly 40% of all African slaves trafficked to the Americas went to Brazil. An estimated 4.9 million slaves from Africa came to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vergonha Ainda Maior: Novas informa\u00e7\u00f5es dispon\u00edveis em um enorme banco de dados mostram que a escravid\u00e3o no Brasil foi muito pior do que se sabia antes (|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|website=Veja|accessdate=16 March 2015|language=Portuguese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313000755/http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|archivedate=13 March 2015|df=}}</ref><ref>Stephen D.

In 1750 Portugal abolished native slavery in the colonies because they considered them unfit for labour and began to import even more African slaves. Slaves were brought to the mainland on [[slave ships]], under inhuman conditions and ill-treatment, and those who survived were sold into the slave markets.\n\nAfter independence, all South American countries maintained slavery for some time. The first South American country to abolish slavery was Chile in 1823, Uruguay in 1830, Bolivia in 1831, Colombia and Ecuador in 1851, Argentina in 1853, Peru and Venezuela in 1854, Suriname in 1863, Paraguay in 1869, and in 1888 Brazil was the last South American nation and the last country in [[western world]] to abolish slavery.\n\n===Independence from Spain and Portugal===\n{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence|Independence of Brazil}}\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Guayaquil conference]] between [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]]]\n[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|thumb|The proclamation of the [[Independence of Brazil]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]] on 7 September 1822]]\n[[File:Coroa\u00e7ao pedro I 001.jpg|thumb|Coronation of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] as 1st [[Emperor of Brazil]]]]\n[[File:JuraIndependencia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]] swears officially the independence of [[Chile]].]]\n\nThe European [[Peninsular War]] (1807\u20131814), a theater of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon invaded Portugal, but the [[House of Braganza]] avoided capture by [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|escaping to Brazil]]. Napoleon also captured King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], and appointed his own brother instead. This appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]] to rule in the name of the captured king.\n\nMany cities in the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] between the patriots, who promoted such autonomy, and the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the [[Absolutist Restoration]] as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict.\n\nThe independence of South America was secured by [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] (Venezuela) and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] (Argentina), the two most important ''[[Libertadores]]''. Bol\u00edvar led a great uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards [[Lima]], the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Meanwhile, San Mart\u00edn led an army across the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile. He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, [[Ecuador]], where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil]], [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese King [[Dom Jo\u00e3o VI]], proclaimed the independent [[Kingdom of Brazil]] in 1822, which later became the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Despite the Portuguese loyalties of garrisons in [[Bahia]], [[Cisplatine Province|Cisplatina]] and [[Par\u00e1]], independence was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal in 1825, on condition of a high compensation paid by Brazil mediatized by the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===Nation-building and fragmentation===\n[[File:Juan Manuel Blanes - El Juramento de los Treinta y Tres Orientales.jpg|thumb|The [[Thirty-Three Orientals]] proclaimed the independence of [[Cisplatine Province]].]]\n[[File:Oscar Pereira da Silva - Cena de Batalha no Sul do Brasil.jpg|thumb|Battle of Fanfa, battle scene in Southern Brazil during the [[Ragamuffin War]]]]\n\nThe newly independent nations began a process of fragmentation, with several civil and international wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern times (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries (such as the [[Republic of Entre R\u00edos]] and the [[Riograndense Republic]]).\n\nThe first separatist attempt was in 1820 by the Argentine province of [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre R\u00edos]], led by a [[caudillo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilescola.com/historia-da-america/caudilhismo.htm|title=Caudillo}}</ref> In spite of the \"Republic\" in its title, [[Francisco Ram\u00edrez (governor)|General Ram\u00edrez]], its caudillo, never really intended to declare an independent Entre Rios. Rather, he was making a political statement in opposition to the monarchist and centralist ideas that back then permeated [[Buenos Aires]] politics. The \"country\" was reincorporated at the United Provinces in 1821.\n\nIn 1825 the [[Cisplatine Province]] declared its independence from the [[Empire of Brazil]], which led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between the imperials and the Argentine from the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] to control the region. Three years later, the [[United Kingdom]] intervened in the question by proclaiming a tie and creating in the former Cisplatina a new independent country: The [[Oriental Republic of Uruguay]].\n\nLater in 1836, while Brazil was experiencing the chaos of the regency, [[Rio Grande do Sul]] [[Ragamuffin War|proclaimed its independence]] motivated by a tax crisis. With the anticipation of the coronation of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] to the throne of Brazil, the country could stabilize and fight the separatists, which the province of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] had joined in 1839. The Conflict came to an end by a process of compromise by which both [[Riograndense Republic]] and [[Juliana Republic]] were reincorporated as provinces in 1845.<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | title= Ragamuffin War | last= Day | first= Peter | date= 17 December 1997 | publisher= Brasil Escola | accessdate= 27 March 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070303074424/http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | archivedate= 3 March 2007 | df=  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/revolucao-farroupilha.htm |title= Ragamuffin Revolution |last= Souza |first=Rainer |date=20 January 2002|publisher=RioGrande |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Peru\u2013Bolivian Confederation]], a short-lived union of Peru and Bolivia, was blocked by Chile in the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836\u20131839) and again during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883).

Despite the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] and the [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazilian War of Independence]], the new nations quickly began to suffer with internal conflicts and wars among themselves.\n\nIn 1825 the proclamation of independence of Cisplatina led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between historical rivals the [[Empire of Brazil]] and the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], Argentina's predecessor. The result was a stalemate, ending with the British arranging for the independence of Uruguay. Soon after, another Brazilian province proclaimed its independence leading to the [[Ragamuffin War]] which Brazil won.\n\nBetween 1836 and 1839 the [[War of the Confederation]] broke out between the short-lived [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] and [[Chile]], with the support of the [[Argentine Confederation]]. The war was fought mostly in the actual territory of [[Peru]] and ended with a Confederate defeat and the dissolution of the Confederacy and annexation of many territories by Argentina.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Argentine Civil Wars]] plagued Argentina since its independence. The conflict was mainly between those who defended the centralization of power in Buenos Aires and those who defended a confederation. During this period it can be said that \"there were two Argentines\": the [[Argentine Confederation]] and the [[Argentine Republic]]. At the same time the political instability in Uruguay led to the [[Uruguayan Civil War]] among the main political factions of the country. All this instability in the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin|platine region]] interfered with the goals of other countries such as Brazil, which was soon forced to take sides. In 1851 the [[Brazilian Empire]], supporting the centralizing unitarians, and the [[Uruguay|Uruguayan government]] invaded Argentina and deposed the caudillo, [[Juan Manuel Rosas]], who ruled the confederation with an iron hand. Although the [[Platine War]] did not put an end to the political chaos and civil war in Argentina, it brought temporary peace to Uruguay where the [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados faction]] won, supported by the [[Brazilian Empire]], [[British Empire]], [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] and the [[Unitarian Party]] of Argentina.<ref name=\"Latin America\u2019s Wars\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=khU0sFxgyjMC&pg=RA2-PA1844&dq=lorenzo%20latorre%20uruguay%20president#v=onepage&q=chapter%20twenty-five&f=false|title=Latin America's Wars|first=Robert L.|last=Scheina|date=31 January 2003|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1597974776}}</ref>\n\nPeace lasted only a short time: in 1864 the Uruguayan factions faced each other again in the [[Uruguayan War]]. The [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]] supported by Paraguay started to attack Brazilian and Argentine farmers near the borders. The Empire made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados without success. In 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, the imperial government declared that Brazil's military would begin reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and, for most of its duration, the Uruguayan\u2013Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war which led to the deposition of the ''Blancos'' and the rise of the pro-Brazilian ''Colorados'' to power again. This angered the Paraguayan government, which even before the end of the war invaded Brazil, beginning the biggest and deadliest war in both South American and Latin American histories: the Paraguayan War.\n\nThe Paraguayan War began when the Paraguayan dictator [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez]] ordered the invasion of the Brazilian provinces of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. His attempt to cross Argentinian territory without Argentinian approval led the pro-Brazilian Argentine government into the war. The pro-Brazilian Uruguayan government showed its support by sending troops. In 1865 the three countries signed the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance]] against Paraguay. At the beginning of the war, the Paraguayans took the lead with several victories, until the Triple Alliance organized to repel the invaders and fight effectively. This was the second [[total war]] experience in the world after the [[American Civil War]]. It was deemed the greatest war effort in the history of all participating countries, taking almost 6 years and ending with the complete devastation of Paraguay. The country lost 40% of its territory to Brazil and Argentina and lost 60% of its population, including 90% of the men. The dictator Lopez was killed in battle and a new government was instituted in alliance with Brazil, which maintained occupation forces in the country until 1876.<ref>{{cite web|language = Portuguese|url= http://www.historiadobrasil.net/guerraparaguai/ |title=A Guerra do Paraguai \u2013 Hist\u00f3ria \u2013 Resumo|last=Borges|first = Fernando Tadeu de Miranda|website=Historiadobrasil.net|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe last South American war in the 19th century was the [[War of the Pacific]] with Bolivia and Peru on one side and Chile on the other. In 1879 the war began with Chilean troops occupying Bolivian ports, followed by Bolivia declaring war on Chile which activated an alliance treaty with Peru. The Bolivians were completely defeated in 1880 and Lima was occupied in 1881. The peace was signed with Peru in 1883 while a truce was signed with Bolivia in 1884.

Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on [[Operation Condor|inter-state collaboration]]. Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of \"National Security\" against internal subversion.

There are several areas of sparse demographics such as [[tropical forest]]s, the [[Atacama Desert]] and the icy portions of [[Patagonia]]. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly [[Spaniards]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Italians]]), [[Africans]] and [[indigenous peoples]]. There is a high percentage of [[mestizos]] that vary greatly in composition by place. There is also a minor population of [[Asians]], especially in Brazil.

At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages.\n\nOther languages found in South America include [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] in Suriname; [[Italian language|Italian]] in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela; and [[German language|German]] in certain pockets of Argentina and Brazil.

Argentina is the third most populous country with {{UN_Population|Argentina}}.\n\nWhile Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. The largest cities in South America, by far, are S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Lima, and Bogot\u00e1. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and three of five in the [[Americas]]. Next in size are Caracas, Belo Horizonte, Medellin and Salvador.\n\nFive of the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Americas|top ten metropolitan areas]] are in Brazil. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 4 million and include the [[Greater S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area]], [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area]], and [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Belo Horizonte metropolitan area]]. Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within Brazil, Argentina is host to the second largest metropolitan area by population in South America: the [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires metropolitan region]] is above 13 million inhabitants.\n\nSouth America has also been witness to the growth of [[Megalopolis|megapolitan areas]]. In Brazil four megaregions exist including the [[Expanded Metropolitan Complex of S\u00e3o Paulo]] with more than 32 million inhabitants. The others are the Greater Rio, Greater Belo Horizonte and [[Greater Porto Alegre]]. Colombia also has four megaregions which comprise 72% of its population, followed by Venezuela, Argentina and Peru which are also homes of megaregions.\n\nThe top ten largest South American metropolitan areas by population as of 2015, based on national census numbers from each country:\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Metro Area'''\n| '''Population'''\n| '''Area'''\n| '''Country'''\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n| 21,090,792\n| {{convert|7947|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]]\n| 13,693,657\n| {{convert|3830|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Argentina\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro]]\n| 13,131,431\n| {{convert|6744|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Lima metropolitan area|Lima]]\n| 9,904,727\n| {{convert|2819|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Peru\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Metropolitan Area of Bogot\u00e1|Bogot\u00e1]]\n| 9,800,225\n| {{convert|4200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Colombia\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Santiago Metropolitan Region|Santiago]]\n| 6,683,852\n| {{convert|15403|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Chile\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Belo Horizonte]]\n| 5,829,923\n| {{convert|9467|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Caracas|Caracas]]\n| 5,322,310\n| {{convert|4715|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Venezuela\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Porto Alegre|Porto Alegre]]\n| 4,258,926\n| {{convert|10232|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Bras\u00edlia|Brasilia]]\n| 4,201,737\n| {{convert|56433|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|}\n<small>2015 Census figures.</small>\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of South America|List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (nominal)|List of South American countries by GDP (PPP)}}\n{{update-section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Banco del Sur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rafael Correa]], [[Evo Morales]], [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]], [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]], [[Nicanor Duarte]], and [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] signed the founding charter of the [[Bank of the South]].]]\n[[File:Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|left|Trading panel of the [[BM&F Bovespa|S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]] is the second biggest in the [[Americas]] and 13th in the world.]]\n[[File:Vista Parcial de Santiago de Chile 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Financial center of [[Santiago]], [[Chile]]]]\n[[File:Ariane 5ES liftoff from ELA-3.jpg|thumb|Launch at the [[Kourou Space Center]] in [[French Guiana]]]]\n[[File:Petrobrasbolivia2006.jpg|thumb|[[Refinery]] of Brazilian state-owned [[Petrobras]] in [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]]]]\n[[File:Chuqui001 02.jpg|thumb|[[Chuquicamata]] is the largest [[Open-pit mining|open pit mine]] in the world, near the city of [[Calama, Chile|Calama]] in Chile.]]\n[[File:Apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o KC-390 (15414135738).jpg|thumb|[[Embraer KC-390|KC-390]] is the largest military transport aircraft produced in South America by the Brazilian company [[Embraer]].]]\n[[File:Bodega chakana hacia la monta\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vineyard]] in [[Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo]], province of [[Mendoza, Argentina]]]]\n\nSouth America relies less on the export of both manufactured goods and natural resources than the world average; merchandise exports from the continent were 16% of GDP on an [[nominal GDP|exchange rate]] basis, compared to 25% for the world as a whole.<ref name=wfex/> Brazil (the seventh largest economy in the world and the largest in South America) leads [[List of countries by exports|in terms of merchandise exports]] at $251 billion, followed by Venezuela at $93 billion, Chile at $86 billion, and Argentina at $84 billion.<ref name=wfex/>\n\nSince 1930, the continent has experienced remarkable growth and diversification in most economic sectors. Most agricultural and livestock products are destined for the domestic market and local consumption. However, the export of [[agriculture|agricultural products]] is essential for the [[balance of trade]] in most countries.<ref name=\"Economy\">O Sistema Econ\u00f4mico / Am\u00e9rica do Sul.

The production of staple foods such as vegetables, corn or beans is large, but focused on domestic consumption. Livestock raising for meat exports is important in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia. In tropical regions the most important crops are [[coffee]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[bananas]], mainly in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. Traditionally, the countries producing [[sugar]] for export are Peru, Guyana and Suriname, and in Brazil, [[sugar cane]] is also used to make [[ethanol]]. On the coast of Peru, northeast and south of Brazil, [[cotton]] is grown. Fifty percent of the South American surface is covered by forests, but timber industries are small and directed to domestic markets. In recent years, however, transnational companies have been settling in the [[Amazon forest|Amazon]] to exploit noble timber destined for export. The Pacific coastal waters of South America are the most important for commercial fishing. The anchovy catch reaches thousands of tons, and tuna is also abundant (Peru is a major exporter). The capture of [[crustaceans]] is remarkable, particularly in northeastern Brazil and Chile.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nOnly Brazil and Argentina are part of the [[G20]] (industrial countries), while only Brazil is part of the [[G8+5]] (the most powerful and influential nations in the world). In the tourism sector, a series of negotiations began in 2005 to promote tourism and increase air connections within the region. [[Punta del Este]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]] and [[Mar del Plata]] are among the most important resorts in South America.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe most industrialized countries in South America are Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay respectively. These countries alone account for more than 75 percent of the region's economy and add up to a GDP of more than US$3.0 trillion. Industries in South America began to take on the economies of the region from the 1930s when the [[Great Depression]] in the United States and other countries of the world boosted industrial production in the continent. From that period the region left the agricultural side behind and began to achieve high rates of economic growth that remained until the early 1990s when they slowed due to political instabilities, economic crises and neoliberal policies.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nSince the end of the economic crisis in Brazil and Argentina that occurred in the period from 1998 to 2002, which has led to [[economic recession]], rising unemployment and falling population income, the industrial and service sectors have been recovering rapidly. Chile, Argentina and Brazil have recovered fastest, growing at an average of 5% per year. All of South America after this period has been recovering and showing good signs of economic stability, with controlled [[inflation]] and exchange rates, continuous growth, a decrease in [[social inequality]] and unemployment\u2013factors that favor industry.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe main industries are: electronics, textiles, food, automotive, metallurgy, aviation, naval, clothing, beverage, steel, tobacco, timber, chemical, among others. Exports reach almost US$400 billion annually, with Brazil accounting for half of this.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe [[Economic inequality|economic gap]] between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than on most other continents.

Some of the most famous genres include [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] from Colombia, [[pasillo]] from Colombia and Ecuador, [[samba]], [[bossa nova]] and [[m\u00fasica sertaneja]] from Brazil, and [[tango music|tango]] from Argentina and Uruguay.

In the late 20th century, [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish rock]] emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. [[Music of Brazil|Brazil]] has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres.  In the central and western regions of Bolivia, Andean and folklore music like [[Diablada]], [[Caporales]] and [[Morenada]] are the most representative of the country, which were originated by European, Aymara and Quechua influences.\n\nThe [[Spanish American literature|literature]] of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] in novels and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] in other genres. The Brazilians [[Machado de Assis]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa]] are widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian writers.\n\nBecause of South America's broad ethnic mix, [[South American cuisine]] has African, South American Indian, South Asian, East Asian, and European influences. [[Bahia]], Brazil, is especially well known for its West African\u2013influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians, Bolivians, and Venezuelans regularly consume wine. People in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Chile, Bolivia and Brazil drink [[mate (beverage)|mate]], an herb which is brewed. The Paraguayan version, [[terere]], differs from other forms of mate in that it is served cold. [[Pisco]] is a liquor distilled from grapes in Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, African, Arab, Andean, and Amazonic food.\n\n=== Plastic arts ===\n[[File:Fernando Botero, Bird (1990), Singapore - 20040616.jpg|thumb|''Bird'' (Singapore), sculpture of [[Fernando Botero]]]]\nThe artist [[Oswaldo Guayasam\u00edn]] (1919\u20131999) from [[Ecuador]], represented with his painting style the feeling of the peoples of Latin America<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.andes.info.ec/es/noticias/guayasamin-pintor-ecuatoriano-retrato-sufrimiento-pueblos-latinoamericanos.html|title=Guayasam\u00edn, el pintor ecuatoriano que retrat\u00f3 los sufrimientos latinoamericanos|last=|first=|date=|work=Andes, Agencia de Noticias|access-date=}}</ref> highlighting social injustices in various parts of the world.

Brazil holds the record at the FIFA World Cup with five titles in total. Argentina and Uruguay have two titles each. So far four South American nations have hosted the tournament including the first edition in Uruguay (1930). The other three were Brazil (1950, 2014), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978).\n\nSouth America is home to the longest running international football tournament; the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]], which has been regularly contested since 1916. Uruguay won the Copa Am\u00e9rica a record 15 times, surpassing hosts Argentina in 2011 to reach 15 titles (they were previously equal at 14 titles each during the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica).\n\nAlso, in South America, a multi-sport event, the [[South American Games]], are held every four years. The first edition was held in [[La Paz]] in 1978 and the most recent took place in [[Santiago]] in 2014.\n\n[[South American Cricket Championship]] is an international [[limited-overs cricket]] tournament played since 1995 featuring national teams from [[Sports in South America|South America]] and certain other invited sides including teams from North America, currently played annually but until 2013 was usually played every two seasons.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Molino de viento (moderno) 2014-09-21 (3).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jep\u00edrachi wind farm in the [[Guajira Peninsula]].]]\n===Energy===\nDue to the diversity of [[topography]] and pluviometric precipitation conditions, the region's water resources vary enormously in different areas. In the [[Andes]], navigation possibilities are limited, except for the Magdalena River, [[Lake Titicaca]] and the lakes of the southern regions of Chile and Argentina. Irrigation is an important factor for agriculture from northwestern Peru to Patagonia. Less than 10% of the known electrical potential of the Andes had been used until the mid-1960s.\n\nThe [[Brazilian Highlands]] has a much higher [[hydroelectric]] potential than the [[Andes|Andean region]] and its possibilities of exploitation are greater due to the existence of several large rivers with high margins and the occurrence of great differences forming huge cataracts, such as those of Paulo Afonso, Igua\u00e7u and others. The [[Amazon River]] system has about 13,000&nbsp;km of waterways, but its possibilities for hydroelectric use are still unknown.\n\nMost of the continent's energy is generated through [[hydroelectric power plants]], but there is also an important share of [[thermoelectric]] and [[wind energy]]. Brazil and Argentina are the only South American countries that generate [[nuclear power]], each with two [[nuclear power plants]]. In 1991 these countries signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement.\n\n{{wide image|Itaipu D\u00e9cembre 2007 - Vue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.jpg|1500px|Panoramic view of the [[Itaipu Dam]], the largest of the world in energy production.}}\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Ruta Panamericana Buenos Aires Florida.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stretch of the [[Pan-American Highway]] in Argentina]]\n[[File:Puerto-del-callao.jpg|thumb|The Port of Callao in Lima|alt=]]\n[[File:L\u00ednea Roja de Mi Telef\u00e9rico en La Paz, Bolivia.jpg|thumb|The La Paz cable car system in Bolivia is home to both the longest and highest urban cable car network in the world.]]\n\nSouth American transportation systems are still deficient, with low kilometric densities. The region has about 1,700,000&nbsp;km of [[highways]] and 100,000&nbsp;km of [[railways]], which are concentrated in the coastal strip, and the interior is still devoid of communication.\n\nOnly two railroads are continental: the Transandina, which connects [[Buenos Aires]], in Argentina to [[Valpara\u00edso]], in Chile, and the Brazil\u2013Bolivia Railroad, which makes it the connection between the port of [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]] in Brazil and the city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], in Bolivia. In addition, there is the [[Pan-American Highway]], which crosses the Andean countries from north to south, although some stretches are unfinished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=88271|title=A Gap in the Andes : Image of the Day|date=2 April 2015|website=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=22 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTwo areas of greater density occur in the railway sector: the platinum network, which develops around the [[Platine region]], largely belonging to Argentina, with more than 45,000&nbsp;km in length; And the [[Southeast Brazil]] network, which mainly serves the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|state of S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. Brazil and Argentina also stand out in the road sector. In addition to the modern roads that extend through northern Argentina and south-east and south of Brazil, a vast road complex aims to link [[Bras\u00edlia]], the federal capital, to the South, Southeast, Northeast and Northern regions of Brazil.\n\nThe Port of Callao is the main port of Peru.\nSouth America has one of the largest bays of navigable inland waterways in the world, represented mainly by the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Platine basin]], the S\u00e3o Francisco and the Orinoco basins, Brazil having about 54,000&nbsp;km navigable, while Argentina has 6,500&nbsp;km and Venezuela, 1,200&nbsp;km.\n\nThe two main merchant fleets also belong to Brazil and Argentina. The following are those of Chile, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia. The largest ports in commercial movement are those of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]], [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], [[Valpara\u00edso]], [[Recife]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Montevideo]], [[Paranagu\u00e1]], [[Rio Grande]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Bel\u00e9m]] and [[Maracaibo]].\n\nIn South America, [[commercial aviation]] has a magnificent expansion field, which has one of the largest traffic density lines in the world, Rio de Janeiro\u2013S\u00e3o Paulo, and large airports, such as [[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Congonhas Airport|Congonhas]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport|S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International]] and [[Viracopos International Airport|Viracopos]] (S\u00e3o Paulo), [[Rio de Janeiro\u2013Gale\u00e3o International Airport|Rio de Janeiro International]] and [[Santos Dumont Airport|Santos Dumont]] (Rio de Janeiro), [[El Dorado International Airport|El Dorado]] (Bogot\u00e1), [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Ezeiza]] (Buenos Aires), [[Tancredo Neves International Airport]] (Belo Horizonte), [[Afonso Pena International Airport|Curitiba International Airport]] (Curitiba), Brasilia, Caracas, Montevideo, Lima, [[Viru Viru International Airport]] (Santa Cruz de la Sierra), Recife, Salvador, Salgado Filho International Airport (Porto Alegre), Fortaleza, Manaus and Bel\u00e9m.\n\nThe main public transport in major cities is the bus.

Such exact purism was typical of Wundt and he instructed all introspection observations be performed under these same instructions: \"1) the Observer must, if possible, be in a position to determine beforehand the entrance of the process to be observed. 2) the introspectionist must, as far as possible, grasp the phenomenon in a state of strained attention and follow its course. 3) Every observation must, in order to make certain, be capable of being repeated several times under the same conditions and 4) the conditions under which the phenomenon appears must be found out by the variation of the attendant circumstances and when this was done the various coherent experiments must be varied according to a plan partly by eliminating certain stimuli and partly by grading their strength and quality\".<ref name=\"Asthana 244\u2013248\"/>\n\n===Titchener===\n[[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]] was an early pioneer in experimental psychology and student of Wilhelm Wundt.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> After earning his doctorate under the tutelage of Wundt at the University of Leipzig, he made his way to [[Cornell University]], where he established his own laboratory and research.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> When Titchener arrived at Cornell in 1894, psychology was still a fledgling discipline, especially in the United States, and Titchener was a key figure in bringing Wundt's ideas to America. However, Titchener misrepresented some of Wundt's ideas to the American psychological establishment, especially in his account of introspection which, Titchener taught, only served a purpose in the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] analysis of [[consciousness]] into its various parts,<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> while Wundt saw it as a means to [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] measure the whole of conscious experience.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Titchener was exclusively interested in the individual components that comprise conscious experience, while Wundt, seeing little purpose in the analysis of individual components, focused on synthesis of these components. Ultimately, Titchener's ideas would form the basis of the short-lived psychological theory of [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]].<ref name=\"Schultz\" />\n\n===Historical misconceptions===\nAmerican [[historiography]] of introspection, according to some authors,<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\">{{cite journal|last=Costal|first=A|title='Introspectionism' and the mythical origins of scientific psychology|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2006|volume=15|issue=4|pages=634\u2013654|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.008|pmid=17174788}}</ref><ref name=\"Clegg 2013\">{{cite book|last=Clegg|first=Joshua|title=Self-observation in the social science|year=2013|publisher=Transaction|location=New Jersey}}</ref> is dominated by three misconceptions. In particular, historians of psychology tend to argue 1) that introspection once was the dominant method of psychological inquiry, 2) that behaviorism, and in particular [[John B. Watson]], is responsible for discrediting introspection as a valid method, and 3) that scientific [[psychology]] completely abandoned introspection as a result of those critiques.<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\"/> Yet, introspection has not been the dominant method. It is believed to be so because [[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]]'s student [[Edwin G. Boring]], in his influential historical accounts of experimental psychology, privileged Titchener's views while giving little credit to original sources.<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\"/> Introspection has been critiqued by many other psychologists, including [[Wilhelm Wundt]], and [[Knight Dunlap]] who in his article \"[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Dunlap/introspection.htm ''The Case Against Introspection'']\", presents an argument against self-observation that is not primarily rooted in behaviorist epistemology. Introspection is still widely used in psychology, but under different names, such as self-report surveys, interviews and fMRIs.<ref name=\"Clegg 2013\"/> It is not the method but rather its name that has been dropped from the dominant psychological vocabulary.\n\n===Recent developments===\n{{See also|Introspection illusion}}\nPartly as a result of Titchener's misrepresentation, the use of introspection diminished after his death and the subsequent decline of structuralism.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Later psychological movements, such as [[functional psychology|functionalism]] and [[behaviorism]], rejected introspection for its lack of scientific [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] among other factors.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Functionalism originally arose in direct opposition to structuralism, opposing its narrow focus on the elements of consciousness<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> and emphasising the purpose of consciousness and other psychological behavior.

For example, in the \"[[think aloud protocol]]\", investigators cue participants to speak their thoughts aloud in order to study an active thought process without forcing an individual to comment on the process itself.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = S.

[[David Hume]] pointed out that introspecting a mental state tends to alter the very state itself; a German author, [[Christian Gottfried Sch\u00fctz]], noted that introspection is often described as mere \"inner sensation\", but actually requires also attention, that introspection does not get at unconscious mental states, and that it cannot be used naively - one needs to know what to look for. [[Immanuel Kant]] added that, if they are understood too narrowly, introspective experiments are impossible. Introspection delivers, at best, hints about what goes on in the mind; it does not suffice to justify knowledge claims about the mind.<ref>Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch.s 2 and 4.</ref> Similarly, the idea continued to be discussed between [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Auguste Comte]]. \nRecent psychological research on [[cognition]] and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] has asked people to report on their mental processes, for instance to say why they made a particular choice or how they arrived at a judgment.

Jack and Roepstorff assert, '...there is also a sense in which subjects simply cannot be wrong about their own experiential states.' Presumably they arrived at this conclusion by drawing on the seemingly self-evident quality of their own introspections, and assumed that it must equally apply to others. However, when we consider research on the topic, this conclusion seems less self-evident. If, for example, extensive introspection can cause people to make decisions that they later regret, then one very reasonable possibility is that the introspection caused them to 'lose touch with their feelings'. In short, empirical studies suggest that people can fail to appraise adequately (i.e. are wrong about) their own experiential states.\n\nAnother question in regards to the veracious accountability of introspection is  if researchers lack the confidence in their own introspections and those of their participants, then how can it gain legitimacy? Three strategies  are accountable: identifying behaviors that establish credibility, finding common ground that enables mutual understanding, and developing a trust that allows one to know when to give the benefit of the doubt.\nThat is to say, that words are only meaningful if validated by one's actions; When people report strategies, feelings or beliefs, their  behaviors must correspond with these statements if they are to be believed.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01970-8 | volume=6 | issue=9 | title=Establishing a legitimate relationship with introspection | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | pages=371\u2013372| year=2002 | last1=Schooler | first1=Jonathan W. }}</ref>\n\nEven when their introspections are uninformative, people still give confident descriptions of their mental processes, being \"unaware of their unawareness\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Yoav Bar-Anan|date=August 22, 2008|title=The Unseen Mind|journal=Science|volume=321|pages=1046\u20131047|doi=10.1126/science.1163029|pmid=18719269|issue=5892 }}</ref> This phenomenon has been termed the ''introspection illusion'' and has been used to explain some [[cognitive bias]]es<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|date=January 2007|title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37\u201343|issn=1364-6613|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001|pmid=17129749}}</ref> and belief in some [[paranormal]] phenomena.<ref name=\"selfismagic\">{{cite book|last=Wegner|first=Daniel M.|title=Are we free?: psychology and free will|editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C.

Such exact purism was typical of Wundt and he instructed all introspection observations be performed under these same instructions: \"1) the Observer must, if possible, be in a position to determine beforehand the entrance of the process to be observed. 2) the introspectionist must, as far as possible, grasp the phenomenon in a state of strained attention and follow its course. 3) Every observation must, in order to make certain, be capable of being repeated several times under the same conditions and 4) the conditions under which the phenomenon appears must be found out by the variation of the attendant circumstances and when this was done the various coherent experiments must be varied according to a plan partly by eliminating certain stimuli and partly by grading their strength and quality\".<ref name=\"Asthana 244\u2013248\"/>\n\n===Titchener===\n[[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]] was an early pioneer in experimental psychology and student of Wilhelm Wundt.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> After earning his doctorate under the tutelage of Wundt at the University of Leipzig, he made his way to [[Cornell University]], where he established his own laboratory and research.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> When Titchener arrived at Cornell in 1894, psychology was still a fledgling discipline, especially in the United States, and Titchener was a key figure in bringing Wundt's ideas to America. However, Titchener misrepresented some of Wundt's ideas to the American psychological establishment, especially in his account of introspection which, Titchener taught, only served a purpose in the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] analysis of [[consciousness]] into its various parts,<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> while Wundt saw it as a means to [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] measure the whole of conscious experience.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Titchener was exclusively interested in the individual components that comprise conscious experience, while Wundt, seeing little purpose in the analysis of individual components, focused on synthesis of these components. Ultimately, Titchener's ideas would form the basis of the short-lived psychological theory of [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]].<ref name=\"Schultz\" />\n\n===Historical misconceptions===\nAmerican [[historiography]] of introspection, according to some authors,<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\">{{cite journal|last=Costal|first=A|title='Introspectionism' and the mythical origins of scientific psychology|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2006|volume=15|issue=4|pages=634\u2013654|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.008|pmid=17174788}}</ref><ref name=\"Clegg 2013\">{{cite book|last=Clegg|first=Joshua|title=Self-observation in the social science|year=2013|publisher=Transaction|location=New Jersey}}</ref> is dominated by three misconceptions. In particular, historians of psychology tend to argue 1) that introspection once was the dominant method of psychological inquiry, 2) that behaviorism, and in particular [[John B. Watson]], is responsible for discrediting introspection as a valid method, and 3) that scientific [[psychology]] completely abandoned introspection as a result of those critiques.<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\"/> Yet, introspection has not been the dominant method. It is believed to be so because [[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]]'s student [[Edwin G. Boring]], in his influential historical accounts of experimental psychology, privileged Titchener's views while giving little credit to original sources.<ref name=\"Costal 2006 634\u2013654\"/> Introspection has been critiqued by many other psychologists, including [[Wilhelm Wundt]], and [[Knight Dunlap]] who in his article \"[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Dunlap/introspection.htm ''The Case Against Introspection'']\", presents an argument against self-observation that is not primarily rooted in behaviorist epistemology. Introspection is still widely used in psychology, but under different names, such as self-report surveys, interviews and fMRIs.<ref name=\"Clegg 2013\"/> It is not the method but rather its name that has been dropped from the dominant psychological vocabulary.\n\n===Recent developments===\n{{See also|Introspection illusion}}\nPartly as a result of Titchener's misrepresentation, the use of introspection diminished after his death and the subsequent decline of structuralism.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Later psychological movements, such as [[functional psychology|functionalism]] and [[behaviorism]], rejected introspection for its lack of scientific [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] among other factors.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> Functionalism originally arose in direct opposition to structuralism, opposing its narrow focus on the elements of consciousness<ref name=\"Schultz\" /> and emphasising the purpose of consciousness and other psychological behavior. Behaviorism's objection to introspection focused much more on its unreliability and [[objectivity (science)|subjectivity]] which conflicted with behaviorism's focus on measurable behavior.<ref name=\"Schultz\" /><ref>{{cite book |title = The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences |editor-first=Robert Andrew |editor-last=Wilson |editor2=Keil, Frank C. | url = https://books.google.com/?id=-wt1aZrGXLYC&printsec=frontcover | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262731447 |year=2001 }}</ref>\n\nThe more recently established [[cognitive psychology]] movement has to some extent accepted introspection's usefulness in the study of psychological phenomena, though generally only in experiments pertaining to internal thought conducted under experimental conditions. For example, in the \"[[think aloud protocol]]\", investigators cue participants to speak their thoughts aloud in order to study an active thought process without forcing an individual to comment on the process itself.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = S.

[[David Hume]] pointed out that introspecting a mental state tends to alter the very state itself; a German author, [[Christian Gottfried Sch\u00fctz]], noted that introspection is often described as mere \"inner sensation\", but actually requires also attention, that introspection does not get at unconscious mental states, and that it cannot be used naively - one needs to know what to look for. [[Immanuel Kant]] added that, if they are understood too narrowly, introspective experiments are impossible. Introspection delivers, at best, hints about what goes on in the mind; it does not suffice to justify knowledge claims about the mind.<ref>Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch.s 2 and 4.</ref> Similarly, the idea continued to be discussed between [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Auguste Comte]]. \nRecent psychological research on [[cognition]] and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] has asked people to report on their mental processes, for instance to say why they made a particular choice or how they arrived at a judgment.

Jack and Roepstorff assert, '...there is also a sense in which subjects simply cannot be wrong about their own experiential states.' Presumably they arrived at this conclusion by drawing on the seemingly self-evident quality of their own introspections, and assumed that it must equally apply to others. However, when we consider research on the topic, this conclusion seems less self-evident. If, for example, extensive introspection can cause people to make decisions that they later regret, then one very reasonable possibility is that the introspection caused them to 'lose touch with their feelings'. In short, empirical studies suggest that people can fail to appraise adequately (i.e. are wrong about) their own experiential states.\n\nAnother question in regards to the veracious accountability of introspection is  if researchers lack the confidence in their own introspections and those of their participants, then how can it gain legitimacy? Three strategies  are accountable: identifying behaviors that establish credibility, finding common ground that enables mutual understanding, and developing a trust that allows one to know when to give the benefit of the doubt.\nThat is to say, that words are only meaningful if validated by one's actions; When people report strategies, feelings or beliefs, their  behaviors must correspond with these statements if they are to be believed.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01970-8 | volume=6 | issue=9 | title=Establishing a legitimate relationship with introspection | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | pages=371\u2013372| year=2002 | last1=Schooler | first1=Jonathan W. }}</ref>\n\nEven when their introspections are uninformative, people still give confident descriptions of their mental processes, being \"unaware of their unawareness\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Yoav Bar-Anan|date=August 22, 2008|title=The Unseen Mind|journal=Science|volume=321|pages=1046\u20131047|doi=10.1126/science.1163029|pmid=18719269|issue=5892 }}</ref> This phenomenon has been termed the ''introspection illusion'' and has been used to explain some [[cognitive bias]]es<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|date=January 2007|title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37\u201343|issn=1364-6613|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001|pmid=17129749}}</ref> and belief in some [[paranormal]] phenomena.<ref name=\"selfismagic\">{{cite book|last=Wegner|first=Daniel M.|title=Are we free?: psychology and free will|editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C.

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n{| style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]].\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]].\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet soon caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat. \n\nHood's front fleet braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the French as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\".<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.86</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse soon realized that the main British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to return to protect the merchant convoy.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|Main stages of the battle]]\n\nIn the following days the two fleets faced each other parallel but both sides kept their distance as they repaired their ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nOn 12 April, the French were sighted a short distance away, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes. A French straggler, {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} ([[Seventy-four (ship)|74 guns]]), was spotted and was chased by four British ships as De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n=== Breaking of the line ===\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''.

As she slowed, she duelled with de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns. The rest of the ships soon followed, [[Raking fire|raking]] the French as they did so, causing high casualties amongst the soldiers and sailors.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\">O'Shaughnessy p. 315-17</ref> Around 9 am, Drake's rearmost ship, {{HMS|Russell|1764|6}}, cleared the end of the French fleet and hauled wind; while his ships had taken some damage, they had inflicted a severe battering on the French.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} was the first victim; virtually a sitting duck, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships began milling around; ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the French line, blasting her way through; this piercing was followed by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]], to the south, also immediately capitalized on the opportunity and led the rearmost of the British ships through the French line, inflicting significant damage. The French tried to restore order; around 1:30 pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled line on the port tack, but this was not fulfilled; he was soon battling Hood's 90-gun HMS ''Barfleur''.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}}, which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> ''Ardent'' soon followed, being taken by the rest of the British centre.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\"/>\n[[File:Fin du C\u00e9sar-Dumoulin-IMG 5478.JPG|thumb|220px|''The end of the C\u00e9sar'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nAt 4 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', alone and being battered by ''Barfleur'', with little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated. [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, succeeded in rallying eight ships of his own division.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nFinally, the isolated ''Ville de Paris'', being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood took the surrender; the boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, Ville de Paris presented a scene of complete horror.

Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> With a fire out of control, the [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]] aboard the ''C\u00e9sar'' exploded, killing more than 400 French and 50 British sailors, although many men jumped overboard trying to avoid the disaster.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, learning of Grasse's fate, assumed command of the scattered French naval fleet. On 13 April, he had ten ships with him and sailed toward [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe British lost 243 killed and 816 wounded, and two captains of 36 were killed. The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n[[File:Barnard's History of England - Rodney accepts the surrender of deGrasse.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1785 engraving of de Grasse surrendering to Rodney.]]\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

He was created a [[Peerage|peer]] with \u00a32,000 a year settled on the title in perpetuity for this victory. Hood was elevated to the peerage as well, while Drake and Affleck were made [[baronet]]s.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nFollowing the Franco-American [[Siege of Yorktown|victory at Yorktown]] the previous year, and the [[Second Rockingham Ministry|change of Government]] in England, peace negotiations among Britain, the American colonies, France, and Spain had begun in early 1782. The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n{| style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n==The Lines==\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]].\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]].\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n==Pre-Battle Movements==\n\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet soon caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat. \n\nHood's front fleet braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the French as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\".<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.86</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse soon realized that the main British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to return to protect the merchant convoy.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|Main stages of the battle]]\n\nIn the following days the two fleets faced each other parallel but both sides kept their distance as they repaired their ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nOn 12 April, the French were sighted a short distance away, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes. A French straggler, {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} ([[Seventy-four (ship)|74 guns]]), was spotted and was chased by four British ships as De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n=== Breaking of the line ===\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship \u2018Formidable\u2019 breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' opened fire and engaged the French centre. As she slowed, she duelled with de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns. The rest of the ships soon followed, [[Raking fire|raking]] the French as they did so, causing high casualties amongst the soldiers and sailors.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\">O'Shaughnessy p. 315-17</ref> Around 9 am, Drake's rearmost ship, {{HMS|Russell|1764|6}}, cleared the end of the French fleet and hauled wind; while his ships had taken some damage, they had inflicted a severe battering on the French.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} was the first victim; virtually a sitting duck, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships began milling around; ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the French line, blasting her way through; this piercing was followed by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]], to the south, also immediately capitalized on the opportunity and led the rearmost of the British ships through the French line, inflicting significant damage. The French tried to restore order; around 1:30 pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled line on the port tack, but this was not fulfilled; he was soon battling Hood's 90-gun HMS ''Barfleur''.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}}, which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> ''Ardent'' soon followed, being taken by the rest of the British centre.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\"/>\n[[File:Fin du C\u00e9sar-Dumoulin-IMG 5478.JPG|thumb|220px|''The end of the C\u00e9sar'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nAt 4 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', alone and being battered by ''Barfleur'', with little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated. [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, succeeded in rallying eight ships of his own division.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nFinally, the isolated ''Ville de Paris'', being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood took the surrender; the boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, Ville de Paris presented a scene of complete horror.

Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> With a fire out of control, the [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]] aboard the ''C\u00e9sar'' exploded, killing more than 400 French and 50 British sailors, although many men jumped overboard trying to avoid the disaster.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, learning of Grasse's fate, assumed command of the scattered French naval fleet. On 13 April, he had ten ships with him and sailed toward [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe British lost 243 killed and 816 wounded, and two captains of 36 were killed. The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n[[File:Barnard's History of England - Rodney accepts the surrender of deGrasse.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1785 engraving of de Grasse surrendering to Rodney.]]\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

Hood was elevated to the peerage as well, while Drake and Affleck were made [[baronet]]s.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nFollowing the Franco-American [[Siege of Yorktown|victory at Yorktown]] the previous year, and the [[Second Rockingham Ministry|change of Government]] in England, peace negotiations among Britain, the American colonies, France, and Spain had begun in early 1782. The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

The flagship news program ''[[News Watch 9]]'' is also bilingual and also airs on NHK General TV and the international channels and NHK World Premium. ''World News'' is aired on NHK BS 1 with ''Catch! Sekai no Top News'' in the morning and ''International News Report'' at night, with the latter also airing on NHK World Premium.

By the late 1930s NHK's overseas broadcasts were known as '''Radio Tokyo''', which became an official name in 1941.\n\nIn November 1941, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] nationalised all public news agencies and coordinated their efforts via the Information Liaison Confidential Committee.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} All published and broadcast news reports became official announcements of the Imperial Army General Headquarters in Tokyo for the duration of [[World War II]].

Japanese-American radio broadcaster [[Frank Shozo Baba]] joined NHK during this time and led an early post-war revamp of its programming. Radio Japan resumed overseas broadcasts in 1952.\n\nA new Broadcasting Act (\"H\u014ds\u014d H\u014d\") was enacted in 1950, which made NHK a listener-supported independent corporation and simultaneously opened the market for [[commercial broadcasting]] in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p08/index.html|title=Broadcast Law: Broadcasting for the Public|accessdate=27 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018085435/http://www.nhk.or.jp/strl/aboutstrl/evolution-of-tv-en/p08/index.html|archivedate=18 October 2015}}</ref> NHK started [[television]] broadcasting in the same year, followed by its Educational TV channel in 1959 and color television broadcasts in 1960.\n\nNHK opened the first stage of [[NHK Broadcasting Center|its current headquarters]] in the [[special wards of Tokyo|special ward]] of [[Tokyo|Japan's capital city]] [[Shibuya]] as an international broadcasting center for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], the first widely televised Olympic Games.
