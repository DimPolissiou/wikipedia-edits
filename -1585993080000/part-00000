Delville was the leading exponent of the Belgian Idealist movement in art during the 1890s. He held, throughout his life, the belief that art should be the expression of a higher spiritual truth and that it should be based on the principle of Ideal, or spiritual Beauty. He executed a great number of paintings during his active career from 1887 to the end of the second World War (many now lost or destroyed) expressing his Idealist aesthetic. Delville was trained at the ''Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-arts'' in Brussels and proved to be a highly precocious student, winning most of the prestigious competition prizes at the Academy while still a young student. He later won the [[Prix de Rome (Belgium)|Belgian Prix de Rome]] which allowed him to travel to Rome and Florence and study at first hand the works of the artists of the Renaissance. During his time in Italy he created his celebrated masterpiece ''[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/oeuvres-commentees/recherche/commentaire_id/lecole-de-platon-208.html?no_cache=1 L'Ecole de Platon]'' (1898), which stands as a visual summary of his Idealist aesthetic which he promoted during the 1890s in his writings, poetry and exhibitions societies, notably the ''Salons d'Art Id\u00e9aliste''.\n\nCharacteristically, Delville's paintings are idea-based, expressing philosophical ideals derived from contemporary hermetic and esoteric traditions. At the start of his career, his esoteric perspective was mostly influenced by the work of [[Eliphas Levi]], [[Edouard Schur\u00e9]], [[Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan]] and [[Saint-Yves d'Alveydre]], and later by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] writings of [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Annie Besant]]. The main underlying theme of his paintings, especially during his early career, has to do with initiation and the transfiguration of the inner life of the soul towards a higher spiritual purpose. Specifically they deal with themes symbolising Ideal love, death and transfiguration as well as representations of Initiates ('light bringers'), and the relationship between the material and metaphysical dimensions. His paintings and finished drawings are an expression of a highly sensitive visionary imagination articulated through precisely observed forms drawn from nature. He also had a brilliant gift for colour and composition and excelled in the representation of human anatomy. Many of his major paintings, such as his ''Les Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'' (1895), ''l'Homme-Dieu'' (1903) and ''Les Ames errantes'' (1942), represent dozens of figures intertwined in complex arrangements and painted with highly detailed anatomical accuracy. He was an astonishingly skilled draughtsman and painter capable of producing highly expressive works on a grand scale, many of which can be seen in public buildings in Brussels, including the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palais de Justice]].\n\nDelville's artistic style is strongly influenced by the Classical tradition. He was a lifelong advocate of the value of the Classical training taught in the Academies. He believed that the discipline acquired as a result of this training was not an end in itself, but rather a valuable means of acquiring a solid drawing and painting technique to allow artists freely to develop their personal artistic style, without inhibiting their individual creative personality. Delville was a respected Academic art teacher. He was employed at the [[Glasgow School of Art]] from 1900 to 1906 and as Professor of drawing at the ''Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-arts'' in Brussels thereafter until 1937.\n\nHe was also a prolific and talented author. He published a very great number of journal articles during his lifetime as well as four volumes of poetry, including his ''Le Frisson du Sphinx'' (1897) and ''Les Splendeurs M\u00e9connues (1922)''. He authored more than a dozen books and pamphlets relating to art and esoteric subjects. The most important of his published books include his esoteric works, ''Dialogue entre Nous'' (1895) and ''Le Christ Reviendra'' (1913) as well as his seminal work on Idealist art, ''La Mission de l'Art'' (1900). He also created and edited several contemporary journals and newspapers during the 1890s promoting his Idealist aesthetic including ''L'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' and ''La Lumi\u00e8re''.\n\nDelville was an energetic artistic entrepreneur, creating several influential artistic exhibition societies, including ''Pour l'Art'' and the ''Salons de l'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' in the 1890s and later, the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Art Monumental'' in the 1920s which was responsible for the decoration of public buildings including the mosaics in the hemicycle of the [[Cinquantenaire]] in Brussels. He also founded the very successful ''Coop\u00e9rative artistique'', which provided affordable art materials for artists at the time.\n\n==Early years and training==\nDelville was born on 19 January 1867 at 2.00 a.m., rue des Dominicains in [[Louvain, Belgium|Louvain]]. He was born illegitimate into a working class household. His mother was Barbe Libert (1833\u20131905), the daughter of a [[canal]] worker who earned a living as a 'journali\u00e8re' as an adult. Delville never knew his father Joachim Thibault who was a lecturer in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] at a local college and who came from a [[bourgeoisie]] family. He bore his mother's name until she married a functionary working in Louvain, Victor Delville (1840\u20131918). Victor adopted Jean who, until then, was known as Jean Libert. The family moved to [[Brussels]] in 1870 and settled in Boulevard Waterloo near [[Porte de Hal]]. The Delville family later moved to St Gilles where Delville began his schooling at the ''Ecole Communale'' in rue du Fort.\n\nDelville took an early interest in drawing, even though his initial career ambitions were to become a Doctor. He was introduced to the artist Sti\u00e9venart by his adoptive grandfather, Fran\u00e7ois Delville, while still a young boy. Delville recalls that this was 'the first artist I had ever seen, and for me, as a child, still unaware of my vocation, this was an enchanting experience.'<ref>Quoted in Armand Eggermont, 'Jean Delville. Peintre de la Figure et de l\u2019Id\u00e9e', 19 janvier 1867-19 janvier 1953, ''Le Thyrse'', IVe s\u00e9rie, no. 4 (1 April 1953), p. 152.</ref>\n\nAt the age of twelve, Delville entered the famous ''Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Royale'' in Brussels. His interest in art developed around this time and he received his father's permission to enroll in evening drawing classes at the ''Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-arts'' in the rue du Midi in 1879. He entered the course for drawing 'apr\u00e8s la t\u00eate antique' (after the classical head) and in 1882 classes for drawing 'apr\u00e8s le torse et figure' (after torso and face). Soon after he gave up his schooling at the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e to study full-time at the Acad\u00e9mie. In 1883, he enrolled in the 'cours de peinture d\u2019apr\u00e8s nature' (class in painting after nature) under the direction of the celebrated teacher [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels]] (1818\u20131895). Portaels objected to Delville's youth, but he excelled in the entrance examination and was unconditionally admitted to study painting under Portaels and [[Joseph Stallaert]]. Delville was a precocious talent and at age 17 won many of the major prizes at the Academy including 'drawing after nature', 'painting after nature', 'historical composition' (with high distinction), 'drawing after the antique', and \u2018[[figure painting]]\u2019.<ref>Miriam Delville, 'Jean Delville, mon grand-p\u00e8re' in Laoureux, et al. ''Jean Delville, Ma\u00eetre de l'id\u00e9al'', pp. 14ff; and Brendan Cole. ''Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute''. pp. 19\u201322.</ref>\n\n==Artistic career 1887\u20131900==\n\n===L'Essor, 1887\u20131891===\nDelville first exhibited in a public context at the moderate exhibition society called ''l'Essor'' from 1887 to 1891. His early works were largely depictions of working class -and peasant life executed in a contemporary realist style influenced by Constant Meunier. Delville's early efforts exhibited in 1887 were largely favourably reviewed in the contemporary press, notably ''[[L'Art Moderne]]'' and the ''Journal de Bruxelles'', even if they were seen to be eclectic and derivative of the works of older established artists. These included works inspired by Baudelaire's poetry including his ''Frontispiece'' and ''L'\u00e9pave'' (now lost) and his main work ''La Terre'' of which a detailed drawing still survives.\n\nThe following year his works were singled out as among the most outstanding of the 1888 exhibitors at L'Essor. This was the year in which he exhibited his highly controversial study for his painting ''La M\u00e8re'' depicting a woman in labour. A contemporary review described it in the following: 'On a huge bed with purple sheets ... a dishevelled standing woman displays her nudity as she writhes in spasmodic movements, bending under the pains of childbirth. Her face is contorted, her gnashing teeth alternate with the curse, her clenched hands lift the bed cover over her belly in an unconscious reflex of modesty ... abominable vision ....! and poor women!' This subject, rarely depicted in art, was seen to be shocking and contrary to bourgeois taste. It does however signal an aspect of Delville's art to depict ideas that are vivid and provocative. \n\nDuring the 1880s, Delville's work tended towards social realism. This included images of workers and peasants (''Soir'' and ''Paysan'', 1888); of beggars and destitution (''Asile de nuit'', 1885); of hunger (''L\u2019Affam\u00e9'',1887) and ultimately of death (''Le Dernier Sommeil'', 1888). Here he focussed on themes of poverty, despair and hopelessness. In an undated drawing titled ''Le las d\u2019Aller'' Delville depicts a fallen figure curled up on his side in a barren landscape, asleep, or perhaps even dead. However, during the period 1888-9 his artistic interests started developing in a more non-realist direction and began to move towards Idealism which dominated his work from then on. This was first indicated in his ''Fragment d\u2019une composition: Le cycle de la passion'' (now lost) displayed at L'Essor in 1889. The final work ''Le Cycle passionnel'' (9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;6 metres) was displayed at ''L'Essor'' the following year (1890) and was inspired by Dante's ''Divine Comedy''. It depicts a vast composition of intertwined figures floating through the nether regions of hell. The theme concerns lovers who have succumbed to their erotic passions. One of the main themes of initiation is to control one's lower passions in order to achieve spiritual transcendence. This painting of this work represents this idea in metaphoric form. This is an early major work by Delville sadly destroyed in the incendiary attack on Louvain in 1914. Despite its importance, it was not received with much enthusiasm in the contemporary press.\n\nAnother work that display Delville's growing interest in non-realist ideas during the 1880s is his more well-known''Tristan et Yseult'' (Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels, 1887). The work is inspired by Wagner's eponymous opera and deals with the relationship between love and death and the idea of transcendence that can be achieved through both. It is an early work that reveals themes closely related to the initiatory tradition which is fully discussed in Brendan Cole's recent book on Delville.\n\nA further important work dealing with non-realist, or Idealist, subject matter was exhibited by Delville at the final ''L'Essor'' exhibition in 1891 titled '' La Symbolisation de la chair et de l'\u00e9sprit'' (the original is lost, but a detailed study recently came up for auction). It depicts a naked female figure dragging a nude male beath the water. Bright light appears above the male figure while dark sub-aquatic vegetation surrounds the base of the female. The initiatory theme here is self-evident in its depiction of the conflict between spirit (light) and matter (dark vegetation). The male aspires towards the light but is dragged down towards the bottom of the dark mass of water. The work establishes an essential duality between consciousness/unconsciousness, light/dark, as well as spirituality and materialism. In Delville's writings he emphasises this duality and its reconciliation; a theme that pervades much of Symbolist art and writings and was conspicuous amongst Romantic artists as well, especially the writings of Goethe. The theme dominates Delville's art. He wrote that:\n<blockquote>'Men have two very distinct trends in them. One of these two trends is physical, which must, of course, provide for his preservation by physical means, having the task of sustaining tangible life, sustaining the body. The other trend, which is not only immaterial but indefinable, is that which arises as a perpetual aspiration beyond the material, for which this world is not enough: it is this 'something else' that overcomes all distances or is, rather, unknowable. This is the very threshold of the occult world, in front of which all science, seized with unsteadiness, prostrates itself in the insuperable premonition of a world beyond!'<ref>Jean Delville, 'Conf\u00e9rence sur 'Comment on Devient Mage\" du Sar M\u00e9rodack J. P\u00e9ladan', ''Le Mouvement Litt\u00e9raire'', 45 (8 D\u00e9cembre 1893), p. 357.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Pour L'Art 1892\u20131895===\nDelville's growing interest in Idealist art led him to instigate a succession from ''L'Essor'' to start a new exhibition society called ''Pour L'Art''. Many of the younger artists of ''L'Essor'' followed him which led to the dissolution of that group. ''Pour L'Art'' became one of the noted avant-garde exhibition societies on Brussels at the time. The leading avant-garde exhibition forum at the time was ''Les XX''. Following ''Les XX'',  ''Pour L'Art'' invited international artists as well, several of whom became well known in Symbolist circles, including Carlos Schwabe, Alexandre S\u00e9on, Chales Filiger and Jan Verkade. Their first exhibition took place in November 1892 and the works displayed were executed in either an Impressionist or Symbolist idiom. Delville designed the poster for the first exhibition depicting a long-necked sphinx \u2013 a key symbol of the period \u2013 cupping a flaming chalice in her hands. Delville's main work of that year was his ''L'Idole de la Perversit\u00e9'' which can be considered one of the major images of the period. The new group received a largely positive press during the time. The group was closely associated with Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan's ''Salons de la Rose+Croix'' in Paris, and P\u00e9ladan was frequently invited to lecture in Brussels at the time by members of the ''Pour L'Art'' group.\n\nThe second exhibition of the Pour L'Art group took place in January 1894. Significantly the society also included the applied, or decorative arts, which were become widely popular at the time and a particular feature of Art Nouveau. Tapestries, bookbindings, and wrought-iron work was displayed alongside the paintings. The influence of Delville and P\u00e9ladan was evident in the predominance of idealist works of art influenced by late fifteenth-century Florentine art, the work of Gustav Moreau, Puvis de Chavannes and the tendency towards large-scale figure compositions. The show was enthusiastically received by the press. \n\nDelville's main works exhibited that year was his celebrated ''La Mort d'Orph\u00e9e'' (1893, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels) and his outstanding ''Mysteriosa'' or ''Portrait of Mrs Stuart Madame Stuart Merrill'' (1892, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels). His work was enthusiastically praised in the press. The leading critic Ernest Verlant wrote:\n<blockquote> One of the principal members of the ''Pour L\u2019Art'' group, in view of his talent and astonishing fecundity, is Jean Delville, who is also a writer and a poet; with a powerful imagination that is funereal and tormented. These epithets are equally suited to his large painting ''La Proie'', a crimson vision of apocalyptic murder, similar to his vast composition from last year, ''Vers l\u2019inconnu'', and of several before that. \u2026 Here and there, for example, in ''L\u2019homme du glaive'', the ''Murmure profane'', and ''Mysteriosa'', he pushes the intensity of expression to its extreme. Elsewhere, as in ''Satana'', he draws together, rather bizarrely, esoteric attributes in a figure derived from da Vinci. But we are able only to express praise in front of ''Orph\u00e9e'', a dead head floating between the shafts of a large lyre; in front of ''Elegia'', a long and supple female body appearing under the spurting and cascading waters of a fountain; in front of ''Au Loin'' and ''Maternitas'', two figures pensively leaning on their elbows, of which the first of the two has a great nobility. These works are monochrome, or nearly so. Their expression is accurate, fine, subtle, refined, not too explicit, and all the more eloquent.<ref>Quoted in Cole, ''Jean Delville, Art between Nature and the Absolute'', p. 93</ref></blockquote>\nThe final ''Pour L'Art'' show took place in January 1895. Delville also participated for the last time in P\u00e9ladan's Salons de la Rose+Croix. This was the year when he began preparing the formation of his own exclusively Idealist exhibition Society, the ''Salons d'Art Id\u00e9aliste'', which opened the following year. By this time the ''Pour L'Art'' Salons were well-established, successful and enthusiastically supported by the contemporary press. Delville's ''L'Ange des splendeurs'' (1894, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels), was Delville's main work of that show. Although not widely praised it stands, according to Brendan Cole, as one of his initiatory paintings ''par excellence'' of Delville's ''oeuvre''<ref>Cole, ''Jean Delville'', p. 291.</ref>\n\n=== Delville and P\u00e9ladan's ''Salons de la Rose+Croix'' 1892\u20131895===\nDelville exhibited at Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan's Rosicrucian Salons for the first four years of their existence (1892\u20135), which coincided with his own Pour l'Art Salons. At this time Delville was closely allied to P\u00e9ladan and his ideals. Delville probably met P\u00e9ladan in Paris when he accompanied one of the touring exhibitions of L'Essor, around 1888.<ref>According to Michel Draguet; see Draguet, Id\u00e9e, Idea, Id\u00e9alisme: Figure du Mythe', in Michel Draguet (ed.), ''Splendeurs de l\u2019Id\u00e9al. Rops, Khnopff, Delville et leur temps.'' Li\u00e8ge: Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Art wallon, du 17 octobre d\u00e9cembre 1997, p. 61.</ref>\n\nDelville shared P\u00e9ladan's concept of creating a forum that showcased art of an exclusively Idealist persuasion. Delville sought to bring Idealist art into the public eye in Belgium through the ''Pour l'Art'' salons, but more specifically in the ''Salons d'Art Id\u00e9alist'' which he founded in 1895 and opened to the public in 1896. By 1896, Delville began severing formal ties with P\u00e9ladan, which cleared the way for his move towards Theosophy later that decade. Delville records his association with P\u00e9ladan in his autobiography: '... my personality as an idealist painter emerged more and more. I made the acquaintance of P\u00e9ladan and became interested in and started participating in the esoteric movement in Paris and Brussels. I exhibited at the Rosicrucian Salon where only idealist art was allowed. P\u00e9ladan exhibited several of my works there, notably ''La Mort d\u2019Orph\u00e9e'' which he placed at the centre of the exhibition, along with ''La chair et l\u2019esprit'' and some drawings. Under his influence, I went to live in Paris where I stayed on the Quai Bourbon among some Rosicrucian friends, disciples of P\u00e9ladan. I stayed there for several months occupying my time not only with the organization of the P\u00e9ladanesque salons, but also in painting the set of ''Babylone'' which was an overall success'<ref>Delville, ''Autobiographie'', Archives d\u2019Art contemporaine Belgique (AACB), 23792/1-4 5\u20138.' p. 2. Delville is probably referring to the Salon Rose+Croix of 1893 \u2013  the year P\u00e9ladan staged his play ''Babylone'' in Paris, in April during the Rose+Croix Salon of that year)</ref> \n\nIn 1892 Delville exhibited his ''La symbolisation de la chair et de l\u2019esprit'' (which was reproduced in the catalogue to the first exhibition) as well as his ''l\u2019Idole de la Perversit\u00e9''. In 1893 he exhibited eight works including his ''Imperia'', ''\u00c9legia'', ''La symbolisation de la chair et de l\u2019esprit'', ''L\u2019Annonciateur'', ''Le Murmure profane'', ''Mysteriosa'', ''Vers l\u2019Inconnu'', and ''L\u2019Homme de Glaive''. In 1894 he exhibited seven works including: ''La Mort d\u2019Orph\u00e9e'', ''La Fin d\u2019un r\u00e8gne'', ''Le Geste d\u2019Ame'', ''Satana'', ''Maternitas'', ''Etude f\u00e9minine'' and ''La Tranquille''. In 1895 Delville exhibited four works including his portrait of P\u00e9ladan: ''Portrait du Grand Ma\u00eetre de la Rose+Croix en habit de choeur'' and ''L\u2019Ange des splendeurs''. Many of these works would be displayed in Brussels as well in Delville's ''Pour l'Art'' exhibitions.<ref>See Brendan Cole, '' Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute'', pp. 138\u201344.</ref>\n\n===Prix de Rome and sojourn in Italy, 1895===\nDelville lived as an indigent artist in St Gilles in Brussels during the course of his early career. By the middle of the 1890s he was married and had a growing family which he struggled to support as an artist. On the advice of his close friend, the sculptor Victor Rousseau, he was motivated to enter the prestigious Prix de Rome, which came with a very generous bursary that also covered the costs for a lengthy sojourn in Italy. Delville won the 1895 competition, but his entry created a controversy amongst his peers given the 'Establishment' nature of the Prix that ran counter to the ideals of the avant-garde at the time. Delville was by then a fairly established figure in avant-garde circles and his association with the Prix de Rome appeared to be a betrayal of their cause. The Prix de Rome, however, also meant that Delville could spend a significant amount of time in Italy studying the Classical art of the Renaissance that he admired so much. \n\nThe rules of the competition were stringent. Competitors were isolated in small studios in the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp which ran the competition and were expected to produce a finished drawing of their composition before setting to work on the final painting. A strict time-limit was imposed on competitors to finish the work. The competition opened in June 1895 and he winner was announced in October.<ref>See Miriam Delville, 'Jean Delville, mon grand-p\u00e8re', p. 21</ref> The theme of the competition that year was ''Le Christ glorifi\u00e9 par les enfants''. Delville recorded his experience in his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>The rules were demanding \u2026 At that time the six selected competitors for the final exam had to paint their work in a secluded lodge, after leaving the original preliminary drawing in a hallway of the Antwerp Academy. It was strictly forbidden to bring any drawings into the lodge, only live models were allowed there. While working on their painting, the competitors had to change their clothes each time they entered their lodge, after having been visited by a specially appointed supervisor. These procedural requirements were the moral guarantee of this great contest in which these artists from the country took part\u2026. As soon as they were selected, they entered into a lodge in order to produce, over three days, the sketch of the requisite painting, and they were given eighty days to complete it without receiving any visitors or advice from anyone \u2013 in order to ensure that the competitors were the unique and personal author of the work so that the jury, composed of the country\u2019s most well-known artists, could cast a definitive judgement.<ref>Delville, ''Autobiography'', p. 3.</ref></blockquote>\nDuring his stay Delville was expected to paint original works reflecting his studies of classical art as well as to make copies after the old masters. He was also expected to send regular reports back to the Antwerp Academy relating to his work there. The experience proved to be a turning point in his career and brought to focus his ideal to synthesise the classical tendency in art with his interest in esoteric philosophy which was the defining attribute of his Idealist aesthetic form then onwards. Delville produced several remarkable paintings during his time in Rome that reflect a dramatic evolution in his art towards a more refined expression of this Idealist aesthetic. These included his outstanding ''Orph\u00e9e aux enfers'' (1896), a key initiatory work, as well as his great masterpiece of the period, his ''L'Ecole de Platon'' (1898), which he exhibited at the 1898 ''Salon d'Art Id\u00e9alist'' to universal praise.<ref>see Cole, ''ibid'' pp. 99\u2013113.</ref> In 1895, Delville published his first book on esoteric philosophy, ''Dialogue entre Nous''.\n\n===The Salons d'Art Id\u00e9aliste 1896\u20131898===\nDelville's ''Salons D'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' were exclusively devoted to exhibiting artwork of an Idealist nature. Delville signalled his programme in a series of polemical articles during the course of the months preceding the opening of the first Salon, which created some controversy amongst his contemporaries. Delville's ideas were bold and confrontational, but it was characteristic of him to stick to the courage of his convictions and to carry his projects through with relentless energy and determination. The aim of the Salons were couched in a short manifesto published before the opening of the first Salon. This is an early instance of a new avant-garde art movement supported by a manifesto; something that would be a commonplace in later Modernist movements and after. The Salons were also accompanied by a series of lectures and musical soir\u00e9es. Delville's Salons were also significant for their inclusion of women artists, something almost unheard of in other contemporary avant garde exhibition societies. The manifesto provides a valuable record of the Idealist movement founded by Delville:\n<blockquote> The intention of the Salons d\u2019Art Id\u00e9aliste is to give rise to an aesthetic Renaissance in Belgium. They bring together, in one annual grouping, all the scattered elements of artistic idealism, that is to say, works with the same leanings towards beauty. Wishing in this way to react against the decadence, against the confusion of the so-called realist, impressionist or libriste schools (degenerate art forms), the Salons d\u2019Art Id\u00e9aliste champion the following as eternal principles of perfection in a work of art: thought, style, and technique. The only thing they recognize as free, within aesthetics, is the creative personality of the artist, and maintain, in the name of harmony, that no work is susceptible to true art unless it is composed of the three absolute terms, namely: spiritual beauty, plastic beauty and technical beauty. Similar, if not identical, to the Parisian Rose & Croix Salons created by S\u00e2r Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan and to the Pre-Raphaelite movement in London, the Salons d\u2019Art Id\u00e9aliste claim to wish to continue, through modern developments, the great tradition of idealist art, from the ancient masters to present-day masters.<ref>'Salons d\u2019Art Id\u00e9aliste', ''La Ligue Artistique'', nr. 23 (4 December 1895), p. 6.</ref></blockquote>\nDelville's main work exhibited that year was his visionary ''Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'' (1895, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels). The work had previously been on show at the Salon de Gand. The depiction of a satanic figure represented under water was unique in Western Art. Instead of wings he is represented with long octopus tentacles. His 'treasures' are the sleeping figures surrounded with jewels and gold coins; objects representing materialism and avarice. The figures show no sign of torment, but are rather represented in a state of somnolent bliss, as though they have succumbed to all that is 'satanic' in Delville's occult view; sensual pleasure and materialism. The work is an apotropaic icon against the snares of the lower passions and the world of matter and sensuality generally. \n\nThe second Salon took place in March 1897 at Edmond Picard's arts venue, ''la Maison d'Art''. Delville's contributions were small and included his ''Orph\u00e9e aux Enfers'', ''Parsifal'' and ''L\u2019Oracle \u00e0 Dodone''; which are now, apart from ''Parsifal'', in private collections. At the time Delville was in Italy on his prescribed sojourn there after winning the coveted Prix de Rome. The show received largely positive reviews in the press and Delville's Salons were becoming more widely accepted, despite his aggressive polemics in the months prior to their establishment which hackled his contemporaries. What was noted as a feature of this Idealist art was its intellectual nature and the proclivity towards the expression of ideas.\n\nThe final ''Salon d'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' took place in March 1898 and was marked by the exhibition of Delville's great masterpiece, his ''l'Ecole de Platon'' (1898, Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay), which marked the culmination of his Idealist programme and widely celebrated amongst his contemporary critics, even those who were previously hostile to his art and aesthetic programme.<ref>See Cole ''Jean Delville'', pp. 115ff for a detailed discussion of Delville's Idealist Salons.</ref>\n\n==After 1900==\nIn 1895 Delville published his ''Dialogue entre nous'', a text in which he outlined his views on occultism and esoteric philosophy. Brendan Cole discusses this text in detail his book on Delville, pointing out that, though the Dialogue reflects the ideas of a number of occultists, it also reveals a new interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. In the late 1890s, Delville joined the [[Theosophical Society]]. He was probably introduced to Theosophy directly through his friendship with Edouard Schur\u00e9, the author of the widely influential book ''Les Grandes Initi\u00e9s''. Schur\u00e9 wrote the preface to Delville's work on Idealist Art, ''La Mission de l'Art'' (1900). Delville also came into close alliance with Annie Besant who inherited the leadership of the Theosophical movement. Besant gave a series of lectures in Brussels in 1899 titled ''La Sagesse Antique''. Delville reviewed her talks in an article published in ''Le Thyrse'' that year.<ref>Delville, 'A propos de la Sagesse Antique. Conference de Mme Annie Besant', ''Le Thyrse'', nr 9, 1 September 1899, pp. 65\u20136.</ref> It is probably from this point onwards that Delville became actively involved in the Theosophical Movements as such. Delville founded ''La Lumi\u00e8re'', a journal devoted to Theosophical ideas in 1899, and published articles from leading Theosophists of the day, including Besant. Delville became the first General Secretary of the Belgian branch of the Theosophical Society in 1911.<ref>See Flaurette Gautier, ''Jean Delville et l'occulture fin de si\u00e8cle''. Unpublished Master's thesis, Tours: University Fran\u00e7ois-Rabelais, 2012.</ref>\nDelville's art flourished after 1900 and he produced some of his greatest works during this period up to the First World War. He worked with undiminished strength and imagination and his paintings revealed a visionary sense of the transcendental inspired by his involvement in the Theosophical movement, seen typically in works such as his monumental ''L'Homme-Dieu'' (1903, Brughes: Groeninge Museum) and ''Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e'' (1907, Free University Brussels). His most striking achievement, however, is his series of five vast canvases that decorated the Cour d'Assises in the Palais de Justice on the theme of 'Justice through the Ages'. These works, monumental in conception and scale and no doubt amongst his finest, were unfortunately destroyed during the second World War as a result of German bombing of the Palais de Justice on 3 September 1944. The irony of this action in relation to the theme of this cycle of paintings cannot be overlooked. Small-scale replacements were installed during the reconstruction of the Palais after the War. The gigantic original central painting titled, ''La Justice, la Loi et la Piti\u00e9'', measured 11 metres by 4.5 metres. This worked was flanked by two works, ''La Justice de Mo\u00efse'' and ''La Justice chr\u00e9tienne'' (both 4 by 3 metres). The two remaining panels represents Justice of the past and present: ''La Justice d'autrefois'' and ''La Justice moderne''.<ref name=\"grand-p\u00e8re 26\">Miriam Delville, ''Jean Delville, mon grand-p\u00e8re'', p. 26.</ref>\n\n===Professor at the Glasgow School of Art, 1900\u20131906===\n[[File:Delville atelier.jpg|thumb|right|Poster advertising Delville's private atelier, c. 1906]]\nDelville hoped to secure a teaching place at the Academy in Brussels, but was offered instead a teaching position at the flourishing [[Glasgow School of Art]] in 1900. His tenure there was highly successful, and the works of the students he trained were celebrated at the annual exhibitions in London. When Delville returned to Brussels in 1907, many of his British students followed him to further their training under his tutelage in his private studio in rue Morris. At that time, Delville fulfilled his ambition to teach at the Brussels Academy and was appointed Professor of Life Studies, a post he held until his retirement in 1937.<ref name=\"grand-p\u00e8re 26\"/>\n\n===The First World War: Exile in London 1914\u201318===\nWhen War broke out, Delville, amongst many Belgians, was welcomed in Britain as exiles. He moved there with his entire family, including his wife and four younger children and settled in Golders Green in London. His two oldest sons, Elie and Rapha\u00ebl Delville, were conscripted into the Belgian War Effort (both survived the conflict). Delville played an active role in London, through his writings, art and public addresses (he was a gifted orator) in support of the Belgians in exile and the conflict against the Germans. He contributed to the Belgian expatriate newspaper in London, ''L'Ind\u00e9pendence Belge'' and wrote several articles and poems virulently condemning German aggression. He was an active member of the philanthropic society for Belgian refugees, ''La Ligue des Patriotes de Belgique'', and was the president of ''La Ligue des Artistes belges'' that was responsible for the creation of the successful publication ''Belgian Art in Exile'' the sale of which raised money for Belgian charities in England. The work contains a great number of representative paintings and other works of art by contemporary Belgian artists. The volume was generally well received. ''The Sketch'' ran a supportive editorial in their January edition and gave informative information about the volume:\n<blockquote>Belgian Art in Exile is the title of a very attractive album of reproductions, mostly in colour, of paintings by exiled Belgian artists, with photographs of works by Belgian sculptors, which has been issued in aid of the Belgian Red Cross and other Belgian charitable institutions. The colour-plates, which are beautifully reproduced, show the high quality and great versatility of modern Belgian art. Particularly notable is a picture of a Moorish cavalry charge, by Alfred Bastien, who since he came to this country has done some fine work for the Illustrated London News. Among many other well-known Belgian artists represented are Albert Baertsoen, Jean Delville, Emile Claus, Herman Richir, Comte Jacques de Lalaing, and Paul Dubois. A fine painting by Frank Brangwyn \u2013 Mater Dolorosa Belgica \u2013 forms a pictorial introduction\", as the frontispiece. Maeterlinck contributes a eulogy of King Albert, and there are poems by Emile Verhaeren, Marcel Wyseur, and Jean Delville, who also writes an introduction. The volume is published by Colour (25, Victoria Street, S.W. at 5s. and (in cloth) 73. 6d., with a limited edition de luxe at \u00a31. Both for itself and the cause it should command a wide sale.<ref>'Woman\u2019s Ways', ''The Sketch'', 5 January 1916, p. IV.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt that time Delville was also an active Freemason and was involved in La Loge Albert 1er that reunited Belgian Freemasons in exile living in Britain.<ref>See Olivier Delville, ''Jean Delville, peintre, 1867\u20131953'', Brussels: Laconti, 1984, pp. 32\u20134.</ref> His time in exile also inspired several important paintings, including: ''La Belgique indomptable'' (1916), depicting a sword-wielding allegorical female figure holding off an attacking Germanic eagle,''Les M\u00e8res'' (1919), depicting a group of mourning mothers surrounded by dead corpses of their fallen sons, and ''Sur l'Autel de la patrie'' (1918), a modern pieta depicting a female figure with the corpse of a bleeding dead soldier at her feet. His most notable work of this period is his ''Les Forces'' (completed in 1924), depicting two vast celestial armies confronting each other. The forces of light, represented on the right, are led by a Christ-like figure seated on a horse and a torch-bearing winged figure leading an army of angels into the fray against a battalion of dark forces streaming in from the left. The work is on open display in the Palais de Justice in the vast 'cour des pas perdus' and is grand in scale, measuring 5 metres by 8 metres.\n\n===The 'Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Art Monumental' 1920===\nFrom an early point in his career Delville was interested in producing art that would be displayed in public spaces for the edification of all. For him, art was a means of uplifting the public, and to this end he despised art that was produced for an elite clique, sold by dealers for the benefit of collectors who saw in art no more than an investment opportunity. Delville's ideals were strongly aligned to the idea of a social purpose for art, about which he wrote extensively during his career. In his ''Mission de l'Art'' he wrote: 'If the purpose of Art, socially speaking, is not to spiritualise the weighted thinking of the public, then one has the right to ask oneself, what is truly its usefulness, or more precisely, its purpose'.<ref>Delville, ''La Mission de L'Art'', 1900, p. 23.</ref>\nAlthough he had already created several large artistic schemes that decorated public buildings, notably his panels for the Palais de Justice, his ambition formally to pursue this aim was finally realised in 1920 when he collaborated with several leading painters of his generation to create the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Art Monumental'' (Society for Monumental Art). The aim of the group was to bring together painters, artists and architects who would draw attention to the need for art specifically created for public buildings.\n\nAn important realisation of this aim was the decoration of the walls in the colonnades of the hemicycles flanking the [[Arcade du Cinquantenaire|Arcade of the Parc du Cinquantenaire]]. Five artists collaborated with Delville on this project: [[Constant Montald]], [[:fr:\u00c9mile Vloors|Emile Vloors]], [[:nl:Omer Dierickx|Omer Dierickx]], [[:fr:\u00c9mile Fabry|Emile Fabry]] and [[:fr:Albert Ciamberlani|Albert Ciamberlani]]. The last two were friends of Delville's since his days at the Academy and had collaborated on many project before. Most of these artists had also exhibited in Delville's Idealist forums, ''Pour L'Art'' and the ''Salons d'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' during the 1890s.\n\nThe project went ahead under the patronage of King Albert I, and was paid for through a scheme of national subscription.\n\nThe overall theme of this major cycle of works was a patriotic commemoration of  'The Glorification of Belgium' following the Great War through allegorical images relating to War and peace. In 1924 Delville expressed his idea for the cycle as a 'vision of a frieze in mosaic unfurling its rhythm of lines and its harmony of colours between the columns of the hemicycle'<ref>Delville, 'Comment est n\u00e9 le project de la d\u00e9coration de l'H\u00e9micycle de l'Arcade du Cinquantenaire', in ''Gand Artistique'' November 1924, p. 256.</ref>\n \nEach artist prepared six individual works (cartoons) that were then adapted to the final mosaics which were three metres high and aligned to the top part of the wall. The total distance of all the mosaics was 120 metres. An overall harmony of all the individual panels was achieved by ensuring that the artists adhered to a few common rules of composition: using the same horizon line, using the same scale for the figures, and adhering to a limited palette of related colours. The specific theme to the left of the arcade is that of Belgium at peace. Works by Fabry, Vloors and Montald represented respectively: the material life, intellectual life and moral life. The specific theme to the right side represent heroic Belgium, with works by Delville, Ciamberlani and Dierickx representing respectively: Victory, the Tribute to Heroes and War.\n\nThe project was conceived between 1922 and 1926 and completed in 1932. The mosaics themselves were executed by Jean Lahaye and Emile Van Asbroeck of the company A Godchol.<ref>see [http://www.irismonument.be/fr.Bruxelles_Extension_Est.Parc_du_Cinquantenaire.A016.html Arcade et h\u00e9micycle Parc du Cinquantenaire]</ref>\n\nThis monumental creation was a vindication of Idealist trends in art presented in a public space and gave his artistic perspective a wider visibility amongst the general public.<ref>See Emile Berger, ' Jean Delville et l'enjeu du monumental', in Laoureux, et al. ''Jean Delville, Ma\u00eetre de l'id\u00e9al''. p. 126ff.</ref>\n\nWorking towards the public good and alleviating the suffering of mankind was also a principle ideal of the Theosophists, an ideal to which Delville's subscribed throughout his life. Delville's Theosophical-socialist views were articulated in two articles his published before the War: ''Socialisme de demain'' (1912) and ''Du Principe sociale de l'Art'' (1913).\n\n==Later years==\nFrom the 1920s onwards, Delville experienced a much more settled and successful career than ever before. With the highly successful completion of the two major public projects in the Palais de Justice and the Cinquantenaire,<ref>See Clovis Pi\u00e9rard,  'Jean Delville, Peintre, Po\u00e8te, Esth\u00e9ticien', ''Memoire et Publications des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Arts et des Lettres de Hainault'', (1971\u20131973), pp. 228ff and 236ff, concerning the highly positive public reception of these works.</ref> and his election as a member of the prestigious Belgian Royal Academy of sciences and letters in 1924, he seemed to have been drawn much closer into the Belgian establishment during these years. He maintained his post as 'Premier Professeur' at the Academy of Fine Art in Brussels until 1937 and continued to paint until crippling arthritis in his right hand forced him to give up the brush in 1947.\n\nHis ambition to create large-scale Idealist works of art was sustained right up to the end of his painting career after the Second World War; notable examples amongst which include his ''Les Forces'' (1924, 55 \u00d7 800&nbsp;cm, Palais de Justice), ''Les Derni\u00e8res Idoles'' (1931, 450 \u00d7 300&nbsp;cm, private collection) and ''La Roue du Monde'' (1940, 298 \u00d7 231&nbsp;cm, Antwerp: Royal Museum of Fine Art). He was still able to sustain a power of expression and a highly articulate finish to his works in his later years that was there from the very start. However, a change in his style took place amongst some of his works in the 1930s, (especially while he was resident in Mons). Characteristically they became more pared-down in their articulation of form and colour: Shapes became more stylised and geometric and his colours were more pallid, or 'pastel' in tone, lacking the energy, vibrant contrasts and rich tonalities that was characteristic of his work until then. His treatment of figures also became more stylised and he often articulated their facial features with characteristically 'almond'-shaped eyes, giving his figures an otherworldy appearance. Typical examples of this period include his ''Seraphitus-Seraphita'' (1932), ''Les Id\u00e9es'' (1934), ''Le Dieu de la Musique'' (1937) and ''P\u00e9gase'' (1938).\n\n[[File:Delville bust.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial bust of Jean Delville, Avenue Sept Bonniers, Brussels, Belgium]]\n\nDelville remained a committed and passionate Theosophist until his death in 1953 and he maintained in one of his biographies that this always formed the foundation to this moral and artistic perspective throughout his later life. Regarding this important aspect of his intellectual and spiritual life, he wrote in 1944:\n<blockquote>En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la philosophie occulte occupe le fond de ma pens\u00e9e depuis bien des ann\u00e9es ! Je pense avoir lu \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tout ce qui fut publi\u00e9 d\u2019important sur les probl\u00e8mes de l\u2019invisible. ... Depuis, j\u2019ai beaucoup cherch\u00e9, \u00e9tudi\u00e9 sur la nature des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes psychiques. L\u2019Etude des sciences occultes est \u00e0 la base de ma vie intellectuelle et morale.<ref>Jean Delville, ''Autobiographie'', manuscript: fonds Eggermont, PA/AACB/2009-20</ref></blockquote>\nDelville died on his birthday, 19 January 1953.\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1919''' : Officer of the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]].<ref>Royal Decree of H.M. King Albert I on 14.11.1919</ref>\n\n==Theory and technique==\n\n===Idealist theory===\nDelville wrote prolifically throughout his life outlining his Idealist aesthetic. His first main publication on the subject was his ''Mission de l'Art'' (1900). Delville's Idealist theory is a syncretic formulation of traditional Idealist thinking (in the tradition of Plato, Schopenhauer and Hegel) and contemporary esoteric philosophy.<ref>For a complete discussion of the relationship between Delville's ''Mission de l'Art'' and ''Hegelian Idealism'', see: Brendan Cole  'Jean Delville's ''La Mission de l'Art'': Hegelian Echoes in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Idealism', ''Religion and the Arts'' 10/2007; 11(3\u20134):330\u2013372.</ref>\nIn summary, Delville believed that art is the expression of the Ideal (or spiritual) in material form and is founded on the principle of Ideal Beauty, in other words Beauty that is the manifestation of the Ideal, or spiritual realm, in physical objects. Contemplating objects that manifest Ideal Beauty allows us to perceive, if only fleetingly, the spiritual dimension and we are transfigured as a result.<ref>For a detailed discussion of Delville's theory of art and Beauty, see: Brendan Cole, ''Jean Delville, Art between Nature and the Absolute.'', especially the detailed chapter four, pp. 150ff.</ref>\n\nDelville outlines this in a vivid passage in his ''La Mission de l'Art'' where he emphasises the expressive value of Idealist art, in other words, that it is not merely a question of engaging passively with the image, but it is also about feeling the 'energy' that it radiates, which uplifts and transforms the consciousness of the viewer, in a spiritual way. Idealism in art is, he writes, 'the introduction of Spirituality into Art'. For Delville, the Idea is an expression of the Ideal realm, and it is a living force within human experience that dwells within the transpersonal realm of human experience. He writes further that:\n<blockquote>The Idea, in the metaphysical or esoteric sense, is Force, the universal and divine force which moves worlds, and its movement is the supreme rhythm whence springs the harmonious working of Life.\n\nWhere there is no thought, there is no life, no creation. The modern western world has become unconscious of this tremendous power of the Ideal, and Art inevitably has thus become degraded. This ignorance of the creative forces of thought has, nevertheless, obscured and diverted towards materialism all modern judgement. Materialism does not know ''how'' ideas and thoughts vibrate, and how these vibrations impinge on the consciousness of the individual.\n\nAnd yet these vibrations, though invisible to the greater part of mankind, are able to exercise an astounding influence over the mentality of human beings, and thus assist in their evolution. Before works of genius the human consciousness receives mental and spiritual vibrations, which are generated by the force of the idea reflected. The more elevated, pure and sublime a work is, the more the inner being, coming into contact with the ideal vibrations emanated from it, will be raised, purified, and made sublime. The artist who is not ideal, that is to say, artist who does not know that every form must be the result of an idea, and that every idea must have its form, the artist, in short, who does not know that Beauty is the luminous conception of equilibrium in forms, will never have any influence over the soul, because his works will be really without thought, that is, without life.\n\nThe Idea is the emotion of the Spirit as Emotion is the reflex of the Soul.<ref>Jean Delville, ''La Mission de L'Art'' translated as ''The New Mission of Art. A Study of Idealism in Art''. Translated by Francis Colmer, with an introduction by Cliffor Bax and Edouard Schur\u00e9. London: Francis Griffiths, 1910, pp 11\u201312.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelville goes further by dividing his understanding of Beauty into three categories: I) Spiritual Beauty: the source of beauty in physical objects, ii) Formal beauty: the physical articulation of Beauty in works of art, and iii) Technical beauty: the specific execution of line, colour, light and shade, and composition to express Ideal beauty in physical objects and works of art. In French Delville referred to these terms as: ''La Beaut\u00e9 spirituelle'', ''La Beaut\u00e9 plastique'' and ''La Beaut\u00e9 technique''.<ref>see Delville's, ''La Mission de l'Art'', pp. 15ff.</ref>\nDelville goes further to map his threefold conception of Beauty onto his esoteric conception of the threefold nature of reality, consisting of the Natural, Human and Divine realms, as well as the threefold nature of man as body (senses), soul (feeling) and mind (thought and spirituality).<ref>Cole, ''Jean Delville'', pp. 335\u2013336.</ref> He writes:\n<blockquote>The work of Idealist Art is therefore that which will harmonise in itself the three great Words of Life: the Natural, the Human and the Divine. To attain this degree of aesthetic balance, \u2013  which, I am happy to concede, is not within the reach of just anyone! \u2013 one must find within the work the purest idea on an intellectual level, the most beautiful form within the artistic realm, and the most perfect technique in terms of execution. Without an idea, a work misses its intellectual mission, without form, it misses its natural mission and, without technique, it misses its goal of perfection. \u2026 The veritable character of the work of Idealist Art can be identified from the balance reigning over its accomplishment, meaning that it does not let the essential terms of idea, art or technique prevail one over the other, but more likely according to relations proportional to their respective powers.<ref>Delville, ''La Mission de L'Art'', pp.35\u201336. Translated in Cole, ''Jean Delville'', p. 335.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===The Classical Tradition===\nDelville believed that the purest expression of Idealist art was to be found in the Classical Tradition of ancient Greek art and the High Renaissance. For him, Classical art was the purest expression of the spiritual in material form. Delville sought to reinterpret the Classical idiom in a contemporary context, to suite, in other words his specific Idealist style of art that he was formulating during the 1890s; not simply, in other words, to copy or imitate classical modes of art<ref>Cole, pp. 191ff.</ref> The expression of harmony and equilibrium, which he saw as an essential aspect of Classical art, were fundamental in the expression of the spiritual in natural forms. There is a mystical aspect to Delville's aesthetic, and idea of Ideal Beauty, when he wrote that:\n<blockquote>The Beautiful, taken in its classical sense, is not an illusion. The Beautiful is the True manifested by the Idea in form. This is the highest goal that the artist must seek to attain \u2026 When the artist causes light to spring forth from darkness, beauty from ugliness, the pure from the impure, he reveals Truth to humanity, he reveals God. The Beautiful, the True, the Good are synonyms. It is the glory of Art to be able to make perceptible to human eyes the three mysteries which form a single one!<ref>Delville, 'Autre Pens\u00e9e'. I-XIII, ''La Ligue Artistique'', 14 (July 1898), p. 2. Quoted in Cole, ''Jean Delville'', p. 192.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Idealist art===\nDelville developed a distinct style in his painting, which is unmistakable. His finished drawing and paintings are highly articulate and precise in the way he renders forms. However, his works are not overbearingly detailed, as is often found in realist art, but he manages to capture the essence of the forms he articulates using the simplest means possible. This is especially so in his approach to figures. In his ''l'Amour des Ames'' he outlines the figures using long, curvaceous contours, and their anatomy is only lightly suggested using gentle contrasts in light and shade; the effect is the expression of great beauty without being overbearingly sensual: a technique often seen in Renaissance frescos. Delville had a great imagination for colour and its use for expressive purposes. His colours are often vivid, almost visionary; most clearly seen in his ''Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'' which is bathed in an atmosphere of luminous golds and yellows. In his ''L'Ange des Splendeurs'' he captures the effect of iridescent, diaphanous gold in the angel's drapery contrasting distinctly with the heavy earthiness of the natural details (animals, spiders, vegetation) at bottom right hand side. His ''Ecole de Platon'' is a paradigm of serenity in his use of muted, cool colours and pastel shades to emphasise the intellectual idyll of Plato's ''Akademos''.\n\nDelville very seldom painted landscapes, still life or portraits for their own sake, but often incorporated these in his figure paintings. Almost all of Delville's paintings focus on the human form as the bearer of the drama of his works. He was a master of the articulation of human anatomy which he used to express vividly his Idealist technique and ideas. The various ways he articulates the human form is key to understanding his artistic programme that he unveiled in his paintings throughout his career. This is especially the case in the rendering of lithe and supple male and female figures in his ''Les Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'', ''L'Amour des Ames'' and ''L'Ecole de Platon'', or the highly expressive drawn, sinewy almost emaciated forms in the lower part of his epic ''l'Homme-Dieu'' displaying the suffering and distress of the human condition; or in the highly muscular, Titanesque rendering of anatomy in his heroic figures in his ''Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e'' and ''Les Derni\u00e8res Idoles''.\n\nFor a good selection of paintings with clear reproductions see this website: [https://lightbearerofbeauty.wordpress.com/art/?preview=true&preview_id=69&preview_nonce=bc063a28e8 \"Jean Delville: Initiate of Spiritual Beauty\"]\n\n==Practise: idealist artworks==\n\n===''Mysteriosa'' or ''The Portrait of Mrs. Stuart Merrill'' (1892)===\n\n'''Pencil, pastel and coloured pencil on paper, 40 x 32.1&nbsp;cm, Brussels: Royal Museum of Fine Art'''\nThough Delville frequently wrote about his ideas, he almost never discussed his paintings. He left the interpretations to the viewer, and as a result his best pictures have an air of mystery and intrigue. One of the most mysterious is his Portrait of Mrs. [[Stuart Merrill]]. This drawing, executed in chalks in 1892, is strikingly otherworldly. In it Delville depicts the young woman as a medium in trance, with her eyes turned upwards. Her radiating red-orange hair combines with the fluid light of her aura.\n\nThe hot colours which surround Mrs. Merrill's head appear to allude to the earthly fires of passion and sensuality. On the other hand, the book on which she rests her chin and long, almost spectral hands is inscribed with an upwards-pointing triangle. This represents Delville's idea of perfect human knowledge, achieved (as he says in his Dialogue), through magic, the Kabbalah and Hermeticism. As a number of authors have pointed out, the painting, with its references to occultism and wisdom seems to hint at initiation. If so, the woman's red aura might refer to her sensual side, which will become more spiritualised as she moves into a different stage of development.\n\nWhatever its interpretation, this very unusual portrait has had a strong effect on viewers. It can be seen as eerie and supernatural (Bade, Femme Fatale, 1979), or as \"a positively magical vision\" (Jullian, ''Dreamers of Decadence'', 1974). It is sometimes referred to as the Mona Lisa of the 1890s, and is also given the title La Mysteriosa . Today, few details are available about the sitter, and even her first name goes unmentioned in the literature. The most extensive information on her identity is given by Delville's son Olivier in his biography of the painter. It is not a first-hand account, however, as Olivier was born at least ten years after the picture was executed. According to him, Stuart Merrill (a Symbolist poet who published his works in Paris and Brussels) had a house near to the Delvilles in Forest at that time. Olivier adds that \"the young Mrs Merrill-Rion\" was a Belgian, and that Delville was struck by her strange beauty and depicted her with a mediumistic character. It is likely that Delville painted other portraits of Mrs Stuart Merrill and the 1893 drawing 'Medusa', in the same media is undoubtedly one of these.\n\nThe painting was not bought by the Merrills, and remained with the Delvilles until it was sold to a Californian private collector in the late 1960s. In 1998, it was acquired by the Brussels Museum of Fine Arts, and is now on display to the public.\n\n===''The Angel of Splendour'' (''L'Ange des Splendeurs'', 1894)===\n\n'''Oil in canvas, 127 x 146&nbsp;cm, Brussels: Museum of Fine Art.'''\n\nThis is undoubtedly one of Delville's most visionary images of the early 1890s. The work refers to Delville's interests in the idea of initiation and the spiritualisation of the soul. As seen in many of his works, Delville often plays on the tension between opposites: light and dark, spirit and matter, Nature and the Ideal, etc. These ideas are personified in this work in the duality between the androgynous Angel and the young androgynous youth who is ensnared in the natural or material realm. His lower torso is engulfed in serpents and surrounded by toads, spiders, butterflies and other life-forms of the natural world. The Angel, on the other hand is a vision of diaphanous gold, clothed in a dress that is more fluid than material, emanating a soft, but intense, light. Her face is of the exquisite beauty commonly seen in Renaissance portraiture, notably in the work of Leonardo, who Delville admired. The bright aureole that surrounds her face beaming light in all directions is a common signifier of her spiritual nature. Her proportions are odd, by human standards, and they were criticised by his contemporaries, but Delville understood that to humanise the angel would be to contradict her symbolic function in this work. She remains a being who is physically of her own, transcendental, realm.  She points upwards indicating the path to the Ideal realm of spirit and beauty while the youth reaches towards her in an attempted gesture to release himself from the material snares that envelop him from below. There is an obvious tension here, as it is not entirely clear whether the youth will make it, or sink back into the deadening material realm from which he is emerging. The first step on the path of initiation and transcendence is to overcome and control the limitations of the illusory material dimension, and specifically to control the passions and desires, in order to clear the path for the transcendence of the soul. This painting is a totem of that moment in the initiatory drama that Delville expressed in many of his paintings and poems at the time.<ref>The work is discussed in detail in, Cole, ''ibid''., pp 280\u2013292.</ref>\n\n===''Sathan\u2019s Treasures'' (''Les Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'', 1895)===\n\n'''Oil on canvas, 258 x 268&nbsp;cm, Brussels: Museum of Fine Art'''\n\nDelville exhibited his ''Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'' (''Sathan's Treasures'') at the Salon de Gand in September 1895 while he was working on his entry for the Belgian Prix de Rome. It was then exhibited in Brussels for the first time in 1896 at Delville's first ''Salon d'Art Id\u00e9aliste''. This was one of Delville's first 'breakthrough' paintings and one of his most important works from his artistic period up to 1895.<ref>See Cole, ''Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute'', ''ibid'', p. 215.</ref>\n\nOn the whole, Delville's works generally deal with the theme of the duality between nature (human or otherwise) and the transcendental world. Delville was an Idealist, in other words, he believed in the reality of a transcendental or spiritual dimension as the basis of reality. Our perceptual material world is, in this world-view, seen merely an illusion that brings suffering and discontent. Our goal is to spiritualise our being and refine our material selves, which includes our desires and need for the fulfillment of material satisfaction. Without a spiritual context in mind, men and women simply become deadened materialistic entities always governed by their desires, passions, greed and ego-driven need for control and power over others. This is the realm of matter, or in Delville's cosmology, the realm of Sathan, who controls and governs our lower state of being. Without a spiritual goal in life, we are merely slaves to Sathan and are completely submissive to his power; we become his 'treasure' as is implied in the title of this painting. Here Delville depicts Sathan as a rather attractive figure, beguiling, powerful and seductive, dragging the hapless mass of men and woman to his undersea lair. Significantly the figures are not in a state of pain or agony, as is usually the case in Western depictions of Satan's underworld. Here they appear to be in a state of reverie and bliss, unconscious of their lives and the value of the spiritual reality of their existence, and succumbing, rather, entirely to the lure of gold and sensual pleasure; in other words, material greed and sensualism that Delville saw as a trap and a catastrophic diversion from humanity's true goal which is to spiritualise one's being and enter the higher realm of consciousness and spiritual bliss which he referred to as the 'Ideal'.<ref>For a very detailed discussion of this work, see Cole, ''ibid''., pp. 215 to 244.</ref>\n\nThe theme of exercising control over one's lower nature, of erotic temptation and indulgence was believed by Delville and his esoteric contemporaries (especially Jos\u00e9ph P\u00e9ladan) to represent the first stage on the path of initiation. This was first suggested in Edouard Schur\u00e9's influential work ''The Great Initiates'' and outlined in a passage reconstructing the Egyptian initiatory trials. He recounts how the final trial is set to resist erotic temptation personified in the form of an alluring female figure.<ref>See Edouard Schur\u00e9, ''Les Grandes Initi\u00e9s'',Paris, Perrin, reprint, 1921, p. 135.</ref>\n\nDelville expressed these ideas in an article published in the contemporary journal ''Le Mouvement Litt\u00e9raire'' in 1893:\n<blockquote>Erotic fever has sterilised most minds. One ordinarily thinks of himself as virile because he satisfies a woman\u2019s unquenched bestial desires. Well, that\u2019s where the great shame of the cerebral degeneration of our time starts. The poet, the artist, the scientist are mostly attached to the spiritual functions rather than the emasculating animal functions. The real male is he whose mind can dominate the body and who only responds to solicitations of the flesh as his will allows. \u2026 if the works of the Sar, a virile man if ever there was one, energetically banish sexual conflicts, that is, are a consistent plea in favour of chastity, it is because he has studied the ravages of carnal love, because he has understood that one has to beware of the feelings of the heart, a heart in love being a dangerous accomplice of instinct. \u2026 Unfortunately, for the most part, we remain stubbornly ignorant of the fact that real virginity develops highly the powers of the soul, and that, to those who dedicate themselves to it, it imparts faculties unknown to the rest of the human race.<ref>Jean Delville, 'Conf\u00e9rence sur \"Comment on Devient Mage\" du Sar M\u00e9rodack J. P\u00e9ladan', ''Le Mouvement Litt\u00e9raire'', 45 (8 December 1893), p. 358.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere are also frequent references to 'Sathan' in Delville's 1897 anthology of poems ''Frisson du Sphinx'', for example his 'Les Murmures de l\u2019Ombre', 'T\u00eate d\u2019Ombre', 'La Temp\u00eate' and 'l\u2019Etoile Noire'. This last vividly evokes the motif that runs throughout Delville's writings:\n\n''L'\u00c9TOILE NOIRE''<br />\nDu plus profond enfer du mal et du n\u00e9ant<br />\nl'on voit le noir \u00e9clat de l'astre satanique<br />\ndarder sinistrement, comme en une panique,<br />\nses n\u00e9fastes rayons au coeur du m\u00e9cr\u00e9ant.\n\nSathan br\u00fble ce feu sombre des mal\u00e9fices<br />\npour fasciner les yeux coupables et damn\u00e9s<br />\net pour faire jaillir sur tous ceux qui sont n\u00e9s<br />\nle chaos infernal des t\u00e9n\u00e8bres complices.\n\nM\u00ealant son despotisme \u00e0 son absurdit\u00e9,<br />\ncontre le Beau, l'Amour, le Ciel, la V\u00e9rit\u00e9,<br />\nc'est le mensonge haineux et la lourde ignorance.\n\nO ! vieil astre de mort, effroyable appareil,<br />\nvous \u00eates la nuit froide et la morne impuissance,<br />\ncar le sang clair du Christ est l'\u00e2me du soleil!\n\n''The Dark Star'' (translation)\n{{quote|From the deepest hell of evil and nothingnessone sees the dark glare of the satanic star sinisterly shining, as in a panic,its harmful rays of light into the heart of the unbeliever.

O! old star of death, device of horror, you are but frigid night and dismal impotence, for the limpid blood of Christ is the soul of the sun!<ref>See Cole, ibid., p. 223, 226 and note.</ref>}}\n\n=== ''The School of Plato'' (''L'Ecole de Platon'', 1898)===\n'''Oil on canvas, 260 x 605&nbsp;cm, Paris: Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay'''\n\nIn this important painting, Delville invokes the serene beauty of the Classical world and its aesthetic and philosophical principles. Delville painted this work while he was in Italy on his artistic sojourn there after winning the coveted [[Prix de Rome (Belgium)|Belgian Prix de Rome]]. Delville was then, at last, able to study the classical works of the Renaissance and the ancient world that profoundly influenced his artistic ideas.\n\nThe scale of the painting is impressive, measuring 2.60 metres high by 6.05 metres long, and Delville certainly had in mind large-scale Academic History paintings which were the preserve of erudite artistic subjects painted in the classical tradition, which he sought to renew.<ref>See Brendan Cole, ''Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute'', p 310. Cole gives a highly detailed analysis and discussion of this work; see ''ibid.'', pp 307\u2013353</ref> The figures depicted are almost life size. The style of the painting is inspired by the Italian frescoes by Raphael and Michelangelo that Delville would have seen while in Rome; characterised by bold articuation of forms with a matte (as opposed to a glossy) finish. The painting was first exhibited at Delville's final ''Salon d'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' in Brussels in 1898. The work was universally praised as a masterpiece by his contemporaries. The leading avant-garde art journal ''L'Art Moderne'', which was frequently hostile towards Delville and his art, praised his work in the following: 'Jean Delville ... has created a Work! A superb work of art: The School of Plato, to which he refers as \"an essay in Fresco\" \u2013 Go and see it! It is of a calm, a serene, a grand and delicious Beauty ... Ideal, yes, truly ideal. The programme shows his worth and it is magnificent.... It is beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!<ref>'Geste 3e des Salons d\u2019Art id\u00e9aliste a la Maison d\u2019Art', ''L\u2019Art Moderne'', 12 (20 March 1898), p. 93.</ref>\n\nDelville was immersed in studying the esoteric tradition and the hidden philosophies that were popular at the time. This was a tradition that extolled the virtues of self-improvement and spiritual progress through initiation. Edouard Schur\u00e9 already identified Plato as one of the 'Great Initiates', in other words, light bearers who guide humanity towards higher consciousness and deeper spiritual awareness during our earthly incarnation. Plato taught of the essential duality between the material and metaphysical dimensions; his gesture, pointing upwards and downwards alludes to this duality between macrocosm and microcosm.<ref>See Cole, ''ibid''., pp. 339ff.</ref> Attainment of the Ideal realm and the expression of its truths in physical form was the key notion in Delville's aesthetic philosophy. He wrote often that the goal of art should aspire towards expressing Absolute, or Spiritual Beauty in physical form. He saw Classical art as the purest expression of this goal and he sought a revival of this idea in art, reworking it in a way that was appropriate for his contemporary cultural era. For Delville, moreover, the human body, was the purest expression of Ideal and Spiritual Beauty. He therefore often resorted to the depiction of nude male and female figures in his art as vehicles for the expression of this Ideal; as is clearly seen in this work. Concerning the spiritual importance of the nude as a vehicle for the expression of a Spiritual ideal he wrote\n<blockquote>The nude has the high quality of being synthetic and universal. \u2026 in evoking Mankind, it evokes Humanity and all the beauty of Life, not life as we modern beings understand it, comprising nerves, morbid fevers and agitation, but the great universal life, which enriches the spirit and the earth, makes stars and souls resplendent and makes space vibrate, which beats in substance as in essence, which rules and moves the Universe, the beings and the objects, mortal or immortal, in the infinite rhythm and the mystery of Eternity, divine macrocosm and human microcosm where Universal Beauty, made of Love, Wisdom and Light, shines and is reflected forever.<ref>Delville, ''La Mission de l'Art'', Brussels: Georges Balat, 1900, pp. 62\u20133, translated in Cole, ''ibid''., p. 301.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe men in this painting are conceived in an idealised androgynous form: a concept that Delville, following P\u00e9ladan, developed to express the ideal of a non-erotic perfection of the human state that synthesises the male and female principle in an idea of wholeness and perfection, which emulates the original state of human perfection that precedes our split, dual experience of reality in our earthly incarnation.<ref>See Cole, ''ibid''., pp. 334ff.</ref>\n\n=== ''The Love of Souls'' (''L'Amour des Ames'', 1900) ===\n'''Tempera and oil on canvas, 268 x 150&nbsp;cm. Brussels: Mus\u00e9e communal des beaux-arts d'Ixelles.'''\n\nThis is undoubtedly one of Delville's most subtly articulated and beautiful images of the period. Delville depicts the union of souls, male and female, in a cosmic setting. This painting suggests a theme important to Delville and his contemporaries regarding the return to unity in the dual male and female principles of human experience that results in spiritual androgyny. Male energy and female energy is united to form a state of wholeness and complete unity of Being. It is a cosmic conception of the goal of existence, beyond opposites, polarity and discord. This state signifies a return to the original state of perfection and integration of opposites that unites us to the Cosmic mind; beyond time and space and the duality of physical and material existence. This spiritual union gives birth to the transcendent being; the cosmic Christ within. Delville often wrote of the nature of duality and the forces of opposites, as well as the need to bring these into harmony, in other words achieving Equilibrium. In fact, he understood the experience of opposition in nature (human as well as in the natural world) as an underlying 'law' relating to what he termed the 'Equilibrium in the Universal Order', with regard to which, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>In spite of a contrary appearance, all the forces, all the manifestations of nature influence each other with currents of negative polarity and positive polarity, undeniable astral influences. \u2026 The great contrasts of life, however, are responsible for all the misery, all the hardship; are they responsible for the production of Chaos?\n\nA huge mistake: The Great and the Small, the Strong and the Weak, the High and the Low, the Active and the Passive, the Full and the Empty, the Weighty and the Dense, Exterior and Interior, the Visible and the Invisible, the Beautiful and the Ugly, the Good and the Bad, Essence and Substance, Spirit and Matter are divergent forces which eternally constitute the great Equilibrium in the Universal Order. It is a Natural Law, and no philosophy, no dogma, no doctrine will ever prevail over It.<ref>Delville, ''Dialogue Entre Nous. Argumentation Kabbalistique, Occultiste, Id\u00e9aliste'' (Bruges: Daveluy Fr\u00e8res, 1895), pp. 77\u20138.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe setting of this work is important. Delville places the figures in an indeterminate, cosmic setting, suggesting that they are not figures that have human substance, but are rather symbols of the transcendent spiritual nature of man and woman. The ribbons of colour surrounding them suggests a fluid energy field upon which they are buoyed; an idea that Delville and his contemporaries often referred to as 'astral light' \u2013 an energy-force that animates living entities; much like the idea of 'the field' in quantum physics.\n\nDelville painted this work in Tempera, where pigments are mixed with egg white to create a luminous finish and a highly durable work of art. He was highly influenced by the artists of the Italian Renaissance who often used Tempera in their works, and which, to this day, retain their purity of colour and luminosity to a high degree. The close-up details reveal his technique of applying the paint in small strokes, rather than blend the colours on the palette, they are blended by the eye. To achieve this effect one has to be highly skilled as a draughtsman.<ref>For a detailed discussion of this work, see Cole, ''Jean Delville, Art Between Nature and the Absolute'', pp. 293\u2013306</ref>\n\n==Character==\nIn his biography, Delville's son Olivier tells us that his father, determined to pass his ideals on to the world, was continually painting and writing. He supplemented this unreliable income by teaching art, but his busy professional life did not prevent him from applying his strongly held beliefs to his personal life. Olivier describes his father as a person of courage, perseverance, probity and intellect, as well as an upright family man who was strict with his six children.\n\n==Legacy==\nDelville is still not nearly as well known as some of his contemporaries of the Symbolist era. There are historical reasons for this. For instance, he never exhibited at the main exhibition societies in Brussels during the early part of his career, such as ''Les XX'' and ''La Libre Esth\u00e9tique''. The reputations of many of his contemporaries, like Khnopff, Mellery and Ensor, were largely founded on their participation at these Societies, which promoted heavily their art through organised marketing campaigns, and by establishing a commercial network of dealers and collectors to invest in the art exhibited there. They were also very successful in making their art well known internationally. There was an overt commercial element associated with these societies in the way they created an aura about the art exhibited there as a desirable commodity. Delville shunned the commercialisation of art and the way it was manufactured as an elite commodity. Although he sold works at his own Societies, such as ''Pour l'Art'' and the ''Salons d'Art Id\u00e9aiste'', their purpose was mainly to create a forum for artists working in an idealist vein. Delville was mainly committed to using art as a force to transform society and to improve the lives of those around him. He wrote: 'there will be nothing to prevent art increasingly to become an educative force in society, conscious of its mission. It is time to penetrate society with art, with the ideal and with beauty. Today's society tends to fall increasingly into instinct. It is saturated with materialism, sensualism and ... commercialism'.''<ref>Jean Delville, 'Le Principe Social de l\u2019Art', ''La Belgique Artistique et Litt\u00e9raire'', v. 7, April- June 1907, p. 39. Quoted in Brendan Cole 'Jean Delville and the Belgian avant-garde: Anti-materialist polemics in support of \"un art annonciateur des spiritualit\u00e9s futures\"\u2019, in Rosina Neginsky (ed.), ''Symbolism, Its Origins and Its Consequences'' (Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing), 2010, pp. 135ff.</ref>\n\nDelville believed, rather, that a respiritulaisation of society would be a redeeming path to rescue it from the morbidity of materialism. Elsewhere he wrote: 'Idealism ... has a universalizing educational and social impact ... Idealism sees humanity in terms of the immense vitality of his ideal future. In order for the artist to become aware of this, it is necessary for him to purify and elevate himself. ... The role of modern idealism will be to draw the artistic temperament away from the deadly epidemics of materialism ... and finally to guide him towards the purified regions of an art that is the harbinger of future spirituality.'<ref>Delville, 'L\u2019Esth\u00e9tique Id\u00e9aliste'. (II) ''L\u2019Art Moderne''. No. 21, 21 May 1899, pp. 176\u2013177. See Brendan Cole 'Jean Delville and the Belgian avant-garde: Anti-materialist polemics in support of \"un art annonciateur des spiritualit\u00e9s futures\"\u2019, pp. 135ff.</ref>\n\nDelville remained desperately poor during the early part of his career and his condition was only occasionally relieved by the stipend associated with the Prix de Rome that he won as well as his employment at the Glasgow School of Art, and later the Ecole des beaux-arts. Delville never sold to dealers and only very seldom took on private commissions for portraits (a genre he would have excelled in). Most of his paintings were on a grand scale and he devised these mostly to be exhibited in public spaces, following his ideal of the social role of art. Thus, the poor reputation associated with Delville's art is in part probably related to the lack of any committed exposure and sustained marketing of his work, which was essential in forging the reputations of the early avant garde and afterwards. Delville also came from a working-class background which was a huge disadvantage in the contemporary bourgeois-dominated culture in Belgium. This would certainly have contributed to the erasure of his worth as an artist over time. And finally Delville was fiercely independent in his approach to promoting his ideas and artistic ideals, seldom bending to the will of what was popular or acceptable in conservative bourgeois circles that controlled and dominated the art market during his formative years. Mainstream critics and peers generally shunned his Art and ideals as a result. Despite his immense talent and vision, Delville remained a 'voice in the wilderness' during this time. This reputation persisted during the course of his life and afterwards as well.<ref>see Cole, ''ibid''.</ref>\n\nAnother great disadvantage related to Delville's reputation relates to the limited exposure of his major works in public museums, and the relative paucity of published material (until recently) concerning Delville's art and career. The Museum of Fine Art in Brussels houses, by far, more works than any public collection, but few of these are on public display. This is also the case in other centres in Belgium (Bruges and Antwerp, for example). Few of his works are to be seen in major museums outside Belgium; with the exception of his ''l'Ecole de Platon'' in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. Many of his smaller works have long since disappeared or have been destroyed, which leaves conspicuous lacunae in his catalogue of extant works. The loss of major paintings like his ''Cycle passionnel'' and ''La Justice \u00e0 travers les \u00e2ges'', amongst others also diminishes the impact of his known ''oeuvre''. Moreover, a great number of his works are in private collections and their whereabouts still needs to be determined. This all means that access to his works is extremely limited and they remain out of the 'public eye', and hence the collective imagination generally. Reproductions of some of his paintings and drawings are available on the Internet, but usually of poor quality which reduces their impact considerably. Finally, until very recently, there have been no major studies or monographs on the artist's work, which until now has left considerable gaps in our understanding of his life, art and ideas.\n\nDespite this, a resurgence of interest in his work and ideas appears to be taking place, notably with the recent important retrospective exhibition in Namur that brought together many important paintings and drawings, many of which have not been seen before in public since they were first exhibited in the nineteenth century. Several Belgian and English Art Historians, working in collaboration with Delville's heirs and estate, are also taking a renewed interest in Delville's work, revealing detailed aspects of his life and work for the first time through detailed studies and monographs on aspects of Delville's life and art (see 'Sources').\n\n==Selected works of art==\n\n===Prints and drawings===\n* '' L'Agonie de Cachapr\u00e8s'' (1887), charcoal on paper, 33 x 34.5&nbsp;cm.

Delville was the leading exponent of the Belgian Idealist movement in art during the 1890s. He held, throughout his life, the belief that art should be the expression of a higher spiritual truth and that it should be based on the principle of Ideal, or spiritual Beauty. He executed a great number of paintings during his active career from 1887 to the end of the second World War (many now lost or destroyed) expressing his Idealist aesthetic. Delville was trained at the ''Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-arts'' in Brussels and proved to be a highly precocious student, winning most of the prestigious competition prizes at the Academy while still a young student. He later won the [[Prix de Rome (Belgium)|Belgian Prix de Rome]] which allowed him to travel to Rome and Florence and study at first hand the works of the artists of the Renaissance. During his time in Italy he created his celebrated masterpiece ''[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/oeuvres-commentees/recherche/commentaire_id/lecole-de-platon-208.html?no_cache=1 L'Ecole de Platon]'' (1898), which stands as a visual summary of his Idealist aesthetic which he promoted during the 1890s in his writings, poetry and exhibitions societies, notably the ''Salons d'Art Id\u00e9aliste''.\n\nCharacteristically, Delville's paintings are idea-based, expressing philosophical ideals derived from contemporary hermetic and esoteric traditions. At the start of his career, his esoteric perspective was mostly influenced by the work of [[Eliphas Levi]], [[Edouard Schur\u00e9]], [[Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan]] and [[Saint-Yves d'Alveydre]], and later by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] writings of [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Annie Besant]]. The main underlying theme of his paintings, especially during his early career, has to do with initiation and the transfiguration of the inner life of the soul towards a higher spiritual purpose. Specifically they deal with themes symbolising Ideal love, death and transfiguration as well as representations of Initiates ('light bringers'), and the relationship between the material and metaphysical dimensions. His paintings and finished drawings are an expression of a highly sensitive visionary imagination articulated through precisely observed forms drawn from nature. He also had a brilliant gift for colour and composition and excelled in the representation of human anatomy. Many of his major paintings, such as his ''Les Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'' (1895), ''l'Homme-Dieu'' (1903) and ''Les Ames errantes'' (1942), represent dozens of figures intertwined in complex arrangements and painted with highly detailed anatomical accuracy. He was an astonishingly skilled draughtsman and painter capable of producing highly expressive works on a grand scale, many of which can be seen in public buildings in Brussels, including the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palais de Justice]].\n\nDelville's artistic style is strongly influenced by the Classical tradition. He was a lifelong advocate of the value of the Classical training taught in the Academies. He believed that the discipline acquired as a result of this training was not an end in itself, but rather a valuable means of acquiring a solid drawing and painting technique to allow artists freely to develop their personal artistic style, without inhibiting their individual creative personality. Delville was a respected Academic art teacher. He was employed at the [[Glasgow School of Art]] from 1900 to 1906 and as Professor of drawing at the ''Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-arts'' in Brussels thereafter until 1937.\n\nHe was also a prolific and talented author. He published a very great number of journal articles during his lifetime as well as four volumes of poetry, including his ''Le Frisson du Sphinx'' (1897) and ''Les Splendeurs M\u00e9connues (1922)''. He authored more than a dozen books and pamphlets relating to art and esoteric subjects. The most important of his published books include his esoteric works, ''Dialogue entre Nous'' (1895) and ''Le Christ Reviendra'' (1913) as well as his seminal work on Idealist art, ''La Mission de l'Art'' (1900). He also created and edited several contemporary journals and newspapers during the 1890s promoting his Idealist aesthetic including ''L'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' and ''La Lumi\u00e8re''.\n\nDelville was an energetic artistic entrepreneur, creating several influential artistic exhibition societies, including ''Pour l'Art'' and the ''Salons de l'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' in the 1890s and later, the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Art Monumental'' in the 1920s which was responsible for the decoration of public buildings including the mosaics in the hemicycle of the [[Cinquantenaire]] in Brussels. He also founded the very successful ''Coop\u00e9rative artistique'', which provided affordable art materials for artists at the time.\n\n==Early years and training==\nDelville was born on 19 January 1867 at 2.00 a.m., rue des Dominicains in [[Louvain, Belgium|Louvain]]. He was born illegitimate into a working class household. His mother was Barbe Libert (1833\u20131905), the daughter of a [[canal]] worker who earned a living as a 'journali\u00e8re' as an adult. Delville never knew his father Joachim Thibault who was a lecturer in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] at a local college and who came from a [[bourgeoisie]] family. He bore his mother's name until she married a functionary working in Louvain, Victor Delville (1840\u20131918). Victor adopted Jean who, until then, was known as Jean Libert. The family moved to [[Brussels]] in 1870 and settled in Boulevard Waterloo near [[Porte de Hal]]. The Delville family later moved to St Gilles where Delville began his schooling at the ''Ecole Communale'' in rue du Fort.\n\nDelville took an early interest in drawing, even though his initial career ambitions were to become a Doctor. He was introduced to the artist Sti\u00e9venart by his adoptive grandfather, Fran\u00e7ois Delville, while still a young boy. Delville recalls that this was 'the first artist I had ever seen, and for me, as a child, still unaware of my vocation, this was an enchanting experience.'<ref>Quoted in Armand Eggermont, 'Jean Delville. Peintre de la Figure et de l\u2019Id\u00e9e', 19 janvier 1867-19 janvier 1953, ''Le Thyrse'', IVe s\u00e9rie, no. 4 (1 April 1953), p. 152.</ref>\n\nAt the age of twelve, Delville entered the famous ''Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Royale'' in Brussels. His interest in art developed around this time and he received his father's permission to enroll in evening drawing classes at the ''Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-arts'' in the rue du Midi in 1879. He entered the course for drawing 'apr\u00e8s la t\u00eate antique' (after the classical head) and in 1882 classes for drawing 'apr\u00e8s le torse et figure' (after torso and face). Soon after he gave up his schooling at the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e to study full-time at the Acad\u00e9mie. In 1883, he enrolled in the 'cours de peinture d\u2019apr\u00e8s nature' (class in painting after nature) under the direction of the celebrated teacher [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels]] (1818\u20131895). Portaels objected to Delville's youth, but he excelled in the entrance examination and was unconditionally admitted to study painting under Portaels and [[Joseph Stallaert]]. Delville was a precocious talent and at age 17 won many of the major prizes at the Academy including 'drawing after nature', 'painting after nature', 'historical composition' (with high distinction), 'drawing after the antique', and \u2018[[figure painting]]\u2019.<ref>Miriam Delville, 'Jean Delville, mon grand-p\u00e8re' in Laoureux, et al. ''Jean Delville, Ma\u00eetre de l'id\u00e9al'', pp. 14ff; and Brendan Cole. ''Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute''. pp. 19\u201322.</ref>\n\n==Artistic career 1887\u20131900==\n\n===L'Essor, 1887\u20131891===\nDelville first exhibited in a public context at the moderate exhibition society called ''l'Essor'' from 1887 to 1891. His early works were largely depictions of working class -and peasant life executed in a contemporary realist style influenced by Constant Meunier. Delville's early efforts exhibited in 1887 were largely favourably reviewed in the contemporary press, notably ''[[L'Art Moderne]]'' and the ''Journal de Bruxelles'', even if they were seen to be eclectic and derivative of the works of older established artists. These included works inspired by Baudelaire's poetry including his ''Frontispiece'' and ''L'\u00e9pave'' (now lost) and his main work ''La Terre'' of which a detailed drawing still survives.\n\nThe following year his works were singled out as among the most outstanding of the 1888 exhibitors at L'Essor. This was the year in which he exhibited his highly controversial study for his painting ''La M\u00e8re'' depicting a woman in labour. A contemporary review described it in the following: 'On a huge bed with purple sheets ... a dishevelled standing woman displays her nudity as she writhes in spasmodic movements, bending under the pains of childbirth. Her face is contorted, her gnashing teeth alternate with the curse, her clenched hands lift the bed cover over her belly in an unconscious reflex of modesty ... abominable vision ....! and poor women!' This subject, rarely depicted in art, was seen to be shocking and contrary to bourgeois taste. It does however signal an aspect of Delville's art to depict ideas that are vivid and provocative. \n\nDuring the 1880s, Delville's work tended towards social realism. This included images of workers and peasants (''Soir'' and ''Paysan'', 1888); of beggars and destitution (''Asile de nuit'', 1885); of hunger (''L\u2019Affam\u00e9'',1887) and ultimately of death (''Le Dernier Sommeil'', 1888). Here he focussed on themes of poverty, despair and hopelessness. In an undated drawing titled ''Le las d\u2019Aller'' Delville depicts a fallen figure curled up on his side in a barren landscape, asleep, or perhaps even dead. However, during the period 1888-9 his artistic interests started developing in a more non-realist direction and began to move towards Idealism which dominated his work from then on. This was first indicated in his ''Fragment d\u2019une composition: Le cycle de la passion'' (now lost) displayed at L'Essor in 1889. The final work ''Le Cycle passionnel'' (9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;6 metres) was displayed at ''L'Essor'' the following year (1890) and was inspired by Dante's ''Divine Comedy''. It depicts a vast composition of intertwined figures floating through the nether regions of hell. The theme concerns lovers who have succumbed to their erotic passions. One of the main themes of initiation is to control one's lower passions in order to achieve spiritual transcendence. This painting of this work represents this idea in metaphoric form. This is an early major work by Delville sadly destroyed in the incendiary attack on Louvain in 1914. Despite its importance, it was not received with much enthusiasm in the contemporary press.\n\nAnother work that display Delville's growing interest in non-realist ideas during the 1880s is his more well-known''Tristan et Yseult'' (Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels, 1887). The work is inspired by Wagner's eponymous opera and deals with the relationship between love and death and the idea of transcendence that can be achieved through both. It is an early work that reveals themes closely related to the initiatory tradition which is fully discussed in Brendan Cole's recent book on Delville.\n\nA further important work dealing with non-realist, or Idealist, subject matter was exhibited by Delville at the final ''L'Essor'' exhibition in 1891 titled '' La Symbolisation de la chair et de l'\u00e9sprit'' (the original is lost, but a detailed study recently came up for auction). It depicts a naked female figure dragging a nude male beath the water. Bright light appears above the male figure while dark sub-aquatic vegetation surrounds the base of the female. The initiatory theme here is self-evident in its depiction of the conflict between spirit (light) and matter (dark vegetation). The male aspires towards the light but is dragged down towards the bottom of the dark mass of water. The work establishes an essential duality between consciousness/unconsciousness, light/dark, as well as spirituality and materialism. In Delville's writings he emphasises this duality and its reconciliation; a theme that pervades much of Symbolist art and writings and was conspicuous amongst Romantic artists as well, especially the writings of Goethe. The theme dominates Delville's art. He wrote that:\n<blockquote>'Men have two very distinct trends in them. One of these two trends is physical, which must, of course, provide for his preservation by physical means, having the task of sustaining tangible life, sustaining the body. The other trend, which is not only immaterial but indefinable, is that which arises as a perpetual aspiration beyond the material, for which this world is not enough: it is this 'something else' that overcomes all distances or is, rather, unknowable. This is the very threshold of the occult world, in front of which all science, seized with unsteadiness, prostrates itself in the insuperable premonition of a world beyond!'<ref>Jean Delville, 'Conf\u00e9rence sur 'Comment on Devient Mage\" du Sar M\u00e9rodack J. P\u00e9ladan', ''Le Mouvement Litt\u00e9raire'', 45 (8 D\u00e9cembre 1893), p. 357.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Pour L'Art 1892\u20131895===\nDelville's growing interest in Idealist art led him to instigate a succession from ''L'Essor'' to start a new exhibition society called ''Pour L'Art''. Many of the younger artists of ''L'Essor'' followed him which led to the dissolution of that group. ''Pour L'Art'' became one of the noted avant-garde exhibition societies on Brussels at the time. The leading avant-garde exhibition forum at the time was ''Les XX''. Following ''Les XX'',  ''Pour L'Art'' invited international artists as well, several of whom became well known in Symbolist circles, including Carlos Schwabe, Alexandre S\u00e9on, Chales Filiger and Jan Verkade. Their first exhibition took place in November 1892 and the works displayed were executed in either an Impressionist or Symbolist idiom. Delville designed the poster for the first exhibition depicting a long-necked sphinx \u2013 a key symbol of the period \u2013 cupping a flaming chalice in her hands. Delville's main work of that year was his ''L'Idole de la Perversit\u00e9'' which can be considered one of the major images of the period. The new group received a largely positive press during the time. The group was closely associated with Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan's ''Salons de la Rose+Croix'' in Paris, and P\u00e9ladan was frequently invited to lecture in Brussels at the time by members of the ''Pour L'Art'' group.\n\nThe second exhibition of the Pour L'Art group took place in January 1894. Significantly the society also included the applied, or decorative arts, which were become widely popular at the time and a particular feature of Art Nouveau. Tapestries, bookbindings, and wrought-iron work was displayed alongside the paintings. The influence of Delville and P\u00e9ladan was evident in the predominance of idealist works of art influenced by late fifteenth-century Florentine art, the work of Gustav Moreau, Puvis de Chavannes and the tendency towards large-scale figure compositions. The show was enthusiastically received by the press. \n\nDelville's main works exhibited that year was his celebrated ''La Mort d'Orph\u00e9e'' (1893, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels) and his outstanding ''Mysteriosa'' or ''Portrait of Mrs Stuart Madame Stuart Merrill'' (1892, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels). His work was enthusiastically praised in the press. The leading critic Ernest Verlant wrote:\n<blockquote> One of the principal members of the ''Pour L\u2019Art'' group, in view of his talent and astonishing fecundity, is Jean Delville, who is also a writer and a poet; with a powerful imagination that is funereal and tormented. These epithets are equally suited to his large painting ''La Proie'', a crimson vision of apocalyptic murder, similar to his vast composition from last year, ''Vers l\u2019inconnu'', and of several before that. \u2026 Here and there, for example, in ''L\u2019homme du glaive'', the ''Murmure profane'', and ''Mysteriosa'', he pushes the intensity of expression to its extreme. Elsewhere, as in ''Satana'', he draws together, rather bizarrely, esoteric attributes in a figure derived from da Vinci. But we are able only to express praise in front of ''Orph\u00e9e'', a dead head floating between the shafts of a large lyre; in front of ''Elegia'', a long and supple female body appearing under the spurting and cascading waters of a fountain; in front of ''Au Loin'' and ''Maternitas'', two figures pensively leaning on their elbows, of which the first of the two has a great nobility. These works are monochrome, or nearly so. Their expression is accurate, fine, subtle, refined, not too explicit, and all the more eloquent.<ref>Quoted in Cole, ''Jean Delville, Art between Nature and the Absolute'', p. 93</ref></blockquote>\nThe final ''Pour L'Art'' show took place in January 1895. Delville also participated for the last time in P\u00e9ladan's Salons de la Rose+Croix. This was the year when he began preparing the formation of his own exclusively Idealist exhibition Society, the ''Salons d'Art Id\u00e9aliste'', which opened the following year. By this time the ''Pour L'Art'' Salons were well-established, successful and enthusiastically supported by the contemporary press. Delville's ''L'Ange des splendeurs'' (1894, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels), was Delville's main work of that show. Although not widely praised it stands, according to Brendan Cole, as one of his initiatory paintings ''par excellence'' of Delville's ''oeuvre''<ref>Cole, ''Jean Delville'', p. 291.</ref>\n\n=== Delville and P\u00e9ladan's ''Salons de la Rose+Croix'' 1892\u20131895===\nDelville exhibited at Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan's Rosicrucian Salons for the first four years of their existence (1892\u20135), which coincided with his own Pour l'Art Salons. At this time Delville was closely allied to P\u00e9ladan and his ideals. Delville probably met P\u00e9ladan in Paris when he accompanied one of the touring exhibitions of L'Essor, around 1888.<ref>According to Michel Draguet; see Draguet, Id\u00e9e, Idea, Id\u00e9alisme: Figure du Mythe', in Michel Draguet (ed.), ''Splendeurs de l\u2019Id\u00e9al. Rops, Khnopff, Delville et leur temps.'' Li\u00e8ge: Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Art wallon, du 17 octobre d\u00e9cembre 1997, p. 61.</ref>\n\nDelville shared P\u00e9ladan's concept of creating a forum that showcased art of an exclusively Idealist persuasion. Delville sought to bring Idealist art into the public eye in Belgium through the ''Pour l'Art'' salons, but more specifically in the ''Salons d'Art Id\u00e9alist'' which he founded in 1895 and opened to the public in 1896. By 1896, Delville began severing formal ties with P\u00e9ladan, which cleared the way for his move towards Theosophy later that decade. Delville records his association with P\u00e9ladan in his autobiography: '... my personality as an idealist painter emerged more and more. I made the acquaintance of P\u00e9ladan and became interested in and started participating in the esoteric movement in Paris and Brussels. I exhibited at the Rosicrucian Salon where only idealist art was allowed. P\u00e9ladan exhibited several of my works there, notably ''La Mort d\u2019Orph\u00e9e'' which he placed at the centre of the exhibition, along with ''La chair et l\u2019esprit'' and some drawings. Under his influence, I went to live in Paris where I stayed on the Quai Bourbon among some Rosicrucian friends, disciples of P\u00e9ladan. I stayed there for several months occupying my time not only with the organization of the P\u00e9ladanesque salons, but also in painting the set of ''Babylone'' which was an overall success'<ref>Delville, ''Autobiographie'', Archives d\u2019Art contemporaine Belgique (AACB), 23792/1-4 5\u20138.' p. 2. Delville is probably referring to the Salon Rose+Croix of 1893 \u2013  the year P\u00e9ladan staged his play ''Babylone'' in Paris, in April during the Rose+Croix Salon of that year)</ref> \n\nIn 1892 Delville exhibited his ''La symbolisation de la chair et de l\u2019esprit'' (which was reproduced in the catalogue to the first exhibition) as well as his ''l\u2019Idole de la Perversit\u00e9''. In 1893 he exhibited eight works including his ''Imperia'', ''\u00c9legia'', ''La symbolisation de la chair et de l\u2019esprit'', ''L\u2019Annonciateur'', ''Le Murmure profane'', ''Mysteriosa'', ''Vers l\u2019Inconnu'', and ''L\u2019Homme de Glaive''. In 1894 he exhibited seven works including: ''La Mort d\u2019Orph\u00e9e'', ''La Fin d\u2019un r\u00e8gne'', ''Le Geste d\u2019Ame'', ''Satana'', ''Maternitas'', ''Etude f\u00e9minine'' and ''La Tranquille''. In 1895 Delville exhibited four works including his portrait of P\u00e9ladan: ''Portrait du Grand Ma\u00eetre de la Rose+Croix en habit de choeur'' and ''L\u2019Ange des splendeurs''. Many of these works would be displayed in Brussels as well in Delville's ''Pour l'Art'' exhibitions.<ref>See Brendan Cole, '' Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute'', pp. 138\u201344.</ref>\n\n===Prix de Rome and sojourn in Italy, 1895===\nDelville lived as an indigent artist in St Gilles in Brussels during the course of his early career. By the middle of the 1890s he was married and had a growing family which he struggled to support as an artist. On the advice of his close friend, the sculptor Victor Rousseau, he was motivated to enter the prestigious Prix de Rome, which came with a very generous bursary that also covered the costs for a lengthy sojourn in Italy. Delville won the 1895 competition, but his entry created a controversy amongst his peers given the 'Establishment' nature of the Prix that ran counter to the ideals of the avant-garde at the time. Delville was by then a fairly established figure in avant-garde circles and his association with the Prix de Rome appeared to be a betrayal of their cause. The Prix de Rome, however, also meant that Delville could spend a significant amount of time in Italy studying the Classical art of the Renaissance that he admired so much. \n\nThe rules of the competition were stringent. Competitors were isolated in small studios in the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp which ran the competition and were expected to produce a finished drawing of their composition before setting to work on the final painting. A strict time-limit was imposed on competitors to finish the work. The competition opened in June 1895 and he winner was announced in October.<ref>See Miriam Delville, 'Jean Delville, mon grand-p\u00e8re', p. 21</ref> The theme of the competition that year was ''Le Christ glorifi\u00e9 par les enfants''. Delville recorded his experience in his autobiography:\n\n<blockquote>The rules were demanding \u2026 At that time the six selected competitors for the final exam had to paint their work in a secluded lodge, after leaving the original preliminary drawing in a hallway of the Antwerp Academy. It was strictly forbidden to bring any drawings into the lodge, only live models were allowed there. While working on their painting, the competitors had to change their clothes each time they entered their lodge, after having been visited by a specially appointed supervisor. These procedural requirements were the moral guarantee of this great contest in which these artists from the country took part\u2026. As soon as they were selected, they entered into a lodge in order to produce, over three days, the sketch of the requisite painting, and they were given eighty days to complete it without receiving any visitors or advice from anyone \u2013 in order to ensure that the competitors were the unique and personal author of the work so that the jury, composed of the country\u2019s most well-known artists, could cast a definitive judgement.<ref>Delville, ''Autobiography'', p. 3.</ref></blockquote>\nDuring his stay Delville was expected to paint original works reflecting his studies of classical art as well as to make copies after the old masters. He was also expected to send regular reports back to the Antwerp Academy relating to his work there. The experience proved to be a turning point in his career and brought to focus his ideal to synthesise the classical tendency in art with his interest in esoteric philosophy which was the defining attribute of his Idealist aesthetic form then onwards. Delville produced several remarkable paintings during his time in Rome that reflect a dramatic evolution in his art towards a more refined expression of this Idealist aesthetic. These included his outstanding ''Orph\u00e9e aux enfers'' (1896), a key initiatory work, as well as his great masterpiece of the period, his ''L'Ecole de Platon'' (1898), which he exhibited at the 1898 ''Salon d'Art Id\u00e9alist'' to universal praise.<ref>see Cole, ''ibid'' pp. 99\u2013113.</ref> In 1895, Delville published his first book on esoteric philosophy, ''Dialogue entre Nous''.\n\n===The Salons d'Art Id\u00e9aliste 1896\u20131898===\nDelville's ''Salons D'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' were exclusively devoted to exhibiting artwork of an Idealist nature. Delville signalled his programme in a series of polemical articles during the course of the months preceding the opening of the first Salon, which created some controversy amongst his contemporaries. Delville's ideas were bold and confrontational, but it was characteristic of him to stick to the courage of his convictions and to carry his projects through with relentless energy and determination. The aim of the Salons were couched in a short manifesto published before the opening of the first Salon. This is an early instance of a new avant-garde art movement supported by a manifesto; something that would be a commonplace in later Modernist movements and after. The Salons were also accompanied by a series of lectures and musical soir\u00e9es. Delville's Salons were also significant for their inclusion of women artists, something almost unheard of in other contemporary avant garde exhibition societies. The manifesto provides a valuable record of the Idealist movement founded by Delville:\n<blockquote> The intention of the Salons d\u2019Art Id\u00e9aliste is to give rise to an aesthetic Renaissance in Belgium. They bring together, in one annual grouping, all the scattered elements of artistic idealism, that is to say, works with the same leanings towards beauty. Wishing in this way to react against the decadence, against the confusion of the so-called realist, impressionist or libriste schools (degenerate art forms), the Salons d\u2019Art Id\u00e9aliste champion the following as eternal principles of perfection in a work of art: thought, style, and technique. The only thing they recognize as free, within aesthetics, is the creative personality of the artist, and maintain, in the name of harmony, that no work is susceptible to true art unless it is composed of the three absolute terms, namely: spiritual beauty, plastic beauty and technical beauty. Similar, if not identical, to the Parisian Rose & Croix Salons created by S\u00e2r Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan and to the Pre-Raphaelite movement in London, the Salons d\u2019Art Id\u00e9aliste claim to wish to continue, through modern developments, the great tradition of idealist art, from the ancient masters to present-day masters.<ref>'Salons d\u2019Art Id\u00e9aliste', ''La Ligue Artistique'', nr. 23 (4 December 1895), p. 6.</ref></blockquote>\nDelville's main work exhibited that year was his visionary ''Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'' (1895, Royal Museums of Fine Art, Brussels). The work had previously been on show at the Salon de Gand. The depiction of a satanic figure represented under water was unique in Western Art. Instead of wings he is represented with long octopus tentacles. His 'treasures' are the sleeping figures surrounded with jewels and gold coins; objects representing materialism and avarice. The figures show no sign of torment, but are rather represented in a state of somnolent bliss, as though they have succumbed to all that is 'satanic' in Delville's occult view; sensual pleasure and materialism. The work is an apotropaic icon against the snares of the lower passions and the world of matter and sensuality generally. \n\nThe second Salon took place in March 1897 at Edmond Picard's arts venue, ''la Maison d'Art''. Delville's contributions were small and included his ''Orph\u00e9e aux Enfers'', ''Parsifal'' and ''L\u2019Oracle \u00e0 Dodone''; which are now, apart from ''Parsifal'', in private collections. At the time Delville was in Italy on his prescribed sojourn there after winning the coveted Prix de Rome. The show received largely positive reviews in the press and Delville's Salons were becoming more widely accepted, despite his aggressive polemics in the months prior to their establishment which hackled his contemporaries. What was noted as a feature of this Idealist art was its intellectual nature and the proclivity towards the expression of ideas.\n\nThe final ''Salon d'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' took place in March 1898 and was marked by the exhibition of Delville's great masterpiece, his ''l'Ecole de Platon'' (1898, Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay), which marked the culmination of his Idealist programme and widely celebrated amongst his contemporary critics, even those who were previously hostile to his art and aesthetic programme.<ref>See Cole ''Jean Delville'', pp. 115ff for a detailed discussion of Delville's Idealist Salons.</ref>\n\n==After 1900==\nIn 1895 Delville published his ''Dialogue entre nous'', a text in which he outlined his views on occultism and esoteric philosophy. Brendan Cole discusses this text in detail his book on Delville, pointing out that, though the Dialogue reflects the ideas of a number of occultists, it also reveals a new interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. In the late 1890s, Delville joined the [[Theosophical Society]]. He was probably introduced to Theosophy directly through his friendship with Edouard Schur\u00e9, the author of the widely influential book ''Les Grandes Initi\u00e9s''. Schur\u00e9 wrote the preface to Delville's work on Idealist Art, ''La Mission de l'Art'' (1900). Delville also came into close alliance with Annie Besant who inherited the leadership of the Theosophical movement. Besant gave a series of lectures in Brussels in 1899 titled ''La Sagesse Antique''. Delville reviewed her talks in an article published in ''Le Thyrse'' that year.<ref>Delville, 'A propos de la Sagesse Antique. Conference de Mme Annie Besant', ''Le Thyrse'', nr 9, 1 September 1899, pp. 65\u20136.</ref> It is probably from this point onwards that Delville became actively involved in the Theosophical Movements as such. Delville founded ''La Lumi\u00e8re'', a journal devoted to Theosophical ideas in 1899, and published articles from leading Theosophists of the day, including Besant. Delville became the first General Secretary of the Belgian branch of the Theosophical Society in 1911.<ref>See Flaurette Gautier, ''Jean Delville et l'occulture fin de si\u00e8cle''. Unpublished Master's thesis, Tours: University Fran\u00e7ois-Rabelais, 2012.</ref>\nDelville's art flourished after 1900 and he produced some of his greatest works during this period up to the First World War. He worked with undiminished strength and imagination and his paintings revealed a visionary sense of the transcendental inspired by his involvement in the Theosophical movement, seen typically in works such as his monumental ''L'Homme-Dieu'' (1903, Brughes: Groeninge Museum) and ''Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e'' (1907, Free University Brussels). His most striking achievement, however, is his series of five vast canvases that decorated the Cour d'Assises in the Palais de Justice on the theme of 'Justice through the Ages'. These works, monumental in conception and scale and no doubt amongst his finest, were unfortunately destroyed during the second World War as a result of German bombing of the Palais de Justice on 3 September 1944. The irony of this action in relation to the theme of this cycle of paintings cannot be overlooked. Small-scale replacements were installed during the reconstruction of the Palais after the War. The gigantic original central painting titled, ''La Justice, la Loi et la Piti\u00e9'', measured 11 metres by 4.5 metres. This worked was flanked by two works, ''La Justice de Mo\u00efse'' and ''La Justice chr\u00e9tienne'' (both 4 by 3 metres). The two remaining panels represents Justice of the past and present: ''La Justice d'autrefois'' and ''La Justice moderne''.<ref name=\"grand-p\u00e8re 26\">Miriam Delville, ''Jean Delville, mon grand-p\u00e8re'', p. 26.</ref>\n\n===Professor at the Glasgow School of Art, 1900\u20131906===\n[[File:Delville atelier.jpg|thumb|right|Poster advertising Delville's private atelier, c. 1906]]\nDelville hoped to secure a teaching place at the Academy in Brussels, but was offered instead a teaching position at the flourishing [[Glasgow School of Art]] in 1900. His tenure there was highly successful, and the works of the students he trained were celebrated at the annual exhibitions in London. When Delville returned to Brussels in 1907, many of his British students followed him to further their training under his tutelage in his private studio in rue Morris. At that time, Delville fulfilled his ambition to teach at the Brussels Academy and was appointed Professor of Life Studies, a post he held until his retirement in 1937.<ref name=\"grand-p\u00e8re 26\"/>\n\n===The First World War: Exile in London 1914\u201318===\nWhen War broke out, Delville, amongst many Belgians, was welcomed in Britain as exiles. He moved there with his entire family, including his wife and four younger children and settled in Golders Green in London. His two oldest sons, Elie and Rapha\u00ebl Delville, were conscripted into the Belgian War Effort (both survived the conflict). Delville played an active role in London, through his writings, art and public addresses (he was a gifted orator) in support of the Belgians in exile and the conflict against the Germans. He contributed to the Belgian expatriate newspaper in London, ''L'Ind\u00e9pendence Belge'' and wrote several articles and poems virulently condemning German aggression. He was an active member of the philanthropic society for Belgian refugees, ''La Ligue des Patriotes de Belgique'', and was the president of ''La Ligue des Artistes belges'' that was responsible for the creation of the successful publication ''Belgian Art in Exile'' the sale of which raised money for Belgian charities in England. The work contains a great number of representative paintings and other works of art by contemporary Belgian artists. The volume was generally well received. ''The Sketch'' ran a supportive editorial in their January edition and gave informative information about the volume:\n<blockquote>Belgian Art in Exile is the title of a very attractive album of reproductions, mostly in colour, of paintings by exiled Belgian artists, with photographs of works by Belgian sculptors, which has been issued in aid of the Belgian Red Cross and other Belgian charitable institutions. The colour-plates, which are beautifully reproduced, show the high quality and great versatility of modern Belgian art. Particularly notable is a picture of a Moorish cavalry charge, by Alfred Bastien, who since he came to this country has done some fine work for the Illustrated London News. Among many other well-known Belgian artists represented are Albert Baertsoen, Jean Delville, Emile Claus, Herman Richir, Comte Jacques de Lalaing, and Paul Dubois. A fine painting by Frank Brangwyn \u2013 Mater Dolorosa Belgica \u2013 forms a pictorial introduction\", as the frontispiece. Maeterlinck contributes a eulogy of King Albert, and there are poems by Emile Verhaeren, Marcel Wyseur, and Jean Delville, who also writes an introduction. The volume is published by Colour (25, Victoria Street, S.W. at 5s. and (in cloth) 73. 6d., with a limited edition de luxe at \u00a31. Both for itself and the cause it should command a wide sale.<ref>'Woman\u2019s Ways', ''The Sketch'', 5 January 1916, p. IV.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt that time Delville was also an active Freemason and was involved in La Loge Albert 1er that reunited Belgian Freemasons in exile living in Britain.<ref>See Olivier Delville, ''Jean Delville, peintre, 1867\u20131953'', Brussels: Laconti, 1984, pp. 32\u20134.</ref> His time in exile also inspired several important paintings, including: ''La Belgique indomptable'' (1916), depicting a sword-wielding allegorical female figure holding off an attacking Germanic eagle,''Les M\u00e8res'' (1919), depicting a group of mourning mothers surrounded by dead corpses of their fallen sons, and ''Sur l'Autel de la patrie'' (1918), a modern pieta depicting a female figure with the corpse of a bleeding dead soldier at her feet. His most notable work of this period is his ''Les Forces'' (completed in 1924), depicting two vast celestial armies confronting each other. The forces of light, represented on the right, are led by a Christ-like figure seated on a horse and a torch-bearing winged figure leading an army of angels into the fray against a battalion of dark forces streaming in from the left. The work is on open display in the Palais de Justice in the vast 'cour des pas perdus' and is grand in scale, measuring 5 metres by 8 metres.\n\n===The 'Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Art Monumental' 1920===\nFrom an early point in his career Delville was interested in producing art that would be displayed in public spaces for the edification of all. For him, art was a means of uplifting the public, and to this end he despised art that was produced for an elite clique, sold by dealers for the benefit of collectors who saw in art no more than an investment opportunity. Delville's ideals were strongly aligned to the idea of a social purpose for art, about which he wrote extensively during his career. In his ''Mission de l'Art'' he wrote: 'If the purpose of Art, socially speaking, is not to spiritualise the weighted thinking of the public, then one has the right to ask oneself, what is truly its usefulness, or more precisely, its purpose'.<ref>Delville, ''La Mission de L'Art'', 1900, p. 23.</ref>\nAlthough he had already created several large artistic schemes that decorated public buildings, notably his panels for the Palais de Justice, his ambition formally to pursue this aim was finally realised in 1920 when he collaborated with several leading painters of his generation to create the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Art Monumental'' (Society for Monumental Art). The aim of the group was to bring together painters, artists and architects who would draw attention to the need for art specifically created for public buildings.\n\nAn important realisation of this aim was the decoration of the walls in the colonnades of the hemicycles flanking the [[Arcade du Cinquantenaire|Arcade of the Parc du Cinquantenaire]]. Five artists collaborated with Delville on this project: [[Constant Montald]], [[:fr:\u00c9mile Vloors|Emile Vloors]], [[:nl:Omer Dierickx|Omer Dierickx]], [[:fr:\u00c9mile Fabry|Emile Fabry]] and [[:fr:Albert Ciamberlani|Albert Ciamberlani]]. The last two were friends of Delville's since his days at the Academy and had collaborated on many project before. Most of these artists had also exhibited in Delville's Idealist forums, ''Pour L'Art'' and the ''Salons d'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' during the 1890s.\n\nThe project went ahead under the patronage of King Albert I, and was paid for through a scheme of national subscription.\n\nThe overall theme of this major cycle of works was a patriotic commemoration of  'The Glorification of Belgium' following the Great War through allegorical images relating to War and peace. In 1924 Delville expressed his idea for the cycle as a 'vision of a frieze in mosaic unfurling its rhythm of lines and its harmony of colours between the columns of the hemicycle'<ref>Delville, 'Comment est n\u00e9 le project de la d\u00e9coration de l'H\u00e9micycle de l'Arcade du Cinquantenaire', in ''Gand Artistique'' November 1924, p. 256.</ref>\n \nEach artist prepared six individual works (cartoons) that were then adapted to the final mosaics which were three metres high and aligned to the top part of the wall. The total distance of all the mosaics was 120 metres. An overall harmony of all the individual panels was achieved by ensuring that the artists adhered to a few common rules of composition: using the same horizon line, using the same scale for the figures, and adhering to a limited palette of related colours. The specific theme to the left of the arcade is that of Belgium at peace. Works by Fabry, Vloors and Montald represented respectively: the material life, intellectual life and moral life. The specific theme to the right side represent heroic Belgium, with works by Delville, Ciamberlani and Dierickx representing respectively: Victory, the Tribute to Heroes and War.\n\nThe project was conceived between 1922 and 1926 and completed in 1932. The mosaics themselves were executed by Jean Lahaye and Emile Van Asbroeck of the company A Godchol.<ref>see [http://www.irismonument.be/fr.Bruxelles_Extension_Est.Parc_du_Cinquantenaire.A016.html Arcade et h\u00e9micycle Parc du Cinquantenaire]</ref>\n\nThis monumental creation was a vindication of Idealist trends in art presented in a public space and gave his artistic perspective a wider visibility amongst the general public.<ref>See Emile Berger, ' Jean Delville et l'enjeu du monumental', in Laoureux, et al. ''Jean Delville, Ma\u00eetre de l'id\u00e9al''. p. 126ff.</ref>\n\nWorking towards the public good and alleviating the suffering of mankind was also a principle ideal of the Theosophists, an ideal to which Delville's subscribed throughout his life. Delville's Theosophical-socialist views were articulated in two articles his published before the War: ''Socialisme de demain'' (1912) and ''Du Principe sociale de l'Art'' (1913).\n\n==Later years==\nFrom the 1920s onwards, Delville experienced a much more settled and successful career than ever before. With the highly successful completion of the two major public projects in the Palais de Justice and the Cinquantenaire,<ref>See Clovis Pi\u00e9rard,  'Jean Delville, Peintre, Po\u00e8te, Esth\u00e9ticien', ''Memoire et Publications des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Arts et des Lettres de Hainault'', (1971\u20131973), pp. 228ff and 236ff, concerning the highly positive public reception of these works.</ref> and his election as a member of the prestigious Belgian Royal Academy of sciences and letters in 1924, he seemed to have been drawn much closer into the Belgian establishment during these years. He maintained his post as 'Premier Professeur' at the Academy of Fine Art in Brussels until 1937 and continued to paint until crippling arthritis in his right hand forced him to give up the brush in 1947.\n\nHis ambition to create large-scale Idealist works of art was sustained right up to the end of his painting career after the Second World War; notable examples amongst which include his ''Les Forces'' (1924, 55 \u00d7 800&nbsp;cm, Palais de Justice), ''Les Derni\u00e8res Idoles'' (1931, 450 \u00d7 300&nbsp;cm, private collection) and ''La Roue du Monde'' (1940, 298 \u00d7 231&nbsp;cm, Antwerp: Royal Museum of Fine Art). He was still able to sustain a power of expression and a highly articulate finish to his works in his later years that was there from the very start. However, a change in his style took place amongst some of his works in the 1930s, (especially while he was resident in Mons). Characteristically they became more pared-down in their articulation of form and colour: Shapes became more stylised and geometric and his colours were more pallid, or 'pastel' in tone, lacking the energy, vibrant contrasts and rich tonalities that was characteristic of his work until then. His treatment of figures also became more stylised and he often articulated their facial features with characteristically 'almond'-shaped eyes, giving his figures an otherworldy appearance. Typical examples of this period include his ''Seraphitus-Seraphita'' (1932), ''Les Id\u00e9es'' (1934), ''Le Dieu de la Musique'' (1937) and ''P\u00e9gase'' (1938).\n\n[[File:Delville bust.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial bust of Jean Delville, Avenue Sept Bonniers, Brussels, Belgium]]\n\nDelville remained a committed and passionate Theosophist until his death in 1953 and he maintained in one of his biographies that this always formed the foundation to this moral and artistic perspective throughout his later life. Regarding this important aspect of his intellectual and spiritual life, he wrote in 1944:\n<blockquote>En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, la philosophie occulte occupe le fond de ma pens\u00e9e depuis bien des ann\u00e9es ! Je pense avoir lu \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tout ce qui fut publi\u00e9 d\u2019important sur les probl\u00e8mes de l\u2019invisible. ... Depuis, j\u2019ai beaucoup cherch\u00e9, \u00e9tudi\u00e9 sur la nature des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes psychiques. L\u2019Etude des sciences occultes est \u00e0 la base de ma vie intellectuelle et morale.<ref>Jean Delville, ''Autobiographie'', manuscript: fonds Eggermont, PA/AACB/2009-20</ref></blockquote>\nDelville died on his birthday, 19 January 1953.\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1919''' : Officer of the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]].<ref>Royal Decree of H.M. King Albert I on 14.11.1919</ref>\n\n==Theory and technique==\n\n===Idealist theory===\nDelville wrote prolifically throughout his life outlining his Idealist aesthetic. His first main publication on the subject was his ''Mission de l'Art'' (1900). Delville's Idealist theory is a syncretic formulation of traditional Idealist thinking (in the tradition of Plato, Schopenhauer and Hegel) and contemporary esoteric philosophy.<ref>For a complete discussion of the relationship between Delville's ''Mission de l'Art'' and ''Hegelian Idealism'', see: Brendan Cole  'Jean Delville's ''La Mission de l'Art'': Hegelian Echoes in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Idealism', ''Religion and the Arts'' 10/2007; 11(3\u20134):330\u2013372.</ref>\nIn summary, Delville believed that art is the expression of the Ideal (or spiritual) in material form and is founded on the principle of Ideal Beauty, in other words Beauty that is the manifestation of the Ideal, or spiritual realm, in physical objects. Contemplating objects that manifest Ideal Beauty allows us to perceive, if only fleetingly, the spiritual dimension and we are transfigured as a result.<ref>For a detailed discussion of Delville's theory of art and Beauty, see: Brendan Cole, ''Jean Delville, Art between Nature and the Absolute.'', especially the detailed chapter four, pp. 150ff.</ref>\n\nDelville outlines this in a vivid passage in his ''La Mission de l'Art'' where he emphasises the expressive value of Idealist art, in other words, that it is not merely a question of engaging passively with the image, but it is also about feeling the 'energy' that it radiates, which uplifts and transforms the consciousness of the viewer, in a spiritual way. Idealism in art is, he writes, 'the introduction of Spirituality into Art'. For Delville, the Idea is an expression of the Ideal realm, and it is a living force within human experience that dwells within the transpersonal realm of human experience. He writes further that:\n<blockquote>The Idea, in the metaphysical or esoteric sense, is Force, the universal and divine force which moves worlds, and its movement is the supreme rhythm whence springs the harmonious working of Life.\n\nWhere there is no thought, there is no life, no creation. The modern western world has become unconscious of this tremendous power of the Ideal, and Art inevitably has thus become degraded. This ignorance of the creative forces of thought has, nevertheless, obscured and diverted towards materialism all modern judgement. Materialism does not know ''how'' ideas and thoughts vibrate, and how these vibrations impinge on the consciousness of the individual.\n\nAnd yet these vibrations, though invisible to the greater part of mankind, are able to exercise an astounding influence over the mentality of human beings, and thus assist in their evolution. Before works of genius the human consciousness receives mental and spiritual vibrations, which are generated by the force of the idea reflected. The more elevated, pure and sublime a work is, the more the inner being, coming into contact with the ideal vibrations emanated from it, will be raised, purified, and made sublime. The artist who is not ideal, that is to say, artist who does not know that every form must be the result of an idea, and that every idea must have its form, the artist, in short, who does not know that Beauty is the luminous conception of equilibrium in forms, will never have any influence over the soul, because his works will be really without thought, that is, without life.\n\nThe Idea is the emotion of the Spirit as Emotion is the reflex of the Soul.<ref>Jean Delville, ''La Mission de L'Art'' translated as ''The New Mission of Art. A Study of Idealism in Art''. Translated by Francis Colmer, with an introduction by Cliffor Bax and Edouard Schur\u00e9. London: Francis Griffiths, 1910, pp 11\u201312.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelville goes further by dividing his understanding of Beauty into three categories: I) Spiritual Beauty: the source of beauty in physical objects, ii) Formal beauty: the physical articulation of Beauty in works of art, and iii) Technical beauty: the specific execution of line, colour, light and shade, and composition to express Ideal beauty in physical objects and works of art. In French Delville referred to these terms as: ''La Beaut\u00e9 spirituelle'', ''La Beaut\u00e9 plastique'' and ''La Beaut\u00e9 technique''.<ref>see Delville's, ''La Mission de l'Art'', pp. 15ff.</ref>\nDelville goes further to map his threefold conception of Beauty onto his esoteric conception of the threefold nature of reality, consisting of the Natural, Human and Divine realms, as well as the threefold nature of man as body (senses), soul (feeling) and mind (thought and spirituality).<ref>Cole, ''Jean Delville'', pp. 335\u2013336.</ref> He writes:\n<blockquote>The work of Idealist Art is therefore that which will harmonise in itself the three great Words of Life: the Natural, the Human and the Divine. To attain this degree of aesthetic balance, \u2013  which, I am happy to concede, is not within the reach of just anyone! \u2013 one must find within the work the purest idea on an intellectual level, the most beautiful form within the artistic realm, and the most perfect technique in terms of execution. Without an idea, a work misses its intellectual mission, without form, it misses its natural mission and, without technique, it misses its goal of perfection. \u2026 The veritable character of the work of Idealist Art can be identified from the balance reigning over its accomplishment, meaning that it does not let the essential terms of idea, art or technique prevail one over the other, but more likely according to relations proportional to their respective powers.<ref>Delville, ''La Mission de L'Art'', pp.35\u201336. Translated in Cole, ''Jean Delville'', p. 335.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===The Classical Tradition===\nDelville believed that the purest expression of Idealist art was to be found in the Classical Tradition of ancient Greek art and the High Renaissance. For him, Classical art was the purest expression of the spiritual in material form. Delville sought to reinterpret the Classical idiom in a contemporary context, to suite, in other words his specific Idealist style of art that he was formulating during the 1890s; not simply, in other words, to copy or imitate classical modes of art<ref>Cole, pp. 191ff.</ref> The expression of harmony and equilibrium, which he saw as an essential aspect of Classical art, were fundamental in the expression of the spiritual in natural forms. There is a mystical aspect to Delville's aesthetic, and idea of Ideal Beauty, when he wrote that:\n<blockquote>The Beautiful, taken in its classical sense, is not an illusion. The Beautiful is the True manifested by the Idea in form. This is the highest goal that the artist must seek to attain \u2026 When the artist causes light to spring forth from darkness, beauty from ugliness, the pure from the impure, he reveals Truth to humanity, he reveals God. The Beautiful, the True, the Good are synonyms. It is the glory of Art to be able to make perceptible to human eyes the three mysteries which form a single one!<ref>Delville, 'Autre Pens\u00e9e'. I-XIII, ''La Ligue Artistique'', 14 (July 1898), p. 2. Quoted in Cole, ''Jean Delville'', p. 192.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Idealist art===\nDelville developed a distinct style in his painting, which is unmistakable. His finished drawing and paintings are highly articulate and precise in the way he renders forms. However, his works are not overbearingly detailed, as is often found in realist art, but he manages to capture the essence of the forms he articulates using the simplest means possible. This is especially so in his approach to figures. In his ''l'Amour des Ames'' he outlines the figures using long, curvaceous contours, and their anatomy is only lightly suggested using gentle contrasts in light and shade; the effect is the expression of great beauty without being overbearingly sensual: a technique often seen in Renaissance frescos. Delville had a great imagination for colour and its use for expressive purposes. His colours are often vivid, almost visionary; most clearly seen in his ''Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'' which is bathed in an atmosphere of luminous golds and yellows. In his ''L'Ange des Splendeurs'' he captures the effect of iridescent, diaphanous gold in the angel's drapery contrasting distinctly with the heavy earthiness of the natural details (animals, spiders, vegetation) at bottom right hand side. His ''Ecole de Platon'' is a paradigm of serenity in his use of muted, cool colours and pastel shades to emphasise the intellectual idyll of Plato's ''Akademos''.\n\nDelville very seldom painted landscapes, still life or portraits for their own sake, but often incorporated these in his figure paintings. Almost all of Delville's paintings focus on the human form as the bearer of the drama of his works. He was a master of the articulation of human anatomy which he used to express vividly his Idealist technique and ideas. The various ways he articulates the human form is key to understanding his artistic programme that he unveiled in his paintings throughout his career. This is especially the case in the rendering of lithe and supple male and female figures in his ''Les Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'', ''L'Amour des Ames'' and ''L'Ecole de Platon'', or the highly expressive drawn, sinewy almost emaciated forms in the lower part of his epic ''l'Homme-Dieu'' displaying the suffering and distress of the human condition; or in the highly muscular, Titanesque rendering of anatomy in his heroic figures in his ''Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e'' and ''Les Derni\u00e8res Idoles''.\n\nFor a good selection of paintings with clear reproductions see this website: [https://lightbearerofbeauty.wordpress.com/art/?preview=true&preview_id=69&preview_nonce=bc063a28e8 \"Jean Delville: Initiate of Spiritual Beauty\"]\n\n==Practise: idealist artworks==\n\n===''Mysteriosa'' or ''The Portrait of Mrs. Stuart Merrill'' (1892)===\n\n'''Pencil, pastel and coloured pencil on paper, 40 x 32.1&nbsp;cm, Brussels: Royal Museum of Fine Art'''\nThough Delville frequently wrote about his ideas, he almost never discussed his paintings. He left the interpretations to the viewer, and as a result his best pictures have an air of mystery and intrigue. One of the most mysterious is his Portrait of Mrs. [[Stuart Merrill]]. This drawing, executed in chalks in 1892, is strikingly otherworldly. In it Delville depicts the young woman as a medium in trance, with her eyes turned upwards. Her radiating red-orange hair combines with the fluid light of her aura.\n\nThe hot colours which surround Mrs. Merrill's head appear to allude to the earthly fires of passion and sensuality. On the other hand, the book on which she rests her chin and long, almost spectral hands is inscribed with an upwards-pointing triangle. This represents Delville's idea of perfect human knowledge, achieved (as he says in his Dialogue), through magic, the Kabbalah and Hermeticism. As a number of authors have pointed out, the painting, with its references to occultism and wisdom seems to hint at initiation. If so, the woman's red aura might refer to her sensual side, which will become more spiritualised as she moves into a different stage of development.\n\nWhatever its interpretation, this very unusual portrait has had a strong effect on viewers. It can be seen as eerie and supernatural (Bade, Femme Fatale, 1979), or as \"a positively magical vision\" (Jullian, ''Dreamers of Decadence'', 1974). It is sometimes referred to as the Mona Lisa of the 1890s, and is also given the title La Mysteriosa . Today, few details are available about the sitter, and even her first name goes unmentioned in the literature. The most extensive information on her identity is given by Delville's son Olivier in his biography of the painter. It is not a first-hand account, however, as Olivier was born at least ten years after the picture was executed. According to him, Stuart Merrill (a Symbolist poet who published his works in Paris and Brussels) had a house near to the Delvilles in Forest at that time. Olivier adds that \"the young Mrs Merrill-Rion\" was a Belgian, and that Delville was struck by her strange beauty and depicted her with a mediumistic character. It is likely that Delville painted other portraits of Mrs Stuart Merrill and the 1893 drawing 'Medusa', in the same media is undoubtedly one of these.\n\nThe painting was not bought by the Merrills, and remained with the Delvilles until it was sold to a Californian private collector in the late 1960s. In 1998, it was acquired by the Brussels Museum of Fine Arts, and is now on display to the public.\n\n===''The Angel of Splendour'' (''L'Ange des Splendeurs'', 1894)===\n\n'''Oil in canvas, 127 x 146&nbsp;cm, Brussels: Museum of Fine Art.'''\n\nThis is undoubtedly one of Delville's most visionary images of the early 1890s. The work refers to Delville's interests in the idea of initiation and the spiritualisation of the soul. As seen in many of his works, Delville often plays on the tension between opposites: light and dark, spirit and matter, Nature and the Ideal, etc. These ideas are personified in this work in the duality between the androgynous Angel and the young androgynous youth who is ensnared in the natural or material realm. His lower torso is engulfed in serpents and surrounded by toads, spiders, butterflies and other life-forms of the natural world. The Angel, on the other hand is a vision of diaphanous gold, clothed in a dress that is more fluid than material, emanating a soft, but intense, light. Her face is of the exquisite beauty commonly seen in Renaissance portraiture, notably in the work of Leonardo, who Delville admired. The bright aureole that surrounds her face beaming light in all directions is a common signifier of her spiritual nature. Her proportions are odd, by human standards, and they were criticised by his contemporaries, but Delville understood that to humanise the angel would be to contradict her symbolic function in this work. She remains a being who is physically of her own, transcendental, realm.  She points upwards indicating the path to the Ideal realm of spirit and beauty while the youth reaches towards her in an attempted gesture to release himself from the material snares that envelop him from below. There is an obvious tension here, as it is not entirely clear whether the youth will make it, or sink back into the deadening material realm from which he is emerging. The first step on the path of initiation and transcendence is to overcome and control the limitations of the illusory material dimension, and specifically to control the passions and desires, in order to clear the path for the transcendence of the soul. This painting is a totem of that moment in the initiatory drama that Delville expressed in many of his paintings and poems at the time.<ref>The work is discussed in detail in, Cole, ''ibid''., pp 280\u2013292.</ref>\n\n===''Sathan\u2019s Treasures'' (''Les Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'', 1895)===\n\n'''Oil on canvas, 258 x 268&nbsp;cm, Brussels: Museum of Fine Art'''\n\nDelville exhibited his ''Tr\u00e9sors de Sathan'' (''Sathan's Treasures'') at the Salon de Gand in September 1895 while he was working on his entry for the Belgian Prix de Rome. It was then exhibited in Brussels for the first time in 1896 at Delville's first ''Salon d'Art Id\u00e9aliste''. This was one of Delville's first 'breakthrough' paintings and one of his most important works from his artistic period up to 1895.<ref>See Cole, ''Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute'', ''ibid'', p. 215.</ref>\n\nOn the whole, Delville's works generally deal with the theme of the duality between nature (human or otherwise) and the transcendental world. Delville was an Idealist, in other words, he believed in the reality of a transcendental or spiritual dimension as the basis of reality. Our perceptual material world is, in this world-view, seen merely an illusion that brings suffering and discontent. Our goal is to spiritualise our being and refine our material selves, which includes our desires and need for the fulfillment of material satisfaction. Without a spiritual context in mind, men and women simply become deadened materialistic entities always governed by their desires, passions, greed and ego-driven need for control and power over others. This is the realm of matter, or in Delville's cosmology, the realm of Sathan, who controls and governs our lower state of being. Without a spiritual goal in life, we are merely slaves to Sathan and are completely submissive to his power; we become his 'treasure' as is implied in the title of this painting. Here Delville depicts Sathan as a rather attractive figure, beguiling, powerful and seductive, dragging the hapless mass of men and woman to his undersea lair. Significantly the figures are not in a state of pain or agony, as is usually the case in Western depictions of Satan's underworld. Here they appear to be in a state of reverie and bliss, unconscious of their lives and the value of the spiritual reality of their existence, and succumbing, rather, entirely to the lure of gold and sensual pleasure; in other words, material greed and sensualism that Delville saw as a trap and a catastrophic diversion from humanity's true goal which is to spiritualise one's being and enter the higher realm of consciousness and spiritual bliss which he referred to as the 'Ideal'.<ref>For a very detailed discussion of this work, see Cole, ''ibid''., pp. 215 to 244.</ref>\n\nThe theme of exercising control over one's lower nature, of erotic temptation and indulgence was believed by Delville and his esoteric contemporaries (especially Jos\u00e9ph P\u00e9ladan) to represent the first stage on the path of initiation. This was first suggested in Edouard Schur\u00e9's influential work ''The Great Initiates'' and outlined in a passage reconstructing the Egyptian initiatory trials. He recounts how the final trial is set to resist erotic temptation personified in the form of an alluring female figure.<ref>See Edouard Schur\u00e9, ''Les Grandes Initi\u00e9s'',Paris, Perrin, reprint, 1921, p. 135.</ref>\n\nDelville expressed these ideas in an article published in the contemporary journal ''Le Mouvement Litt\u00e9raire'' in 1893:\n<blockquote>Erotic fever has sterilised most minds. One ordinarily thinks of himself as virile because he satisfies a woman\u2019s unquenched bestial desires. Well, that\u2019s where the great shame of the cerebral degeneration of our time starts. The poet, the artist, the scientist are mostly attached to the spiritual functions rather than the emasculating animal functions. The real male is he whose mind can dominate the body and who only responds to solicitations of the flesh as his will allows. \u2026 if the works of the Sar, a virile man if ever there was one, energetically banish sexual conflicts, that is, are a consistent plea in favour of chastity, it is because he has studied the ravages of carnal love, because he has understood that one has to beware of the feelings of the heart, a heart in love being a dangerous accomplice of instinct. \u2026 Unfortunately, for the most part, we remain stubbornly ignorant of the fact that real virginity develops highly the powers of the soul, and that, to those who dedicate themselves to it, it imparts faculties unknown to the rest of the human race.<ref>Jean Delville, 'Conf\u00e9rence sur \"Comment on Devient Mage\" du Sar M\u00e9rodack J. P\u00e9ladan', ''Le Mouvement Litt\u00e9raire'', 45 (8 December 1893), p. 358.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere are also frequent references to 'Sathan' in Delville's 1897 anthology of poems ''Frisson du Sphinx'', for example his 'Les Murmures de l\u2019Ombre', 'T\u00eate d\u2019Ombre', 'La Temp\u00eate' and 'l\u2019Etoile Noire'. This last vividly evokes the motif that runs throughout Delville's writings:\n\n''L'\u00c9TOILE NOIRE''<br />\nDu plus profond enfer du mal et du n\u00e9ant<br />\nl'on voit le noir \u00e9clat de l'astre satanique<br />\ndarder sinistrement, comme en une panique,<br />\nses n\u00e9fastes rayons au coeur du m\u00e9cr\u00e9ant.\n\nSathan br\u00fble ce feu sombre des mal\u00e9fices<br />\npour fasciner les yeux coupables et damn\u00e9s<br />\net pour faire jaillir sur tous ceux qui sont n\u00e9s<br />\nle chaos infernal des t\u00e9n\u00e8bres complices.\n\nM\u00ealant son despotisme \u00e0 son absurdit\u00e9,<br />\ncontre le Beau, l'Amour, le Ciel, la V\u00e9rit\u00e9,<br />\nc'est le mensonge haineux et la lourde ignorance.\n\nO ! vieil astre de mort, effroyable appareil,<br />\nvous \u00eates la nuit froide et la morne impuissance,<br />\ncar le sang clair du Christ est l'\u00e2me du soleil!\n\n''The Dark Star'' (translation)\n{{quote|From the deepest hell of evil and nothingnessone sees the dark glare of the satanic star sinisterly shining, as in a panic,its harmful rays of light into the heart of the unbeliever.

Delville painted this work while he was in Italy on his artistic sojourn there after winning the coveted [[Prix de Rome (Belgium)|Belgian Prix de Rome]]. Delville was then, at last, able to study the classical works of the Renaissance and the ancient world that profoundly influenced his artistic ideas.\n\nThe scale of the painting is impressive, measuring 2.60 metres high by 6.05 metres long, and Delville certainly had in mind large-scale Academic History paintings which were the preserve of erudite artistic subjects painted in the classical tradition, which he sought to renew.<ref>See Brendan Cole, ''Jean Delville. Art Between Nature and the Absolute'', p 310. Cole gives a highly detailed analysis and discussion of this work; see ''ibid.'', pp 307\u2013353</ref> The figures depicted are almost life size. The style of the painting is inspired by the Italian frescoes by Raphael and Michelangelo that Delville would have seen while in Rome; characterised by bold articuation of forms with a matte (as opposed to a glossy) finish. The painting was first exhibited at Delville's final ''Salon d'Art Id\u00e9aliste'' in Brussels in 1898. The work was universally praised as a masterpiece by his contemporaries. The leading avant-garde art journal ''L'Art Moderne'', which was frequently hostile towards Delville and his art, praised his work in the following: 'Jean Delville ... has created a Work! A superb work of art: The School of Plato, to which he refers as \"an essay in Fresco\" \u2013 Go and see it! It is of a calm, a serene, a grand and delicious Beauty ... Ideal, yes, truly ideal. The programme shows his worth and it is magnificent.... It is beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!<ref>'Geste 3e des Salons d\u2019Art id\u00e9aliste a la Maison d\u2019Art', ''L\u2019Art Moderne'', 12 (20 March 1898), p. 93.</ref>\n\nDelville was immersed in studying the esoteric tradition and the hidden philosophies that were popular at the time. This was a tradition that extolled the virtues of self-improvement and spiritual progress through initiation. Edouard Schur\u00e9 already identified Plato as one of the 'Great Initiates', in other words, light bearers who guide humanity towards higher consciousness and deeper spiritual awareness during our earthly incarnation. Plato taught of the essential duality between the material and metaphysical dimensions; his gesture, pointing upwards and downwards alludes to this duality between macrocosm and microcosm.<ref>See Cole, ''ibid''., pp. 339ff.</ref> Attainment of the Ideal realm and the expression of its truths in physical form was the key notion in Delville's aesthetic philosophy. He wrote often that the goal of art should aspire towards expressing Absolute, or Spiritual Beauty in physical form. He saw Classical art as the purest expression of this goal and he sought a revival of this idea in art, reworking it in a way that was appropriate for his contemporary cultural era. For Delville, moreover, the human body, was the purest expression of Ideal and Spiritual Beauty. He therefore often resorted to the depiction of nude male and female figures in his art as vehicles for the expression of this Ideal; as is clearly seen in this work. Concerning the spiritual importance of the nude as a vehicle for the expression of a Spiritual ideal he wrote\n<blockquote>The nude has the high quality of being synthetic and universal. \u2026 in evoking Mankind, it evokes Humanity and all the beauty of Life, not life as we modern beings understand it, comprising nerves, morbid fevers and agitation, but the great universal life, which enriches the spirit and the earth, makes stars and souls resplendent and makes space vibrate, which beats in substance as in essence, which rules and moves the Universe, the beings and the objects, mortal or immortal, in the infinite rhythm and the mystery of Eternity, divine macrocosm and human microcosm where Universal Beauty, made of Love, Wisdom and Light, shines and is reflected forever.<ref>Delville, ''La Mission de l'Art'', Brussels: Georges Balat, 1900, pp. 62\u20133, translated in Cole, ''ibid''., p. 301.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe men in this painting are conceived in an idealised androgynous form: a concept that Delville, following P\u00e9ladan, developed to express the ideal of a non-erotic perfection of the human state that synthesises the male and female principle in an idea of wholeness and perfection, which emulates the original state of human perfection that precedes our split, dual experience of reality in our earthly incarnation.<ref>See Cole, ''ibid''., pp. 334ff.</ref>\n\n=== ''The Love of Souls'' (''L'Amour des Ames'', 1900) ===\n'''Tempera and oil on canvas, 268 x 150&nbsp;cm. Brussels: Mus\u00e9e communal des beaux-arts d'Ixelles.'''\n\nThis is undoubtedly one of Delville's most subtly articulated and beautiful images of the period. Delville depicts the union of souls, male and female, in a cosmic setting. This painting suggests a theme important to Delville and his contemporaries regarding the return to unity in the dual male and female principles of human experience that results in spiritual androgyny. Male energy and female energy is united to form a state of wholeness and complete unity of Being. It is a cosmic conception of the goal of existence, beyond opposites, polarity and discord. This state signifies a return to the original state of perfection and integration of opposites that unites us to the Cosmic mind; beyond time and space and the duality of physical and material existence. This spiritual union gives birth to the transcendent being; the cosmic Christ within. Delville often wrote of the nature of duality and the forces of opposites, as well as the need to bring these into harmony, in other words achieving Equilibrium. In fact, he understood the experience of opposition in nature (human as well as in the natural world) as an underlying 'law' relating to what he termed the 'Equilibrium in the Universal Order', with regard to which, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>In spite of a contrary appearance, all the forces, all the manifestations of nature influence each other with currents of negative polarity and positive polarity, undeniable astral influences. \u2026 The great contrasts of life, however, are responsible for all the misery, all the hardship; are they responsible for the production of Chaos?\n\nA huge mistake: The Great and the Small, the Strong and the Weak, the High and the Low, the Active and the Passive, the Full and the Empty, the Weighty and the Dense, Exterior and Interior, the Visible and the Invisible, the Beautiful and the Ugly, the Good and the Bad, Essence and Substance, Spirit and Matter are divergent forces which eternally constitute the great Equilibrium in the Universal Order. It is a Natural Law, and no philosophy, no dogma, no doctrine will ever prevail over It.<ref>Delville, ''Dialogue Entre Nous. Argumentation Kabbalistique, Occultiste, Id\u00e9aliste'' (Bruges: Daveluy Fr\u00e8res, 1895), pp. 77\u20138.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe setting of this work is important. Delville places the figures in an indeterminate, cosmic setting, suggesting that they are not figures that have human substance, but are rather symbols of the transcendent spiritual nature of man and woman. The ribbons of colour surrounding them suggests a fluid energy field upon which they are buoyed; an idea that Delville and his contemporaries often referred to as 'astral light' \u2013 an energy-force that animates living entities; much like the idea of 'the field' in quantum physics.\n\nDelville painted this work in Tempera, where pigments are mixed with egg white to create a luminous finish and a highly durable work of art. He was highly influenced by the artists of the Italian Renaissance who often used Tempera in their works, and which, to this day, retain their purity of colour and luminosity to a high degree. The close-up details reveal his technique of applying the paint in small strokes, rather than blend the colours on the palette, they are blended by the eye. To achieve this effect one has to be highly skilled as a draughtsman.<ref>For a detailed discussion of this work, see Cole, ''Jean Delville, Art Between Nature and the Absolute'', pp. 293\u2013306</ref>\n\n==Character==\nIn his biography, Delville's son Olivier tells us that his father, determined to pass his ideals on to the world, was continually painting and writing. He supplemented this unreliable income by teaching art, but his busy professional life did not prevent him from applying his strongly held beliefs to his personal life. Olivier describes his father as a person of courage, perseverance, probity and intellect, as well as an upright family man who was strict with his six children.\n\n==Legacy==\nDelville is still not nearly as well known as some of his contemporaries of the Symbolist era. There are historical reasons for this. For instance, he never exhibited at the main exhibition societies in Brussels during the early part of his career, such as ''Les XX'' and ''La Libre Esth\u00e9tique''. The reputations of many of his contemporaries, like Khnopff, Mellery and Ensor, were largely founded on their participation at these Societies, which promoted heavily their art through organised marketing campaigns, and by establishing a commercial network of dealers and collectors to invest in the art exhibited there. They were also very successful in making their art well known internationally. There was an overt commercial element associated with these societies in the way they created an aura about the art exhibited there as a desirable commodity. Delville shunned the commercialisation of art and the way it was manufactured as an elite commodity. Although he sold works at his own Societies, such as ''Pour l'Art'' and the ''Salons d'Art Id\u00e9aiste'', their purpose was mainly to create a forum for artists working in an idealist vein. Delville was mainly committed to using art as a force to transform society and to improve the lives of those around him. He wrote: 'there will be nothing to prevent art increasingly to become an educative force in society, conscious of its mission. It is time to penetrate society with art, with the ideal and with beauty. Today's society tends to fall increasingly into instinct. It is saturated with materialism, sensualism and ... commercialism'.''<ref>Jean Delville, 'Le Principe Social de l\u2019Art', ''La Belgique Artistique et Litt\u00e9raire'', v. 7, April- June 1907, p. 39. Quoted in Brendan Cole 'Jean Delville and the Belgian avant-garde: Anti-materialist polemics in support of \"un art annonciateur des spiritualit\u00e9s futures\"\u2019, in Rosina Neginsky (ed.), ''Symbolism, Its Origins and Its Consequences'' (Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing), 2010, pp. 135ff.</ref>\n\nDelville believed, rather, that a respiritulaisation of society would be a redeeming path to rescue it from the morbidity of materialism. Elsewhere he wrote: 'Idealism ... has a universalizing educational and social impact ... Idealism sees humanity in terms of the immense vitality of his ideal future. In order for the artist to become aware of this, it is necessary for him to purify and elevate himself. ... The role of modern idealism will be to draw the artistic temperament away from the deadly epidemics of materialism ... and finally to guide him towards the purified regions of an art that is the harbinger of future spirituality.'<ref>Delville, 'L\u2019Esth\u00e9tique Id\u00e9aliste'. (II) ''L\u2019Art Moderne''. No. 21, 21 May 1899, pp. 176\u2013177. See Brendan Cole 'Jean Delville and the Belgian avant-garde: Anti-materialist polemics in support of \"un art annonciateur des spiritualit\u00e9s futures\"\u2019, pp. 135ff.</ref>\n\nDelville remained desperately poor during the early part of his career and his condition was only occasionally relieved by the stipend associated with the Prix de Rome that he won as well as his employment at the Glasgow School of Art, and later the Ecole des beaux-arts. Delville never sold to dealers and only very seldom took on private commissions for portraits (a genre he would have excelled in). Most of his paintings were on a grand scale and he devised these mostly to be exhibited in public spaces, following his ideal of the social role of art. Thus, the poor reputation associated with Delville's art is in part probably related to the lack of any committed exposure and sustained marketing of his work, which was essential in forging the reputations of the early avant garde and afterwards. Delville also came from a working-class background which was a huge disadvantage in the contemporary bourgeois-dominated culture in Belgium. This would certainly have contributed to the erasure of his worth as an artist over time. And finally Delville was fiercely independent in his approach to promoting his ideas and artistic ideals, seldom bending to the will of what was popular or acceptable in conservative bourgeois circles that controlled and dominated the art market during his formative years. Mainstrem critics and peers generally shunned his Art and ideals as a result. Despite his immense talent and vision, Delville remained a 'voice in the wilderness' during this time. This reputation persisted during the course of his life and afterwards as well.<ref>see Cole, ''ibid''.</ref>\n\nAnother great disadvantage related to Delville's reputation relates to the limited exposure of his major works in public museums, and the relative paucity of published material (until recently) concerning Delville's art and career. The Museum of Fine Art in Brussels houses, by far, more works than any public collection, but few of these are on public display. This is also the case in other centres in Belgium (Bruges and Antwerp, for example). Few of his works are to be seen in major museums outside Belgium; with the exception of his ''l'Ecole de Platon'' in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris. Many of his smaller works have long since disappeared or have been destroyed, which leaves conspicuous lacunae in his catalogue of extant works. The loss of major paintings like his ''Cycle passionnel'' and ''La Justice \u00e0 travers les \u00e2ges'', amongst others also diminishes the impact of his known ''oeuvre''. Moreover, a great number of his works are in private collections and their whereabouts still needs to be determined. This all means that access to his works is extremely limited and they remain out of the 'public eye', and hence the collective imagination generally. Reproductions of some of his paintings and drawings are available on the Internet, but usually of poor quality which reduces their impact considerably. Finally, until very recently, there have been no major studies or monographs on the artist's work, which until now has left considerable gaps in our understanding of his life, art and ideas.\n\nDespite this, a resurgence of interest in his work and ideas appears to be taking place, notably with the recent important retrospective exhibition in Namur that brought together many important paintings and drawings, many of which have not been seen before in public since they were first exhibited in the nineteenth century. Several Belgian and English Art Historians, working in collaboration with Delville's heirs and estate, are also taking a renewed interest in Delville's work, revealing detailed aspects of his life and work for the first time through detailed studies and monographs on aspects of Delville's life and art (see 'Sources').\n\n==Selected works of art==\n\n===Prints and drawings===\n* '' L'Agonie de Cachapr\u00e8s'' (1887), charcoal on paper, 33 x 34.5&nbsp;cm.

During the 1970s and 1980s, he was a member of the bands for the television shows ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[Late Night With David Letterman]]''. In the early 1980s Steve Jordan was a member of the [[Steve Khan]] band, along with [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] on bass, and [[Manolo Badrena]] on percussion. Since the middle 1980s, Jordan has been a member of the [[X-Pensive Winos]], the side project of [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Keith Richards]]. Jordan and Richards have been production and songwriting partners on many of Richards's solo works. In 2005, he became a member of the [[John Mayer Trio]].<ref name=\"Drummerworld\">{{cite web|title=Drummerworld: Steve Jordan | url =http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Steve_Jordan.html| website=Drumerworld|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"DL\">{{cite web|title=Steve Jordan Biography {{!}} Famous Drummers|url=http://www.drumlessons.com/drummers/steve-jordan/|website=Drum Lessons|accessdate=March 6, 2017|language=en}}</ref> [https://jazzfoundation.org/our-team/ Jordan is also the current Artistic Director of the Jazz Foundation of America alongside Meegan Voss.]\n\n==Early years==\nJordan attended New York City's [[The High School of Music & Art|High School of Music and Art]], graduating in 1974.\n\nJordan was a teenager when he first played in [[Stevie Wonder]]'s band. Later, he played drums for the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' band in the 1970s. Jordan also played in the New York \"24th Street Band\" which had great success in Japan. When [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] toured as [[The Blues Brothers]] in the late 1970s, Jordan was their drummer, and recorded on their resulting album, credited as Steve \"Getdwa\" Jordan. He did not, however, appear in the movie of the same name. He also played drums for [[Paul Shaffer]]'s [[World's Most Dangerous Band]] on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' from 1982-1986.\n\n== X-Pensive Winos and Chuck Berry ==\n[[File:\u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0420\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0441 \u0414\u0436\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0430\u043d \u041d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Jordan appearing with Richards' X-Pensive Winos.

[[Keith Richards]] then hired Jordan to play on [[Aretha Franklin]]'s [[cover version|cover]] of \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]\" for a [[Jumpin' Jack Flash (film)|film]] of the same name.\n\nAccording to Richards, Jordan pressed Richards on the plane ride home from Aretha's recording session in [[Detroit]] to be included in the upcoming [[documentary film|documentary]] by [[Taylor Hackford]] ''[[Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll]]'', a tribute to [[Chuck Berry]].

As time went on, WRVR was a full-time jazz station with a strong audience following but low ratings.\n\nIn mid-1974 Riverside Church looked to cut its losses and sell WRVR, but with a preferred condition that the station's jazz format be preserved. At the same time, [[classical music]]-formatted WNCN (104.3 FM, now sister station [[WAXQ]]) was in the process of a controversial format change to [[Album oriented rock]], with new call letters WQIV. A group of WNCN audience members formed the non-profit WNCN Listeners Guild and attempted to block the station's then-owner, Starr Broadcasting, from making the format switch. After their efforts failed, the WNCN Listeners Guild partnered with [[GAF Materials Corporation|GAF Corporation]] and briefly entered negotiations with Riverside Church to purchase WRVR and switch its programming to classical.<ref>{{cite web|title=In brief: Another Hitch |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/74-OCR/1974-11-04-BC-OCR-Page-0006.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting |page=6 |date=November 4, 1974 |accessdate=March 3, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=No go on WRVR buy |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/75-OCR/1975-03-03-BC-OCR-Page-0007.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting |page=7 |date=March 3, 1975 |accessdate=March 3, 2019 }}</ref> The rock format on 104.3 FM would last less than a year, as GAF announced it would purchase WQIV in July 1975 and restore 104.3 FM to its former call sign and programming.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1975/1975-08-25-BC.pdf#page=60 \"Classical-music fans win out in New York.\"] ''Broadcasting'', August 25, 1975, pp. 62, 64.

Like the WNCN/WQIV situation, community opposition tried to stop sale of the station. Sonderling ultimately took control of WRVR in October 1976 after over a year of delays.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1976/1976-11-01-BC.pdf#page=55 \"FCC gives green-light to sale of NY stations.\"] ''Broadcasting'', November 1, 1976, pp. 55-56. Accessed March 3, 2019.</ref> The listeners' protests did prevent the proposed change, and WRVR remained a jazz station under Sonderling ownership. At that time it developed the precursor to what would later become known as the \"[[smooth jazz]]\" format.  While it played Jazz music, it was allowed to report to Radio & Records Album Oriented Rock chart in the mid to late 1970s.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1978 [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] announced it was purchasing the Sonderling chain<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1978/1978-03-20-BC.pdf#page=33 \"Viacom, Sonderling propose marriage.\"] ''Broadcasting'', March 20, 1978, pp. 33-34. Accessed April 2, 2019.</ref>, a sale which took a year-and-a-half to become final. When Viacom took over in 1980, the call letters were changed to '''WKHK''' and the station adopted a [[country music]] format known as \"Kick 106.7 FM\". The format change took place in the middle of the night and brought many protests from New York jazz fans, who petitioned the FCC to deny the station's license renewal; ultimately the petition was denied. WKHK would suffer from low ratings, as they were unable to compete with [[WEPN (AM)|WHN]] (1050 AM), which also had a country music format at the time.\n\nOn January 23, 1984, Viacom dropped country music and turned 106.7 into an [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] station\u2013with new call letters '''WLTW''' and on-air branding of \"Lite FM\". Initially they were an [[easy listening]] station without anything that would be classified as \"[[elevator music]]\". At this point, the station played music from such artists as [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[the Carpenters]], [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Andy Williams]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[Simon & Garfunkel]], [[James Taylor]], and [[the Stylistics]]. The station also played softer songs from such artists as [[Elton John]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[the Righteous Brothers]] and [[Billy Joel]]. The station wouldn't play any new music except for new songs by artists that were familiar to listeners of the station. With this format change, ratings did increase from its previously low levels.\n\nBy the late 1980s, WLTW started to play songs from such artists as [[Whitney Houston]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[the Doobie Brothers]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. As other competing New York City stations changed their focus, the station stayed with their soft adult contemporary format, even though they were phasing out songs from artists such as Frank Sinatra, Barry Manilow, and the Carpenters. At this point, the station's ratings were at or near the top compared with other New York City radio stations.\n\n===1990s===\nBy the mid-1990s, with [[WPAT-FM]] adapting a Spanish adult contemporary format, [[WPLJ]] adapting a [[Adult contemporary music#Hot adult contemporary|hot adult contemporary]] format, and [[WWPR-FM|WMXV]] switching to a [[Adult contemporary music#Modern adult contemporary|modern adult contemporary]] format, WLTW segued to a mainstream adult contemporary format with a more uptempo direction than before, and phased out the majority of its soft adult contemporary material.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/20/business/media-business-advertising-wltw-fm-finds-success-with-ever-evolving-definition.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; WLTW-FM finds success with an ever-evolving definition of 'soft' adult contemporary music.|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ugkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22wltw%22+%22soft+ac%22&source=bl&ots=PkehODKMQ5&sig=moaIZOMyNsG17jl73tgVoBscGIw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjw68n549_eAhWZnoMKHVsiCygQ6AEwBXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Office Radio: No Longer Monolithic|date=1996-11-23|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=XCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT64&lpg=PT64&dq=%22wltw%22+%22soft+ac%22&source=bl&ots=X9V8xVT8jM&sig=GPRWDj1k5LAazNMCSwZ48FoKZAs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiD4oiz5t_eAhVC_oMKHaLsAkk4ChDoATAAegQIChAB#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=AC Dominates Arbitrons|date=1986-01-18|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Merger with Clear Channel Communications===\n[[Image:WLTW.png|200px|right|thumb|The station's logo used from 1995 to 2009]]\nChancellor bought WLTW and the rest of Viacom's radio group in 1997.<ref>Rathburn, Elizabeth A. and Donna Petrozzello. \"Hicks's sticks hit 267.\" ''Broadcasting and Cable'', February 24, 1997, pp. 6, 8.

Finally, in 2000, AM/FM merged with Clear Channel Communications, which became [[iHeartMedia]] in 2014. (Of note, Viacom would not be out of the radio business for long, for when they bought [[CBS]], they also bought their radio properties, which were owned by the radio subsidiary [[CBS Radio|Infinity Broadcasting]] - which owned WLTW's future competitor, [[WNEW-FM]].)\n\nWLTW was simulcast nationwide on [[XM Satellite Radio]] from 2001 to the end of 2003, under the channel name \"Lite.\"  WLTW on XM was replaced by [[The Blend (Sirius XM)|The Blend]] on February 2, 2004.  In 2004, all XM music channels went commercial free, and WLTW was replaced with a unique-to-XM channel called [[Sunny (XM)|Sunny]], which had an [[easy listening]] format. Since then, Clear Channel has regained the right to air commercials on their XM music channels. Sunny then began carrying commercials, but was still exclusive to XM. After a few format tweaks, Sunny played soft oldies until it became [[The Pink Channel]].\n\nDuring the [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday]] season ([[Thanksgiving]] through [[Christmas]]), WLTW has played [[Christmas music]] interspersed with its regular playlist.  Only on Christmas Day and a few days leading up to it would the station devote all its airtime to holiday music.  After the [[September 11 attacks]], Christmas music was seen as a comforting \"feel-good\" format for radio listeners.  Already established as a popular station for Christmas music, WLTW began to switch to an all-Christmas format earlier in 2002.  After retaining its leadership in market share, and as part of a national trend, the station continued to make the switch earlier in the following years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/08/nyregion/08carols.html?ei=5088&en=ba1d0e04e68b51a1&ex=1260248400&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=|title=Jingle All the Time|date=December 8, 2004|first=James|last=Barron|newspaper=New York Times|authorlink=James Barron (journalist)}}</ref> By 2004, the all-Christmas format ran from Thanksgiving through Christmas, and in 2005, it began on November 18, the week before Thanksgiving (November 24). By all accounts, the gamble paid off; WLTW captured 7.4% of the New York radio audience during the fall of 2005\u2014the biggest market share in WLTW's history and the highest share for all New York stations since the winter of 1995. On November 18, 2006, for the 2nd year in a row the station switched to all Christmas music on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, becoming the first NYC Station to do so. They did so the same day as [[WALK-FM]], a [[Long Island]]-based station which shares a good portion of their listening audience. At some points during the 2008 holiday season, WLTW would draw as much as a third of all radio listeners in the New York area. \n\nWLTW usually switches to Christmas music on the Friday before Thanksgiving, like it did in recent years.

By 2009, most of the hot AC content was toned down in order for competitor WWFS' (now [[WNEW-FM]]) shift from [[hot AC]] to adult contemporary.  In 2011, WWFS switched panels to the [[hot adult contemporary]] panel from the [[adult contemporary]] panel on [[Nielsen BDS]] and later [[Mediabase]], giving WWFS more format similarity to rival [[WPLJ]] (owned by [[Cumulus Media]]) rather than WLTW or its rimshot rivals ([[WNBM]]/[[WFME-FM|WFAF]], [[WKJY]] or [[WMGQ]], the latter two on 98.3 FM).\n\nFurther cost-cutting efforts by Clear Channel caused the departure of longtime station favorites Al \"Bernie\" Berstein and Valerie Smaldone in early 2008.  It was also announced that Program Director Jim Ryan would exit as of May 2008. Chris Conley took over the Program Director Position. Mr. Conley was a programming consultant with McVay Media and long time programming veteran with years in the Adult Contemporary radio format.  Chris had a very successful tenure at [[WBEB]] B101 FM in Philadelphia. Recently, in addition to his programming duties at WLTW-FM, Mr. Conley has been overseeing programming at sister station [[WKTU]] The Beat Of New York. Ms. Morgan Prue, winner of several Music Director Of The Year Awards,  stayed on as the station's Music Director and Assistant Program Director Upon Ms. Prue's departure, to pursue a program directorship in Canada, Ms. Jillian Kempton was named Assistant Program Director/Music Director. Jill is now the program director of sister station, in Washington DC, [[WASH-FM]] and Ms. Cara Hahn has stepped into the Assistant Program Director role, which she also holds at New York sister station [[WHTZ]].\n\nLite FM has evolved into a more upbeat \"Variety\" station from its earlier \"Soft Rock\" approach with deejays talking over intros, keeping a non stop music flow, and has added a jingle package for the first time in the history of the station. The station uses Reelworld One AC with its own logo. The station is also well known for having somewhat of a lean toward Rhythmic AC compared to most other AC stations owned by Clear Channel, possibly due to the younger-leaning audience in the NY market.\n\nIn May 2011, WLTW returned to [[XM Satellite Radio]], with a full-time simulcast on Channel 13.  However, station owner Clear Channel sold off its ownership stake in [[Sirius XM Radio]] during the second quarter of fiscal year 2013.  As a result of the sale, nine of Clear Channel's eleven XM stations, including the simulcast of WLTW, ceased broadcast over XM Satellite Radio on October 18, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/84485/clear-channel-sells-siriusxm-stake-stations-to-leave-service/|title=Clear Channel Sells SiriusXM Stake; Stations To Leave Service|website=RadioInsight|language=en-US|access-date=March 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA link to 106.7 FM's days as Riverside Church-owned WRVR remains on WLTW in the present day.

As time went on, WRVR was a full-time jazz station with a strong audience following but low ratings.\n\nIn mid-1974 Riverside Church looked to cut its losses and sell WRVR, but with a preferred condition that the station's jazz format be preserved. At the same time, [[classical music]]-formatted WNCN (104.3 FM, now sister station [[WAXQ]]) was in the process of a controversial format change to [[Album oriented rock]], with new call letters WQIV. A group of WNCN audience members formed the non-profit WNCN Listeners Guild and attempted to block the station's then-owner, Starr Broadcasting, from making the format switch. After their efforts failed, the WNCN Listeners Guild partnered with [[GAF Materials Corporation|GAF Corporation]] and briefly entered negotiations with Riverside Church to purchase WRVR and switch its programming to classical.<ref>{{cite web|title=In brief: Another Hitch |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/74-OCR/1974-11-04-BC-OCR-Page-0006.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting |page=6 |date=November 4, 1974 |accessdate=March 3, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=No go on WRVR buy |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/75-OCR/1975-03-03-BC-OCR-Page-0007.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting |page=7 |date=March 3, 1975 |accessdate=March 3, 2019 }}</ref> The rock format on 104.3 FM would last less than a year, as GAF announced it would purchase WQIV in July 1975 and restore 104.3 FM to its former call sign and programming.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1975/1975-08-25-BC.pdf#page=60 \"Classical-music fans win out in New York.\"] ''Broadcasting'', August 25, 1975, pp. 62, 64.

Like the WNCN/WQIV situation, community opposition tried to stop sale of the station. Sonderling ultimately took control of WRVR in October 1976 after over a year of delays.<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1976/1976-11-01-BC.pdf#page=55 \"FCC gives green-light to sale of NY stations.\"] ''Broadcasting'', November 1, 1976, pp. 55-56. Accessed March 3, 2019.</ref> The listeners' protests did prevent the proposed change, and WRVR remained a jazz station under Sonderling ownership. At that time it developed the precursor to what would later become known as the \"[[smooth jazz]]\" format.  While it played Jazz music, it was allowed to report to Radio & Records Album Oriented Rock chart in the mid to late 1970s.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1978 [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] announced it was purchasing the Sonderling chain<ref>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1978/1978-03-20-BC.pdf#page=33 \"Viacom, Sonderling propose marriage.\"] ''Broadcasting'', March 20, 1978, pp. 33-34. Accessed April 2, 2019.</ref>, a sale which took a year-and-a-half to become final. When Viacom took over in 1980, the call letters were changed to '''WKHK''' and the station adopted a [[country music]] format known as \"Kick 106.7 FM\". The format change took place in the middle of the night and brought many protests from New York jazz fans, who petitioned the FCC to deny the station's license renewal; ultimately the petition was denied. WKHK would suffer from low ratings, as they were unable to compete with [[WEPN (AM)|WHN]] (1050 AM), which also had a country music format at the time.\n\nOn January 23, 1984, Viacom dropped country music and turned 106.7 into an [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] station\u2013with new call letters '''WLTW''' and on-air branding of \"Lite FM\". Initially they were an [[easy listening]] station without anything that would be classified as \"[[elevator music]]\". At this point, the station played music from such artists as [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[the Carpenters]], [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Andy Williams]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[Simon & Garfunkel]], [[James Taylor]], and [[the Stylistics]]. The station also played softer songs from such artists as [[Elton John]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[the Righteous Brothers]] and [[Billy Joel]]. The station wouldn't play any new music except for new songs by artists that were familiar to listeners of the station. With this format change, ratings did increase from its previously low levels.\n\nBy the late 1980s, WLTW started to play songs from such artists as [[Whitney Houston]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[the Doobie Brothers]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. As other competing New York City stations changed their focus, the station stayed with their soft adult contemporary format, even though they were phasing out songs from artists such as Frank Sinatra, Barry Manilow, and the Carpenters. At this point, the station's ratings were at or near the top compared with other New York City radio stations.\n\n===1990s===\nBy the mid-1990s, with [[WPAT-FM]] adapting a Spanish adult contemporary format, [[WPLJ]] adapting a [[Adult contemporary music#Hot adult contemporary|hot adult contemporary]] format, and [[WWPR-FM|WMXV]] switching to a [[Adult contemporary music#Modern adult contemporary|modern adult contemporary]] format, WLTW segued to a mainstream adult contemporary format with a more uptempo direction than before, and phased out the majority of its soft adult contemporary material.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/20/business/media-business-advertising-wltw-fm-finds-success-with-ever-evolving-definition.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; WLTW-FM finds success with an ever-evolving definition of 'soft' adult contemporary music.|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ugkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22wltw%22+%22soft+ac%22&source=bl&ots=PkehODKMQ5&sig=moaIZOMyNsG17jl73tgVoBscGIw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjw68n549_eAhWZnoMKHVsiCygQ6AEwBXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Office Radio: No Longer Monolithic|date=1996-11-23|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=XCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT64&lpg=PT64&dq=%22wltw%22+%22soft+ac%22&source=bl&ots=X9V8xVT8jM&sig=GPRWDj1k5LAazNMCSwZ48FoKZAs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiD4oiz5t_eAhVC_oMKHaLsAkk4ChDoATAAegQIChAB#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=AC Dominates Arbitrons|date=1986-01-18|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Merger with Clear Channel Communications===\n[[Image:WLTW.png|200px|right|thumb|The station's logo used from 1995 to 2009]]\nChancellor bought WLTW and the rest of Viacom's radio group in 1997.<ref>Rathburn, Elizabeth A. and Donna Petrozzello. \"Hicks's sticks hit 267.\" ''Broadcasting and Cable'', February 24, 1997, pp. 6, 8.

Finally, in 2000, AM/FM merged with Clear Channel Communications, which became [[iHeartMedia]] in 2014. (Of note, Viacom would not be out of the radio business for long, for when they bought [[CBS]], they also bought their radio properties, which were owned by the radio subsidiary [[CBS Radio|Infinity Broadcasting]] - which owned WLTW's future competitor, [[WNEW-FM]].)\n\nWLTW was simulcast nationwide on [[XM Satellite Radio]] from 2001 to the end of 2003, under the channel name \"Lite.\"  WLTW on XM was replaced by [[The Blend (Sirius XM)|The Blend]] on February 2, 2004.  In 2004, all XM music channels went commercial free, and WLTW was replaced with a unique-to-XM channel called [[Sunny (XM)|Sunny]], which had an [[easy listening]] format. Since then, Clear Channel has regained the right to air commercials on their XM music channels. Sunny then began carrying commercials, but was still exclusive to XM. After a few format tweaks, Sunny played soft oldies until it became [[The Pink Channel]].\n\nDuring the [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday]] season ([[Thanksgiving]] through [[Christmas]]), WLTW has played [[Christmas music]] interspersed with its regular playlist.  Only on Christmas Day and a few days leading up to it would the station devote all its airtime to holiday music.  After the [[September 11 attacks]], Christmas music was seen as a comforting \"feel-good\" format for radio listeners.  Already established as a popular station for Christmas music, WLTW began to switch to an all-Christmas format earlier in 2002.  After retaining its leadership in market share, and as part of a national trend, the station continued to make the switch earlier in the following years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/08/nyregion/08carols.html?ei=5088&en=ba1d0e04e68b51a1&ex=1260248400&partner=rssnyt&pagewanted=print&position=|title=Jingle All the Time|date=December 8, 2004|first=James|last=Barron|newspaper=New York Times|authorlink=James Barron (journalist)}}</ref> By 2004, the all-Christmas format ran from Thanksgiving through Christmas, and in 2005, it began on November 18, the week before Thanksgiving (November 24). By all accounts, the gamble paid off; WLTW captured 7.4% of the New York radio audience during the fall of 2005\u2014the biggest market share in WLTW's history and the highest share for all New York stations since the winter of 1995. On November 18, 2006, for the 2nd year in a row the station switched to all Christmas music on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, becoming the first NYC Station to do so. They did so the same day as [[WALK-FM]], a [[Long Island]]-based station which shares a good portion of their listening audience. At some points during the 2008 holiday season, WLTW would draw as much as a third of all radio listeners in the New York area. \n\nWLTW usually switches to Christmas music on the Friday before Thanksgiving, like it did in recent years. However, this did not occur in 2019, when the station decided to switch to Christmas music on November 15, instead of November 22, which was the Friday before Thanksgiving.\n\n===Since 2006===\nAs part of Clear Channel's nationwide cost-cutting efforts, WLTW fired station veterans Bill Buchner (mornings) and J.J.

By 2009, most of the hot AC content was toned down in order for competitor WWFS' (now [[WNEW-FM]]) shift from [[hot AC]] to adult contemporary.  In 2011, WWFS switched panels to the [[hot adult contemporary]] panel from the [[adult contemporary]] panel on [[Nielsen BDS]] and later [[Mediabase]], giving WWFS more format similarity to rival [[WPLJ]] (owned by [[Cumulus Media]]) rather than WLTW or its rimshot rivals ([[WNBM]]/[[WFME-FM|WFAF]], [[WKJY]] or [[WMGQ]], the latter two on 98.3 FM).\n\nFurther cost-cutting efforts by Clear Channel caused the departure of longtime station favorites Al \"Bernie\" Berstein and Valerie Smaldone in early 2008.  It was also announced that Program Director Jim Ryan would exit as of May 2008. Chris Conley took over the Program Director Position. Mr. Conley was a programming consultant with McVay Media and long time programming veteran with years in the Adult Contemporary radio format.  Chris had a very successful tenure at [[WBEB]] B101 FM in Philadelphia. Recently, in addition to his programming duties at WLTW-FM, Mr. Conley has been overseeing programming at sister station [[WKTU]] The Beat Of New York. Ms. Morgan Prue, winner of several Music Director Of The Year Awards,  stayed on as the station's Music Director and Assistant Program Director Upon Ms. Prue's departure, to pursue a program directorship in Canada, Ms. Jillian Kempton was named Assistant Program Director/Music Director. Jill is now the program director of sister station, in Washington DC, [[WASH-FM]] and Ms. Cara Hahn has stepped into the Assistant Program Director role, which she also holds at New York sister station [[WHTZ]].\n\nLite FM has evolved into a more upbeat \"Variety\" station from its earlier \"Soft Rock\" approach with deejays talking over intros, keeping a non stop music flow, and has added a jingle package for the first time in the history of the station. The station uses Reelworld One AC with its own logo. The station is also well known for having somewhat of a lean toward Rhythmic AC compared to most other AC stations owned by Clear Channel, possibly due to the younger-leaning audience in the NY market.\n\nIn May 2011, WLTW returned to [[XM Satellite Radio]], with a full-time simulcast on Channel 13.  However, station owner Clear Channel sold off its ownership stake in [[Sirius XM Radio]] during the second quarter of fiscal year 2013.  As a result of the sale, nine of Clear Channel's eleven XM stations, including the simulcast of WLTW, ceased broadcast over XM Satellite Radio on October 18, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/84485/clear-channel-sells-siriusxm-stake-stations-to-leave-service/|title=Clear Channel Sells SiriusXM Stake; Stations To Leave Service|website=RadioInsight|language=en-US|access-date=March 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA link to 106.7 FM's days as Riverside Church-owned WRVR remains on WLTW in the present day.
