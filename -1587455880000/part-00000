The patient showed mild symptoms and had been discharged a week earlier with instructions to self-quarantine at home; he was subsequently confirmed to have completely recovered. Between January and March, Nepal took steps to prevent a widespread outbreak of the disease, while preparing for it by procuring essential supplies, equipment and medicine, upgrading health infrastructure, training medical personnel, and spreading public awareness. The second case was confirmed on 23 March 2020 in Kathmandu. {{as of|2020|04|17}}, 28 additional cases have been confirmed, one each in Rautahat and Kanchanpur, two each in Baglung and Chitwan, three each in Parsa and Kathmandu, four in Kailali and 12 in Udayapur district.<!--GETS OUTDATED--> 13 of the cases involved people who had recently returned from abroad, and 15 of them were Indian nationals residing in Nepal; the first case of local transmission was confirmed on 4 April in a 34-year-old woman from Kailali.<!--GETS OUTDATED--> A second complete recovery was confirmed on 18 April, bringing the number of active cases to 28.

Land borders with India as well as China were later completely sealed off, and all international flights suspended. All academic examinations were cancelled, and schools and colleges were closed. Quarantine centres and temporary hospitals are being setup across the country. Laboratory facilities are being upgraded and expanded. Hospitals have been setting up [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] units and [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] beds. The [[SAARC]] countries have pledged to cooperate in controlling the disease in the region. India, the United States and Germany have increased their support to Nepali health sector.\n\nNepal cancelled its international promotional activities related to ''Visit Nepal Year 2020''.

Sighi\u0219oara became one of the most important cities of Transylvania, with artisans from throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]] visiting the settlement. The German artisans and craftsmen dominated the urban economy, as well as building the fortifications protecting it. It is estimated that during the 16th and 17th centuries Sighi\u0219oara had as many as 15 [[guild]]s and 20 [[handicraft]] branches. The [[Baroque]] sculptor Elias Nicolai lived in the city. The [[Wallachia]]n ''[[voivode]]'' [[Vlad Dracul]] (father of [[Vlad III the Impaler|Vlad the Impaler (Dracula)]]), who lived in exile in the town, had coins minted in the city (otherwise coinage was the monopoly of the [[Hungarian kings]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]) and issued the first document listing the city's [[Romanian language|Romanian]] name, ''Sighi\u0219oara''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The Romanian name is first attested in 1435, and derives from the Hungarian ''Segesv\u00e1r'', where ''v\u00e1r'' is \"fort\".<ref name=\"room\"/><ref name=\"talanga\"/>\n[[File:Old picture of Piata Hermann Oberth .jpg|left|thumb|252x252px|Pia\u021ba Hermann Oberth during the 20th century]]\nThe city was the setting for [[George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]]'s election as [[List of Transylvanian rulers|Prince of Transylvania]] and [[King of Hungary]] in 1631. Sighi\u0219oara suffered military occupation, fires, and plagues during the 17th and 18th centuries. An important source for the history of 17th-century Transylvania, for the period of 1606\u20131666, are the records of Georg Kraus, the town's notary.<ref>[http://bookline.hu/product/home!execute.action?id=77551&type=22&_v=Kraus_Georg_Erdelyi_kronika_1608_1666 Erd\u00e9lyi kr\u00f3nika 1608-1666] (in Hungarian)</ref>\n\nThe nearby plain of [[Albe\u0219ti, Mure\u0219|Albe\u0219ti]] was the site of the [[Battle of Segesv\u00e1r]], where the [[Revolution of 1848|revolutionary]] Hungarian army led by [[J\u00f3zef Bem]] was defeated by the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] army led by Luders on 31 July 1849. A monument was constructed in 1852 to the Russian general Skariatin, who died in the battle. The Hungarian poet [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]] is generally believed to have been killed in the battle, and a monument was constructed in his honor at Albe\u0219ti in 1897. After [[World War I]] Sighi\u0219oara passed with Transylvania from [[Austria-Hungary]] to the [[Kingdom of Romania]].\n\n[[Historic Centre of Sighi\u0219oara|Central Sighi\u0219oara]] has preserved in an exemplary way the features of a small [[Middle Ages|medieval]] fortified city.

Each year, a [[Sighi\u0219oara Medieval Festival|Medieval Festival]] takes place in the old citadel in July.\n[[File:sighisoara2.JPG|thumb|right|View from Villa Franka]]\n\nIn Eastern Europe, Sighi\u0219oara is one of the few fortified towns that are still inhabited. The town is made up of two parts. The medieval stronghold was built on top of a hill and is known as the \"Citadel\" (Cetate). The lower town lies in the valley of T\u00e2rnava Mare river.\n\nThe houses inside Sighi\u0219oara Citadel show the main features of a craftsmen's town. However, there are some houses that belonged to the former patriciate, like the Venetian House and the House with Antlers.\n\nIn 2001-2003 the construction of a [[Dracula]] theme park in the 'Breite' nature preserve near Sighi\u0219oara was considered but ultimately rejected, owing to the strong opposition of local civil society groups and national and international media as well as politically influential persons, as the theme park would have detracted from the medieval style of the city and would have destroyed the nature preserve.\n\n==Demographics and name==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1910 |10913\n|1930 |13033\n|1948 |18284\n|1956 |20363\n|1966 |25109\n|1977 |33208\n|1992 |36170\n|2002 |32287\n|2011 |28102\n}}\n\nEthnic groups in 2011:<ref>[http://www.mures.insse.ro/phpfiles/COMUNICAT_DATE_PROVIZORII_RPL_2011_judetul_MURES.pdf 2011 census data]</ref>\n*Romanians (75%)\n*Hungarians (17.6%)\n*Roma (5.3%)\n*Germans (1.5%)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The main Citadel's attractions are certainly the towers.\n\n=== Towers ===\nAccording to ancient military architectures writings, the defence towers had to be a fortification system for the mutual defense, and, at the same time, each tower was supposed to be an independent [[Fortification|fortress]]: a break at the base of a tower did not mean entering into the city, capturing a tower did not have to lead to the conquest of the city. Most of these towers were hollow and equipped with elevators and underground galleries.\n* [[Sighi\u0219oara Clock Tower (Turnul cu Ceas)|Sighi\u0219oara Clock Tower (''Turnul cu Ceas'')]] - the landmark of the city is a 64 m-high tower built in the 13th century.[5] Today it is a museum of history.\n* [[Tinsmith Tower (Turnul Cositorilor)|The Tinsmiths' Tower (''Turnul Cositorarilor)'']]\n* [[Butcher Tower (Turnul M\u0103celarilor)|The Butchers' Tower (''Turnul M\u0103celarilor)'']]  \n* [[The Bootmakers' Tower]] \n* [[The Tailors' Tower (Turnul Croitorilor)|The Tailors' Tower (''Turnul Croitorilor'')]] \n* [[The Furriers' Tower (Turnul Cojocarilor)|The Furriers' Tower (''Turnul Cojocarilor'')]]\n* [[The Ironsmiths' Tower (Turnul Fierarilor)|The Ironsmiths' Tower (''Turnul Fierarilor'')]] \n* [[The Ropemakers' Tower (Turnul Fr\u00e2nghierilor)|The Ropemakers' Tower (''Turnul Fr\u00e2nghierilor'')]]\n* [[The Tanners' Tower (Turnul T\u0103b\u0103carilor)|The Tanners' Tower (''Turnul T\u0103b\u0103carilor'')]] \n* [[The Face Tower]] - tower on the route to T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, out of the citadel, but still worth visiting thanks to its story.\n\n=== Churches ===\n* [[The church on the hill (Biserica din Deal)|The church on the hill (''Biserica din Deal'')]] - is undoubtedly one of the most valuable architectural monuments of the city and has been one of the most representative buildings of the gothic site of Romania. \n* The [[Monastery Church, Sighi\u0219oara|Monastery Church]] (''[[Monastery Church, Sighi\u0219oara|Biserica M\u00e2n\u0103stirii Dominicane]]'') -  is a gothic style architectural monument which is placed in the neighbourhood of the Clock tower and it was built at the beginning of the 13th century. It is the only church without a bell: the reason is basically that the Saxons weren't great spenders and thought that one bell, the one of the Church on the hill, was enough for the whole city.\n* [[The Saint Joseph Roman Catholic church]]\n* [[Leprosy Church (Biserica Lepro\u0219ilor)|Leprosy Church (''Biserica Lepro\u0219ilor'')]]\n* [[Holy Trinity Church, Sighi\u0219oara|The Orthodox Cathedral of Sighi\u0219oara (Catedrala Ortodox\u0103)]]\n\n=== Civil architecture ===\nMost of the 164 houses in the city having at least 300 years old, are considered historical monuments : the City Square, with its rectangular plan, was once inhabited by noble families of the city, though it has undergone to many transformations over time.

Sighi\u0219oara became one of the most important cities of Transylvania, with artisans from throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]] visiting the settlement. The German artisans and craftsmen dominated the urban economy, as well as building the fortifications protecting it. It is estimated that during the 16th and 17th centuries Sighi\u0219oara had as many as 15 [[guild]]s and 20 [[handicraft]] branches. The [[Baroque]] sculptor Elias Nicolai lived in the city. The [[Wallachia]]n ''[[voivode]]'' [[Vlad Dracul]] (father of [[Vlad III the Impaler|Vlad the Impaler (Dracula)]]), who lived in exile in the town, had coins minted in the city (otherwise coinage was the monopoly of the [[Hungarian kings]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]) and issued the first document listing the city's [[Romanian language|Romanian]] name, ''Sighi\u0219oara''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The Romanian name is first attested in 1435, and derives from the Hungarian ''Segesv\u00e1r'', where ''v\u00e1r'' is \"fort\".<ref name=\"room\"/><ref name=\"talanga\"/>\n[[File:Old picture of Piata Hermann Oberth .jpg|left|thumb|252x252px|Pia\u021ba Hermann Oberth during the 20th century]]\nThe city was the setting for [[George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]]'s election as [[List of Transylvanian rulers|Prince of Transylvania]] and [[King of Hungary]] in 1631.

A monument was constructed in 1852 to the Russian general Skariatin, who died in the battle. The Hungarian poet [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]] is generally believed to have been killed in the battle, and a monument was constructed in his honor at Albe\u0219ti in 1897. After [[World War I]] Sighi\u0219oara passed with Transylvania from [[Austria-Hungary]] to the [[Kingdom of Romania]].\n\n[[Historic Centre of Sighi\u0219oara|Central Sighi\u0219oara]] has preserved in an exemplary way the features of a small [[Middle Ages|medieval]] fortified city.

The town is made up of two parts. The medieval stronghold was built on top of a hill and is known as the \"Citadel\" (Cetate). The lower town lies in the valley of T\u00e2rnava Mare river.\n\nThe houses inside Sighi\u0219oara Citadel show the main features of a craftsmen's town. However, there are some houses that belonged to the former patriciate, like the Venetian House and the House with Antlers.\n\nIn 2001-2003 the construction of a [[Dracula]] theme park in the 'Breite' nature preserve near Sighi\u0219oara was considered but ultimately rejected, owing to the strong opposition of local civil society groups and national and international media as well as politically influential persons, as the theme park would have detracted from the medieval style of the city and would have destroyed the nature preserve.\n\n==Demographics and name==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1910 |10913\n|1930 |13033\n|1948 |18284\n|1956 |20363\n|1966 |25109\n|1977 |33208\n|1992 |36170\n|2002 |32287\n|2011 |28102\n}}\n\nEthnic groups in 2011:<ref>[http://www.mures.insse.ro/phpfiles/COMUNICAT_DATE_PROVIZORII_RPL_2011_judetul_MURES.pdf 2011 census data]</ref>\n*Romanians (75%)\n*Hungarians (17.6%)\n*Roma (5.3%)\n*Germans (1.5%)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The main Citadel's attractions are certainly the towers.\n\n=== Towers ===\nAccording to ancient military architectures writings, the defence towers had to be a fortification system for the mutual defense, and, at the same time, each tower was supposed to be an independent [[Fortification|fortress]]: a break at the base of a tower did not mean entering into the city, capturing a tower did not have to lead to the conquest of the city. Most of these towers were hollow and equipped with elevators and underground galleries.\n* [[Sighi\u0219oara Clock Tower (Turnul cu Ceas)|Sighi\u0219oara Clock Tower (''Turnul cu Ceas'')]] - the landmark of the city is a 64 m-high tower built in the 13th century.[5] Today it is a museum of history.\n* [[Tinsmith Tower (Turnul Cositorilor)|The Tinsmiths' Tower (''Turnul Cositorarilor)'']]\n* [[Butcher Tower (Turnul M\u0103celarilor)|The Butchers' Tower (''Turnul M\u0103celarilor)'']]  \n* [[The Bootmakers' Tower]] \n* [[The Tailors' Tower (Turnul Croitorilor)|The Tailors' Tower (''Turnul Croitorilor'')]] \n* [[The Furriers' Tower (Turnul Cojocarilor)|The Furriers' Tower (''Turnul Cojocarilor'')]]\n* [[The Ironsmiths' Tower (Turnul Fierarilor)|The Ironsmiths' Tower (''Turnul Fierarilor'')]] \n* [[The Ropemakers' Tower (Turnul Fr\u00e2nghierilor)|The Ropemakers' Tower (''Turnul Fr\u00e2nghierilor'')]]\n* [[The Tanners' Tower (Turnul T\u0103b\u0103carilor)|The Tanners' Tower (''Turnul T\u0103b\u0103carilor'')]] \n* [[The Face Tower]] - tower on the route to T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, out of the citadel, but still worth visiting thanks to its story.\n\n=== Churches ===\n* [[The church on the hill (Biserica din Deal)|The church on the hill (''Biserica din Deal'')]] - is undoubtedly one of the most valuable architectural monuments of the city and has been one of the most representative buildings of the gothic site of Romania. \n* The [[Monastery Church, Sighi\u0219oara|Monastery Church]] (''[[Monastery Church, Sighi\u0219oara|Biserica M\u00e2n\u0103stirii Dominicane]]'') -  is a gothic style architectural monument which is placed in the neighbourhood of the Clock tower and it was built at the beginning of the 13th century.

In 1949, during his inaugural speech, President [[Harry Truman]] identified the development of undeveloped areas  as a priority for the west:\n\n:\u201cMore than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate, they are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history humanity possesses the knowledge  and the skill to relieve the suffering   from these people ... I believe that we should make available to peace-loving peoples the benefits of our  store of technical knowledge in order to help them  the realize their aspirations for a better life\u2026 What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealing ... Greater production is the key to prosperity and peace. And the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modem scientific and technical knowledge.\"\n\nThere have been several major phases of [[development theory]] since 1945. [[Alexander Gerschenkron]] argued that the less developed the country is at the outset of economic development (relative to others), the more likely certain conditions are to occur. Hence, all countries do not progress similarly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective|last=Gerschenkron|first=Alexander|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}</ref>  From the 1940s to the 1960s the state played a large role in promoting industrialization in developing countries, following the idea of [[modernization theory]]. This period was followed by a brief period of basic needs development focusing on human capital development and redistribution in the 1970s. [[Neoliberalism]] emerged in the 1980s pushing an agenda of free trade and removal of [[import substitution industrialization]] policies.\n\nIn economics, the study of economic development was borne out of an extension to traditional economics that focused entirely on [[Gross national product|national product]], or the aggregate output of goods and services. Economic development was concerned with the expansion of people's [[entitlement]]s and their corresponding capabilities, [[morbidity]], [[nourishment]], [[literacy]], [[education]], and other [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] indicators.<ref>See [[Michael Todaro]] and [[Stephen C.

Hirschman]], a major contributor to [[development economics]], asserted that economic development grew to concentrate on the [[Developing country|poor regions of the world]], primarily in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]] yet on the outpouring of fundamental ideas and models.<ref>Hirschman, A. O. (1981). The Rise and Decline of Development Economics. Essays in Trespassing: Economics to Politics to Beyond. pp. 1\u201324</ref>\n\nIt has also been argued, notably by Asian and European proponents of [[infrastructure-based development]], that systematic, [[term (time)|long-term]] government investments in [[transportation]], [[housing]], [[education]], and [[healthcare]] are necessary to ensure sustainable economic growth in emerging countries.\n\n===Growth and development===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nEconomic growth deals with an increase in the level of output, but economic development is related to an increase in output coupled with improvement in the social and political welfare of people within a country. Therefore, economic development encompasses both growth and [[welfare economics|welfare values]].\n\nDependency theorists argue that poor countries have sometimes experienced [[economic growth]] with little or no economic development initiatives; for instance, in cases where they have functioned mainly as resource-providers to wealthy industrialized countries. There is an opposing argument, however, that growth causes development because some of the increase in income gets spent on [[Human development (economics)|human development]] factors such as education and health.\n\nAccording to Ranis et al., economic growth and development is a two-way relationship. According to them, the first chain consists of economic growth benefiting human development, since economic growth is likely to lead families and individuals to use their heightened incomes to increase expenditures, which in turn furthers human development. At the same time, the increased consumption and spending, health, education, and infrastructure systems grow and contribute to economic growth.\n\nIn addition to increasing private incomes, economic growth also generates additional [[resource]]s that can be used to improve [[social service]]s (such as [[healthcare]], safe [[drinking water]], etc.). By generating additional resources for social services, unequal [[income distribution]] will be mitigated as such social services are distributed equally across each [[community]], thereby benefiting each individual.\nConcisely, the relationship between human development and economic development can be explained in three ways. First, an increase in average income leads to improvement in [[health]] and [[nutrition]] (known as Capability Expansion through Economic Growth). Second, it is believed that social outcomes can only be improved by reducing income [[poverty]] (known as Capability Expansion through Poverty Reduction). Lastly, social outcomes can also be improved with essential services such as [[education]], [[healthcare]], and clean [[drinking water]] (known as Capability Expansion through Social Services).\nJohn Joseph Puthenkalam's research aims at the process of economic growth theories that lead to economic development. After analyzing the existing capitalistic growth-development theoretical apparatus, he introduces the new model which integrates the variables of freedom, democracy, and human rights into the existing models and argue that any future economic growth-development of any nation depends on this emerging model as we witness the third wave of unfolding demand for democracy in the Middle East. He develops the knowledge sector in growth theories with two new concepts of 'micro knowledge' and 'macro knowledge'. Micro knowledge is what an individual learns from school or various existing knowledge and macro knowledge is the core philosophical thinking of a nation that all individuals inherently receive. How to combine both these pieces of knowledge would determine further growth that leads to the economic development of developing nations.\n\nYet others believe that several basic building blocks need to be in place for growth and development to take place.  For instance, some economists believe that a fundamental first step toward development and growth is to address property rights issues, otherwise, only a small part of the economic sector will be able to participate in growth.  That is, without inclusive property rights in the equation, the informal sector will remain outside the mainstream economy, excluded and without the same opportunities for study. \nThe economic development of countries can also be implicated or contributed by the multinational corporations' companies.\n\n==Economic development goals==\nThe development of a country has been associated with different concepts but generally encompasses economic growth through higher productivity,<ref>Simon Kuznets (1966).

For example, health and education improvements have been closely related to economic growth, but the causality with economic development may not be obvious. In any case, it is important to not expect that particular economic development programs be able to fix many problems at once as that would be establishing unsurmountable goals for them that are highly unlikely they can achieve. Any development policy should set limited goals and a gradual approach to avoid falling victim to something Prittchet, Woolcock and Andrews call \u2018premature load bearing\u2019.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMany times the economic development goals of specific countries cannot be reached because they lack the State's capabilities to do so. For example, if a nation has little capacity to carry out basic functions like security and policing or core service delivery it is unlikely that a program that wants to foster a free-trade zone (special economic zones) or distribute vaccinations to vulnerable populations can accomplish their goals. This has been something overlooked by multiple international organizations, aid programs and even participating governments who attempt to carry out \u2018best practices\u2019 from other places in a carbon-copy manner with little success. This isomorphic mimicry \u2013adopting organizational forms that have been successful elsewhere but that only hide institutional dysfunction without solving it on the home country \u2013can contribute to getting countries stuck in \u2018capability traps\u2019 where the country does not advance in its development goals.<ref name=\":0\" /> An example of this can be seen through some of the criticisms of foreign aid and its success rate at helping countries develop.\n\nBeyond the incentive compatibility problems that can happen to foreign aid donations \u2013that foreign aid granting countries continue to give it to countries with little results of economic growth<ref>William Easterly (2003), \u201cCan Foreign Aid Buy Growth?\u201d in ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'' 17(3), pp. 23 \u2013 48.</ref> but with corrupt leaders that are aligned with the granting countries\u2019 geopolitical interests and agenda<ref>Ethan Bueno de Mesquita (2016), ''Political Economy for Public Policy'', Princenton University Press, chapter 11.</ref> \u2013there are problems of fiscal fragility associated to receiving an important amount of government revenues through foreign aid.

In today's global landscape, location is vitally important and becomes a key in [[competitive advantage]].\n\nInternational trade and exchange rates are a key issue in economic development. Currencies are often either under-valued or [[Kemal Kurdas|over-valued]], resulting in trade surpluses or deficits. Furthermore, the growth of globalization has linked economic development with trends on international trade and participation in [[global value chain]]s (GVCs) and international financial markets. The last financial crisis had a huge effect on economies in developing countries. Economist Jayati Ghosh states that it is necessary to make [[financial market]]s in developing countries more resilient by providing a variety of [[financial institution]]s. This could also add to financial security for small-scale producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/globally-harmonised-banking-regulation-does-not-serve-developing-countries-needs|title=Too much of the same|date=January 2013|website=dandc.eu|publisher=D+C Development and Cooperation|author=Jayati Gosh}}</ref>\n\n===Organization===\n{{main|economic development organization}}\nEconomic development has evolved into a professional industry of highly specialized practitioners. The practitioners have two key roles: one is to provide leadership in [[Public policy|policy-making]], and the other is to administer policy, programs, and projects. Economic development practitioners generally work in public offices on the state, regional, or municipal level, or in public\u2013private partnerships organizations that may be partially funded by local, regional, state, or federal tax money. These economic development organizations function as individual entities and in some cases as departments of local governments. Their role is to seek out new economic opportunities and retain their existing business wealth.\n\nThere are numerous other organizations whose primary function is not economic development that work in partnership with economic developers. They include the news media, foundations, utilities, schools, health care providers, faith-based organizations, and colleges, universities, and other education or research institutions.\n\n===International Economic Development Council===\nWith more than 20,000 professional economic developers employed worldwide in this highly specialized industry, the [[International Economic Development Council]] (IEDC) headquartered in Washington, D.C. is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping economic developers do their job more effectively and raising the profile of the profession. With over 4,500 members across the US and internationally, serving exclusively the economic development community, IEDC membership represents the entire range of the profession ranging from regional, state, local, rural, urban, and international economic development organizations, as well as chambers of commerce, technology development agencies, utility companies, educational institutions, consultants and redevelopment authorities. Many individual states also have associations comprising economic development professionals, who work closely with IEDC.\n\n==Development indicators and indices==\nThere are various types of macroeconomic and sociocultural indicators or \"metrics\" used by [[economist]]s and [[geographer]]s to assess the relative economic advancement of a given region or nation. The [[World Bank]]'s \"World Development Indicators\" are compiled annually from officially recognized international sources and include national, regional and global estimates.\n\n===GDP per capita \u2013 growing development population===\nGDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by mid year population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidizes not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.\n\n===Modern transportation===\nEuropean [[development economist]]s have argued that the existence of modern transportation networks- such as [[high-speed rail]] infrastructure constitutes a significant indicator of a country's economic advancement: this perspective is illustrated notably through the [[Basic Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index]] (known as BRTI Index)<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.academia.edu/6494981| work= Revue Analyse Financi\u00e8re| location=Paris | title= Transportation Infrastructure and Country Attractiveness| first= M.

With the struggle to attract and retain business, competition is further intensified by the use of many variations of economic incentives to the potential business such as: tax incentives, investment capital, donated land, utility rate discounts, and many others. IEDC places significant attention on the various activities undertaken by economic development organizations to help them compete and sustain vibrant communities.\n\nAdditionally, the use of community profiling tools and [[database]] templates to measure community assets versus other communities is also an important aspect of economic development. Job creation, economic output, and increase in taxable basis are the most common measurement tools. When considering measurement, too much emphasis has been placed on economic developers for \"not creating jobs\". However, the reality is that economic developers do not typically create jobs, but facilitate the process for existing businesses and [[Startup company|start-ups]] to do so. Therefore, the economic developer must make sure that there are sufficient economic development programs in place to assist the businesses achieve their goals. Those types of programs are usually policy-created and can be local, regional, statewide and national in nature.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Constitutional economics]]\n* [[European Free Trade Association]]\n* [[Factors of production]]\n* [[Financial deepening]]\n* [[Gender and development]]\n* [[Infrastructure]]\n* [[International development]]\n* [[International Monetary Fund]]\n* [[North\u2013South divide]]\n* [[Opportunity management]]\n* [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]\n* [[Private sector development]]\n* [[Socioeconomics]]\n* [[World Bank Group]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite encyclopedia |last=V\u00e2squez |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian V\u00e1squez |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |chapter= Development, Economic |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n76 |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages= 120\u201323|ref= }}\n* {{cite report |last=Rosnick |first=David  |display-authors=etal|title= The Scorecard on Development, 1960\u20132016: China and the Global Economic Rebound |url= http://cepr.net/publications/reports/the-scorecard-on-development-1960-2016-china-and-the-global-economic-rebound |year=2017 |publisher=[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]]|location= Washington, DC |ref= }}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Economic development}}\n\n{{GDP country lists}}\n{{Aspects of capitalism}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economic Development}}\n[[Category:Economic development| ]]\n[[Category:Development economics|*]]\n[[Category:Economic indicators|Development]]\n", "text_old": "{{Economics sidebar}}\n'''Economic and social development''', as a public sector term, is the process by which the economic well-being and [[quality of life]] of a nation, region or local community are improved according to targeted goals and objectives.\n\nThe term has been used frequently in the 20th and 21st centuries, but the concept has existed in the West for centuries. \"[[Modernization]]\", \"[[Westernization]]\", and especially \"[[industrialization]]\" are other terms often used while discussing economic development.\n\nWhereas economic development is a policy intervention endeavor aiming to improve the [[well-being]] of people, [[economic growth]] is a phenomenon of market [[productivity]] and rise in [[GDP]].

In 1949, during his inaugural speech, President [[Harry Truman]] identified the development of undeveloped areas  as a priority for the west:\n\n:\u201cMore than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate, they are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history humanity possesses the knowledge  and the skill to relieve the suffering   from these people ... I believe that we should make available to peace-loving peoples the benefits of our  store of technical knowledge in order to help them  the realize their aspirations for a better life\u2026 What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealing ... Greater production is the key to prosperity and peace. And the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modem scientific and technical knowledge.\"\n\nThere have been several major phases of [[development theory]] since 1945. [[Alexander Gerschenkron]] argued that the less developed the country is at the outset of economic development (relative to others), the more likely certain conditions are to occur. Hence, all countries do not progress similarly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective|last=Gerschenkron|first=Alexander|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}</ref>  From the 1940s to the 1960s the state played a large role in promoting industrialization in developing countries, following the idea of [[modernization theory]]. This period was followed by a brief period of basic needs development focusing on human capital development and redistribution in the 1970s. [[Neoliberalism]] emerged in the 1980s pushing an agenda of free trade and removal of [[import substitution industrialization]] policies.\n\nIn economics, the study of economic development was borne out of an extension to traditional economics that focused entirely on [[Gross national product|national product]], or the aggregate output of goods and services. Economic development was concerned with the expansion of people's [[entitlement]]s and their corresponding capabilities, [[morbidity]], [[nourishment]], [[literacy]], [[education]], and other [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] indicators.<ref>See [[Michael Todaro]] and [[Stephen C.

Hirschman]], a major contributor to [[development economics]], asserted that economic development grew to concentrate on the [[Developing country|poor regions of the world]], primarily in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]] yet on the outpouring of fundamental ideas and models.<ref>Hirschman, A. O. (1981). The Rise and Decline of Development Economics. Essays in Trespassing: Economics to Politics to Beyond. pp. 1\u201324</ref>\n\nIt has also been argued, notably by Asian and European proponents of [[infrastructure-based development]], that systematic, [[term (time)|long-term]] government investments in [[transportation]], [[housing]], [[education]], and [[healthcare]] are necessary to ensure sustainable economic growth in emerging countries.\n\n===Growth and development===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nEconomic growth deals with an increase in the level of output, but economic development is related to an increase in output coupled with improvement in the social and political welfare of people within a country. Therefore, economic development encompasses both growth and [[welfare economics|welfare values]].\n\nDependency theorists argue that poor countries have sometimes experienced [[economic growth]] with little or no economic development initiatives; for instance, in cases where they have functioned mainly as resource-providers to wealthy industrialized countries. There is an opposing argument, however, that growth causes development because some of the increase in income gets spent on [[Human development (economics)|human development]] factors such as education and health.\n\nAccording to Ranis et al., economic growth and development is a two-way relationship. According to them, the first chain consists of economic growth benefiting human development, since economic growth is likely to lead families and individuals to use their heightened incomes to increase expenditures, which in turn furthers human development. At the same time, the increased consumption and spending, health, education, and infrastructure systems grow and contribute to economic growth.\n\nIn addition to increasing private incomes, economic growth also generates additional [[resource]]s that can be used to improve [[social service]]s (such as [[healthcare]], safe [[drinking water]], etc.). By generating additional resources for social services, unequal [[income distribution]] will be mitigated as such social services are distributed equally across each [[community]], thereby benefiting each individual.\nConcisely, the relationship between human development and economic development can be explained in three ways. First, an increase in average income leads to improvement in [[health]] and [[nutrition]] (known as Capability Expansion through Economic Growth). Second, it is believed that social outcomes can only be improved by reducing income [[poverty]] (known as Capability Expansion through Poverty Reduction). Lastly, social outcomes can also be improved with essential services such as [[education]], [[healthcare]], and clean [[drinking water]] (known as Capability Expansion through Social Services).\nJohn Joseph Puthenkalam's research aims at the process of economic growth theories that lead to economic development. After analyzing the existing capitalistic growth-development theoretical apparatus, he introduces the new model which integrates the variables of freedom, democracy, and human rights into the existing models and argue that any future economic growth-development of any nation depends on this emerging model as we witness the third wave of unfolding demand for democracy in the Middle East. He develops the knowledge sector in growth theories with two new concepts of 'micro knowledge' and 'macro knowledge'. Micro knowledge is what an individual learns from school or various existing knowledge and macro knowledge is the core philosophical thinking of a nation that all individuals inherently receive. How to combine both these pieces of knowledge would determine further growth that leads to the economic development of developing nations.\n\nYet others believe that several basic building blocks need to be in place for growth and development to take place.  For instance, some economists believe that a fundamental first step toward development and growth is to address property rights issues, otherwise, only a small part of the economic sector will be able to participate in growth.  That is, without inclusive property rights in the equation, the informal sector will remain outside the mainstream economy, excluded and without the same opportunities for study. \nThe economic development of countries can also be implicated or contributed by the multinational corporations' companies.\n\n==Economic development goals==\nThe development of a country has been associated with different concepts but generally encompasses economic growth through higher productivity,<ref>Simon Kuznets (1966).

For example, health and education improvements have been closely related to economic growth, but the causality with economic development may not be obvious. In any case, it is important to not expect that particular economic development programs be able to fix many problems at once as that would be establishing unsurmountable goals for them that are highly unlikely they can achieve. Any development policy should set limited goals and a gradual approach to avoid falling victim to something Prittchet, Woolcock and Andrews call \u2018premature load bearing\u2019.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMany times the economic development goals of specific countries cannot be reached because they lack the State's capabilities to do so. For example, if a nation has little capacity to carry out basic functions like security and policing or core service delivery it is unlikely that a program that wants to foster a free-trade zone (special economic zones) or distribute vaccinations to vulnerable populations can accomplish their goals. This has been something overlooked by multiple international organizations, aid programs and even participating governments who attempt to carry out \u2018best practices\u2019 from other places in a carbon-copy manner with little success. This isomorphic mimicry \u2013adopting organizational forms that have been successful elsewhere but that only hide institutional dysfunction without solving it on the home country \u2013can contribute to getting countries stuck in \u2018capability traps\u2019 where the country does not advance in its development goals.<ref name=\":0\" /> An example of this can be seen through some of the criticisms of foreign aid and its success rate at helping countries develop.\n\nBeyond the incentive compatibility problems that can happen to foreign aid donations \u2013that foreign aid granting countries continue to give it to countries with little results of economic growth<ref>William Easterly (2003), \u201cCan Foreign Aid Buy Growth?\u201d in ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'' 17(3), pp. 23 \u2013 48.</ref> but with corrupt leaders that are aligned with the granting countries\u2019 geopolitical interests and agenda<ref>Ethan Bueno de Mesquita (2016), ''Political Economy for Public Policy'', Princenton University Press, chapter 11.</ref> \u2013there are problems of fiscal fragility associated to receiving an important amount of government revenues through foreign aid.

In today's global landscape, location is vitally important and becomes a key in [[competitive advantage]].\n\nInternational trade and exchange rates are a key issue in economic development. Currencies are often either under-valued or [[Kemal Kurdas|over-valued]], resulting in trade surpluses or deficits. Furthermore, the growth of globalization has linked economic development with trends on international trade and participation in [[global value chain]]s (GVCs) and international financial markets. The last financial crisis had a huge effect on economies in developing countries. Economist Jayati Ghosh states that it is necessary to make [[financial market]]s in developing countries more resilient by providing a variety of [[financial institution]]s. This could also add to financial security for small-scale producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/globally-harmonised-banking-regulation-does-not-serve-developing-countries-needs|title=Too much of the same|date=January 2013|website=dandc.eu|publisher=D+C Development and Cooperation|author=Jayati Gosh}}</ref>\n\n===Organization===\n{{main|economic development organization}}\nEconomic development has evolved into a professional industry of highly specialized practitioners. The practitioners have two key roles: one is to provide leadership in [[Public policy|policy-making]], and the other is to administer policy, programs, and projects. Economic development practitioners generally work in public offices on the state, regional, or municipal level, or in public\u2013private partnerships organizations that may be partially funded by local, regional, state, or federal tax money. These economic development organizations function as individual entities and in some cases as departments of local governments. Their role is to seek out new economic opportunities and retain their existing business wealth.\n\nThere are numerous other organizations whose primary function is not economic development that work in partnership with economic developers. They include the news media, foundations, utilities, schools, health care providers, faith-based organizations, and colleges, universities, and other education or research institutions.\n\n===International Economic Development Council===\nWith more than 20,000 professional economic developers employed worldwide in this highly specialized industry, the [[International Economic Development Council]] (IEDC) headquartered in Washington, D.C. is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping economic developers do their job more effectively and raising the profile of the profession. With over 4,500 members across the US and internationally, serving exclusively the economic development community, IEDC membership represents the entire range of the profession ranging from regional, state, local, rural, urban, and international economic development organizations, as well as chambers of commerce, technology development agencies, utility companies, educational institutions, consultants and redevelopment authorities. Many individual states also have associations comprising economic development professionals, who work closely with IEDC.\n\n==Development indicators and indices==\nThere are various types of macroeconomic and sociocultural indicators or \"metrics\" used by [[economist]]s and [[geographer]]s to assess the relative economic advancement of a given region or nation. The [[World Bank]]'s \"World Development Indicators\" are compiled annually from officially recognized international sources and include national, regional and global estimates.\n\n===GDP per capita \u2013 growing development population===\nGDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by mid year population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidizes not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.\n\n===Modern transportation===\nEuropean [[development economist]]s have argued that the existence of modern transportation networks- such as [[high-speed rail]] infrastructure constitutes a significant indicator of a country's economic advancement: this perspective is illustrated notably through the [[Basic Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index]] (known as BRTI Index)<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.academia.edu/6494981| work= Revue Analyse Financi\u00e8re| location=Paris | title= Transportation Infrastructure and Country Attractiveness| first= M.

With the struggle to attract and retain business, competition is further intensified by the use of many variations of economic incentives to the potential business such as: tax incentives, investment capital, donated land, utility rate discounts, and many others. IEDC places significant attention on the various activities undertaken by economic development organizations to help them compete and sustain vibrant communities.\n\nAdditionally, the use of community profiling tools and [[database]] templates to measure community assets versus other communities is also an important aspect of economic development. Job creation, economic output, and increase in taxable basis are the most common measurement tools. When considering measurement, too much emphasis has been placed on economic developers for \"not creating jobs\". However, the reality is that economic developers do not typically create jobs, but facilitate the process for existing businesses and [[Startup company|start-ups]] to do so. Therefore, the economic developer must make sure that there are sufficient economic development programs in place to assist the businesses achieve their goals. Those types of programs are usually policy-created and can be local, regional, statewide and national in nature.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Constitutional economics]]\n* [[European Free Trade Association]]\n* [[Factors of production]]\n* [[Financial deepening]]\n* [[Gender and development]]\n* [[Infrastructure]]\n* [[International development]]\n* [[International Monetary Fund]]\n* [[North\u2013South divide]]\n* [[Opportunity management]]\n* [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]\n* [[Private sector development]]\n* [[Socioeconomics]]\n* [[World Bank Group]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite encyclopedia |last=V\u00e2squez |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian V\u00e1squez |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |chapter= Development, Economic |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n76 |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages= 120\u201323|ref= }}\n* {{cite report |last=Rosnick |first=David  |display-authors=etal|title= The Scorecard on Development, 1960\u20132016: China and the Global Economic Rebound |url= http://cepr.net/publications/reports/the-scorecard-on-development-1960-2016-china-and-the-global-economic-rebound |year=2017 |publisher=[[Center for Economic and Policy Research]]|location= Washington, DC |ref= }}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Economic development}}\n\n{{GDP country lists}}\n{{Aspects of capitalism}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economic Development}}\n[[Category:Economic development| ]]\n[[Category:Development economics|*]]\n[[Category:Economic indicators|Development]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c6:3611:fb00:fda8:bc48:1797:ecf2", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development"}

The site enables registered users to submit new material and edits to existing entries. Users with a proven track record of submitting factual data are given instant approval for additions or corrections to cast, credits, and other demographics of media product and personalities. However, image, name, character name, plot summaries, and title changes are supposedly screened before publication, and usually take between 24 and 72 hours to appear.\n\nAll registered users choose their own site name, and most operate anonymously. They have a ''profile page'' which shows how long a registered user has been a member, as well as personal movie ratings (should the user decide to display them) and, since 2015, \"badges\" are added representing how many contributions a particular registered user has submitted. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, bios, etc. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb ''page'', then that user/visitor can add photos to that page by enrolling in IMDbPRO.<ref>{{cite web |title=Submission guide for users |series=Help Center |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=2&file=contact_information&ref_=hlp_sr_1 |website=IMDb}}</ref> There is no single index of contributors, no index on each profile page of the items contributed, and (except for plot synopses and biographies) no identification of contributors to each product's or person's data pages.\n\nUsers are also invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted mean]]-rating that is displayed beside each title, with online filters employed to deter [[ballot-stuffing]].\n\nIn January 2019, IMDb launched a free movie streaming platform called Freedive, an [[ad-supported]] service offering Hollywood movie titles and TV shows.

Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working, but soon retired people were added, so Needham started what was then (but did not remain) a separate \"Dead Actors/Actresses List\". Steve Hammond started collecting and merging character names for both the actors and actresses lists. When these achieved popularity, they were merged back into the lists themselves. The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible.\n\nBy late 1990, the lists included almost 10,000&nbsp;movies and television series correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein. On October 17, 1990, Needham developed and posted a collection of [[Unix]] [[shell script]]s that could be used to search the four lists, and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chmielewski |first=Dawn C. |date=January 19, 2013 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/19/business/la-fi-himi-needham-20130120 |title=Col Needham created IMDb |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> At the time, it was known as the \"rec.arts.movies movie database\".\n\n===On the web===\nThe database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay. Later, in 1993, it moved onto the fledgling [[World Wide Web]] under the name of ''Cardiff Internet Movie Database''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |title=Historical Internet Movie Database Site |publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science & Informatics |access-date=March 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324121844/http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |archivedate=March 24, 2013}}</ref> The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of [[Cardiff University]] in Wales. [[Rob Hartill]] was the original web interface author. In 1994, the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein. Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of [[Web mirror|mirrors]] across the world with donated bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB History |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?history |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n===As an independent company===\nIn 1996 IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom, becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd. founder Col&nbsp;Needham became the primary owner.

They have already been verified when they are added to the main filmography.\n\n==IMDb TV==\nOn January 10, 2019, IMDb launched Freedive, a [[streaming service]] that offers certain films free with [[advertisements]].

Conversely, a credited text entry, such as a plot summary, may be corrected for content, grammar, sentence structure, perceived omission or error, by other contributors without having to add their names as co-authors. Due to the time required for processing submitted data or text before it is displayed, IMDb is different from user-contributed projects like  [[Discogs]], or [[OpenStreetMap]], or [[Wikipedia]], in that contributors cannot add, delete, or modify the data or text on impulse, and the manipulation of data is controlled by IMDb technology and salaried staff.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/interfaces#plain |title=The plain text data files |series=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIMDb has been subject to deliberate additions of false information; in 2012 a spokesperson said: \"We make it easy for users and professionals to update much of our content, which is why we have an 'edit page.'

Since 2007, IMDb has been experimenting with wiki-programmed sections for complete film synopses, parental guides, and FAQs about titles as determined by (and answered by) individual contributors.\n\n===Data format and access===\nIMDb does not provide an [[Web API|API]] for automated queries. However, most of the data can be downloaded as [[data compression|compressed]] plain text files and the information can be extracted using the [[command-line interface]] tools provided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/interfaces |title=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb |access-date=January 15, 2007}}</ref> There is also a Java-based [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files, which allows a search and a display of the information.<ref name=\"jmdb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.de/ |title=Java Movie Database (JMDB) |website=Jmdb.de |access-date=October 27, 2010}}</ref> This GUI application supports different languages, but the movie related data are in English, as made available by IMDb.

The non-English language sites display film titles in the specified language. Originally, IMDb's [[English language]] sites displayed titles according to their original country-of-origin language, however, in 2010 IMDb began allowing individual users in the UK and USA to choose primary title display by either the original-language titles, or the US or UK release title (normally, in English).\n\n==Ancillary features==\n===User ratings of films===\nAs one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a [[rating scale]] that allows users to rate films on a scale of one to ten. It has been alleged that the rating system is flawed, for several reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/imdbs-top-250-discussion/|title=Why IMDb's Top&nbsp;250 matters ... and why it doesn't |publisher=Screenrant.com |date=April 13, 2010 |access-date=February 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIMDb indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways in order to produce a [[weighted mean]] that is displayed for each film, series, and so on. It states that filters are used to avoid [[ballot stuffing]]; the method is not described in detail to avoid attempts to circumvent it. In fact, it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the weighted average and the arithmetic mean.\n\n====Rankings====\nThe IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by the registered users of the website using the methods described. {{As of|2019|10|21}}, ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' is #1 on the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/top |title=Top&nbsp;250 movies as voted by our users |publisher=IMDb |access-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The \"Top&nbsp;250\" rating is based on only the ratings of \"regular voters\". The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret. IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top&nbsp;250 list they \"''deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter''\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=1&file=notintop250 |title=The user votes average on film or show ''X'' is 9.4, so it should appear in your Top&nbsp;250 Movies or TV list, yet it doesn't. Why? |website=IMDb}}</ref> In addition to other weightings, the Top&nbsp;250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in [[actuarial science]] as a ''credibility formula''.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf |title=Encyclopedia of Actuarial Science |last=Norberg |first=Ragnar |doi=10.1002/9780470012505.tac068 |chapter=Credibility Theory |year=2006 |isbn=0470846763|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515175331/http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf|archive-date=May 15, 2004}}</ref> This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information; in this case from eligible users who submit ratings. Although the current formula is not disclosed, IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating:<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB's statement on their voting calculation |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4Ze0vwNLI |website=imdb.com |access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB Vote FAQ |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=February 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<math display=\"block\">W = \\frac{\\ R \\cdot v + C \\cdot m\\ }{v + m} </math>\nwhere:\n*<math>W\\ </math> = weighted rating\n*<math>R\\ </math> = average for the movie as a number from 1 to 10 (mean) = (Rating)\n*<math>v\\ </math> = number of votes for the movie = (votes)\n*<math>m\\ </math> = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 25,000)\n*<math>C\\ </math> = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 7.0)\n\nThe <math>W\\ </math> in this formula is equivalent to a Bayesian posterior mean (''see [[Bayesian statistics]]'').\n\nThe IMDb also has a Bottom&nbsp;100 feature which is assembled through a similar process although only 1500&nbsp;votes must be received to qualify for the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom |title=Bottom&nbsp;100 |publisher=IMDb |access-date=March 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Top&nbsp;250 list comprises a wide range of feature films, including major releases, cult films, independent films, critically acclaimed films, silent films, and non-English-language films. Documentaries, short films and TV&nbsp;episodes are not currently included.\n\nSince 2015, there has been a Top&nbsp;250 list devoted to ranking television shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv/ |title=Top&nbsp;250 TV |website=IMDb |access-date=March 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Message boards===\nBeginning in 2001, the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title (excepting, {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, TV episodes<ref>Each TV episode uses the same message board for the whole series</ref>) and name entry, along with over 140 main boards. In order to post on the message boards a user needed to \"authenticate\" their account via cell phone, credit card, or by having been a recent customer of the parent company [[Amazon.com]]. Message boards expanded in recent years. The Soapbox started in 1999 as a general message board meant for debates on any subjects. The Politics board started in 2007 was a message board to discuss politics, news events, and current affairs, as well as history and economics.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nBy February 20, 2017, all the message boards and their content were permanently removed.

An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].\n\n{{As of|2020|01}}, IMDb has approximately {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum:6,534,894 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million<!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--> titles (including episodes) and {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum: 10,378,806 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million<!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--> personalities in its database,<ref name=\"stats\"/> as well as 83 million registered users.\n\nIMDb began as a movie database on the [[Usenet]] group \"rec.arts.movies\" in 1990 and moved to the web in 1993.\n\n==Features==\nThe movie and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all internet users, but a registration process is necessary to contribute information to the site.\n\nMost data in the database is provided by volunteer contributors. The site enables registered users to submit new material and edits to existing entries. Users with a proven track record of submitting factual data are given instant approval for additions or corrections to cast, credits, and other demographics of media product and personalities. However, image, name, character name, plot summaries, and title changes are supposedly screened before publication, and usually take between 24 and 72 hours to appear.\n\nAll registered users choose their own site name, and most operate anonymously. They have a ''profile page'' which shows how long a registered user has been a member, as well as personal movie ratings (should the user decide to display them) and, since 2015, \"badges\" are added representing how many contributions a particular registered user has submitted. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, bios, etc. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb ''page'', then that user/visitor can add photos to that page by enrolling in IMDbPRO.<ref>{{cite web |title=Submission guide for users |series=Help Center |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=2&file=contact_information&ref_=hlp_sr_1 |website=IMDb}}</ref> There is no single index of contributors, no index on each profile page of the items contributed, and (except for plot synopses and biographies) no identification of contributors to each product's or person's data pages.\n\nUsers are also invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted mean]]-rating that is displayed beside each title, with online filters employed to deter [[ballot-stuffing]].\n\nIn January 2019, IMDb launched a free movie streaming platform called Freedive, an [[ad-supported]] service offering Hollywood movie titles and TV shows.

Others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own. Needham subsequently started an \"Actors List\", while Dave Knight began a \"[[film director|Directors]] List\", and Andy Krieg took over \"THE LIST\" from Hank Driskill, which would later be renamed the \"Actress List\". Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working, but soon retired people were added, so Needham started what was then (but did not remain) a separate \"Dead Actors/Actresses List\". Steve Hammond started collecting and merging character names for both the actors and actresses lists. When these achieved popularity, they were merged back into the lists themselves. The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible.\n\nBy late 1990, the lists included almost 10,000&nbsp;movies and television series correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein. On October 17, 1990, Needham developed and posted a collection of [[Unix]] [[shell script]]s that could be used to search the four lists, and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chmielewski |first=Dawn C. |date=January 19, 2013 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/19/business/la-fi-himi-needham-20130120 |title=Col Needham created IMDb |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> At the time, it was known as the \"rec.arts.movies movie database\".\n\n===On the web===\nThe database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay. Later, in 1993, it moved onto the fledgling [[World Wide Web]] under the name of ''Cardiff Internet Movie Database''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |title=Historical Internet Movie Database Site |publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science & Informatics |access-date=March 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324121844/http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |archivedate=March 24, 2013}}</ref> The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of [[Cardiff University]] in Wales. [[Rob Hartill]] was the original web interface author. In 1994, the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein. Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of [[Web mirror|mirrors]] across the world with donated bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB History |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?history |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n===As an independent company===\nIn 1996 IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom, becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd. founder Col&nbsp;Needham became the primary owner.

The data that is submitted goes through a series of consistency checks before it goes live. Given the sheer volume of the information, occasional mistakes are inevitable, and, when reported, they are promptly fixed. We always welcome corrections.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/james-marsden-likes-barry-manilow-390278 |title=Which A-list star is hacking IMDb pages? |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 14, 2012 |access-date=February 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Java Movie Database (JMDB)<ref name=\"jmdb\" /> is reportedly creating an IMDb_Error.log file that lists all the errors found while processing the IMDb plain text files. A Wiki alternative to IMDb is Open Media Database<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omdb.org |title=Open Media Database |website=omdb.org |access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref> whose content is also contributed by users but licensed under [[Creative Commons license|CC-by]] and the [[GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]]. Since 2007, IMDb has been experimenting with wiki-programmed sections for complete film synopses, parental guides, and FAQs about titles as determined by (and answered by) individual contributors.\n\n===Data format and access===\nIMDb does not provide an [[Web API|API]] for automated queries. However, most of the data can be downloaded as [[data compression|compressed]] plain text files and the information can be extracted using the [[command-line interface]] tools provided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/interfaces |title=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb |access-date=January 15, 2007}}</ref> There is also a Java-based [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files, which allows a search and a display of the information.<ref name=\"jmdb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.de/ |title=Java Movie Database (JMDB) |website=Jmdb.de |access-date=October 27, 2010}}</ref> This GUI application supports different languages, but the movie related data are in English, as made available by IMDb. A [[Python (programming language)|Python]] package called IMDbPY can also be used to process the compressed plain text files into a number of different [[SQL]] databases, enabling easier access to the entire dataset for searching or data mining.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/|title=IMDbPY |website=IMDbPY |access-date=February 14, 2011 |publisher=sourceforge.net}}</ref>\n\n===Film titles===\nThe IMDb has sites in English as well as versions translated completely or in part into other languages ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], French, German, [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Italian, [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], Spanish and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]). The non-English language sites display film titles in the specified language. Originally, IMDb's [[English language]] sites displayed titles according to their original country-of-origin language, however, in 2010 IMDb began allowing individual users in the UK and USA to choose primary title display by either the original-language titles, or the US or UK release title (normally, in English).\n\n==Ancillary features==\n===User ratings of films===\nAs one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a [[rating scale]] that allows users to rate films on a scale of one to ten. It has been alleged that the rating system is flawed, for several reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/imdbs-top-250-discussion/|title=Why IMDb's Top&nbsp;250 matters ... and why it doesn't |publisher=Screenrant.com |date=April 13, 2010 |access-date=February 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIMDb indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways in order to produce a [[weighted mean]] that is displayed for each film, series, and so on. It states that filters are used to avoid [[ballot stuffing]]; the method is not described in detail to avoid attempts to circumvent it. In fact, it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the weighted average and the arithmetic mean.\n\n====Rankings====\nThe IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by the registered users of the website using the methods described. {{As of|2019|10|21}}, ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' is #1 on the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/top |title=Top&nbsp;250 movies as voted by our users |publisher=IMDb |access-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The \"Top&nbsp;250\" rating is based on only the ratings of \"regular voters\". The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret. IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top&nbsp;250 list they \"''deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter''\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=1&file=notintop250 |title=The user votes average on film or show ''X'' is 9.4, so it should appear in your Top&nbsp;250 Movies or TV list, yet it doesn't. Why? |website=IMDb}}</ref> In addition to other weightings, the Top&nbsp;250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in [[actuarial science]] as a ''credibility formula''.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf |title=Encyclopedia of Actuarial Science |last=Norberg |first=Ragnar |doi=10.1002/9780470012505.tac068 |chapter=Credibility Theory |year=2006 |isbn=0470846763|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515175331/http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf|archive-date=May 15, 2004}}</ref> This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information; in this case from eligible users who submit ratings. Although the current formula is not disclosed, IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating:<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB's statement on their voting calculation |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4Ze0vwNLI |website=imdb.com |access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB Vote FAQ |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=February 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<math display=\"block\">W = \\frac{\\ R \\cdot v + C \\cdot m\\ }{v + m} </math>\nwhere:\n*<math>W\\ </math> = weighted rating\n*<math>R\\ </math> = average for the movie as a number from 1 to 10 (mean) = (Rating)\n*<math>v\\ </math> = number of votes for the movie = (votes)\n*<math>m\\ </math> = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 25,000)\n*<math>C\\ </math> = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 7.0)\n\nThe <math>W\\ </math> in this formula is equivalent to a Bayesian posterior mean (''see [[Bayesian statistics]]'').\n\nThe IMDb also has a Bottom&nbsp;100 feature which is assembled through a similar process although only 1500&nbsp;votes must be received to qualify for the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom |title=Bottom&nbsp;100 |publisher=IMDb |access-date=March 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Top&nbsp;250 list comprises a wide range of feature films, including major releases, cult films, independent films, critically acclaimed films, silent films, and non-English-language films. Documentaries, short films and TV&nbsp;episodes are not currently included.\n\nSince 2015, there has been a Top&nbsp;250 list devoted to ranking television shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv/ |title=Top&nbsp;250 TV |website=IMDb |access-date=March 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Message boards===\nBeginning in 2001, the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title (excepting, {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, TV episodes<ref>Each TV episode uses the same message board for the whole series</ref>) and name entry, along with over 140 main boards. In order to post on the message boards a user needed to \"authenticate\" their account via cell phone, credit card, or by having been a recent customer of the parent company [[Amazon.com]]. Message boards expanded in recent years. The Soapbox started in 1999 as a general message board meant for debates on any subjects. The Politics board started in 2007 was a message board to discuss politics, news events, and current affairs, as well as history and economics.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nBy February 20, 2017, all the message boards and their content were permanently removed.

Lawyer with a BA in [[law]] from the [[Federal University of Bahia]] in 1955 and a Doctor of Law from the [[University of Paris]] in 1957, he was a professor at the institution where he graduated. A civil construction and communications entrepreneur, he joined ARENA<ref>National Renovating Alliance</ref> and was elected [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|federal deputy]] in 1966; however, little exercised his mandate for having assumed the Secretariat of Municipal Affairs and Urban Services when his father ruled Bahia (1967\u20131971). Director of the Bank of the State of Bahia in the first government [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Magalh\u00e3es]] was elected federal deputy in 1974 and was chosen vice-governor of the state when Magalh\u00e3es returned to the Palace of Ondina on the Recommendation of President [[Ernesto Geisel]] in 1978.
