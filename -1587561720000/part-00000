The solution is very dark and pipette vigorously to ensure all is dissolved.  [http://orders.frontiersci.com/Orders/WebPlugin/ProdDetail.aspx?cat=B610-9 Biliverdin dimethyl ester] is not soluble in common [[Buffer solution|buffers]], including [[Phosphate-buffered saline|phosphate buffered saline]] (PBS) or [[Hanks' salts|Hank's balanced salt solution]] (HBSS).  Add 1-5 \u03bcM [http://orders.frontiersci.com/Orders/WebPlugin/ProdDetail.aspx?cat=B610-9 biliverdin dimethyl ester] in media or buffer containing 10% [[fetal bovine serum]] (FBS).

[http://orders.frontiersci.com/Orders/WebPlugin/ProdDetail.aspx?cat=B610-9 Biliverdin dimethyl ester] should be used to get maximum fluorescence intensity. Incubate smURFP with [[chromophore]] for as long as possible to increase protein accumulation caused by enhanced [[protein stability]] with [[chromophore]].  Leave [[chromophore]] for a minimum of 3 hours and 24 h is recommended.  Remove [[chromophore]], wash with media containing 10% [[Fetal bovine serum|FBS]], and image in media lacking [[phenol red]] or imaging [[Buffer solution|buffer]].\n\n== smURFP Biosensors ==\n[[File:Birth of a Multi-nucleated Cell.gif|thumb|318x318px|Far Red & Near Infrared FUCCI visualizes the birth of a multinucleated cell, which is common in many cancer cells.]][[File:E. coli expressing smURFP, a fluorescent protein.tif|thumb|788x788px|smURFP (light-blue) expressed in E. coli.]]\n''[[Kinase]] [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] sensor.'' smURFP is a useful acceptor for many red [[Green fluorescent protein|fluorescent proteins]] due to spectral overlap. A rationally designed red fluorescent protein, stagRFP, allows for easier creation of [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] sensors. stagRFP is a useful FRET donor to the far-red acceptor smURFP and an [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]] [[kinase]] [[F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer|FRET]] reporter was created with an average response of ~15%.

Pioneering work by Atsushi Miyawaki and coworkers developed the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator ([http://www.conncoll.edu/ccacad/zimmer/GFP-ww/cooluses19.html FUCCI]), which enables [[fluorescence]] imaging of the cell cycle. Originally, a [[green fluorescent protein]], mAG, was fused to hGem(1/110) and an orange [[fluorescent protein]] (mKO<sub>2</sub>) was fused to hCdt1(30/120). Note, these fusions are fragments that contain a [[Nuclear Localization Signal|nuclear localization signal]] and [[ubiquitination]] sites for [[Protein degradation|degradation]], but are not functional proteins. The [[green fluorescent protein]] is made during the S, G<sub>2</sub>, or M phase and degraded during the G<sub>0</sub> or G<sub>1</sub> phase, while the orange [[fluorescent protein]] is made during the G<sub>0</sub> or G<sub>1</sub> phase and destroyed during the S, G<sub>2</sub>, or M phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sakaue-Sawano|first=Asako|last2=Kurokawa|first2=Hiroshi|last3=Morimura|first3=Toshifumi|last4=Hanyu|first4=Aki|last5=Hama|first5=Hiroshi|last6=Osawa|first6=Hatsuki|last7=Kashiwagi|first7=Saori|last8=Fukami|first8=Kiyoko|last9=Miyata|first9=Takaki|date=2008-02-08|title=Visualizing spatiotemporal dynamics of multicellular cell-cycle progression|journal=Cell|volume=132|issue=3|pages=487\u2013498|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.12.033|issn=1097-4172|pmid=18267078}}</ref> A far-red and near-infrared FUCCI was developed using a [[cyanobacteria]]-derived [[fluorescent protein]] (smURFP) and a [[Phytochrome|bacteriophytochrome]]-derived [[fluorescent protein]] ([http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/nmeth.3935_SV2.html movie found at this link]).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* SmURFP [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KX449134 KX449134] & TDsmURFP, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KX449135 KX449135] - GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ Accession Codes\n* [https://www.fpbase.org/protein/smurfp/ FPbase entry]\n*[https://www.addgene.org/Erik_Rodriguez/ Obtain Plasmid DNA at Addgene] (Non-profit organization for sharing DNA.)\n\n[[Category:Proteins]]\n[[Category:Fluorescent proteins]]\n", "name_user": "Erin Rod", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProperties:Fix grammar.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmURFP"}
