He was the Minister for Education in the [[Frank Walsh|Walsh government]], and was responsible for the overhaul of many of the old policies of the 33-year old [[Liberal and Country League]] [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford government]], reforming South Australian education.\n\nLoveday was born to a jeweller in [[Essex]], [[England]] in 1900. After serving in the Naval Air Service from March 1918 to March 1919, he migrated to South Australia in October 1919 and took employment on William Mills\u2019s property, Millbrae, in the Adelaide Hills. In 1922 he acquired a 15-acre (6 ha) horticultural block at Renmark and became engaged to Mills\u2019s youngest child, Lizzie Hilliary. They married at Chalmers Presbyterian Church, Adelaide, on 27 August 1924. The farm soon proved to be not economically viable, and Loveday had to relocate. He carried out bulk haulage work in the north regions, mainly around [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]]. He was entitled to a soldier settler block and bought land at [[Cungena, South Australia|Cungena]]. On 566 hectares of land, he began to grow wheat. Struggling through the low grain prices caused by [[The Great Depression]], he became President of the South Australian Wheat Growers\u2019 Protection Association and secretary of its Eyre Peninsula branch.\n\nIn February 1936 the Lovedays moved to [[Kernilla, South Australia|Kernilla]], [[Port Lincoln]]. His wife ran the farm while he began labouring jobs in the local area. He served as secretary (1940\u201356) of the local AEU and helped to form a branch of the Australian Labor Party at Whyalla. Active in local politics, he sat on several wartime committees and was a founding member (1945\u201365) of the Whyalla Town Commission. He was an ALP candidate for the Legislative Council Northern electorate in the 1947 and 1950 elections and in a 1949 by-election. When the electoral redistribution of 1955 gave Whyalla its own House of Assembly seat, he secured the Labor nomination and won it at the election next year.\n\nOnce in the House, Loveday was always an advocate for the expansion of education services in [[Whyalla]]. He was also known for his wishes for the broadening of the horizon for children in rural areas. He was a founding member of the movement for BHP to establish a steelworks at Whyalla, which was opened in 1965.\n\nWhen Labor won the [[1965 South Australian state election|1965 election]], Loveday was appointed and sworn as Minister for Education in the [[Frank Walsh|Walsh Government]]. He was the founding member of the bill introduced on 26 January 1966 that established the [[Flinders University]] of South Australia as a separate entity from the [[University of Adelaide]]. He overhauled the grading system for Intermediate and Leaving certificate examinations (1966) and for abolishing the externally examined Intermediate (1968). The divide between the single-sex technical schools and the more academic high schools, a problem which was slowly building and increasing class division under Loveday's predecessor, ended.\n\nLoveday, as a staunch advocate of equality, started a staged process towards pay equity for women teachers, including 'accouchement leave' and other means of reducing discrimination were begun. Loveday approved a pioneering experiment in which Pitjantjatjara children received their first formal schooling in their own language. However, his inept handling in 1966-67 of the (John) Murrie case\u2014involving a Darwin primary-school headmaster who publicly complained about the lack of experienced teachers at his school\u2014angered many in the teaching profession.\n\nAfter Walsh retired and [[Don Dunstan]] took office in June 1967, Loveday was also sworn in as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He was to the left of many in the Labor party and many men of his age on emerging social issues. In 1968 he supported the case for abortion law reform. Loveday retired from parliament at the [[1970 South Australian state election|1970 election]], in which the [[Playmander]] was taken apart and the Labor government again gained office after Dunstan.\n\nLoveday and his family had moved to Glenelg in 1965. When he died in January 1987, Dunstan described him as a man of admirable 'intellect, integrity and forthrightness'.<ref>[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/loveday-ronald-redvers-14351 Loveday, Ronald Redvers (1900\u20131987)]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef | before= [[Baden Pattinson]] }}\n{{s-ttl | title= Minister for Education | years= 1965\u20131968 }}\n{{s-aft | after= [[Joyce Steele]] }}\n{{s-bef | before= [[Don Dunstan]] }}\n{{s-ttl | title= Minister for Aboriginal Affairs | years= 1967\u20131968 }}\n{{s-aft | after= [[Robin Millhouse]] }}\n{{s-par|au-sa}}\n{{s-new|seat}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member for [[Electoral district of Whyalla|Whyalla]]|years=1956\u20131970}}\n{{s-aft | after=[[Max Brown (politician)|Max Brown]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Loveday, Ron}}\n[[Category:1900 births]]\n[[Category:1987 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the South Australian House of Assembly]]\n[[Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of South Australia]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian politicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=January 2016}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| honorific-prefix = [[The Honourable]]\n| honorific-suffix =  \n| image = [[File:Ronald_Loveday.jpg|175px]]\n| office1 = [[Department for Education (South Australia)|Minister of Education]]\n| premier1 = [[Frank Walsh]]<br>[[Don Dunstan]]\n| predecessor1 = [[Baden Pattinson]]\n| successor1 = [[Joyce Steele]]\n| term_start1 = 10 March 1965\n| term_end1 = 16 April 1968\n| office2 = Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Housing\n| predecessor2 = [[Glen Pearson]]\n| successor2 = [[Joyce Steele]]\n| premier2 = [[Don Dunstan]]\n| term_start2 = 1 June 1967\n| term_end2 = 16 April 1968\n| office3 = [[Electoral district of Whyalla|Member for Whyalla]]\n| predecessor3 = ''district created''\n| successor3 = [[Max Brown (politician)|Max Brown]]\n| term_start3 = 3 March 1956\n| term_end3 = 30 May 1970\n| birth_name = Ronald Redvers Loveday\n| birth_date = {{birth date|df=yes|1900|3|10}}\n| birth_place = [[Chelmsford]], [[United Kingdom]]\n| death_date = {{death date and age|df=yes|1987|1|17|1900|3|10}} \n| death_place = [[Glenelg, South Australia]]\n| nationality = \n| spouse = {{marriage|Lizzy Mills|1924|1987|end={{abbr|d.|died}}}}\n| party = [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Labor]]\n| relations = \n| children =\n| residence =\n| alma_mater = \n| occupation = Wheatgrower\n| profession =\n| religion =\n| signature =\n| website = \n| footnotes =\n}}\n'''Ronald Redvers Loveday''' (10 March 1900 \u2013 17 January 1987) was a South Australian politician who represented the [[South Australian House of Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of Whyalla|Whyalla]] from 1956 to 1970 for the [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Labor Party]].<ref>[http://www2.parliament.sa.gov.au/formermembers/Detail.aspx?pid=3669 Ron Loveday: SA Parliament]</ref> He was a wheat-grower and union director prior to joining the Parliament.

When the electoral redistribution of 1955 gave Whyalla its own House of Assembly seat, he secured the Labor nomination and won it at the election next year.\n\nOnce in the House, Loveday was always an advocate for the expansion of education services in [[Whyalla]]. He was also known for his wishes for the broadening of the horizon for children in rural areas. He was a founding member of the movement for BHP to establish a steelworks at Whyalla, which was opened in 1965.\n\nWhen Labor won the [[1965 South Australian state election|1965 election]], Loveday was appointed and sworn as Minister for Education in the [[Frank Walsh|Walsh Government]]. He was the founding member of the bill introduced on 26 January 1966 that established the [[Flinders University]] of South Australia as a separate entity from the [[University of Adelaide]]. He overhauled the grading system for Intermediate and Leaving certificate examinations (1966) and for abolishing the externally examined Intermediate (1968). The divide between the single-sex technical schools and the more academic high schools, a problem which was slowly building and increasing class division under Loveday's predecessor, ended.\n\nLoveday, as a staunch advocate of equality, started a staged process towards pay equity for women teachers, including 'accouchement leave' and other means of reducing discrimination were begun. Loveday approved a pioneering experiment in which Pitjantjatjara children received their first formal schooling in their own language. However, his inept handling in 1966-67 of the (John) Murrie case\u2014involving a Darwin primary-school headmaster who publicly complained about the lack of experienced teachers at his school\u2014angered many in the teaching profession.\n\nAfter Walsh retired and [[Don Dunstan]] took office in June 1967, Loveday was also sworn in as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He was to the left of many in the Labor party and many men of his age on emerging social issues. In 1968 he supported the case for abortion law reform. Loveday retired from parliament at the [[1970 South Australian state election|1970 election]], in which the [[Playmander]] was taken apart and the Labor government again gained office after Dunstan.\n\nLoveday and his family had moved to Glenelg in 1965. When he died in January 1987, Dunstan described him as a man of admirable 'intellect, integrity and forthrightness'.<ref>[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/loveday-ronald-redvers-14351 Loveday, Ronald Redvers (1900\u20131987)]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef | before= [[Baden Pattinson]] }}\n{{s-ttl | title= Minister for Education | years= 1965\u20131968 }}\n{{s-aft | after= [[Joyce Steele]] }}\n{{s-bef | before= [[Don Dunstan]] }}\n{{s-ttl | title= Minister for Aboriginal Affairs | years= 1967\u20131968 }}\n{{s-aft | after= [[Robin Millhouse]] }}\n{{s-par|au-sa}}\n{{s-new|seat}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member for [[Electoral district of Whyalla|Whyalla]]|years=1956\u20131970}}\n{{s-aft | after=[[Max Brown (politician)|Max Brown]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Loveday, Ron}}\n[[Category:1900 births]]\n[[Category:1987 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the South Australian House of Assembly]]\n[[Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of South Australia]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian politicians]]\n\n\n{{Australia-Labor-politician-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Timrollpickering", "label": "safe", "comment": "stub clean up, removed stub tag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Loveday"}

After receiving a degree in [[Medicine]] from the [[Free University of Brussels (1834\u20131969)|Free University of Brussels]] in 1901, he set up a practice in Laeken. On his death-bed in October 1958, he married his long-term companion Louisa Degueldre (1898\u20131985), with whom he had had a son, Jacques, who had been born in [[Ixelles]] in 1932.\n\nThroughout his life, he encountered repeated problems with the accepted spelling of his name. Although his official name was \"Vandemeulebroek\", even many official papers dating to his period as Burgomaster are erroneously spelled \"Van de Meulebroeck\".\n\n==Political career==\nVandemeulebroek became a communal councilor in 1907, and in 1912 became ''[[Alderman|\u00e9chevin]]'' of Public Instruction in Laeken. During [[World War I]], he volunteered as a military doctor and served as part of the 6th Regiment of Artillery. When the commune of Laeken was annexed by the City of Brussels in 1921, he became a communal councilor in Brussels and, from 1930 until 1939, ''\u00e9chevin'' of Public Works. As vice-president of the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|1935 Brussels ''Exposition universelle'']], he continued his work promoting public works, and the ''Grand Palais du Centenaire'' and reordering of the [[Heysel Plateau]] date to this period.\n\nFrom 17 November 1932 to 1936, he served as deputy for the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]] for the region of Brussels. From 28 November 1939, he succeeded the late [[Adolphe Max]] as burgomaster of Brussels.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Allied Victory Parade in Brussels BU9488.jpg|thumb|Joseph Van de Meulebroeck presents colours to the British [[Guards Armoured Division]] at the victory parade in Brussels in 1945]]\nAfter the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation of Belgium]] in 1940, it became clear that Vandemeulebroek's patriotic stance would not be tolerated for long by the Germans. The pretext offered for his removal was an ''Amtsverbot'' order fixing an age limit of 60 on officials in public office; at the time, Vandemeulebroek was aged 65. Ironically, his designated successor, [[Jules Coelst]], was six years older.\n\nEven before his dismissal, however, he was arrested on 30 June 1941 and deported to Germany. He addressed the population in a \"Proclamation\" poster, which stated that \"Contrary to what has been said, I have neither abandoned my post nor submitted my resignation. I am, I remain and I will remain the legitimate burgomaster of Brussels.\" Coelst did not remain in the position long, and on 24 September 1942, the City of Brussels was joined with its largely Flemish-speaking suburbs to form the new region of ''Gro\u00df-Br\u00fcssel'' (\"Greater Brussels\"), in which the ''[[Flamingant]]'' [[Jan Grauls (mayor)|Jan Grauls]] was named burgomaster.\n\n===After the Liberation===\nWhen the city was liberated at the beginning of September 1944, Joseph Vandemeulebroek was reinstated as burgomaster. Returning to his office in the [[Brussels Town Hall|town hall]], he opened the window and symbolically threw his cushion, sullied by the previous occupant, onto the [[Grand Place]]. He later received [[Winston Churchill]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and [[Charles de Gaulle]].\n\nAs a result of his declining health, Joseph Vandemeulebroek submitted his resignation of the position of Burgomaster which was accepted on 13 February 1956. He was succeeded by [[Lucien Cooremans]]. Vandemeulebroek was given the title of Baron by [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]] in 1953.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of mayors of the City of Brussels]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cooremans, Lucien, Le Dr. Joseph Van de Meulebroeck fut cr\u00e9\u00e9 baron en reconnaissance des services exceptionnels rendus au pays et \u00e0 la capitale, in : De 1830 \u00e0 1958.

Ironically, his designated successor, [[Jules Coelst]], was six years older.\n\nEven before his dismissal, however, he was arrested on 30 June 1941 and deported to Germany. He addressed the population in a \"Proclamation\" poster, which stated that \"Contrary to what has been said, I have neither abandoned my post nor submitted my resignation. I am, I remain and I will remain the legitimate burgomaster of Brussels.\" Coelst did not remain in the position long, and on 24 September 1942, the City of Brussels was joined with its largely Flemish-speaking suburbs to form the new region of ''Gro\u00df-Br\u00fcssel'' (\"Greater Brussels\"), in which the ''[[Flamingant]]'' [[Jan Grauls (mayor)|Jan Grauls]] was named burgomaster.\n\n===After the Liberation===\nWhen the city was liberated at the beginning of September 1944, Joseph Vandemeulebroek was reinstated as burgomaster. Returning to his office in the [[Brussels Town Hall|town hall]], he opened the window and symbolically threw his cushion, sullied by the previous occupant, onto the [[Grand Place]]. He later received [[Winston Churchill]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and [[Charles de Gaulle]].\n\nAs a result of his declining health, Joseph Vandemeulebroek submitted his resignation of the position of Burgomaster which was accepted on 13 February 1956. He was succeeded by [[Lucien Cooremans]]. Vandemeulebroek was given the title of Baron by [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]] in 1953.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of mayors of the City of Brussels]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cooremans, Lucien, Le Dr. Joseph Van de Meulebroeck fut cr\u00e9\u00e9 baron en reconnaissance des services exceptionnels rendus au pays et \u00e0 la capitale, in : De 1830 \u00e0 1958.

It is governed under the management of the [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Indian Ministry of Defence]].\n\nThe [[government-owned corporation]] is primarily involved in the operations of the aerospace and is currently involved in the design, fabrication and assembly of [[aircraft]], [[jet engine]]s, [[helicopter]]s and their spare parts. It has several facilities spread across India including [[Bengaluru]], [[Ozar Airport|Nasik]], [[Korwa, Uttar Pradesh|Korwa]], [[Kanpur]], [[Koraput]], [[Lucknow]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Kasaragod]].  The [[Hindustan Marut|HAL HF-24 Marut]] fighter-bomber was the first fighter aircraft made in India.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:HAL Dhruv production line.JPG|thumb|Production line of the [[HAL Dhruv]] at [[Bangalore]]]]\n\nHAL was established as '''Hindustan Aircraft Limited''' in Bangalore on 23 December 1940 by [[Walchand Hirachand]] who became Chairman of the company. The companies office was opened at a bungalow called \"Eventide\" on [[Domlur]] Road.\n\nThe organisation and equipment for the factory at Bangalore was set up by [[William D. Pawley]] of the Intercontinental Aircraft Corporation of New York. Pawley obtained a large number of machine-tools and equipment from the United States.\n\nThe [[Indian Government]] bought a one-third stake in the company and by April 1941 by investing 25 lakhs as it believed this to be a strategic imperative. The decision by the government was primarily motivated to boost British military hardware supplies in Asia to counter the increasing threat posed by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[Second World War]]. The Kingdom of Mysore supplied two directors, Air Marshal [[John Frederick Andrews Higgins|John Higgins]] was resident director. The first aircraft built was a [[Harlow PC-5]]<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1954/1954%20-%202391.PDF \"Hindustan Aircraft Ltd\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510094328/http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1954/1954%20-%202391.PDF |date=10 May 2013 }} ''Flight'' 27 August 1954 p. 296.</ref> On 2 April 1942, the government announced that the company had been nationalised when it had bought out the stakes of Seth Walchand Hirachand and other promoters so that it could act freely. The Mysore Kingdom refused to sell its stake in the company but yielded the management control over to the Indian Government.\n\nIn 1943 the Bangalore factory was handed over to the [[United States Army Air Forces]] but still using Hindustan Aircraft management. The factory expanded rapidly and became the centre for major overhaul and repair of American aircraft and was known as the 84th Air Depot. The first aircraft to be overhauled was a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] followed by every type of aircraft operated in India and Burma. When returned to Indian control two years later the factory had become one of the largest overhaul and repair organisations in the East. In the post war reorganisation the company built railway carriages as an interim activity.\n\n[[File:IJT Prototype in hangar.jpg|thumb|IJT prototype in its hangar]]\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, the management of the company was passed over to the [[Government of India]].\n\nHindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was formed on 1 October 1964 when Hindustan Aircraft Limited joined the consortium formed in June by the IAF Aircraft Manufacturing Depot, Kanpur (at the time manufacturing HS748 under licence) and the group recently set up to manufacture MiG-21 under licence, with its new factories planned in Koraput, Nasik and Hyderabad.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%202305.html HAL Preserved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309050659/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%202305.html |date=9 March 2012 }} ''Flight International'' 1964</ref> Though HAL was not used actively for developing newer models of fighter jets, except for the [[HF-24 Marut]], the company has played a crucial role in modernisation of the [[Indian Air Force]]. In 1957 company started manufacturing [[Bristol Siddeley Orpheus]] jet engines under licence at new factory located in Bangalore.\n\nDuring the 1980s, HAL's operations saw a rapid increase which resulted in the development of new indigenous aircraft such as the [[HAL Tejas]] and [[HAL Dhruv]]. HAL also developed an advanced version of the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]], known as MiG-21 ''Bison'', which increased its life-span by more than 20 years. HAL has also obtained several multimillion-dollar contracts from leading international aerospace firms such as [[Airbus]], [[Boeing]] and [[Honeywell]] to manufacture aircraft spare parts and engines.\n\nBy 2012, HAL was reportedly bogged down in the details of production and has been slipping on its schedules.<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/article2957917.ece \"HAL slipping up on deliveries as it handles too many projects.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307001016/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/article2957917.ece |date=7 March 2012 }} ''The Hindu Business Line'', 3 March 2012.</ref> On 1 April 2015, HAL reconstituted its Board with Mr. TS Raju as CMD, Mr. S Subrahmanyan as Director (Operations), Mr. VM Chamola as Director (HR), CA Ramana Rao as Director (Finance) and Mr. D K Venkatesh as Director (Engineering & R&D). There are two Govt. nominees in the Board and six independent Directors.\n\nIn March 2017, HAL Chairman and Managing Director T Suvarna Raju announced that the company had finalised plans for an indigenisation drive. The company plans to produce nearly 1,000 military helicopters, including Kamov 226, LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) ALH (Advanced Light Helicopter), and over 100 planes over the next 10 years. HAL will manufacture the Kamov 226T helicopter under a joint venture agreement with Russian defence manufacturers. The Kamov 226T will replace the country's fleet of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. Over the next 5 years, HAL will carry out major upgrade of almost the entire fighter fleet of Indian Air Force including Su-30MKI, Jaguars, Mirage and Hawk jets to make them \"more lethal\". The company will also deliver 123 Tejas Light Combat Aircraft to the IAF from 2018\u201319, at a rate of 16 jets per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Narendra Modi powers-up HAL's indigenisation drive, India's military may get 100 planes, 1,000 helicopters soon|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/narendra-modi-powers-up-hals-indigenisation-drive-indias-military-may-get-100-planes-1000-helicopters-soon/603118/|website=The Financial Express|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=26 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327165630/http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/narendra-modi-powers-up-hals-indigenisation-drive-indias-military-may-get-100-planes-1000-helicopters-soon/603118/|archivedate=27 March 2017}}</ref> [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter|LCH]] production will now take place in a newly built Light Combat Helicopter Production Hangar at Helicopter Division in HAL Complex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-inaugurates-hals-lch-production-hangar|title=Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurates HAL\u2019s LCH production Hangar at Bengaluru|last=World|first=Republic|website=Republic World|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\nIn view of [[Make in India]] policy and to increase the share of defence exports to achieve the target of $5 billion dollars by 2025, HAL is planning to setup logistic bases in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Vietnam]] with priority target for [[Southeast Asia]], [[Western Asia|West Asia]] and [[North Africa]]n markets.

It is governed under the management of the [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Indian Ministry of Defence]].\n\nThe [[government-owned corporation]] is primarily involved in the operations of the aerospace and is currently involved in the design, fabrication and assembly of [[aircraft]], [[jet engine]]s, [[helicopter]]s and their spare parts. It has several facilities spread across India including [[Bengaluru]], [[Ozar Airport|Nasik]], [[Korwa, Uttar Pradesh|Korwa]], [[Kanpur]], [[Koraput]], [[Lucknow]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Kasaragod]].  The [[Hindustan Marut|HAL HF-24 Marut]] fighter-bomber was the first fighter aircraft made in India.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:HAL Dhruv production line.JPG|thumb|Production line of the [[HAL Dhruv]] at [[Bangalore]]]]\n\nHAL was established as '''Hindustan Aircraft Limited''' in Bangalore on 23 December 1940 by [[Walchand Hirachand]] who became Chairman of the company. The companies office was opened at a bungalow called \"Eventide\" on [[Domlur]] Road.\n\nThe organisation and equipment for the factory at Bangalore was set up by [[William D. Pawley]] of the Intercontinental Aircraft Corporation of New York, who had already established [[Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company]] (CAMCO) in partnership with Chinese Nationalist government. Pawley obtained a large number of machine-tools and equipment from the United States.\n\nThe [[Indian Government]] bought a one-third stake in the company and by April 1941 by investing 25 lakhs as it believed this to be a strategic imperative. The decision by the government was primarily motivated to boost British military hardware supplies in Asia to counter the increasing threat posed by [[Imperial Japan]] during [[Second World War]]. The Kingdom of Mysore supplied two directors, Air Marshal [[John Frederick Andrews Higgins|John Higgins]] was resident director. The first aircraft built was a [[Harlow PC-5]]<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1954/1954%20-%202391.PDF \"Hindustan Aircraft Ltd\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510094328/http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1954/1954%20-%202391.PDF |date=10 May 2013 }} ''Flight'' 27 August 1954 p. 296.</ref> On 2 April 1942, the government announced that the company had been nationalised when it had bought out the stakes of Seth Walchand Hirachand and other promoters so that it could act freely. The Mysore Kingdom refused to sell its stake in the company but yielded the management control over to the Indian Government.\n\nIn 1943 the Bangalore factory was handed over to the [[United States Army Air Forces]] but still using Hindustan Aircraft management. The factory expanded rapidly and became the centre for major overhaul and repair of American aircraft and was known as the 84th Air Depot. The first aircraft to be overhauled was a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] followed by every type of aircraft operated in India and Burma. When returned to Indian control two years later the factory had become one of the largest overhaul and repair organisations in the East. In the post war reorganisation the company built railway carriages as an interim activity.\n\n[[File:IJT Prototype in hangar.jpg|thumb|IJT prototype in its hangar]]\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, the management of the company was passed over to the [[Government of India]].\n\nHindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was formed on 1 October 1964 when Hindustan Aircraft Limited joined the consortium formed in June by the IAF Aircraft Manufacturing Depot, Kanpur (at the time manufacturing HS748 under licence) and the group recently set up to manufacture MiG-21 under licence, with its new factories planned in Koraput, Nasik and Hyderabad.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%202305.html HAL Preserved] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309050659/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%202305.html |date=9 March 2012 }} ''Flight International'' 1964</ref> Though HAL was not used actively for developing newer models of fighter jets, except for the [[HF-24 Marut]], the company has played a crucial role in modernisation of the [[Indian Air Force]]. In 1957 company started manufacturing [[Bristol Siddeley Orpheus]] jet engines under licence at new factory located in Bangalore.\n\nDuring the 1980s, HAL's operations saw a rapid increase which resulted in the development of new indigenous aircraft such as the [[HAL Tejas]] and [[HAL Dhruv]]. HAL also developed an advanced version of the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]], known as MiG-21 ''Bison'', which increased its life-span by more than 20 years. HAL has also obtained several multimillion-dollar contracts from leading international aerospace firms such as [[Airbus]], [[Boeing]] and [[Honeywell]] to manufacture aircraft spare parts and engines.\n\nBy 2012, HAL was reportedly bogged down in the details of production and has been slipping on its schedules.<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/article2957917.ece \"HAL slipping up on deliveries as it handles too many projects.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307001016/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/article2957917.ece |date=7 March 2012 }} ''The Hindu Business Line'', 3 March 2012.</ref> On 1 April 2015, HAL reconstituted its Board with Mr. TS Raju as CMD, Mr. S Subrahmanyan as Director (Operations), Mr. VM Chamola as Director (HR), CA Ramana Rao as Director (Finance) and Mr. D K Venkatesh as Director (Engineering & R&D). There are two Govt. nominees in the Board and six independent Directors.\n\nIn March 2017, HAL Chairman and Managing Director T Suvarna Raju announced that the company had finalised plans for an indigenisation drive. The company plans to produce nearly 1,000 military helicopters, including Kamov 226, LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) ALH (Advanced Light Helicopter), and over 100 planes over the next 10 years. HAL will manufacture the Kamov 226T helicopter under a joint venture agreement with Russian defence manufacturers. The Kamov 226T will replace the country's fleet of Cheetah and Chetak helicopters. Over the next 5 years, HAL will carry out major upgrade of almost the entire fighter fleet of Indian Air Force including Su-30MKI, Jaguars, Mirage and Hawk jets to make them \"more lethal\". The company will also deliver 123 Tejas Light Combat Aircraft to the IAF from 2018\u201319, at a rate of 16 jets per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Narendra Modi powers-up HAL's indigenisation drive, India's military may get 100 planes, 1,000 helicopters soon|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/narendra-modi-powers-up-hals-indigenisation-drive-indias-military-may-get-100-planes-1000-helicopters-soon/603118/|website=The Financial Express|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=26 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327165630/http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/narendra-modi-powers-up-hals-indigenisation-drive-indias-military-may-get-100-planes-1000-helicopters-soon/603118/|archivedate=27 March 2017}}</ref> [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter|LCH]] production will now take place in a newly built Light Combat Helicopter Production Hangar at Helicopter Division in HAL Complex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-inaugurates-hals-lch-production-hangar|title=Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurates HAL\u2019s LCH production Hangar at Bengaluru|last=World|first=Republic|website=Republic World|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\nIn view of [[Make in India]] policy and to increase the share of defence exports to achieve the target of $5 billion dollars by 2025, HAL is planning to setup logistic bases in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Vietnam]] with priority target for [[Southeast Asia]], [[Western Asia|West Asia]] and [[North Africa]]n markets.
