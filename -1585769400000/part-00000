It was opened on 2 March 1919, and its first rector was D.P Bogolepov \u2013 the [[Moscow State University]] graduate, the Deputy People\u2019s Finance Commissar of RSFSR. In September 1946, the Institute was consolidated with ''Moscow Credit-Economic Institute'' training students since 1931.

It was opened on 2 March 1919, and its first rector was D.P Bogolepov \u2013 the [[Moscow State University]] graduate, the Deputy People\u2019s Finance Commissar of RSFSR. In September 1946, the Institute was consolidated with ''Moscow Credit-Economic Institute'' training students since 1931.

By 1906 the population had grown to 140,000, a phenomenon of rapid growth that was to be repeated in the 1920s in neighbouring areas such as [[Harrow, London|Harrow]]. The Metropolitan line service was withdrawn in 1940, when the station was served by the Bakerloo line,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} and later the [[Jubilee line]].\n\nThe [[First World War]] caused Willesden to change from a predominantly [[middle class]] suburb to a [[working class]] part of London. After the war, Willesden grew rapidly as many factories opened up with numerous flats and terraced houses. The local council encouraged building to prevent large unemployment and decline.\nTo the present day, Willesden has been shaped by the patterns of migration which marks it out as one of the most diverse areas in the [[United Kingdom]].

In 1923, the specialist coach builder [[Freestone and Webb]] established their base in Willesden, producing bespoke cars on [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and Bentley chassis until 1956.\n\nWillesden became a municipal borough in 1933, and it is at this time that the area became predominantly working class. A small [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] community had formed in Willesden by this time, which grew rapidly during the period of the [[Second World War]]. A small Jewish community of refugees from Europe also formed during the war, with 3.5% of the population in 1951 born in [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or [[Austria]].\nDuring the war, Willesden suffered large bombing damage due to the heavy concentration of manufacturing industry, such as munition factories, the location of 'Smiths Instruments\" (Used defensive aircraft instrumentation). Mulliner-Park Ward (Coach builders to Rolls Royce and Bentley, hand built cars).

The whole of central Willesden (bar the area by the Willesden Green station) was earmarked for redevelopment; however, this did not come to fruition.

By 1906 the population had grown to 140,000, a phenomenon of rapid growth that was to be repeated in the 1920s in neighbouring areas such as [[Harrow, London|Harrow]]. The Metropolitan line service was withdrawn in 1940, when the station was served by the Bakerloo line,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} and later the [[Jubilee line]].\n\nThe [[First World War]] caused Willesden to change from a predominantly [[middle class]] suburb to a [[working class]] part of London. After the war, Willesden grew rapidly as many factories opened up with numerous flats and terraced houses.

A small [[Irish diaspora|Irish]] community had formed in Willesden by this time, which grew rapidly during the period of the [[Second World War]]. A small Jewish community of refugees from Europe also formed during the war, with 3.5% of the population in 1951 born in [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] or [[Austria]].\nDuring the war, Willesden suffered large bombing damage due to the heavy concentration of manufacturing industry, such as munition factories, the location of 'Smiths Instruments\" (Used defensive aircraft instrumentation). Mulliner-Park Ward (Coach builders to Rolls Royce and Bentley, hand built cars).

Several dance notation systems have been invented, many of which are designed to document specific types of dance. A ''dance score'' is recorded dance notation that describes a particular dance.\n\n==Usage==\n\nThe primary uses of dance notation are historical dance preservation through documentation, and analysis (e.g., in [[ethnochoreology]]) or reconstruction of [[Choreography (dance)|choreography]], dance forms, and technical exercises. Also, dance notation allows a dance work to be documented and therefore potentially copyrighted. \n\nTwo popular dance notation systems used in [[Western culture]] are [[Labanotation]] (also known as Kinetography Laban) and [[Benesh Movement Notation]]. Others include [[Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation]] and DanceWriting.\n\nMany dance notation systems are designed for a specific type of dance. Examples of such systems include Shorthand Dance Notation for dances from [[Israel]], Morris Dance Notation for [[Morris dance]], and [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]] for [[Baroque dance]]. As a result, these systems usually cannot effectively describe other types of dance.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dancewriting 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Valerie Sutton]] in a dance pose and its corresponding \"Sutton DanceWriting\" notation.]]\nIn the 1680s, [[Pierre Beauchamp]] invented a dance notation system for Baroque dance. His system, known as [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]], was published in 1700 by [[Raoul-Auger Feuillet]] and used to record dances throughout the eighteenth century.\n\nA well-known collection of dance scores is the [[Sergeyev Collection]], recorded using [[Vladimir Ivanovich Stepanov]]'s notation method (1892). This collection documents the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]]'s (today the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet) repertoire from the turn of the 20th century, including [[Marius Petipa]]'s original choreographic designs for ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Giselle]]'', ''[[Le Corsaire]]'', and ''[[Swan Lake]]'', as well as ''[[Copp\u00e9lia]]'' and the original version of ''[[The Nutcracker]]''. It was with this collection that many of these works were first staged outside Russia.\n\nIn 1934, the composer [[Joseph Schillinger]] created a highly accurate notation system based on the 3D bone rotation and translation of a moving dancer.<ref>{{Cite web title=A Modern Instantiation of Schillinger's Dance Notation | url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07494467.2011.636204 | access-date=5 August 2019</ref> Unfortunately, with [[motion capture]] technology half a century in the future, there was no way to effectively measure and record this information at the time.\n\nIn 1948, [[Hanya Holm]] became the first Broadway choreographer to have her dance scores copyrighted, for her work on ''[[Kiss Me, Kate|Kiss Me Kate]]''.\n\nIn 1951, Stanley D. Kahn published [[Kahnotation]], a dance notation system specific to [[tap dance]].\n\nAfter having studied [[Korean dance]] in the 1970s, [[North Korea]]n choreographer [[U Chang-sop]] developed a system of dance notation called the [[Chamo System of Dance Notation]]. It uses pictorially based symbols.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dance notation |last=Guest |first=Ann Hutchinson |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc. |date=2 October 2016 |access-date=14 May 2019 |url= https://www.britannica.com/art/dance-notation }}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, [[Ann Hutchinson Guest]] reconstructed choreographer [[Arthur Saint-L\u00e9on]]'s ''Pas de Six'' from his 1844 ballet ''[[La Vivandi\u00e8re]]'', along with its original music by composer [[Cesare Pugni]], for the [[Joffrey Ballet]]. The piece was reconstructed from Saint-L\u00e9on's work, which was documented using his own method of dance notation, known as ''La St\u00e9nochor\u00e9graphie''.\n\nIn 1982, the first computerized notation system\u2014the ''DOM'' dance notation system\u2014was created by [[Eddie Dombrower]] for the [[Apple II]] [[personal computer]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Dance Notation Journal|year=1986|issue=Fall|pages=47\u201348}}</ref> The system displayed an animated figure on the screen that performed dance moves specified by the choreographer.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Action stroke dance notation]]\n*[[Motif description]], a subset of Labanotation\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Cage, J. and Knowles, A.

Several dance notation systems have been invented, many of which are designed to document specific types of dance. A ''dance score'' is recorded dance notation that describes a particular dance.\n\n==Usage==\n\nThe primary uses of dance notation are historical dance preservation through documentation, and analysis (e.g., in [[ethnochoreology]]) or reconstruction of [[Choreography (dance)|choreography]], dance forms, and technical exercises. Also, dance notation allows a dance work to be documented and therefore potentially copyrighted. \n\nTwo popular dance notation systems used in [[Western culture]] are [[Labanotation]] (also known as Kinetography Laban) and [[Benesh Movement Notation]]. Others include [[Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation]] and DanceWriting.\n\nMany dance notation systems are designed for a specific type of dance. Examples of such systems include Shorthand Dance Notation for dances from [[Israel]], Morris Dance Notation for [[Morris dance]], and [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]] for [[Baroque dance]]. As a result, these systems usually cannot effectively describe other types of dance.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dancewriting 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Valerie Sutton]] in a dance pose and its corresponding \"Sutton DanceWriting\" notation.]]\nIn the 1680s, [[Pierre Beauchamp]] invented a dance notation system for Baroque dance. His system, known as [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]], was published in 1700 by [[Raoul-Auger Feuillet]] and used to record dances throughout the eighteenth century.\n\nA well-known collection of dance scores is the [[Sergeyev Collection]], recorded using [[Vladimir Ivanovich Stepanov]]'s notation method (1892). This collection documents the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]]'s (today the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet) repertoire from the turn of the 20th century, including [[Marius Petipa]]'s original choreographic designs for ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Giselle]]'', ''[[Le Corsaire]]'', and ''[[Swan Lake]]'', as well as ''[[Copp\u00e9lia]]'' and the original version of ''[[The Nutcracker]]''. It was with this collection that many of these works were first staged outside Russia.\n\nIn 1934, the composer [[Joseph Schillinger]] created a highly accurate notation system based on the 3D bone rotation and translation of a moving dancer.<ref>{{Cite web title=A Modern Instantiation of Schillinger's Dance Notation | url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07494467.2011.636204 | access-date=5 August 2019</ref> Unfortunately, with [[motion capture]] technology half a century in the future, there was no way to effectively measure and record this information at the time.\n\nIn 1948, [[Hanya Holm]] became the first Broadway choreographer to have her dance scores copyrighted, for her work on ''[[Kiss Me, Kate|Kiss Me Kate]]''.\n\nIn 1951, Stanley D. Kahn published [[Kahnotation]], a dance notation system specific to [[tap dance]].\n\nAfter having studied [[Korean dance]] in the 1970s, [[North Korea]]n choreographer [[U Chang-sop]] developed a system of dance notation called the [[Chamo System of Dance Notation]]. It uses pictorially based symbols.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dance notation |last=Guest |first=Ann Hutchinson |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc. |date=2 October 2016 |access-date=14 May 2019 |url= https://www.britannica.com/art/dance-notation }}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, [[Ann Hutchinson Guest]] reconstructed choreographer [[Arthur Saint-L\u00e9on]]'s ''Pas de Six'' from his 1844 ballet ''[[La Vivandi\u00e8re]]'', along with its original music by composer [[Cesare Pugni]], for the [[Joffrey Ballet]]. The piece was reconstructed from Saint-L\u00e9on's work, which was documented using his own method of dance notation, known as ''La St\u00e9nochor\u00e9graphie''.\n\nIn 1982, the first computerized notation system\u2014the ''DOM'' dance notation system\u2014was created by [[Eddie Dombrower]] for the [[Apple II]] [[personal computer]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Dance Notation Journal|year=1986|issue=Fall|pages=47\u201348}}</ref> The system displayed an animated figure on the screen that performed dance moves specified by the choreographer.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Action stroke dance notation]]\n*[[Motif description]], a subset of Labanotation\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Cage, J. and Knowles, A.

Electing to remain there for two years following his graduation, he became an assistant teacher of civil engineering and mathematics. In 1851, he sought and received admission to the [[University of Pennsylvania Medical School]]. After graduating from Penn a year ahead of schedule, he then signed on as ship's surgeon for the [[Second Grinnell Expedition]] of 1853\u20131855. Led by [[Elisha Kane]], the project's members left New York harbor in June 1853 in search of [[Franklin's lost expedition]].<ref>Drabelle, \"Pointing the Way to the Pole.\"</ref> \n\nWhile still engaged with Kane's expedition, Hayes and another team member succeeded in making a round trip exploration of the east coast of [[Ellesmere Island]] north of the [[79th parallel north|79th parallel]] (79\u00b0 north).

When Kane announced his plans to extend the expedition for a second winter even though the group's food and fuel were severely depleted, Hayes and seven other team members opted to head south for what they thought would be safety. Instead, they ran out of food and began to eat the only available food source \u2014 [[lichen]] \u2014 until forced to return to Kane's main group, where Hayes then underwent the amputation of three of his frostbitten toes before Kane ordered the group to head to Greenland via sledge and boat. After reaching New York in October 1855 and recuperating from the ordeal, Hayes then embarked on a lecture tour, speaking before audiences at the [[American Geographical Society]] and [[Smithsonian Institution]]<ref>Drabelle, \"Pointing the Way to the Pole.\"</ref> and eventually becoming \"the most prolific lecturer and writer on the Arctic in the nineteenth century,\" according to biographer Douglas Wamsley.<ref>Wamsley, Douglas W.

Departing in June 1860 aboard the ''United States'', he ultimately hoped to reach the North Pole. After arriving in Greenland, where he encouraged several Eskimos to join his 20-man party as hunters to ensure that his crew would not be forced to endure the hunger and starvation experienced by previous expeditions, Hayes and his men then set out for [[Baffin Bay]], [[Smith Sound]] and Ellesmere Island en route to the [[Open Polar Sea]] but, like others before him, was eventually forced by the terrain, harsh climate and dwindling food supplies to turn back. Taking a measurement with his sextant before making the turnaround, he recorded that he and his men had reached 81\u00b035' north, 70\u00b030' west \u2014 which, if his measurement was accurate, would have meant that he and his men had reached the farthest point north to date of any polar expedition. His journal entries did not match the position he had written down in the frigid cold, however, leading subsequent researchers to conclude that he had overestimated his reach by more than {{Convert|100|mi|km|abbr=}}, and to speculate that Hayes may have mistakenly noted that his sextant observations of the sun had been taken at noon when they hadn't or that he had inverted the second digit of the group's farthest lone lower limb to read 56\u00b052\u2032 instead of the true observation 59\u00b052\u2032. According to researchers, the farthest point reached by Hayes was [[Cape Collinson]], less than {{Convert|10|mi|km|abbr=}} north of 80\u00b0 north, longitude 70\u00b030\u2032 west.<ref>Barr, William.

In 1862, he was placed in command of the [[Satterlee General Hospital]], a sprawling 4,500-bed military hospital in [[Philadelphia]] which saw spikes in patients following the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg]], the latter of which was responsible for \"swelling the hospital population to more than 6,000\" after \"the greatest number of wounded were admitted to the hospital in a single month\" during the summer of 1863.<ref>\"[https://chrc-phila.org/sisters-of-charity-nursed-wounded-civil-war-soldiers-at-west-philadelphia-hospital/ Daughters of Charity Nursed Wounded Civil War Soldiers at West Philadelphia hospital].\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Catholic Historical Research Center, Archdiocese of Pennsylvania, March 24, 2011.</ref>\n\nRendering care to as many as 50,000 sick and wounded during the time this hospital was open, the physicians and nurses under Hayes lost only 260 patients between the time of the hospital's opening and closure, a significant achievement when considering the challenges they faced in treating not only the sheer volume of patients they were required to process, but in doing so while employing relatively rudimentary medical care procedures and sanitation practices.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gay|first1=James D.|title=Satterlee USA General Hospital West Philadelphia|url=http://libwww.freelibrary.org/diglib/SearchItem.cfm?searchKey=3408575232&ItemID=pdcp00420|website=Free Library of Philadelphia|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref><ref>\"Daughters of Charity Nursed Wounded Civil War Soldiers at West Philadelphia hospital,\" Catholic Historical Research Center, Archdiocese of Pennsylvania.</ref>\n\n==Post-war life==\nPost-war, Hayes penned a book about his expedition days, ''The Open Polar Sea: A Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery towards the North Pole, in the Schooner United States''.<ref>Drabelle, \"Pointing the Way to the Pole.\"</ref> He then followed up with the publication of other work, including 1869's ''Cast Away in the Cold''.

When Kane announced his plans to extend the expedition for a second winter even though the group's food and fuel were severely depleted, Hayes and seven other team members opted to head south for what they thought would be safety. Instead, they ran out of food and began to eat the only available food source \u2014 [[lichen]] \u2014 until forced to return to Kane's main group, where Hayes then underwent the amputation of three of his frostbitten toes before Kane ordered the group to head to Greenland via sledge and boat. After reaching New York in October 1855 and recuperating from the ordeal, Hayes then embarked on a lecture tour, speaking before audiences at the [[American Geographical Society]] and [[Smithsonian Institution]]<ref>Drabelle, \"Pointing the Way to the Pole.\"</ref> and eventually becoming \"the most prolific lecturer and writer on the Arctic in the nineteenth century,\" according to biographer Douglas Wamsley.<ref>Wamsley, Douglas W.

Departing in June 1860 aboard the ''United States'', he ultimately hoped to reach the North Pole. After arriving in Greenland, where he encouraged several Eskimos to join his 20-man party as hunters to ensure that his crew would not be forced to endure the hunger and starvation experienced by previous expeditions, Hayes and his men then set out for [[Baffin Bay]], [[Smith Sound]] and Ellesmere Island en route to the [[Open Polar Sea]] but, like others before him, was eventually forced by the terrain, harsh climate and dwindling food supplies to turn back. Taking a measurement with his sextant before making the turnaround, he recorded that he and his men had reached 81\u00b035' north, 70\u00b030' west \u2014 which, if his measurement was accurate, would have meant that he and his men had reached the farthest point north to date of any polar expedition. His journal entries did not match the position he had written down in the frigid cold, however, leading subsequent researchers to conclude that he had overestimated his reach by more than {{Convert|100|mi|km|abbr=}}, and to speculate that Hayes may have mistakenly noted that his sextant observations of the sun had been taken at noon when they hadn't or that he had inverted the second digit of the group's farthest lone lower limb to read 56\u00b052\u2032 instead of the true observation 59\u00b052\u2032. According to researchers, the farthest point reached by Hayes was [[Cape Collinson]], less than {{Convert|10|mi|km|abbr=}} north of 80\u00b0 north, longitude 70\u00b030\u2032 west.<ref>Barr, William.

In 1862, he was placed in command of the [[Satterlee General Hospital]], a sprawling 4,500-bed military hospital in [[Philadelphia]] which saw spikes in patients following the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg]], the latter of which was responsible for \"swelling the hospital population to more than 6,000\" after \"the greatest number of wounded were admitted to the hospital in a single month\" during the summer of 1863.<ref>\"[https://chrc-phila.org/sisters-of-charity-nursed-wounded-civil-war-soldiers-at-west-philadelphia-hospital/ Daughters of Charity Nursed Wounded Civil War Soldiers at West Philadelphia hospital].\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Catholic Historical Research Center, Archdiocese of Pennsylvania, March 24, 2011.</ref>\n\nRendering care to as many as 50,000 sick and wounded during the time this hospital was open, the physicians and nurses under Hayes lost only 260 patients between the time of the hospital's opening and closure, a significant achievement when considering the challenges they faced in treating not only the sheer volume of patients they were required to process, but in doing so while employing relatively rudimentary medical care procedures and sanitation practices.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gay|first1=James D.|title=Satterlee USA General Hospital West Philadelphia|url=http://libwww.freelibrary.org/diglib/SearchItem.cfm?searchKey=3408575232&ItemID=pdcp00420|website=Free Library of Philadelphia|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref><ref>\"Daughters of Charity Nursed Wounded Civil War Soldiers at West Philadelphia hospital,\" Catholic Historical Research Center, Archdiocese of Pennsylvania.</ref>\n\n==Post-war life==\nPost-war, Hayes penned a book about his expedition days, ''The Open Polar Sea: A Narrative of a Voyage of Discovery towards the North Pole, in the Schooner United States''.<ref>Drabelle, \"Pointing the Way to the Pole.\"</ref> He then followed up with the publication of other work, including 1869's ''Cast Away in the Cold''.

His accession to the [[Duchy of Bohemia|Bohemian]] throne marked the start of a phase of stability after a long period of internal dynastic struggles. Under his rule, the [[Moravia]]n lands were reconquered from [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Polish]] occupation.\n\n== Life ==\nOld\u0159ich was the third son of Duke [[Boleslaus II of Bohemia]] (d. 999){{sfn|Wolverton|2001|p=102}} and the son one of his father's two wives: [[Adiva]] or [[Emma of M\u011bln\u00edk]]. Upon the death of his father, his eldest brother [[Boleslaus III of Bohemia|Boleslaus III]] succeeded as duke, however, he soon entered into a fierce conflict with his younger brothers Old\u0159ich and [[Jarom\u00edr of Bohemia|Jarom\u00edr]]. In 1001, both had to flee to the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] court at [[Regensburg]]. When Boleslaus III was deposed by the rival [[Vr\u0161ovci]] dynasty the next year and the Polish ruler [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]] invaded Bohemia, King [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II of Germany]] intervened. As a part of Henry's expedition to [[Prague]], Boleslaus's brothers were able to return to Bohemia, and Jarom\u00edr was installed as Bohemian duke in 1004. \n[[File:Oldrich a Bozena.jpg|thumb|left|Old\u0159ich and his wife Bo\u017eena enter Prague, ''Chronicle of Dalimil'']]\nIn the [[German\u2013Polish War (1002\u201318)|German\u2013Polish War]] of 1002-18, Duke Jarom\u00edr remained a loyal supporter of the German king. Nevertheless, Henry did not take action when he was deposed and blinded by his brother Old\u0159ich on 12 April 1012. While Jarom\u00edr fled to Poland, Old\u0159ich recognised the suzerainty of the German king. He secured his rule by suppressing the Vr\u0161ovci insurgents.\n\nOld\u0159ich and his son [[Bretislaus I of Bohemia|Bretislaus]] sought to win back Moravia, once conquered from the Poles by Old\u0159ich's grandfather Duke [[Boleslaus I of Bohemia|Boleslaus I]]. Bretislaus and his wife [[Judith of Schweinfurt]] took up residence in [[Olomouc]]. In 1029, the Bohemian forces, backed by Holy Roman Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], finally drove the Poles out of the eastern lands. However, Bretislaus's efforts to occupy adjacent territories in what is today [[Slovakia]] by marching against the forces of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]] failed in 1030 due to the jealousy of the emperor, who reached an agreement with King [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]]. In the following year, Bohemian forces refused to take the field for the emperor.\n\nIn 1032, Duke Old\u0159ich was invited to the ''[[Hoftag]]'' diet at [[Merseburg]], but did not appear. His absence raised the ire of the emperor and Conrad, busy with events in [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. Old\u0159ich was arrested, deposed and sent to Bavaria. He was again replaced by his brother Jarom\u00edr. However, when Old\u0159ich was pardoned the next year, he returned to Bohemia and had Jarom\u00edr captured, blinded, and deposed. He seized power again and drove out Jarom\u00edr's son from Moravia.\n\nOld\u0159ich died abruptly on 9 November 1034 and later examination of his skeleton reveal his skull to have suffered a fatal blow.

With depth, rich copper ore was discovered, but early efforts to mine copper failed. [[Boyce Thompson]] bought the old Silver Queen mine in 1910, and by 1912, the Magma Copper Company was in production. A narrow gauge railroad connecting to the [[Phoenix and Eastern Railroad]] was built in 1915, and later converted to standard gauge. A [[smelter]] was built in 1924. A new concentrator replaced the original one in 1946.\n\nAfter 71 years of production, the Magma mine closed in August 1982 due to high operating costs and declining copper prices. Operations resumed in September 1990, but the mine closed again on June 28, 1996. During its  86-year life  (1911\u20131996). the Magma mine produced approximately 27.6 million short tons of ore averaging about 4.9% copper,  recovering 1,299,718 short tons of copper, 36,550 short tons of zinc, approximately 686,000 ounces of gold and 34.3 million ounces of silver.<ref>[https://arizonadailyindependent.com/2015/07/19/history-of-the-magma-mine-superior-arizona/ History Of The Magma Mine, Superior, Arizona] at ''Arizona Daily Independent'', July 19, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe old Magma No. 9 shaft atop Apache Leap is being used to explore the huge [[Resolution Copper]] deposit below.\n\n==Geography==\nSuperior is located approximately {{convert|70|mi|km}} east of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and the same distance north of [[Tucson]].

With depth, rich copper ore was discovered, but early efforts to mine copper failed. [[Boyce Thompson]] bought the old Silver Queen mine in 1910, and by 1912, the Magma Copper Company was in production. A narrow gauge railroad connecting to the [[Phoenix and Eastern Railroad]] was built in 1915, and later converted to standard gauge. A [[smelter]] was built in 1924. A new concentrator replaced the original one in 1946.\n\nAfter 71 years of production, the Magma mine closed in August 1982 due to high operating costs and declining copper prices. Operations resumed in September 1990, but the mine closed again on June 28, 1996. During its  86-year life  (1911\u20131996). the Magma mine produced approximately 27.6 million short tons of ore averaging about 4.9% copper,  recovering 1,299,718 short tons of copper, 36,550 short tons of zinc, approximately 686,000 ounces of gold and 34.3 million ounces of silver.<ref>[https://arizonadailyindependent.com/2015/07/19/history-of-the-magma-mine-superior-arizona/ History Of The Magma Mine, Superior, Arizona] at ''Arizona Daily Independent'', July 19, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe old Magma No. 9 shaft atop Apache Leap is being used to explore the huge [[Resolution Copper]] deposit below.\n\n==Geography==\nSuperior is located approximately {{convert|70|mi|km}} east of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and the same distance north of [[Tucson]].
