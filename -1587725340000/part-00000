Square dances were first documented in 16th-century England but were also quite common in France and throughout Europe. They came to North America with the European settlers and have undergone considerable development there. In some countries and regions, through preservation and repetition, square dances have attained the status of a [[folk dance]].\nThe Western American square dance may be the most widely known form worldwide, possibly due to its association in the 20th century with the romanticized image of the American [[Cowboy#Development of the modern cowboy image|cowboy]]. Square dancing is, therefore, strongly associated with the United States.  Nineteen U.S. states have designated it as their [[List of U.S. state dances|official state dance]].\n\nThe various square dance movements are based on the steps and figures used in traditional folk dances and social dances from many countries.  Some of these traditional dances include [[English country dance]], Caledonians and the [[quadrille]]. \n\nIn most American forms of square dance, the dancers are prompted or cued through a sequence of steps (square dance choreography) by a [[Caller (dance)|caller]] to the beat (and, in some traditions, the phrasing) of music. In some forms of traditional square dancing, the caller may be one of the dancers or musicians, but in modern Western square dancing the caller will be on stage, giving full attention to directing the dancers. Modern Western square dances are not learned as complete routines; the dancers learn basic movements, each with its own distinctive call, but do not know in what order they will be called.\n\nThe [[American folk music revival]] in New York City in the 1950s was rooted in the resurgent interest in square dancing and folk dancing there in the 1940s, which gave musicians such as [[Pete Seeger]] popular exposure.<ref>Szwed, John, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sV48asr7T4MC&printsec=frontcover ''Alan Lomax: The Man who Recorded Music''], Penguin, 2010.

Written by [[Alan Lomax]] and narrated by Pete Seeger.</ref>\n\n==Main types==\nTerminology: In the United States, in general, people go to square dances and call it square dancing.  In England, Ireland and Scotland, people go to all sorts of dances at which some of the dances will be square dances, but they don't say that they are \"square dancing\". The majority of dances at such events will be in the form of longways sets, sets of four (two couples with the men diagonally opposite each other, like the side couples in a square), three-couple or four-couple sets or circassian circles.\n\nConversely, people not familiar with the various different forms of dance may ask for an evening of square dance meaning simply a [[barn dance]] where many different formations of dance are used.  It is possible to go to one of these \"square dances\" and not do a single actual square dance all evening.\n\n===United States and Canada===\n[[File:Dance. Square Dancing at North Branch Y.M.C.A BAnQ P48S1P06773.jpg|thumb|Square dance in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] in 1941]]\n* [[Traditional square dance]], which is also called \"old time square dance\". Traditional square dance is not standardized and can be subdivided into regional styles. The [[New England]] and [[Appalachia]]n styles have been particularly well documented; both have survived to the present time. There are several other styles; some have survived or been revived in recent years, some have not. Traditional square dance is frequently presented in alternation with [[contra dance]]s (particularly in revival groups) or with some form of freestyle couple dancing (at surviving local events). One ancestor of New England style square dances is the [[quadrille]], and older New England callers occasionally refer to their squares as \"quadrilles.\" Where traditional square dance has been revived, it encompasses a wide range of new choreography.\n* [[Modern Western square dance]] (MWSD), which is also called \"Western square dance\", \"contemporary Western square dance\", or \"modern American square dance\". Modern Western square dance evolved from the Western style of traditional square dance from about 1940 to 1960. Traditional Western square dancing was promoted beginning in the 1930s by [[Lloyd Shaw (educator)|Lloyd Shaw]], who solicited definitions from callers across the country in order to preserve that dance form and make it available to other teachers.  Since the 1970s modern Western square dance has been promoted and standardized by [[Callerlab]], the \"International Association of Square Dance Callers\".  Modern Western square dance is sometimes presented in alternation with [[Round dance (ballroom)|round dance]]s. This modern form of square dancing is taught in around thirty countries. As well as the USA and Canada, this includes the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Australia, China, Japan and Russia. Within Europe, the majority of square dance clubs are in Germany and the United Kingdom. All teach the Callerlab syllabus. The initial stage reached by all dancers is called Mainstream. This program consists of a 'core' list of about 70 moves which is revised periodically. Because of this standardization, it is possible for anyone with the proper training to enjoy modern Western square dancing in many countries around the world; although instruction is typically given in the local language, the calls are always in English.[[File:MeowDanceSquares.jpg|thumb|293x293px|Modern Appalachian Square Dancing]]\n[[File:Square Dance diagram from Playford's English Dancing Master.jpg|thumb|right|Square Dance Diagram from [[The Dancing Master]] (Published circa 1650 to 1720) ]]\n\n===England===\n* [[John Playford|Playford]]:  [[John Playford]] published ''[[The Dancing Master|The English Dancing Master]]'' in 1651.  Eight of the 105 dances are square dances, many exhibiting concepts that we still use today such as the Heads performing an action and then the Sides repeating the same action.  Three of the dances, such as \"Dull Sir John\", actually state \"A Square Dance for Eight thus\" (see the diagram on the right). Square dances such as \"Newcastle\", one of those original eight, are still very popular today, and countless new dances have been written in the [[John Playford|Playford]] style, or [[Country dance|English country dance (ECD)]] style as it is known in the United States.\n* [[Folk Dance]] /[[Barn dance]]: At English folk or country dances a very wide range of dances is performed, many of which are square dances: Playford style dances; dances derived from the [[quadrille]], for example \"La Russe\" published by H.D. Willock in the \"Manual of Dancing\" (c.1847); regional traditional folk dances such as the \"Goathland Square Eight\" and the \"Cumberland Square Eight\"; American traditional square dances; plus countless new square dances written in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n* [[C\u00e9ilidh]]: Ceilidhs often include square dances. At English Ceilidhs the same squares may be done as at folk dances or barn dances, but with more stepping. Stepping includes skip steps, hop steps, polka steps and rants.\n[[Square Dance]]: In Britain Square Dancing is formally organised by clubs affiliated to the British Association of American  Square Dance Clubs, who also organise the teaching of [[Modern Western square dance]] to [[Callerlab]] definitions. Unless otherwise stated, a square dance is run according to the [[Callerlab]] syllabus by a caller who is either a member of [[Callerlab]] or of the Square Dance Caller's Club of Great Britain. The level of dancing is indicated on the publicity material, e.g. 'Mainstream' or 'Mainstream with Pre-Announced Plus'.  This is fully described in the main [[Modern Western square dance]] entry. It is increasingly common to see [[C\u00e9ilidh]] and [[Barn dance]] events advertised as being a [[Square Dance]] which can be misleading.\n\n===Ireland===\n* [[Ceili dance|C\u00e9il\u00ed]]: Ceili dances cover a wide range of formations, including many square dances.\n* [[Irish set dance]]: Square dances with strong regional associations.  Tops (rather than Heads) and Sides are used extensively.  Stepping, often with a flat-foot polka step is normal.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Scottish country dance]]: Scottish dances cover a wide range of formations, including many square dances.\n\n===Continental Europe===\nMany traditions know square dances; they are usually not called, rather the sequence of figures is fixed, and known by the dancers. Examples include the German ''Bekedorfer'', French ''Carr\u00e9 de Campagne'', and ''Mie Katoen'' from the Low Countries. Variations include double squares, with two couples on each side, like the Danish ''Sonderborger Doppelkadril'' or the Dutch ''Vleegerd''. Some are composed of multiple figures, indicating descent from the high-society [[quadrille]].\n\n===International===\n[[Modern Western square dance]] is practiced in many countries throughout the world.\n* Square dancing is typically \"called\" (directed verbally by an individual, the ''caller'') in [[English language]] throughout the world. Once a person learns the calls, the person can generally dance internationally. However, as may be expected, there are slight style and call title variations throughout the world, although all [[Modern Western square dance]] forms are based on the [[Callerlab]] definitions.\n\n==Numbering of couples==\n[[File:Quadrille set five person set colonial ball at the Albert Hall.jpg|thumb|Quadrille variation involving five couples dancing at a Colonial Ball in the [[Albert Hall, Canberra|Albert Hall]], Canberra September 2016 ([[sepia tone|sepia]])]]\n\nCouple numbering in a square dance set usually begins with the couple nearest the head of the hall (the side of the room containing the musicians and caller, or in the pre-caller era, the royal presence or other hosts or important guests). This couple is the \"first\" or \"number one\" couple.\n\nIf most of the figures are danced between facing couples across the set, as in the 19th century [[quadrille]] and dances derived from it, the couple opposite the first is the \"second couple\". The first and second couples constitute the \"head\" or \"top\" couples (or the \"head and foot\" couples); the third and fourth couples are the \"side\" couples. In the 19th century quadrille, the third couple is to the first couple's right. In Irish set dances, the third couple (sometimes termed the \"first side couple\") is to the left of the \"first top couple\" (the couples facing the first top and first side are the \"second top couple\" and the \"second side couple\" respectively).\n\nIf most figures are danced around the set, with one or more couples visiting the others in turn, the couples are likewise numbered around the set. In 17th century England they were numbered clockwise, with the second couple to the first couple's left. In most present-day American square dance traditions, the couples are numbered counterclockwise: the second couple is to the first couple's right, the third couple is across from the first, and the fourth couple is to the left of the first. The first and third are \"head couples\" or \"heads\" (or, in older parlance, the \"first four\"); the second and fourth are \"side couples\" or \"sides\" (formerly \"side four\" or \"second four\").\n\n==Comparing square dance calls==\nIn this context a \"call\" refers to the name of a specific dance movement.  It may alternatively refer to the phrase used by a caller to cue the dancers so they dance the specified movement, or to the dance movement itself. It mirrors the ambiguity of the word \"dance\", which may mean a dance event, the dancing of an individual to the playing of one piece of music, or dancing in general.\n\nIn many communities, especially in Scotland and Ireland, the dancers are expected to know the dance and there is no caller.\n\nA square dance call may take a very short time or a very long time to execute. Most calls require between 4 and 32 \"counts\" (where a count is roughly one step). In traditional square dancing the timing of a call is dictated by tradition; in some regional styles, particularly that of New England, the dance movements are closely fitted to the [[phrase (music)|phrases]] of the music. In modern Western square dancing many calls have been given formally specified durations, based partly on direct observation of how long it takes an average dancer to execute them.\n\nTraditional and modern Western square dancing have a number of calls in common, but there are usually small differences in the way they are performed.  For example, the \"Allemande Left\" is traditionally performed by grasping left hands with the other dancer, pulling away from each other slightly, and walking halfway around a central axis then stepping through. In modern Western dance the grip is modified so that each dancer grips the forearm of the other, and there is no pulling (that is, each dancer supports his or her own weight). These modifications make it easier to enter and exit the movement, and thus easier to incorporate it into a long sequence of calls.\n\nTraditional square dance uses a comparatively small number of calls\u2014between about ten and thirty, depending on the region and the individual caller. (Many traditional square dance calls are similar or identical to contra dance calls, which are described at [[contra dance choreography]].) New dance moves are explained by the caller.\n\nIn [[Modern Western square dance]] the participants are expected to have learned and become proficient in a particular ''[[Square dance program|program]]'', a defined set of calls.  Dancing Modern Western square dance is constantly challenging and surprising due to the unknown or unexpected choreography of the caller (that is, the way the caller ties together the \"calls\" and the formations which result)\u2014unlike traditional square dance, very rarely are two modern Western dances ever alike.  Like traditional square dancing, recovering from occasional mistakes is often part of the fun. Dancers are encouraged to dance only those programs at which they are reasonably proficient, the default level of achievement being the Mainstream program. All programs are set by [[Callerlab]], the callers' international association, which also governs the training of callers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.callerlab.org|title=CALLERLAB Website > Home|author=|date=|website=www.callerlab.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Comparing square dance music==\n[[File:Fiddlinbillhensley.png|thumb|left|Old-time fiddlers often accompany traditional square dances.]]\nIrish and Scottish dances are normally done to traditional tunes.  English dances may be done to traditional tunes, though, especially at ceilidhs, there is experimentation with many different musical styles.\n\nThe two types of American square dance are accompanied by different types of music.\n\nTraditional square dance is almost always danced to live music. Since the 19th century, much of the square dance repertoire has been derived from [[jig]]s and [[reel (dance)|reels]] from Scotland and Ireland, sometimes in relatively unaltered form, sometimes as played in the [[old time music]] tradition or as adapted by other cultures such as that of [[Quebec]]. This sort of music is played on acoustic instruments, such as the [[fiddle]], [[banjo]], [[guitar]] and [[double bass]]; certain instruments, including the [[piano]], [[accordion]], [[concertina]] and [[hammered dulcimer]], are popular in specific regions. In some communities where square dancing has survived, the prevailing form of music has become popular songs from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, played on instruments such as [[saxophone]]s, [[drum]]s, and [[electric guitar]]s. Tempos can vary from around 108 to more than 150 [[Beats per minute|bpm]], depending on the regional style. \n\n[[Modern Western square dance]] is danced to a variety of music types, everything from pop to traditional country to Broadway musical to contemporary [[country music]]\u2014even rock, [[Motown]], techno and hip-hop. The music is usually played from recordings; the tempo is also more uniform than in traditional dancing, as the \"perfect\" modern Western square dance tempo is 120\u2013128 [[Beats per minute|bpm]]. At this speed dancers take one step per beat of the music.\n\n==Other comparisons==\n[[File:Schleswig-Holstein, Itzehoe, Museumsfest 2014 NIK 7581.JPG|thumb|Square dancers performing outdoors in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]] in 2014]]\n[[Modern Western square dance]] is organized by [[square dance club]]s.  The clubs offer classes, social and dance evenings, as well as arrange for larger dances which are usually open to the general square dancing public (i.e. non-club members).  Larger dances sometimes request a strict western-style dress code, which originated in the late '50s and early '60s and is known as \"[[Modern Western square dance#Dress code|traditional square dance attire]]\", although it was not traditional before that time.  Clubs may choose to advertise their dances as requiring less strict dress codes known as \"proper\" or \"casual\" (no dress code).  [[Modern Western square dance]] events in Britain are increasingly seen as having a relaxed dress code, although many dancers do like to wear \"[[Modern Western square dance#Dress code|traditional square dance attire]]\".\n\nIn the United States dance groups often have no particular dress code and lines between the forms of square dancing have become blurred in recent years. Traditional-revival groups typically adopt very casual dress and traditional-revival choreographers have begun to use basic movements that were invented for [[Modern Western square dance]] forms and a few modern Western callers incorporate older dances from various traditions, such as New England or Appalachian, into their programs.\n\nWhere traditional square dancing exists as a community social dance (sometimes in the form of a [[Barn dance]] or a [[C\u00e9il\u00ed|Ceilidh]]) people often dress up a bit, though their clothing is not square-dance-specific.\n\n==Variations==\nWhile the standard formation for a square dance is four couples in a square, there are many variations on the theme. Here are some examples:\n* Ninepins: a square with one extra person in the middle\n* Winter Solstice: a square with one extra couple in the middle\n* Hexitation: a square with two couples in each of the Head positions.\n* Twelve Reel: a square with three people on each side, normally a man with a lady on either side of him.\n* Hexagon dancing:  six couples arranged in a hexagon.  There are three head couples and three side couples.  Most commonly done by advanced and challenge level dancers\n* Bigon:  a square with four people, each of whom dances his/her own part and that of their opposite.  Almost exclusively done by challenge level dancers due to the extreme mental flexibility required to grasp this difficult concept.\n\nModern choreography also includes dances which morph from one form to another.

Vext was a local buzz band, playing shows at [[CBGB]], The Continental, and Lamours. They also opened for [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], [[Candiria]] and many others.

It is also traditional for every family to thoroughly clean their house, in order to sweep away any ill-fortune and to make way for incoming good luck. Another custom is the decoration of windows and doors with red [[Chinese paper cutting|paper-cuts]] and [[Couplet (Chinese poetry)|couplets]]. Popular themes among these paper-cuts and couplets include that of [[Fu character|good fortune or happiness]], wealth, and longevity. Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in [[Red envelopes|red paper envelopes]]. For the northern regions of China, [[dumpling]]s are featured prominently in meals celebrating the festival.

The calendar is also used in countries that have been influenced by, or have relations with, China&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], though occasionally the date celebrated may differ by one day or even one moon cycle due to using a meridian based on a different capital city in a different time zone or different placements of intercalary months.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://chineseculture.about.com/od/chinesefestivals/a/ChineseNewYear.htm | title=The History of Chinese New Year | publisher=About.com | accessdate=8 February 2013 | author=Chiu, Lisa}}</ref>\n\n[[Chinese calendar]] defines the [[lunar month]] with [[solstice|winter solstice]] as the 11th month, which means that Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice (rarely the third if an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary month]] intervenes).<ref name=\"CentralWeatherBureau\">\n{{cite web\n|script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u4ee3\u6b72\u9996\u5206\u90a3\u5e7e\u7a2e?\u5404\u4ee5\u4f55\u70ba\u8d77\u9ede?\n|trans-title=In ancient China, how to decide the starting point of a year?\n|publisher=[[Central Weather Bureau]]\n|url=http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V7/knowledge/encyclopedia/as093.htm\n|language=Chinese\n|accessdate=26 January 2017\n}}\n</ref> In more than 96% of the years, the Chinese New Year's Day is the closest date to a [[new moon]] to [[lichun]] ({{CJKV| c= \u7acb\u6625| l= ''start of spring''}}) on 4 or 5 February, and the first new moon after [[Dahan (solar term)|Dahan]] ({{CJKV| c= \u5927\u5bd2| l= ''major cold''}}). In the [[Gregorian calendar]], the Lunar New Year begins at the new moon that falls between 21 January and 20 February.<ref name=\"aslaksen\"/> To determine whether a year has an intercalary month, one only needs to check whether Chinese New Year is within the month of January.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Gregorian Calendar dates for Chinese New Year from 1912 to 2101 are below, along with the year's presiding animal [[Chinese zodiac|zodiac]] and its Stem-branch. The traditional [[Chinese calendar]] follows a [[Metonic cycle]], a system used by the modern [[Jewish Calendar]], and returns to the same date in Gregorian calendar roughly. The names of the [[Earthly Branches]] have no English counterparts and are ''not'' the Chinese translations of the animals. Alongside the 12-year cycle of the animal zodiac there is a 10-year cycle of [[heavenly stem]]s. Each of the ten heavenly stems is associated with one of the [[Wu Xing|five elements]] of [[Chinese astrology]], namely: [[Tree (Wu Xing)|Wood]], [[Fire (Wu Xing)|Fire]], [[Earth (Wu Xing)|Earth]], [[Metal (Wu Xing)|Metal]], and [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]]. The elements are rotated every two years while a [[yin and yang]] association alternates every year. The elements are thus distinguished: Yang Wood, Yin Wood, Yang Fire, Yin Fire, etc. These produce a combined cycle that repeats every 60 years. For example, the year of the Yang Fire [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]] occurred in 1936 and in 1996, 60 years apart.\n\nMany people inaccurately calculate their Chinese birth-year by converting it from their Gregorian birth-year. As the Chinese New Year starts in late January to mid-February, the previous Chinese year dates through 1 January until that day in the new Gregorian year, remaining unchanged from the previous Gregorian year. For example, the 2011 year of the [[Rabbit]] began on 3 February 2011 . The year 2011 is generally aligned with the year of the [[Rabbit]]. However, the 1986 year of the [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]] officially ended on 2 February 2011 . This means that anyone born from 14 February to 2 February 2011 was actually born in the year of the [[Tiger]] rather than the year of the [[Rabbit]]. Many online Chinese Sign calculators do not account for the non-alignment of the two calendars, using Gregorian-calendar years rather than official Chinese New Year dates.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chinesenewyears.info/chinese-new-year-calendar.php | title = Chinese New Year Calendar  | publisher = chinesenewyears.info | date = | access-date = August 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne scheme of [[Chinese calendar#Continuous numbering|continuously-numbered]] Chinese calendar years assigns 4709 to the year beginning in 2011, but this is not universally accepted; the calendar is traditionally cyclical, not continuously numbered.\n\nAlthough the Chinese calendar traditionally does not use continuously numbered years, outside China its years are sometimes numbered from the purported reign of the mythical [[Yellow Emperor]] in the [[3rd millennium BC]]. But at least three different years numbered 1 are now used by various scholars, making the year beginning [[Common Era|CE]] 2015 the \"Chinese year\" 4712, 4713, or 4652.<ref>See [[Chinese calendar]] for details and references.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none;background:none;\"\n|-\n!

The Nian would eat villagers, especially children in the middle of the night.<ref name=chan>{{cite book |author1=Chan Sui Jeung |title=Traditional Chinese Festivals and Local Celebrations |date=2001 |publisher=Wan Li Book Company Limited}}</ref> One year, all the villagers decided to go hide from the beast. An old man, appeared before the villagers went into hiding and said that he would stay the night, and would get revenge on the Nian. All the villagers thought he was insane. The old man put red papers up and set off firecrackers. The day after, the villagers came back to their town and saw that nothing had been destroyed. They assumed that the old man was a deity who came to save them. The villagers then understood that Yanhuang had discovered that the Nian was afraid of the color red and loud noises.<ref name=chan/>  So the tradition grew that when New Year was approaching, the villagers would wear red clothes, hang red lanterns, and red spring scrolls on windows and doors. People also used firecrackers to frighten away the Nian. From then on, Nian never came to the village again. The Nian was eventually captured by [[Hongjun Laozu]], an ancient Taoist monk. After that, Nian retreated to a nearby mountain. The name of the mountain has long been lost over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends-asia/origin-lunar-new-year-and-legend-nian-001289|title=The Origin of Lunar New Year and the legend of Nian|publisher=Ancient Origins|date=31 January 2014|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a saying that the beast is \"Xi\", rather than Nian. Spring Festival included New Year\u2019s Eve and  New Year. Xi is a kind of faint monster, and Nian is not related to the animal beasts in terms of meaning, it is more like a mature harvest.{{clarify|date=October 2019}} There is no record of the beast in the ancient texts; it is only in Chinese folklore. The word \"Nian\" is composed of the words \"he\" and \"Qian\". It means that the grain is rich and the harvest is good. The farmers review the harvest at the end of the year and are also full of expectations for the coming year.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Laura Rico |title=Lunar New Year origins, customs explained |url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/lunar-new-year-origins-customs-explained |accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Chinese historical documents, since the beginning of the era, people have celebrated the harvest in the New Year and welcomed the new folk customs. Later, they gradually became an established traditional festival.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Naming==\nWhile Spring Festival has since become the official name of Chinese New Year, the Chinese outside mainland China still prefer to call it Lunar New Year. \u201cChinese New Year\u201d is a popular and convenient translation for people of non-Chinese cultural backgrounds. Along with the [[Han Chinese]] in and outside China, as many as 29 of the 55 ethnic minority groups in China also celebrate Chinese New Year. Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia celebrate it as an official festival.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Haiwang Yuan |title=The Origin of Chinese New Year |url=https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&context=dlps_fac_pub |accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Public holiday==\nChinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in some countries and territories where there is a sizable Chinese and Korean population. Since Chinese New Year falls on different dates on the Gregorian calendar every year on different days of the week, some of these governments opt to shift working days in order to accommodate a longer public holiday. In some countries, a statutory holiday is added on the following work day when the New Year falls on a weekend, as in the case of 2013, where the New Year's Eve (9 February) falls on Saturday and the New Year's Day (10 February) on Sunday. Depending on the country, the holiday may be termed differently; common names are \"Chinese New Year\", \"Lunar New Year\", \"New Year Festival\", and \"Spring Festival\".\n\nFor New Year celebrations that are lunar but are outside of China and Chinese diaspora (such as Korea's [[Korean New Year|''Seollal'']] and Vietnam's ''[[T\u1ebft]]''), see the article on [[Lunar New Year]].\n\nFor other countries where Chinese New Year is celebrated but not an official holiday, see the table below.\n\n{{Clear}}\n<!-- BEFORE ADDING OTHER COUNTRIES TO THIS TABLE, please verify that 1) the country declares an official public holiday where government facilities are closed and 2) it should not confuse as [[Lunar New Year]].

Influenced by the flourished cultures, foods from different places look and taste totally different. Among them, the most well-known ones are dumplings from northern China and Tangyuan from southern China.\n\n===Preceding days===\nOn the eighth day of the lunar month prior to Chinese New Year, the [[Laba Festival|''Laba'' holiday]] ({{zh|t=\u81d8\u516b|s=\u814a\u516b|hp=l\u00e0b\u0101|links=no|c=|labels=no}}), a traditional porridge, [[Laba porridge]] ({{zh|t=\u81d8\u516b\u7ca5|s=\u814a\u516b\u7ca5|hp=l\u00e0b\u0101 zh\u014du|links=no|c=|labels=no}}), is served in remembrance of an ancient festival, called ''La'', that occurred shortly after the winter solstice.<ref>Bodde, Derk. ''Festivals in Classical China: New Year and other Annual Observances during the Han Dynasty'', Princeton University Press, 1975, pp. 49 ff.</ref> Pickles such as Laba garlic, which turns green from vinegar, are also made on this day. For those that practice Buddhism, the Laba holiday is also considered [[Bodhi Day]]. ''Layue'' ({{zh|t=\u81d8\u6708|s=\u814a\u6708|hp=L\u00e0yu\u00e8|links=no|c=|labels=no}}) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honor of the gods in the twelfth lunar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as ''larou'' ({{zh|t=\u81d8\u8089|s=\u814a\u8089|hp=l\u00e0r\u00f2u|links=no|c=|labels=no}}). The porridge was prepared by the women of the household at first light, with the first bowl offered to the family's ancestors and the household deities. Every member of the family was then served a bowl, with leftovers distributed to relatives and friends.<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 5.</ref> It's still served as a special breakfast on this day in some Chinese homes. The concept of the \"La month\" is similar to [[Advent]] in Christianity. Many families eat vegetarian on Chinese New Year eve, the garlic and preserved meat are eaten on Chinese New Year day.\n\n[[File:Receive the gods in chinese new year 1.jpg|thumb|left|Receive the Gods in Chinese New Year, (1900s)]]\nOn the days immediately before the New Year celebration, Chinese families give their homes a thorough cleaning. There is a Cantonese saying \"Wash away the dirt on ''nin ya baat''\" ({{zh|c=\u5e74\u5eff\u516b\uff0c\u6d17\u908b\u9062|hp=ni\u00e1n ni\u00e0n b\u0101, x\u01d0 l\u0101t\u00e0|j=nin4 jaa6 baat3, sai2 laap6 taap3 (laat6 taat3)|links=no}}), but the practice is not restricted to ''nin ya baat'' (the 28th day of month 12). It is believed the cleaning sweeps away the bad luck of the preceding year and makes their homes ready for good luck. Brooms and dust pans are put away on the first day so that the newly arrived good luck cannot be swept away. Some people give their homes, doors and window-frames a new coat of red paint; decorators and paper-hangers do a year-end rush of business prior to Chinese New Year.<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 9.</ref> Homes are often decorated with paper cutouts of Chinese auspicious phrases and [[couplet (Chinese poetry)|couplets]]. Purchasing new clothing and shoes also symbolize a new start. Any hair cuts need to be completed before the New Year, as cutting hair on New Year is considered bad luck due to the homonymic nature of the word \"hair\" (fa) and the word for \"prosperity\". Businesses are expected to pay off all the debts outstanding for the year before the new year eve, extending to debts of gratitude. Thus it is a common practice to send gifts and rice to close business associates, and extended family members.\n\nIn many households where Buddhism or Taoism is prevalent, home altars and statues are cleaned thoroughly, and decorations used to adorn altars over the past year are taken down and burned a week before the new year starts, to be replaced with new decorations. Taoists (and Buddhists to a lesser extent) will also \"send gods back to heaven\" ({{zh|c=\u9001\u795e|hp=s\u00f2ngsh\u00e9n|links=no}}), an example would be burning a paper effigy of [[Kitchen God|Zao Jun the Kitchen God]], the recorder of family functions. This is done so that the Kitchen God can report to the [[Jade Emperor]] of the family household's transgressions and good deeds. Families often offer sweet foods (such as candy) in order to \"bribe\" the deities into reporting good things about the family.\n\nPrior to the Reunion Dinner, a prayer of thanksgiving is held to mark the safe passage of the previous year. Confucianists take the opportunity to remember their ancestors, and those who had lived before them are revered. Some people do not give a Buddhist prayer due to the influence of Christianity, with a Christian prayer offered instead.\n\n===Chinese New Year's Eve===\n{{main|Chinese New Year\u2019s Eve}}\nThe biggest event of any Chinese New Year's Eve is the annual [[reunion dinner]]. Dishes consisting of special meats are served at the tables, as a main course for the dinner and offering for the New Year. This meal is comparable to Thanksgiving dinner in the U.S. and remotely similar to Christmas dinner in other countries with a high percentage of Christians.\n\nIn northern China, it is customary to make [[jiaozi]], or dumplings, after dinner to eat around midnight. Dumplings symbolize wealth because their shape resembles a Chinese [[sycee]]. In contrast, in the South, it is customary to make a glutinous new year cake ([[niangao]]) and send pieces of it as gifts to relatives and friends in the coming days. Ni\u00e1ng\u0101o [Pinyin] literally means \"new year cake\" with a homophonous meaning of \"increasingly prosperous year in year out\".<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 36.</ref>\n\nAfter dinner, some families go to local temples hours before the new year begins to pray for a prosperous new year by lighting the first incense of the year; however in modern practice, many households hold parties and even hold a countdown to the new year. Traditionally, firecrackers were lit to scare away evil spirits with the household doors sealed, not to be reopened until the new morning in a ritual called \"opening the door of fortune\" ({{zh|hp=k\u0101ic\u00e1im\u00e9n|t=\u958b\u8ca1\u9580|s=\u5f00\u8d22\u95e8|links=no|c=|labels=no}}).<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 30.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1982, the ''[[CCTV New Year's Gala]]'' is broadcast in China four hours before the start of the New Year and lasts until the succeeding early morning. Watching it has gradually become a tradition in China. A tradition of going to bed late on New Year's Eve, or even keeping awake the whole night and morning, known as ''shousui'' (\u5b88\u5c81), is still practised as it is thought to add on to one's parents' longevity.\n\n===First day===\nThe first day is for the welcoming of the deities of the heavens and earth, officially beginning at midnight. It is a traditional practice to light fireworks, burn bamboo sticks and firecrackers and to make as much of a din as possible to chase off the evil spirits as encapsulated by ''nian'' of which the term ''Guo Nian'' was derived. Many [[Buddhist]]s abstain from meat consumption on the first day because it is believed to ensure [[longevity]] for them. Some consider lighting fires and using knives to be bad luck on New Year's Day, so all food to be consumed is cooked the days before. On this day, it is considered bad luck to use the broom, as good fortune is not to be \"swept away\" symbolically.\n\nMost importantly, the first day of Chinese New Year is a time to honor one's elders and families visit the oldest and most senior members of their extended families, usually their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents.\n\nFor Buddhists, the first day is also the designated holy day of [[Maitreya]] [[Bodhisattva]] (better known as the more familiar [[Budai|Budai Luohan]]), the Buddha-to-be. People also abstain from killing animals.\n\nSome families may invite a [[lion dance]] troupe as a symbolic ritual to usher in the Chinese New Year as well as to evict bad spirits from the premises. Members of the family who are married also give [[red envelopes]] containing cash known as ''lai see'' (Cantonese dialect) or ''angpow'' (Hokkien, Chaozhou, and Fujian dialects), or ''hongbao'' (Mandarin), a form of blessings and to suppress the aging and challenges associated with the coming year, to junior members of the family, mostly children and teenagers. Business managers also give bonuses through red packets to employees for good luck, smooth-sailing, good health and wealth.\n\nWhile fireworks and firecrackers are traditionally very popular, some regions have banned them due to concerns over fire hazards. For this reason, various city governments (e.g., Kowloon, Beijing, Shanghai for a number of years) issued bans over fireworks and firecrackers in certain precincts of the city. As a substitute, large-scale fireworks display have been launched by governments in such city-states as Hong Kong and Singapore. However, it is a tradition that the indigenous peoples of the [[walled village]]s of [[New Territories]], Hong Kong are permitted to light [[firecrackers]] and launch [[fireworks]] in a limited scale.\n\n===Second day===\n[[File:Incence at grave.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Incense]] is burned at the graves of ancestors as part of the offering and prayer rituals.]]\n\nThe second day of the Chinese New Year, known as \"beginning of the year\" ({{zh|t=\u958b\u5e74|s=\u5f00\u5e74|hp=k\u0101ini\u00e1n|links=no|c=|labels=no}}),<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 40.</ref> was when married daughters visited their birth parents, relatives and close friends. (Traditionally, married daughters didn't have the opportunity to visit their birth families frequently.)\n\nDuring the days of imperial China, \"beggars and other unemployed people circulate[d] from family to family, carrying a picture [of the God of Wealth] shouting, \"''Cai Shen dao''!\" [The God of Wealth has come!].\"<ref>Kong, Shiu L. ''Chinese Culture and Lore''. HK: University of Toronto Press, 1989, p. 48</ref> Householders would respond with \"lucky money\" to reward the messengers. Business people of the Cantonese dialect group will hold a 'Hoi Nin' prayer to start their business on the 2nd day of Chinese New Year so they will be blessed with good luck and prosperity in their business for the year.\n\nAs this day is believed to be [[The Birthday of Che Kung]], a deity worshipped in Hong Kong, worshippers go to [[Che Kung Temple]]s to pray for his blessing. A representative from the government asks [[Che Kung]] about the city's fortune through [[Hong Kong Government Lunar New year kau cim tradition|kau cim]].\n\n===Third day===\nThe third day is known as \"red mouth\" ({{zh|c=\u8d64\u53e3|hp=Ch\u00eck\u01d2u|links=no|s=|t=|labels=no}}). ''Chikou'' is also called \"Chigou's Day\" ({{zh|c=\u8d64\u72d7\u65e5|hp=Ch\u00ecg\u01d2ur\u00ec|links=no|s=|t=|labels=no}}). ''Chigou'', literally \"red dog\", is an epithet of \"the God of Blazing Wrath\" ({{zh|c=\u719b\u6012\u4e4b\u795e|hp=Bi\u0101o n\u00f9 zh\u012b sh\u00e9n|links=no}}). Rural villagers continue the tradition of burning paper offerings over trash fires. It is considered an unlucky day to have guests or go visiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ctps.tp.edu.tw/country/holiday/hldy_b/hldy_b2.htm |title=\u00acK\u00b8' |publisher=.ctps.tp.edu.tw |accessdate=25 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721190459/http://www2.ctps.tp.edu.tw/country/holiday/hldy_b/hldy_b2.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref> Hakka villagers in rural Hong Kong in the 1960s called it the Day of the Poor Devil and believed everyone should stay at home.<ref>Berkowitz and Brandauer, ''Folk Religion in an Urban Setting'', Hong Kong, 1969, p. 49.</ref> This is also considered a propitious day to visit the temple of the God of Wealth and have one's future told.\n\n===Fourth day===\nIn those communities that celebrate Chinese New Year for 15 days, the fourth day is when corporate \"spring dinners\" kick off and business returns to normal. Other areas that have a longer Chinese New Year holiday will celebrate and welcome the gods that were previously sent on this day.\n\n===Fifth day===\nThis day is the god of Wealth's birthday. In northern China, people eat [[jiaozi]], or dumplings, on the morning of ''powu'' ({{zh|c=\u7834\u4e94|hp=p\u00f2w\u01d4|links=no}}). In Taiwan, businesses traditionally re-open on the next day (the sixth day), accompanied by firecrackers.\n\nIt is also common in China that on the 5th day people will shoot off firecrackers to get [[Guan Yu]]'s attention, thus ensuring his favor and good fortune for the new year.<ref name=\"About.com\">{{cite web | url=http://goasia.about.com/od/ChineseNewYear/a/Chinese-New-Year-Traditions.htm | title=Chinese New Year Traditions | publisher=About.com | accessdate=8 February 2013 | author=Rodgers, Greg}}</ref>\n\n===Sixth day===\nThe sixth day is Horse's Day, on which people drive away the Ghost of Poverty by throwing out the garbage stored up during the festival.

The venue will usually be in or near the home of the most senior member of the family. The New Year's Eve dinner is very large and sumptuous and traditionally includes dishes of meat (namely, pork and chicken) and fish. Most reunion dinners also feature a [[communal bowl|communal]] [[hot pot]] as it is believed to signify the coming together of the family members for the meal. Most reunion dinners (particularly in the Southern regions) also prominently feature specialty meats (e.g. wax-cured meats like duck and [[Chinese sausage]]) and seafood (e.g. [[lobster]] and [[abalone]]) that are usually reserved for this and other special occasions during the remainder of the year. In most areas, fish ({{zh|s=\u9c7c|t=\u9b5a|p=y\u00fa|first=|links=no|c=|labels=no}}) is included, but not eaten completely (and the remainder is stored overnight), as the Chinese phrase \"may there be ''surpluses'' every year\" ({{zh|t=\u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918|s=\u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u4f59|p=ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u01d2u y\u00fa|first=|links=no|c=|labels=no}}) sounds the same as \"let there be fish every year.\" Eight individual dishes are served to reflect the belief of good fortune associated with the number. If in the previous year a death was experienced in the family, seven dishes are served.\n\nOther traditional foods consists of noodles, fruits, dumplings, spring rolls, and Tangyuan which are also known as sweet rice balls. Each dish served during Chinese New Year represents something special. The noodles used to make longevity noodles are usually very thin, long wheat noodles. These noodles are longer than normal noodles that are usually fried and served on a plate, or boiled and served in a bowl with its broth. Expectedly, the noodles symbolize the wish for a long life. The fruits that are typically selected would be oranges, tangerines, and pomelos as they are round and \"golden\" color symbolizing fullness and wealth. Their lucky sound when spoken also brings good luck and fortune. The Chinese pronunciation for orange is \u6a59 (ch\u00e9ng /chnng/), which sounds the same as the Chinese for 'success' (\u6210). One of the ways to spell tangerine(\u6854 j\u00fa /jyoo/) contains the Chinese character for luck (\u5409 j\u00ed /jee/). Pomelos is believed to bring constant prosperity. Pomelo in Chinese (\u67da y\u00f2u /yo/) sounds similar to 'to have' (\u6709 y\u01d2u), disregarding its tone, however it sounds exactly like 'again' (\u53c8 y\u00f2u).  Dumplings and spring rolls symbolize wealth, whereas sweet rice balls symbolize family togetherness.\n\n[[Red packet]]s for the immediate family are sometimes distributed during the reunion dinner. These packets contain money in an amount that reflects good luck and honorability. Several foods are consumed to usher in wealth, happiness, and good fortune. Several of the [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese food]] names are homophones for words that also mean good things.\n\nMany places in China still follow the tradition of eating only vegetarian food on the first day of the New year, as it is a sign of peace. So, they believe that eating only vegetarian food the first day will bring joy and peace into their lives for the whole year.\n\nLike many other New Year dishes, certain ingredients also take special precedence over others as these ingredients also have similar-sounding names with prosperity, good luck, or even counting money.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Food item\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Simplified Chinese\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Traditional Chinese\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Hanyu Pinyin\n! style=\"width:50%;\"| Description\n|-\n| [[Buddha's delight]] \n|\u7f57\u6c49\u658b\n|\u7f85\u6f22\u9f4b\n|Lu\u00f3h\u00e0n zh\u0101i|| An elaborate [[Buddhist cuisine|vegetarian dish]] served by Chinese families on the eve and the first day of the New Year.

Red envelopes are then kept under the pillow and slept on for seven nights after Chinese New Year before opening because that symbolizes good luck and fortune.\n\nIn [[Taiwan]] in the 2000s, some employers also gave red packets as a bonus to [[maid]]s, nurses or [[domestic worker]]s from Southeast Asian countries, although whether this is appropriate is controversial.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Ofw chinese new year things to remember\n |publisher    = South East Asia Group [an agency introducing foreign workers to work in Taiwan]\n |url          = http://www.sea.com.tw/word/%B9L%A6~%AA%60%B7N%A8%C6%B6%B5-%B5%E1%A4%E5.pdf\n |archive-url  = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160317045230/http://www.sea.com.tw/word/%B9L%A6~%AA%60%B7N%A8%C6%B6%B5-%B5%E1%A4%E5.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-date = 17 March 2016\n |format       = PDF\n |accessdate   = 29 January 2012\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|script-title=zh:\u5bb6\u5ead\u5916\u50ad\u904e\u5e74\u7fd2\u4fd7\u61c9\u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805\n|publisher=South East Asia Group\n|url=http://seacomtw.pixnet.net/blog/post/41810763\n|language=Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai, English\n|format=JPEG\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn the mid-2010s, Chinese [[messaging app]]s such as [[WeChat]] popularized the distribution of red envelopes in a virtual format via [[mobile payment]]s, usually within [[group chat]]s.<ref name=\"fastco-redpacket\">{{cite web|title=How Social Cash Made WeChat The App For Everything|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money|website=Fast Company|accessdate=4 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103135948/https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money|archive-date=3 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Doug|title=Red envelope wars in China, Xiaomi eyes US|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1715981/red-envelope-wars-china-xiaomi-eyes-us|accessdate=18 February 2015|agency=South China Morning Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218160037/http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1715981/red-envelope-wars-china-xiaomi-eyes-us|archive-date=18 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2017, it was estimated that over 100 billion of these virtual red envelopes would be sent over the New Year holiday.<ref name=\"bbc-virtual\">{{cite web|title=Why this Chinese New Year will be a digital money fest|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38746298|website=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128112533/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38746298|archive-date=28 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-01-13/tencent-alibaba-send-lunar-new-year-revelers-money-hunting-101043798.html|title=Tencent, Alibaba Send Lunar New Year Revelers Money-Hunting|last=|first=|date=13 January 2017|website=Caixin Global|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829072212/https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-01-13/tencent-alibaba-send-lunar-new-year-revelers-money-hunting-101043798.html|archive-date=2018-08-29|access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>\n\n===Gift exchange===\n[[File:Candy Box.jpg|thumb|[[Chinese candy box]]]]\nIn addition to red envelopes, which are usually given from older people to younger people, small gifts (usually food or sweets) are also exchanged between friends or relatives (of different households) during Chinese New Year. Gifts are usually brought when visiting friends or relatives at their homes. Common gifts include fruits (typically oranges, but never trade pears), cakes, biscuits, chocolates, and candies.\n\nCertain items should not be given, as they are considered [[taboo]]. Taboo gifts include:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinese-lessons.com/cantonese/culture1NewYears.htm#gift |title=Chinese Culture: New Years \u2013 Cantonese Culture Notes and Phrases |publisher=chinese-lessons.com |accessdate=4 November 2008 |last=|first=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://randomwire.com/green-hat-a-no-no/ |title=Green Hat a No-No |date=3 December 2009 |author=David}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://chineseculture.about.com/od/chinesefestivals/a/Chinese-Gift-Giving-What-Not-To-Buy.htm |title=Chinese Gift-Giving: What Not to Buy \u2013 Avoid These Chinese Gift-Giving Blunders |first=Lauren |last=Mack |date=27 February 2015 |publisher=About.com |accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n* items associated with [[funerals]] (i.e. handkerchiefs, towels, [[chrysanthemums]], items colored white and black)\n* items that show that time is running out (i.e. clocks and watches)\n* sharp objects that symbolize cutting a tie (i.e. scissors and knives)\n* items that symbolize that you want to walk away from a relationship (examples: shoes and sandals)\n* mirrors\n* [[homonyms]] for unpleasant topics (examples: \"clock\" sounds like \"the funeral ritual\", green hats because \"wear a green hat\" sounds like \"[[cuckold]]\", \"handkerchief\" sounds like \"goodbye\", \"pear\" sounds like \"separate\", and \"umbrella\" sounds like \"disperse\").\n\n===Markets===\nMarkets or village fairs are set up as the New Year is approaching. These usually open-air markets feature new year related products such as flowers, toys, clothing, and even fireworks and firecrackers. It is convenient for people to buy gifts for their new year visits as well as their home decorations. In some places, the practice of shopping for the perfect [[Prunus mume|plum tree]] is not dissimilar to the Western tradition of buying a [[Christmas tree]].\n\n[[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong filmmakers]] also release \"New Year celebration films\" ({{zh|t=\u8cc0\u6b72\u7247|s=|p=|first=t|links=no|c=|labels=yes}}), mostly comedies, at this time of year.\n\n===Fireworks===\n[[File:Chinesenewyearfireworkman.jpg|thumb|A Chinese man setting off fireworks during Chinese New Year in Shanghai.]]\nBamboo stems filled with gunpowder that was burnt to create small explosions were once used in ancient China to drive away evil spirits. In modern times, this method has eventually evolved into the use of [[firecrackers]] during the festive season. Firecrackers are usually strung on a long fused string so it can be hung down. Each firecracker is rolled up in red papers, as red is auspicious, with gunpowder in its core. Once ignited, the firecracker lets out a loud popping noise and, as they are usually strung together by the hundreds, the firecrackers are known for their deafening explosions that are thought to scare away evil spirits. The burning of firecrackers also signifies a joyful time of year and has become an integral aspect of Chinese New Year celebrations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/sip_749_2005-01-11.html |title=Firecrackers |publisher=Infopedia.nlb.gov.sg |date=15 April 1999 |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> Since the 2000s, firecrackers have been banned in various countries and towns.\n\n===Music===\n\"''Happy New Year!''\" ({{zh|c=\u65b0\u5e74\u597d\u5440|hp=X\u012bn Ni\u00e1n H\u01ceo Ya|l=New Year's Good, Ya|links=no}}) is a popular children's song for the New Year holiday.<ref name=\"eChineseLearning\">{{cite web |url=http://resources.echineselearning.com/kids/kids-chinese-496.html |title=\u65b0\u5e74\u597d (x\u012bnni\u00e1nh\u01ceo) Happy New Year |publisher=eChineseLearning.com |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> The melody is similar to the American [[Western music (North America)|folk song]], ''[[Oh My Darling, Clementine]]''.\n\n*Chorus:\n: Happy New Year!

During the New Year holidays, the stage boss gathers the most popular actors whom from various troupes let them perform [[Repertoire|repertories]] from [[Qing dynasty]]. Nowadays people prefer celebrating the new year with their family by watching these movies together.\n\n===Clothing===\n[[File:Red girls (121513100).jpg|thumb|right|Girls dressed in red (Hong Kong).]]\nThe color red is commonly worn throughout Chinese New Year; traditional beliefs held that red could scare away evil spirits and bad fortune. The wearing of new clothes is another clothing custom during the festival, the new clothes symbolize a new beginning in the year, and enough things to use and wear in this time.\n\n===Family portrait===\nIn some places, the taking of a [[Portrait photography|family portrait]] is an important ceremony after the relatives are gathered. The photo is taken at the hall of the house or taken in front of the house. The most senior male head of the family sits in the center.\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{see also|Fu character}}\n[[File:FuDao.jpg|thumb|right|An inverted character ''fu'' is a sign of arriving blessings.]]\n\nAs with all cultures, Chinese New Year traditions incorporate elements that are symbolic of deeper meaning. One common example of Chinese New Year symbolism is the red [[diamond]]-shaped ''[[fu character]]s'' ({{zh|c=\u798f|hp=f\u00fa|cy=fuk1|l=blessings, happiness|links=no}}), which are displayed on the entrances of Chinese homes. This sign is usually seen hanging upside down, since the Chinese word ''dao'' ({{zh|c=\u5012|hp=d\u00e0o|l=upside down|links=no}}), is [[homophone|homophonous]] or nearly homophonous with ({{zh|c=\u5230|hp=d\u00e0o|l=arrive|links=no}}) in all [[varieties of Chinese]]. Therefore, it symbolizes the arrival of luck, happiness, and prosperity.\n\nFor the [[Cantonese]]-speaking people, if the ''fu'' sign is hung upside down, the implied ''dao'' (upside down) sounds like the Cantonese word for \"pour\", producing \"pour the luck [away]\", which would usually symbolize bad luck; this is why the ''fu'' character is not usually hung upside-down in Cantonese communities.\n\nRed is the predominant color used in New Year celebrations. Red is the emblem of joy, and this color also symbolizes virtue, truth and sincerity. On the Chinese opera stage, a painted red face usually denotes a sacred or loyal personage and sometimes a great emperor. Candies, cakes, decorations and many things associated with the New Year and its ceremonies are colored red. The sound of the Chinese word for \"red\" ({{zh|t=\u7d05|s=\u7ea2|hp=h\u00f3ng|cy=hung4|links=no}}) is in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] homophonous with the word for \"prosperous.\" Therefore, red is an auspicious color and has an auspicious sound.\nAccording to Chinese tradition, the year of the pig is a generally unlucky year for the public, which is why you need to reevaluate most of your decisions before you reach a conclusion. However, this only helps you get even more control over your life as you learn to stay ahead of everything by being cautious.<ref>https://askastrology.com/year-of-the-pig/</ref>\n\n===Nianhua===\n[[File:ChineseNewYearBoston01.jpg|thumb|upright|Chinese New Year festival in [[Chinatown, Boston]]]]\n\nNianhua can be a form of Chinese colored woodblock printing, for decoration during Chinese New Year.<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite web |url=http://jds.cass.cn/Item/5606.aspx |title=The Boxer Rebellion, 1900: A Selection of Books, Prints and Photographs |last=Wood |first=Frances |publisher=British Library |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Flowers===\nThe following are popular floral decorations for the New Year and are available at new year markets.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Floral Decor ||Meaning\n|-\n|[[Plum Blossom]] || symbolizes luckiness\n|-\n|[[Kumquat]] || symbolizes prosperity\n|-\n|[[Calamondin]]\n|Symbolizes luck\n|-\n|[[Narcissus (genus)|Narcissus]] || symbolizes prosperity\n|-\n|[[Bamboo]] || a plant used for any time of year\n|-\n|[[Sunflower]] || means to have a good year\n|-\n|[[Eggplant]] ||a plant to heal all of your sicknesses\n|-\n|[[Sandersonia|Chom Mon Plant]] || a plant which gives you tranquility\n|}\n\n===Icons and ornaments===\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Icons || Meaning || Illustrations\n|-\n| '''[[Lantern]]s''' || These lanterns that differ from those of [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] in general.

In modern China, migrant workers in China travel home to have [[reunion dinner]]s with their families on Chinese New Year's Eve. Owing to a large number of interprovincial travelers, special arrangements were made by [[Passenger rail transport in China|railways]], buses and airlines starting from 15 days before the New Year's Day. This 40-day period is called [[chunyun]], and is known as the world's largest annual migration.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7813267.stm China's holiday rush begins early], BBC</ref> More interurban trips are taken in mainland China in this period than the total population of China.\n\nIn Taiwan, spring travel is also a major event. The majority of transportation in western Taiwan is in a north\u2013south direction: long distance travel between urbanized north and hometowns in the rural south. Transportation in eastern Taiwan and that between Taiwan and its islands is less convenient. Cross-strait flights between Taiwan and mainland China began in 2003 as part of [[Three Links]], mostly for \"Taiwanese businessmen\" to return to Taiwan for the new year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/01/07/2003522653 |date=7 January 2012 |title=Ministry warns of heavy Lunar New Year holiday traffic |author=Shan, Shelley |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] }}\n{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/01/25/2003523974 |date=25 January 2012 |title=Despite rain, millions hit the road |author=Lee, I-chia |newspaper=Taipei Times }}\n{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/01/29/2003524165 |date=29 January 2012 |title=Early start beats tolls and congestion as the holiday ends |author=Lee, I-chia |quote=... total traffic volume on Friday was 2.7&nbsp; million vehicles, about 1.7 times the average daily traffic volume of about 1.6&nbsp; million. \"We estimate the total traffic volume [yesterday] was between 2.1&nbsp; million and 2.3&nbsp; million vehicles,\" Chen said. \"Northbound traffic volume was much higher than southbound and peak hours were between 3&nbsp; pm and 6&nbsp; pm.\" |newspaper=Taipei Times}}</ref>\n\n==Festivities outside Greater China==\n[[File:2016 Singapur, Downtown Core, River Hongbao 2016 (43).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Decorations on the occasion of Chinese New Year - River Hongbao 2016, [[Singapore]]]]\nChinese New Year is also celebrated annually in many countries with significant Chinese populations.

In 1849, with the discovery of gold and the ensuing [[California Gold Rush]], over 50,000 people had come to San Francisco to seek their fortune or just a better way of life.

By the 1860s, the residents of [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]] were eager to share their culture with their fellow San Francisco residents who may have been unfamiliar with (or hostile towards) it. The organizers chose to showcase their culture by using a favorite American tradition \u2013 the [[parade]].

New Year couplets printed in gold letters on bright red paper, referred to as ''chunlian'' (\u6625\u806f) or ''[[fai chun]]'' (\u63ee\u6625), is another way of expressing auspicious new year wishes. They probably predate the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644), but did not become widespread until then.<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 20.</ref> Today, they are ubiquitous with Chinese New Year.\n\nSome of the most common greetings include:\n*'''Xin nian kuai le''': {{zh|s=\u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u4e50|t=\u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u6a02|p=X\u012bnni\u00e1nku\u00e0il\u00e8|poj= Sin-n\u00ee kh\u00f2ai-lo\u030dk|j=san1 nin4 faai3 lok6}}; [[Hakka]]: Sin Ngen Kai Lok; [[Taishanese]]: Slin Nen Fai Lok.

While the first two words of this phrase had a much longer historical significance (legend has it that the congratulatory messages were traded for surviving the ravaging beast of ''[[Nian]]'', in practical terms it may also have meant surviving the harsh winter conditions), the last two words were added later as ideas of capitalism and [[consumerism]] became more significant in Chinese societies around the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The saying is now commonly heard in English speaking communities for greetings during Chinese New Year in parts of the world where there is a sizable Chinese-speaking community, including [[overseas Chinese]] communities that have been resident for several generations, relatively recent immigrants from [[Greater China]], and those who are transit migrants (particularly students).\n\nNumerous other greetings exist, some of which may be exclaimed out loud to no one in particular in specific situations. For example, as breaking objects during the new year is considered inauspicious, one may then say \u6b72\u6b72\u5e73\u5b89 (''Su\u00ecsu\u00ec-p\u00edng'\u0101n'') immediately, which means \"everlasting peace year after year\". ''Su\u00ec'' (\u6b72), meaning \"age\" is homophonous with \u788e (su\u00ec) (meaning \"shatter\"), in the demonstration of the Chinese love for wordplay in auspicious phrases. Similarly, \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918 (''ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u01d2u y\u00fa''), a wish for surpluses and bountiful harvests every year, plays on the word ''y\u00fa'' that can also refer to \u9b5a (y\u00fa meaning fish), making it a catch phrase for fish-based Chinese new year dishes and for paintings or graphics of fish that are hung on walls or presented as gifts.\n\nThe most common auspicious greetings and sayings consist of four characters, such as the following:\n*\u91d1\u7389\u6eff\u5802 ''J\u012bny\u00f9m\u01cent\u00e1ng''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May your wealth [gold and jade] come to fill a hall\"\n*\u5927\u5c55\u9d3b\u5716 ''D\u00e0zh\u01cenh\u00f3ngt\u00fa''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May you realize your ambitions\"\n*\u8fce\u6625\u63a5\u798f ''Y\u00edngch\u00fanji\u0113f\u00fa''&nbsp;\u2013 \"Greet the New Year and encounter happiness\"\n*\u842c\u4e8b\u5982\u610f ''W\u00e0nsh\u00ecr\u00fay\u00ec''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May all your wishes be fulfilled\"\n*\u5409\u6176\u6709\u9918 ''J\u00edq\u00ecngy\u01d2uy\u00fa''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May your happiness be without limit\"\n*\u7af9\u5831\u5e73\u5b89 ''Zh\u00fab\u00e0op\u00edng'\u0101n''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May you hear [in a letter] that all is well\"\n*\u4e00\u672c\u842c\u5229 ''Y\u012bb\u011bnw\u00e0nl\u00ec''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May a small investment bring ten-thousandfold profits\"\n*\u798f\u58fd\u96d9\u5168 ''F\u00fash\u00f2ushu\u0101ngqu\u00e1n''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May your happiness and longevity be complete\"\n*\u62db\u8ca1\u9032\u5bf6 ''Zh\u0101oc\u00e1ij\u00ecnb\u01ceo''&nbsp;\u2013 \"When wealth is acquired, precious objects follow\"<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 22</ref>\n\nThese greetings or phrases may also be used just before children receive their red packets, when gifts are exchanged, when visiting temples, or even when tossing the shredded ingredients of [[yusheng]] particularly popular in Malaysia and Singapore. Children and their parents can also pray in the temple, in hopes of getting good blessings for the new year to come.\n\nChildren and teenagers sometimes jokingly use the phrase \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u7d05\u5305\u62ff\u4f86 (in Traditional Chinese; Simplified Chinese: \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22\uff0c\u7ea2\u5305\u62ff\u6765; [[Pinyin]]: g\u014dngx\u01d0f\u0101c\u00e1i, h\u00f3ngb\u0101o n\u00e1l\u00e1i; Cantonese: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86; Jyutping: gung1 hei2 faat3 coi4, lei6 si6 dau6 loi4), roughly translated as \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope!\". In [[Hakka]] the saying is more commonly said as 'Gung hee fatt choi, hung bao diu loi' which would be written as \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u7d05\u5305\u9017\u4f86 \u2013 a mixture of the Cantonese and Mandarin variants of the saying.\n\nBack in the 1960s, children in Hong Kong used to say \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86,\u6597\u96f6\u5514\u611b (Cantonese, Gung Hei Fat Choy, Lai Si Tau Loi, Tau Ling M Ngoi), which was recorded in the pop song [[Kowloon Hong Kong]] by [[Reynettes]] in 1966. Later in the 1970s, children in Hong Kong used the saying: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86,\u4f0d\u6beb\u5acc\u5c11,\u58f9\u868a\u5514\u611b (Cantonese), roughly translated as, \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope, fifty cents is too little, don't want a dollar either.\" It basically meant that they disliked small change \u2013 coins which were called \"hard substance\" (Cantonese: \u786c\u5622). Instead, they wanted \"soft substance\" (Cantonese: \u8edf\u5622), which was either a ten dollar or a twenty dollar note.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Overseas Chinese]]\n*[[Lunar New Year fireworks display in Hong Kong]]\n*[[The Birthday of Che Kung]]\n*Other celebrations of Lunar New Year in China:\n** [[Losar|Tibetan New Year]] ''(Losar)''\n** [[Tsagaan Sar|Mongolian New Year]] ''(Tsagaan Sar)''\n*Celebrations of Lunar New Year in other parts of Asia:\n** [[Korean New Year]] ''(Seollal)''\n** [[Japanese New Year]] ''(Sh\u014dgatsu)''\n** [[Tsagaan Sar|Mongolian New Year]] ''(Tsagaan Sar)''\n** [[T\u1ebft|Vietnamese New Year]] ''(T\u1ebft)''\n*Similar Asian Lunisolar New Year celebrations that occur in April:\n**[[Thingyan|Burmese New Year]] ''(Thingyan)''\n**[[Cambodian New Year]] ''(Chaul Chnam Thmey)''\n**[[Songkran (Lao)|Lao New Year]] ''(Pii Mai)''\n**[[Sinhalese New Year|Sri Lankan New Year]] ''(Aluth Avuruddu)''\n**[[Songkran (Thailand)|Thai New Year]] ''(Songkran)''\n* Chinese New Year Gregorian Holiday in Malaysia\n**Malaysia Chinese New Year ''(Tahun Baru Cina)''\n**Indonesian Chinese New Year ''(Imlek)''\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Welch|first= Patricia Bjaaland |year=1997|title= Chinese New Year|url=https://archive.org/details/chinesenewyear00welc|url-access=registration|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{PRC Holidays}}\n{{Hong Kong Holidays}}\n{{Public holidays in Indonesia}}\n{{Public holidays in Malaysia}}\n{{Public holidays in Singapore}}\n{{Public holidays in Thailand}}\n{{Public holidays in the Philippines}}\n{{Chinese New Year}}\n{{Portal bar|China|Holidays}}\n\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Buddhist holidays]]\n[[Category:Chinese New Year]]\n[[Category:Chinese-Australian culture]]\n[[Category:New Year celebrations]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in China]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Observances set by the Chinese calendar]]\n[[Category:Winter events in China]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Traditional Chinese holiday}}\n{{About|the festival observed on the traditional Chinese calendar|the first day of the year observed on other lunar or lunisolar calendars|Lunar New Year}}\n{{Infobox holiday\n|official_name =\n|image = File:Kung Hei Fat Choi!

It is also traditional for every family to thoroughly clean their house, in order to sweep away any ill-fortune and to make way for incoming good luck. Another custom is the decoration of windows and doors with red [[Chinese paper cutting|paper-cuts]] and [[Couplet (Chinese poetry)|couplets]]. Popular themes among these paper-cuts and couplets include that of [[Fu character|good fortune or happiness]], wealth, and longevity. Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in [[Red envelopes|red paper envelopes]]. For the northern regions of China, [[dumpling]]s are featured prominently in meals celebrating the festival.

The calendar is also used in countries that have been influenced by, or have relations with, China&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], though occasionally the date celebrated may differ by one day or even one moon cycle due to using a meridian based on a different capital city in a different time zone or different placements of intercalary months.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://chineseculture.about.com/od/chinesefestivals/a/ChineseNewYear.htm | title=The History of Chinese New Year | publisher=About.com | accessdate=8 February 2013 | author=Chiu, Lisa}}</ref>\n\n[[Chinese calendar]] defines the [[lunar month]] with [[solstice|winter solstice]] as the 11th month, which means that Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice (rarely the third if an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary month]] intervenes).<ref name=\"CentralWeatherBureau\">\n{{cite web\n|script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u570b\u53e4\u4ee3\u6b72\u9996\u5206\u90a3\u5e7e\u7a2e?\u5404\u4ee5\u4f55\u70ba\u8d77\u9ede?\n|trans-title=In ancient China, how to decide the starting point of a year?\n|publisher=[[Central Weather Bureau]]\n|url=http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V7/knowledge/encyclopedia/as093.htm\n|language=Chinese\n|accessdate=26 January 2017\n}}\n</ref> In more than 96% of the years, the Chinese New Year's Day is the closest date to a [[new moon]] to [[lichun]] ({{CJKV| c= \u7acb\u6625| l= ''start of spring''}}) on 4 or 5 February, and the first new moon after [[Dahan (solar term)|Dahan]] ({{CJKV| c= \u5927\u5bd2| l= ''major cold''}}). In the [[Gregorian calendar]], the Lunar New Year begins at the new moon that falls between 21 January and 20 February.<ref name=\"aslaksen\"/> To determine whether a year has an intercalary month, one only needs to check whether Chinese New Year is within the month of January.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Gregorian Calendar dates for Chinese New Year from 1912 to 2101 are below, along with the year's presiding animal [[Chinese zodiac|zodiac]] and its Stem-branch. The traditional [[Chinese calendar]] follows a [[Metonic cycle]], a system used by the modern [[Jewish Calendar]], and returns to the same date in Gregorian calendar roughly. The names of the [[Earthly Branches]] have no English counterparts and are ''not'' the Chinese translations of the animals. Alongside the 12-year cycle of the animal zodiac there is a 10-year cycle of [[heavenly stem]]s. Each of the ten heavenly stems is associated with one of the [[Wu Xing|five elements]] of [[Chinese astrology]], namely: [[Tree (Wu Xing)|Wood]], [[Fire (Wu Xing)|Fire]], [[Earth (Wu Xing)|Earth]], [[Metal (Wu Xing)|Metal]], and [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]]. The elements are rotated every two years while a [[yin and yang]] association alternates every year. The elements are thus distinguished: Yang Wood, Yin Wood, Yang Fire, Yin Fire, etc. These produce a combined cycle that repeats every 60 years. For example, the year of the Yang Fire [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]] occurred in 1936 and in 1996, 60 years apart.\n\nMany people inaccurately calculate their Chinese birth-year by converting it from their Gregorian birth-year. As the Chinese New Year starts in late January to mid-February, the previous Chinese year dates through 1 January until that day in the new Gregorian year, remaining unchanged from the previous Gregorian year. For example, the 2011 year of the [[Rabbit]] began on 3 February 2011 . The year 2011 is generally aligned with the year of the [[Rabbit]]. However, the 1986 year of the [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]] officially ended on 2 February 2011 . This means that anyone born from 14 February to 2 February 2011 was actually born in the year of the [[Tiger]] rather than the year of the [[Rabbit]]. Many online Chinese Sign calculators do not account for the non-alignment of the two calendars, using Gregorian-calendar years rather than official Chinese New Year dates.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chinesenewyears.info/chinese-new-year-calendar.php | title = Chinese New Year Calendar  | publisher = chinesenewyears.info | date = | access-date = August 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOne scheme of [[Chinese calendar#Continuous numbering|continuously-numbered]] Chinese calendar years assigns 4709 to the year beginning in 2011, but this is not universally accepted; the calendar is traditionally cyclical, not continuously numbered.\n\nAlthough the Chinese calendar traditionally does not use continuously numbered years, outside China its years are sometimes numbered from the purported reign of the mythical [[Yellow Emperor]] in the [[3rd millennium BC]]. But at least three different years numbered 1 are now used by various scholars, making the year beginning [[Common Era|CE]] 2015 the \"Chinese year\" 4712, 4713, or 4652.<ref>See [[Chinese calendar]] for details and references.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none;background:none;\"\n|-\n!

The Nian would eat villagers, especially children in the middle of the night.<ref name=chan>{{cite book |author1=Chan Sui Jeung |title=Traditional Chinese Festivals and Local Celebrations |date=2001 |publisher=Wan Li Book Company Limited}}</ref> One year, all the villagers decided to go hide from the beast. An old man, appeared before the villagers went into hiding and said that he would stay the night, and would get revenge on the Nian. All the villagers thought he was insane. The old man put red papers up and set off firecrackers. The day after, the villagers came back to their town and saw that nothing had been destroyed. They assumed that the old man was a deity who came to save them. The villagers then understood that Yanhuang had discovered that the Nian was afraid of the color red and loud noises.<ref name=chan/>  So the tradition grew that when New Year was approaching, the villagers would wear red clothes, hang red lanterns, and red spring scrolls on windows and doors. People also used firecrackers to frighten away the Nian. From then on, Nian never came to the village again. The Nian was eventually captured by [[Hongjun Laozu]], an ancient Taoist monk. After that, Nian retreated to a nearby mountain. The name of the mountain has long been lost over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends-asia/origin-lunar-new-year-and-legend-nian-001289|title=The Origin of Lunar New Year and the legend of Nian|publisher=Ancient Origins|date=31 January 2014|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a saying that the beast is \"Xi\", rather than Nian. Spring Festival included New Year\u2019s Eve and  New Year. Xi is a kind of faint monster, and Nian is not related to the animal beasts in terms of meaning, it is more like a mature harvest.{{clarify|date=October 2019}} There is no record of the beast in the ancient texts; it is only in Chinese folklore. The word \"Nian\" is composed of the words \"he\" and \"Qian\". It means that the grain is rich and the harvest is good. The farmers review the harvest at the end of the year and are also full of expectations for the coming year.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Laura Rico |title=Lunar New Year origins, customs explained |url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/lunar-new-year-origins-customs-explained |accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Chinese historical documents, since the beginning of the era, people have celebrated the harvest in the New Year and welcomed the new folk customs. Later, they gradually became an established traditional festival.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Naming==\nWhile Spring Festival has since become the official name of Chinese New Year, the Chinese outside mainland China still prefer to call it Lunar New Year. \u201cChinese New Year\u201d is a popular and convenient translation for people of non-Chinese cultural backgrounds. Along with the [[Han Chinese]] in and outside China, as many as 29 of the 55 ethnic minority groups in China also celebrate Chinese New Year. Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia celebrate it as an official festival.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Haiwang Yuan |title=The Origin of Chinese New Year |url=https://digitalcommons.wku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&context=dlps_fac_pub |accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Public holiday==\nChinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in some countries and territories where there is a sizable Chinese and Korean population. Since Chinese New Year falls on different dates on the Gregorian calendar every year on different days of the week, some of these governments opt to shift working days in order to accommodate a longer public holiday. In some countries, a statutory holiday is added on the following work day when the New Year falls on a weekend, as in the case of 2013, where the New Year's Eve (9 February) falls on Saturday and the New Year's Day (10 February) on Sunday. Depending on the country, the holiday may be termed differently; common names are \"Chinese New Year\", \"Lunar New Year\", \"New Year Festival\", and \"Spring Festival\".\n\nFor New Year celebrations that are lunar but are outside of China and Chinese diaspora (such as Korea's [[Korean New Year|''Seollal'']] and Vietnam's ''[[T\u1ebft]]''), see the article on [[Lunar New Year]].\n\nFor other countries where Chinese New Year is celebrated but not an official holiday, see the table below.\n\n{{Clear}}\n<!-- BEFORE ADDING OTHER COUNTRIES TO THIS TABLE, please verify that 1) the country declares an official public holiday where government facilities are closed and 2) it should not confuse as [[Lunar New Year]].

Influenced by the flourished cultures, foods from different places look and taste totally different. Among them, the most well-known ones are dumplings from northern China and Tangyuan from southern China.\n\n===Preceding days===\nOn the eighth day of the lunar month prior to Chinese New Year, the [[Laba Festival|''Laba'' holiday]] ({{zh|t=\u81d8\u516b|s=\u814a\u516b|hp=l\u00e0b\u0101|links=no|c=|labels=no}}), a traditional porridge, [[Laba porridge]] ({{zh|t=\u81d8\u516b\u7ca5|s=\u814a\u516b\u7ca5|hp=l\u00e0b\u0101 zh\u014du|links=no|c=|labels=no}}), is served in remembrance of an ancient festival, called ''La'', that occurred shortly after the winter solstice.<ref>Bodde, Derk. ''Festivals in Classical China: New Year and other Annual Observances during the Han Dynasty'', Princeton University Press, 1975, pp. 49 ff.</ref> Pickles such as Laba garlic, which turns green from vinegar, are also made on this day. For those that practice Buddhism, the Laba holiday is also considered [[Bodhi Day]]. ''Layue'' ({{zh|t=\u81d8\u6708|s=\u814a\u6708|hp=L\u00e0yu\u00e8|links=no|c=|labels=no}}) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honor of the gods in the twelfth lunar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as ''larou'' ({{zh|t=\u81d8\u8089|s=\u814a\u8089|hp=l\u00e0r\u00f2u|links=no|c=|labels=no}}). The porridge was prepared by the women of the household at first light, with the first bowl offered to the family's ancestors and the household deities. Every member of the family was then served a bowl, with leftovers distributed to relatives and friends.<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 5.</ref> It's still served as a special breakfast on this day in some Chinese homes. The concept of the \"La month\" is similar to [[Advent]] in Christianity. Many families eat vegetarian on Chinese New Year eve, the garlic and preserved meat are eaten on Chinese New Year day.\n\n[[File:Receive the gods in chinese new year 1.jpg|thumb|left|Receive the Gods in Chinese New Year, (1900s)]]\nOn the days immediately before the New Year celebration, Chinese families give their homes a thorough cleaning. There is a Cantonese saying \"Wash away the dirt on ''nin ya baat''\" ({{zh|c=\u5e74\u5eff\u516b\uff0c\u6d17\u908b\u9062|hp=ni\u00e1n ni\u00e0n b\u0101, x\u01d0 l\u0101t\u00e0|j=nin4 jaa6 baat3, sai2 laap6 taap3 (laat6 taat3)|links=no}}), but the practice is not restricted to ''nin ya baat'' (the 28th day of month 12). It is believed the cleaning sweeps away the bad luck of the preceding year and makes their homes ready for good luck. Brooms and dust pans are put away on the first day so that the newly arrived good luck cannot be swept away. Some people give their homes, doors and window-frames a new coat of red paint; decorators and paper-hangers do a year-end rush of business prior to Chinese New Year.<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 9.</ref> Homes are often decorated with paper cutouts of Chinese auspicious phrases and [[couplet (Chinese poetry)|couplets]]. Purchasing new clothing and shoes also symbolize a new start. Any hair cuts need to be completed before the New Year, as cutting hair on New Year is considered bad luck due to the homonymic nature of the word \"hair\" (fa) and the word for \"prosperity\". Businesses are expected to pay off all the debts outstanding for the year before the new year eve, extending to debts of gratitude. Thus it is a common practice to send gifts and rice to close business associates, and extended family members.\n\nIn many households where Buddhism or Taoism is prevalent, home altars and statues are cleaned thoroughly, and decorations used to adorn altars over the past year are taken down and burned a week before the new year starts, to be replaced with new decorations. Taoists (and Buddhists to a lesser extent) will also \"send gods back to heaven\" ({{zh|c=\u9001\u795e|hp=s\u00f2ngsh\u00e9n|links=no}}), an example would be burning a paper effigy of [[Kitchen God|Zao Jun the Kitchen God]], the recorder of family functions. This is done so that the Kitchen God can report to the [[Jade Emperor]] of the family household's transgressions and good deeds. Families often offer sweet foods (such as candy) in order to \"bribe\" the deities into reporting good things about the family.\n\nPrior to the Reunion Dinner, a prayer of thanksgiving is held to mark the safe passage of the previous year. Confucianists take the opportunity to remember their ancestors, and those who had lived before them are revered. Some people do not give a Buddhist prayer due to the influence of Christianity, with a Christian prayer offered instead.\n\n===New Year's Eve===\n{{main|Chinese New Year\u2019s Eve}}\nThe biggest event of any Chinese New Year's Eve is the annual [[reunion dinner]]. Dishes consisting of special meats are served at the tables, as a main course for the dinner and offering for the New Year. This meal is comparable to Thanksgiving dinner in the U.S. and remotely similar to Christmas dinner in other countries with a high percentage of Christians.\n\nIn northern China, it is customary to make [[jiaozi]], or dumplings, after dinner to eat around midnight. Dumplings symbolize wealth because their shape resembles a Chinese [[sycee]]. In contrast, in the South, it is customary to make a glutinous new year cake ([[niangao]]) and send pieces of it as gifts to relatives and friends in the coming days. Ni\u00e1ng\u0101o [Pinyin] literally means \"new year cake\" with a homophonous meaning of \"increasingly prosperous year in year out\".<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 36.</ref>\n\nAfter dinner, some families go to local temples hours before the new year begins to pray for a prosperous new year by lighting the first incense of the year; however in modern practice, many households hold parties and even hold a countdown to the new year. Traditionally, firecrackers were lit to scare away evil spirits with the household doors sealed, not to be reopened until the new morning in a ritual called \"opening the door of fortune\" ({{zh|hp=k\u0101ic\u00e1im\u00e9n|t=\u958b\u8ca1\u9580|s=\u5f00\u8d22\u95e8|links=no|c=|labels=no}}).<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 30.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1982, the ''[[CCTV New Year's Gala]]'' is broadcast in China four hours before the start of the New Year and lasts until the succeeding early morning. Watching it has gradually become a tradition in China. A tradition of going to bed late on New Year's Eve, or even keeping awake the whole night and morning, known as ''shousui'' (\u5b88\u5c81), is still practised as it is thought to add on to one's parents' longevity.\n\n===First day===\nThe first day is for the welcoming of the deities of the heavens and earth, officially beginning at midnight. It is a traditional practice to light fireworks, burn bamboo sticks and firecrackers and to make as much of a din as possible to chase off the evil spirits as encapsulated by ''nian'' of which the term ''Guo Nian'' was derived. Many [[Buddhist]]s abstain from meat consumption on the first day because it is believed to ensure [[longevity]] for them. Some consider lighting fires and using knives to be bad luck on New Year's Day, so all food to be consumed is cooked the days before. On this day, it is considered bad luck to use the broom, as good fortune is not to be \"swept away\" symbolically.\n\nMost importantly, the first day of Chinese New Year is a time to honor one's elders and families visit the oldest and most senior members of their extended families, usually their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents.\n\nFor Buddhists, the first day is also the designated holy day of [[Maitreya]] [[Bodhisattva]] (better known as the more familiar [[Budai|Budai Luohan]]), the Buddha-to-be. People also abstain from killing animals.\n\nSome families may invite a [[lion dance]] troupe as a symbolic ritual to usher in the Chinese New Year as well as to evict bad spirits from the premises. Members of the family who are married also give [[red envelopes]] containing cash known as ''lai see'' (Cantonese dialect) or ''angpow'' (Hokkien, Chaozhou, and Fujian dialects), or ''hongbao'' (Mandarin), a form of blessings and to suppress the aging and challenges associated with the coming year, to junior members of the family, mostly children and teenagers. Business managers also give bonuses through red packets to employees for good luck, smooth-sailing, good health and wealth.\n\nWhile fireworks and firecrackers are traditionally very popular, some regions have banned them due to concerns over fire hazards. For this reason, various city governments (e.g., Kowloon, Beijing, Shanghai for a number of years) issued bans over fireworks and firecrackers in certain precincts of the city. As a substitute, large-scale fireworks display have been launched by governments in such city-states as Hong Kong and Singapore. However, it is a tradition that the indigenous peoples of the [[walled village]]s of [[New Territories]], Hong Kong are permitted to light [[firecrackers]] and launch [[fireworks]] in a limited scale.\n\n===Second day===\n[[File:Incence at grave.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Incense]] is burned at the graves of ancestors as part of the offering and prayer rituals.]]\n\nThe second day of the Chinese New Year, known as \"beginning of the year\" ({{zh|t=\u958b\u5e74|s=\u5f00\u5e74|hp=k\u0101ini\u00e1n|links=no|c=|labels=no}}),<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 40.</ref> was when married daughters visited their birth parents, relatives and close friends. (Traditionally, married daughters didn't have the opportunity to visit their birth families frequently.)\n\nDuring the days of imperial China, \"beggars and other unemployed people circulate[d] from family to family, carrying a picture [of the God of Wealth] shouting, \"''Cai Shen dao''!\" [The God of Wealth has come!].\"<ref>Kong, Shiu L. ''Chinese Culture and Lore''. HK: University of Toronto Press, 1989, p. 48</ref> Householders would respond with \"lucky money\" to reward the messengers. Business people of the Cantonese dialect group will hold a 'Hoi Nin' prayer to start their business on the 2nd day of Chinese New Year so they will be blessed with good luck and prosperity in their business for the year.\n\nAs this day is believed to be [[The Birthday of Che Kung]], a deity worshipped in Hong Kong, worshippers go to [[Che Kung Temple]]s to pray for his blessing. A representative from the government asks [[Che Kung]] about the city's fortune through [[Hong Kong Government Lunar New year kau cim tradition|kau cim]].\n\n===Third day===\nThe third day is known as \"red mouth\" ({{zh|c=\u8d64\u53e3|hp=Ch\u00eck\u01d2u|links=no|s=|t=|labels=no}}). ''Chikou'' is also called \"Chigou's Day\" ({{zh|c=\u8d64\u72d7\u65e5|hp=Ch\u00ecg\u01d2ur\u00ec|links=no|s=|t=|labels=no}}). ''Chigou'', literally \"red dog\", is an epithet of \"the God of Blazing Wrath\" ({{zh|c=\u719b\u6012\u4e4b\u795e|hp=Bi\u0101o n\u00f9 zh\u012b sh\u00e9n|links=no}}). Rural villagers continue the tradition of burning paper offerings over trash fires. It is considered an unlucky day to have guests or go visiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ctps.tp.edu.tw/country/holiday/hldy_b/hldy_b2.htm |title=\u00acK\u00b8' |publisher=.ctps.tp.edu.tw |accessdate=25 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721190459/http://www2.ctps.tp.edu.tw/country/holiday/hldy_b/hldy_b2.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref> Hakka villagers in rural Hong Kong in the 1960s called it the Day of the Poor Devil and believed everyone should stay at home.<ref>Berkowitz and Brandauer, ''Folk Religion in an Urban Setting'', Hong Kong, 1969, p. 49.</ref> This is also considered a propitious day to visit the temple of the God of Wealth and have one's future told.\n\n===Fourth day===\nIn those communities that celebrate Chinese New Year for 15 days, the fourth day is when corporate \"spring dinners\" kick off and business returns to normal. Other areas that have a longer Chinese New Year holiday will celebrate and welcome the gods that were previously sent on this day.\n\n===Fifth day===\nThis day is the god of Wealth's birthday. In northern China, people eat [[jiaozi]], or dumplings, on the morning of ''powu'' ({{zh|c=\u7834\u4e94|hp=p\u00f2w\u01d4|links=no}}). In Taiwan, businesses traditionally re-open on the next day (the sixth day), accompanied by firecrackers.\n\nIt is also common in China that on the 5th day people will shoot off firecrackers to get [[Guan Yu]]'s attention, thus ensuring his favor and good fortune for the new year.<ref name=\"About.com\">{{cite web | url=http://goasia.about.com/od/ChineseNewYear/a/Chinese-New-Year-Traditions.htm | title=Chinese New Year Traditions | publisher=About.com | accessdate=8 February 2013 | author=Rodgers, Greg}}</ref>\n\n===Sixth day===\nThe sixth day is Horse's Day, on which people drive away the Ghost of Poverty by throwing out the garbage stored up during the festival.

The venue will usually be in or near the home of the most senior member of the family. The New Year's Eve dinner is very large and sumptuous and traditionally includes dishes of meat (namely, pork and chicken) and fish. Most reunion dinners also feature a [[communal bowl|communal]] [[hot pot]] as it is believed to signify the coming together of the family members for the meal. Most reunion dinners (particularly in the Southern regions) also prominently feature specialty meats (e.g. wax-cured meats like duck and [[Chinese sausage]]) and seafood (e.g. [[lobster]] and [[abalone]]) that are usually reserved for this and other special occasions during the remainder of the year. In most areas, fish ({{zh|s=\u9c7c|t=\u9b5a|p=y\u00fa|first=|links=no|c=|labels=no}}) is included, but not eaten completely (and the remainder is stored overnight), as the Chinese phrase \"may there be ''surpluses'' every year\" ({{zh|t=\u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918|s=\u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u4f59|p=ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u01d2u y\u00fa|first=|links=no|c=|labels=no}}) sounds the same as \"let there be fish every year.\" Eight individual dishes are served to reflect the belief of good fortune associated with the number. If in the previous year a death was experienced in the family, seven dishes are served.\n\nOther traditional foods consists of noodles, fruits, dumplings, spring rolls, and Tangyuan which are also known as sweet rice balls. Each dish served during Chinese New Year represents something special. The noodles used to make longevity noodles are usually very thin, long wheat noodles. These noodles are longer than normal noodles that are usually fried and served on a plate, or boiled and served in a bowl with its broth. Expectedly, the noodles symbolize the wish for a long life. The fruits that are typically selected would be oranges, tangerines, and pomelos as they are round and \"golden\" color symbolizing fullness and wealth. Their lucky sound when spoken also brings good luck and fortune. The Chinese pronunciation for orange is \u6a59 (ch\u00e9ng /chnng/), which sounds the same as the Chinese for 'success' (\u6210). One of the ways to spell tangerine(\u6854 j\u00fa /jyoo/) contains the Chinese character for luck (\u5409 j\u00ed /jee/). Pomelos is believed to bring constant prosperity. Pomelo in Chinese (\u67da y\u00f2u /yo/) sounds similar to 'to have' (\u6709 y\u01d2u), disregarding its tone, however it sounds exactly like 'again' (\u53c8 y\u00f2u).  Dumplings and spring rolls symbolize wealth, whereas sweet rice balls symbolize family togetherness.\n\n[[Red packet]]s for the immediate family are sometimes distributed during the reunion dinner. These packets contain money in an amount that reflects good luck and honorability. Several foods are consumed to usher in wealth, happiness, and good fortune. Several of the [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese food]] names are homophones for words that also mean good things.\n\nMany places in China still follow the tradition of eating only vegetarian food on the first day of the New year, as it is a sign of peace. So, they believe that eating only vegetarian food the first day will bring joy and peace into their lives for the whole year.\n\nLike many other New Year dishes, certain ingredients also take special precedence over others as these ingredients also have similar-sounding names with prosperity, good luck, or even counting money.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Food item\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Simplified Chinese\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Traditional Chinese\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Hanyu Pinyin\n! style=\"width:50%;\"| Description\n|-\n| [[Buddha's delight]] \n|\u7f57\u6c49\u658b\n|\u7f85\u6f22\u9f4b\n|Lu\u00f3h\u00e0n zh\u0101i|| An elaborate [[Buddhist cuisine|vegetarian dish]] served by Chinese families on the eve and the first day of the New Year.

Red envelopes are then kept under the pillow and slept on for seven nights after Chinese New Year before opening because that symbolizes good luck and fortune.\n\nIn [[Taiwan]] in the 2000s, some employers also gave red packets as a bonus to [[maid]]s, nurses or [[domestic worker]]s from Southeast Asian countries, although whether this is appropriate is controversial.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Ofw chinese new year things to remember\n |publisher    = South East Asia Group [an agency introducing foreign workers to work in Taiwan]\n |url          = http://www.sea.com.tw/word/%B9L%A6~%AA%60%B7N%A8%C6%B6%B5-%B5%E1%A4%E5.pdf\n |archive-url  = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160317045230/http://www.sea.com.tw/word/%B9L%A6~%AA%60%B7N%A8%C6%B6%B5-%B5%E1%A4%E5.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-date = 17 March 2016\n |format       = PDF\n |accessdate   = 29 January 2012\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|script-title=zh:\u5bb6\u5ead\u5916\u50ad\u904e\u5e74\u7fd2\u4fd7\u61c9\u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805\n|publisher=South East Asia Group\n|url=http://seacomtw.pixnet.net/blog/post/41810763\n|language=Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai, English\n|format=JPEG\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn the mid-2010s, Chinese [[messaging app]]s such as [[WeChat]] popularized the distribution of red envelopes in a virtual format via [[mobile payment]]s, usually within [[group chat]]s.<ref name=\"fastco-redpacket\">{{cite web|title=How Social Cash Made WeChat The App For Everything|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money|website=Fast Company|accessdate=4 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103135948/https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money|archive-date=3 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Doug|title=Red envelope wars in China, Xiaomi eyes US|url=http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1715981/red-envelope-wars-china-xiaomi-eyes-us|accessdate=18 February 2015|agency=South China Morning Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218160037/http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1715981/red-envelope-wars-china-xiaomi-eyes-us|archive-date=18 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2017, it was estimated that over 100 billion of these virtual red envelopes would be sent over the New Year holiday.<ref name=\"bbc-virtual\">{{cite web|title=Why this Chinese New Year will be a digital money fest|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38746298|website=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128112533/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38746298|archive-date=28 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-01-13/tencent-alibaba-send-lunar-new-year-revelers-money-hunting-101043798.html|title=Tencent, Alibaba Send Lunar New Year Revelers Money-Hunting|last=|first=|date=13 January 2017|website=Caixin Global|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829072212/https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-01-13/tencent-alibaba-send-lunar-new-year-revelers-money-hunting-101043798.html|archive-date=2018-08-29|access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>\n\n===Gift exchange===\n[[File:Candy Box.jpg|thumb|[[Chinese candy box]]]]\nIn addition to red envelopes, which are usually given from older people to younger people, small gifts (usually food or sweets) are also exchanged between friends or relatives (of different households) during Chinese New Year. Gifts are usually brought when visiting friends or relatives at their homes. Common gifts include fruits (typically oranges, but never trade pears), cakes, biscuits, chocolates, and candies.\n\nCertain items should not be given, as they are considered [[taboo]]. Taboo gifts include:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinese-lessons.com/cantonese/culture1NewYears.htm#gift |title=Chinese Culture: New Years \u2013 Cantonese Culture Notes and Phrases |publisher=chinese-lessons.com |accessdate=4 November 2008 |last=|first=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://randomwire.com/green-hat-a-no-no/ |title=Green Hat a No-No |date=3 December 2009 |author=David}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://chineseculture.about.com/od/chinesefestivals/a/Chinese-Gift-Giving-What-Not-To-Buy.htm |title=Chinese Gift-Giving: What Not to Buy \u2013 Avoid These Chinese Gift-Giving Blunders |first=Lauren |last=Mack |date=27 February 2015 |publisher=About.com |accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n* items associated with [[funerals]] (i.e. handkerchiefs, towels, [[chrysanthemums]], items colored white and black)\n* items that show that time is running out (i.e. clocks and watches)\n* sharp objects that symbolize cutting a tie (i.e. scissors and knives)\n* items that symbolize that you want to walk away from a relationship (examples: shoes and sandals)\n* mirrors\n* [[homonyms]] for unpleasant topics (examples: \"clock\" sounds like \"the funeral ritual\", green hats because \"wear a green hat\" sounds like \"[[cuckold]]\", \"handkerchief\" sounds like \"goodbye\", \"pear\" sounds like \"separate\", and \"umbrella\" sounds like \"disperse\").\n\n===Markets===\nMarkets or village fairs are set up as the New Year is approaching. These usually open-air markets feature new year related products such as flowers, toys, clothing, and even fireworks and firecrackers. It is convenient for people to buy gifts for their new year visits as well as their home decorations. In some places, the practice of shopping for the perfect [[Prunus mume|plum tree]] is not dissimilar to the Western tradition of buying a [[Christmas tree]].\n\n[[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong filmmakers]] also release \"New Year celebration films\" ({{zh|t=\u8cc0\u6b72\u7247|s=|p=|first=t|links=no|c=|labels=yes}}), mostly comedies, at this time of year.\n\n===Fireworks===\n[[File:Chinesenewyearfireworkman.jpg|thumb|A Chinese man setting off fireworks during Chinese New Year in Shanghai.]]\nBamboo stems filled with gunpowder that was burnt to create small explosions were once used in ancient China to drive away evil spirits. In modern times, this method has eventually evolved into the use of [[firecrackers]] during the festive season. Firecrackers are usually strung on a long fused string so it can be hung down. Each firecracker is rolled up in red papers, as red is auspicious, with gunpowder in its core. Once ignited, the firecracker lets out a loud popping noise and, as they are usually strung together by the hundreds, the firecrackers are known for their deafening explosions that are thought to scare away evil spirits. The burning of firecrackers also signifies a joyful time of year and has become an integral aspect of Chinese New Year celebrations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/sip_749_2005-01-11.html |title=Firecrackers |publisher=Infopedia.nlb.gov.sg |date=15 April 1999 |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> Since the 2000s, firecrackers have been banned in various countries and towns.\n\n===Music===\n\"''Happy New Year!''\" ({{zh|c=\u65b0\u5e74\u597d\u5440|hp=X\u012bn Ni\u00e1n H\u01ceo Ya|l=New Year's Good, Ya|links=no}}) is a popular children's song for the New Year holiday.<ref name=\"eChineseLearning\">{{cite web |url=http://resources.echineselearning.com/kids/kids-chinese-496.html |title=\u65b0\u5e74\u597d (x\u012bnni\u00e1nh\u01ceo) Happy New Year |publisher=eChineseLearning.com |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> The melody is similar to the American [[Western music (North America)|folk song]], ''[[Oh My Darling, Clementine]]''.\n\n*Chorus:\n: Happy New Year!

During the New Year holidays, the stage boss gathers the most popular actors whom from various troupes let them perform [[Repertoire|repertories]] from [[Qing dynasty]]. Nowadays people prefer celebrating the new year with their family by watching these movies together.\n\n===Clothing===\n[[File:Red girls (121513100).jpg|thumb|right|Girls dressed in red (Hong Kong).]]\nThe color red is commonly worn throughout Chinese New Year; traditional beliefs held that red could scare away evil spirits and bad fortune. The wearing of new clothes is another clothing custom during the festival, the new clothes symbolize a new beginning in the year, and enough things to use and wear in this time.\n\n===Family portrait===\nIn some places, the taking of a [[Portrait photography|family portrait]] is an important ceremony after the relatives are gathered. The photo is taken at the hall of the house or taken in front of the house. The most senior male head of the family sits in the center.\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{see also|Fu character}}\n[[File:FuDao.jpg|thumb|right|An inverted character ''fu'' is a sign of arriving blessings.]]\n\nAs with all cultures, Chinese New Year traditions incorporate elements that are symbolic of deeper meaning. One common example of Chinese New Year symbolism is the red [[diamond]]-shaped ''[[fu character]]s'' ({{zh|c=\u798f|hp=f\u00fa|cy=fuk1|l=blessings, happiness|links=no}}), which are displayed on the entrances of Chinese homes. This sign is usually seen hanging upside down, since the Chinese word ''dao'' ({{zh|c=\u5012|hp=d\u00e0o|l=upside down|links=no}}), is [[homophone|homophonous]] or nearly homophonous with ({{zh|c=\u5230|hp=d\u00e0o|l=arrive|links=no}}) in all [[varieties of Chinese]]. Therefore, it symbolizes the arrival of luck, happiness, and prosperity.\n\nFor the [[Cantonese]]-speaking people, if the ''fu'' sign is hung upside down, the implied ''dao'' (upside down) sounds like the Cantonese word for \"pour\", producing \"pour the luck [away]\", which would usually symbolize bad luck; this is why the ''fu'' character is not usually hung upside-down in Cantonese communities.\n\nRed is the predominant color used in New Year celebrations. Red is the emblem of joy, and this color also symbolizes virtue, truth and sincerity. On the Chinese opera stage, a painted red face usually denotes a sacred or loyal personage and sometimes a great emperor. Candies, cakes, decorations and many things associated with the New Year and its ceremonies are colored red. The sound of the Chinese word for \"red\" ({{zh|t=\u7d05|s=\u7ea2|hp=h\u00f3ng|cy=hung4|links=no}}) is in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] homophonous with the word for \"prosperous.\" Therefore, red is an auspicious color and has an auspicious sound.\nAccording to Chinese tradition, the year of the pig is a generally unlucky year for the public, which is why you need to reevaluate most of your decisions before you reach a conclusion. However, this only helps you get even more control over your life as you learn to stay ahead of everything by being cautious.<ref>https://askastrology.com/year-of-the-pig/</ref>\n\n===Nianhua===\n[[File:ChineseNewYearBoston01.jpg|thumb|upright|Chinese New Year festival in [[Chinatown, Boston]]]]\n\nNianhua can be a form of Chinese colored woodblock printing, for decoration during Chinese New Year.<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite web |url=http://jds.cass.cn/Item/5606.aspx |title=The Boxer Rebellion, 1900: A Selection of Books, Prints and Photographs |last=Wood |first=Frances |publisher=British Library |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Flowers===\nThe following are popular floral decorations for the New Year and are available at new year markets.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Floral Decor ||Meaning\n|-\n|[[Plum Blossom]] || symbolizes luckiness\n|-\n|[[Kumquat]] || symbolizes prosperity\n|-\n|[[Calamondin]]\n|Symbolizes luck\n|-\n|[[Narcissus (genus)|Narcissus]] || symbolizes prosperity\n|-\n|[[Bamboo]] || a plant used for any time of year\n|-\n|[[Sunflower]] || means to have a good year\n|-\n|[[Eggplant]] ||a plant to heal all of your sicknesses\n|-\n|[[Sandersonia|Chom Mon Plant]] || a plant which gives you tranquility\n|}\n\n===Icons and ornaments===\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Icons || Meaning || Illustrations\n|-\n| '''[[Lantern]]s''' || These lanterns that differ from those of [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] in general.

In modern China, migrant workers in China travel home to have [[reunion dinner]]s with their families on Chinese New Year's Eve. Owing to a large number of interprovincial travelers, special arrangements were made by [[Passenger rail transport in China|railways]], buses and airlines starting from 15 days before the New Year's Day. This 40-day period is called [[chunyun]], and is known as the world's largest annual migration.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7813267.stm China's holiday rush begins early], BBC</ref> More interurban trips are taken in mainland China in this period than the total population of China.\n\nIn Taiwan, spring travel is also a major event. The majority of transportation in western Taiwan is in a north\u2013south direction: long distance travel between urbanized north and hometowns in the rural south. Transportation in eastern Taiwan and that between Taiwan and its islands is less convenient. Cross-strait flights between Taiwan and mainland China began in 2003 as part of [[Three Links]], mostly for \"Taiwanese businessmen\" to return to Taiwan for the new year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/01/07/2003522653 |date=7 January 2012 |title=Ministry warns of heavy Lunar New Year holiday traffic |author=Shan, Shelley |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] }}\n{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/01/25/2003523974 |date=25 January 2012 |title=Despite rain, millions hit the road |author=Lee, I-chia |newspaper=Taipei Times }}\n{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/01/29/2003524165 |date=29 January 2012 |title=Early start beats tolls and congestion as the holiday ends |author=Lee, I-chia |quote=... total traffic volume on Friday was 2.7&nbsp; million vehicles, about 1.7 times the average daily traffic volume of about 1.6&nbsp; million. \"We estimate the total traffic volume [yesterday] was between 2.1&nbsp; million and 2.3&nbsp; million vehicles,\" Chen said. \"Northbound traffic volume was much higher than southbound and peak hours were between 3&nbsp; pm and 6&nbsp; pm.\" |newspaper=Taipei Times}}</ref>\n\n==Festivities outside Greater China==\n[[File:2016 Singapur, Downtown Core, River Hongbao 2016 (43).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Decorations on the occasion of Chinese New Year - River Hongbao 2016, [[Singapore]]]]\nChinese New Year is also celebrated annually in many countries with significant Chinese populations.

In 1849, with the discovery of gold and the ensuing [[California Gold Rush]], over 50,000 people had come to San Francisco to seek their fortune or just a better way of life.

By the 1860s, the residents of [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]] were eager to share their culture with their fellow San Francisco residents who may have been unfamiliar with (or hostile towards) it. The organizers chose to showcase their culture by using a favorite American tradition \u2013 the [[parade]].

New Year couplets printed in gold letters on bright red paper, referred to as ''chunlian'' (\u6625\u806f) or ''[[fai chun]]'' (\u63ee\u6625), is another way of expressing auspicious new year wishes. They probably predate the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644), but did not become widespread until then.<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 20.</ref> Today, they are ubiquitous with Chinese New Year.\n\nSome of the most common greetings include:\n*'''Xin nian kuai le''': {{zh|s=\u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u4e50|t=\u65b0\u5e74\u5feb\u6a02|p=X\u012bnni\u00e1nku\u00e0il\u00e8|poj= Sin-n\u00ee kh\u00f2ai-lo\u030dk|j=san1 nin4 faai3 lok6}}; [[Hakka]]: Sin Ngen Kai Lok; [[Taishanese]]: Slin Nen Fai Lok.

While the first two words of this phrase had a much longer historical significance (legend has it that the congratulatory messages were traded for surviving the ravaging beast of ''[[Nian]]'', in practical terms it may also have meant surviving the harsh winter conditions), the last two words were added later as ideas of capitalism and [[consumerism]] became more significant in Chinese societies around the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The saying is now commonly heard in English speaking communities for greetings during Chinese New Year in parts of the world where there is a sizable Chinese-speaking community, including [[overseas Chinese]] communities that have been resident for several generations, relatively recent immigrants from [[Greater China]], and those who are transit migrants (particularly students).\n\nNumerous other greetings exist, some of which may be exclaimed out loud to no one in particular in specific situations. For example, as breaking objects during the new year is considered inauspicious, one may then say \u6b72\u6b72\u5e73\u5b89 (''Su\u00ecsu\u00ec-p\u00edng'\u0101n'') immediately, which means \"everlasting peace year after year\". ''Su\u00ec'' (\u6b72), meaning \"age\" is homophonous with \u788e (su\u00ec) (meaning \"shatter\"), in the demonstration of the Chinese love for wordplay in auspicious phrases. Similarly, \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u9918 (''ni\u00e1nni\u00e1n y\u01d2u y\u00fa''), a wish for surpluses and bountiful harvests every year, plays on the word ''y\u00fa'' that can also refer to \u9b5a (y\u00fa meaning fish), making it a catch phrase for fish-based Chinese new year dishes and for paintings or graphics of fish that are hung on walls or presented as gifts.\n\nThe most common auspicious greetings and sayings consist of four characters, such as the following:\n*\u91d1\u7389\u6eff\u5802 ''J\u012bny\u00f9m\u01cent\u00e1ng''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May your wealth [gold and jade] come to fill a hall\"\n*\u5927\u5c55\u9d3b\u5716 ''D\u00e0zh\u01cenh\u00f3ngt\u00fa''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May you realize your ambitions\"\n*\u8fce\u6625\u63a5\u798f ''Y\u00edngch\u00fanji\u0113f\u00fa''&nbsp;\u2013 \"Greet the New Year and encounter happiness\"\n*\u842c\u4e8b\u5982\u610f ''W\u00e0nsh\u00ecr\u00fay\u00ec''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May all your wishes be fulfilled\"\n*\u5409\u6176\u6709\u9918 ''J\u00edq\u00ecngy\u01d2uy\u00fa''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May your happiness be without limit\"\n*\u7af9\u5831\u5e73\u5b89 ''Zh\u00fab\u00e0op\u00edng'\u0101n''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May you hear [in a letter] that all is well\"\n*\u4e00\u672c\u842c\u5229 ''Y\u012bb\u011bnw\u00e0nl\u00ec''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May a small investment bring ten-thousandfold profits\"\n*\u798f\u58fd\u96d9\u5168 ''F\u00fash\u00f2ushu\u0101ngqu\u00e1n''&nbsp;\u2013 \"May your happiness and longevity be complete\"\n*\u62db\u8ca1\u9032\u5bf6 ''Zh\u0101oc\u00e1ij\u00ecnb\u01ceo''&nbsp;\u2013 \"When wealth is acquired, precious objects follow\"<ref>Welch, Patricia Bjaaland, p. 22</ref>\n\nThese greetings or phrases may also be used just before children receive their red packets, when gifts are exchanged, when visiting temples, or even when tossing the shredded ingredients of [[yusheng]] particularly popular in Malaysia and Singapore. Children and their parents can also pray in the temple, in hopes of getting good blessings for the new year to come.\n\nChildren and teenagers sometimes jokingly use the phrase \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u7d05\u5305\u62ff\u4f86 (in Traditional Chinese; Simplified Chinese: \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22\uff0c\u7ea2\u5305\u62ff\u6765; [[Pinyin]]: g\u014dngx\u01d0f\u0101c\u00e1i, h\u00f3ngb\u0101o n\u00e1l\u00e1i; Cantonese: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86; Jyutping: gung1 hei2 faat3 coi4, lei6 si6 dau6 loi4), roughly translated as \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope!\". In [[Hakka]] the saying is more commonly said as 'Gung hee fatt choi, hung bao diu loi' which would be written as \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u7d05\u5305\u9017\u4f86 \u2013 a mixture of the Cantonese and Mandarin variants of the saying.\n\nBack in the 1960s, children in Hong Kong used to say \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86,\u6597\u96f6\u5514\u611b (Cantonese, Gung Hei Fat Choy, Lai Si Tau Loi, Tau Ling M Ngoi), which was recorded in the pop song [[Kowloon Hong Kong]] by [[Reynettes]] in 1966. Later in the 1970s, children in Hong Kong used the saying: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86,\u4f0d\u6beb\u5acc\u5c11,\u58f9\u868a\u5514\u611b (Cantonese), roughly translated as, \"Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope, fifty cents is too little, don't want a dollar either.\" It basically meant that they disliked small change \u2013 coins which were called \"hard substance\" (Cantonese: \u786c\u5622). Instead, they wanted \"soft substance\" (Cantonese: \u8edf\u5622), which was either a ten dollar or a twenty dollar note.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Overseas Chinese]]\n*[[Lunar New Year fireworks display in Hong Kong]]\n*[[The Birthday of Che Kung]]\n*Other celebrations of Lunar New Year in China:\n** [[Losar|Tibetan New Year]] ''(Losar)''\n** [[Tsagaan Sar|Mongolian New Year]] ''(Tsagaan Sar)''\n*Celebrations of Lunar New Year in other parts of Asia:\n** [[Korean New Year]] ''(Seollal)''\n** [[Japanese New Year]] ''(Sh\u014dgatsu)''\n** [[Tsagaan Sar|Mongolian New Year]] ''(Tsagaan Sar)''\n** [[T\u1ebft|Vietnamese New Year]] ''(T\u1ebft)''\n*Similar Asian Lunisolar New Year celebrations that occur in April:\n**[[Thingyan|Burmese New Year]] ''(Thingyan)''\n**[[Cambodian New Year]] ''(Chaul Chnam Thmey)''\n**[[Songkran (Lao)|Lao New Year]] ''(Pii Mai)''\n**[[Sinhalese New Year|Sri Lankan New Year]] ''(Aluth Avuruddu)''\n**[[Songkran (Thailand)|Thai New Year]] ''(Songkran)''\n* Chinese New Year Gregorian Holiday in Malaysia\n**Malaysia Chinese New Year ''(Tahun Baru Cina)''\n**Indonesian Chinese New Year ''(Imlek)''\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Welch|first= Patricia Bjaaland |year=1997|title= Chinese New Year|url=https://archive.org/details/chinesenewyear00welc|url-access=registration|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{PRC Holidays}}\n{{Hong Kong Holidays}}\n{{Public holidays in Indonesia}}\n{{Public holidays in Malaysia}}\n{{Public holidays in Singapore}}\n{{Public holidays in Thailand}}\n{{Public holidays in the Philippines}}\n{{Chinese New Year}}\n{{Portal bar|China|Holidays}}\n\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Buddhist holidays]]\n[[Category:Chinese New Year]]\n[[Category:Chinese-Australian culture]]\n[[Category:New Year celebrations]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in China]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Singapore]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Observances set by the Chinese calendar]]\n[[Category:Winter events in China]]\n", "name_user": "Carrosgmktg", "label": "safe", "comment": "Updated links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year"}
