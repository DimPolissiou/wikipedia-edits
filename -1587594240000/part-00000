A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref>ICON, (2006). Care and Conservation of Clocks. Retrieved from: \thttps://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf </ref>. [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\n==== Condition checks ====\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Environmental Conditions ===\n\n'''Incorrect Relative Humidity'''\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.  High humidity can cause warping, rotting, mold and fungus to the wood clock and can corrode the metal pieces of the clock. Wood clock must be kept in climate-controlled rooms for optimal preservation. A humidity ranges between 35%-60% is optimal for wood clock. \n\nIncorrect relative humidity can cause the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n'''Incorrect Temperature'''\n\nThe amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON />\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates wood clocks may be stored in, can rapidly deteriorate the condition of the wood. Moderate temperatures in the range of 68 to 75 (f) degrees is recommended. \n\nIncorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n'''Pests'''\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n'''Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet'''\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n\n'''Pollutants'''\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\nContaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Types of clock damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]].

Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref>ICON, (2006). Care and Conservation of Clocks. Retrieved from: \thttps://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf </ref>. [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\n==== Condition checks ====\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Environmental Conditions ===\n\n'''Incorrect Relative Humidity'''\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.  High humidity can cause warping, rotting, mold and fungus to the wood clock and can corrode the metal pieces of the clock. Wood clock must be kept in climate-controlled rooms for optimal preservation. A humidity ranges between 35%-60% is optimal for wood clock. \n\nIncorrect relative humidity can cause the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n'''Incorrect Temperature'''\n\nThe amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON />\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates wood clocks may be stored in, can rapidly deteriorate the condition of the wood. Moderate temperatures in the range of 68 to 75 (f) degrees is recommended. \n\nIncorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n'''Pests'''\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n'''Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet'''\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n\n'''Pollutants'''\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\n:Contaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Types of clock damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]].

Two years earlier, Middletown had granted the site to the State for the establishment of an asylum to accommodate Connecticut's mentally ill. By 1896, four groups of buildings had been erected and the institution was one of the largest of its kind in the country.\n\nThe site is still used as a psychiatric care facility, operated by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The State has indicated that it wishes to demolish up to 24 buildings on the campus.\n\n==Facilities==\n\nLocated in the South Farms district, Connecticut Valley Hospital consists of a large concentration of early and contemporary buildings. The site, landscaped with broad lawns and large shade trees, is at the top of a hill and offers panoramic views of the city. Silver Street and Bow Lane pass thorough the property which is bordered by Eastern Drive, to the west. Small drives, leading from these streets, traverse the property's grounds.<ref name=\"nrhpinv3\"/>\n\nThe hospital consists of approximately eighty structures complemented by {{convert|650|acre|km2}} south and east of the main site. It includes large institutional buildings constructed of brick and brownstone, frame and brick residences, and a number of maintenance buildings. The majority of these form a large group centered on Shew Hall. This site contains approximately 200 acres. It comprises many distinctive structures that evidence different periods of the institution's development.<ref name=\"nrhpinv3\"/>\n\nShew Hall, the original hospital structure, was built in 1867. It functions as the administrative building and is the focal point of the institution. This large structure is named in honor of the hospital's first superintendent, Dr. Abram M. Shew. Designed by [[Addison Hutton]] of Philadelphia, it was constructed in the [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] style. The building was remodeled in 1939, when the interior was updated and a flat roof bordered by a parapet was installed on the main section. The three large wings display mansard roofs and details that are indicative of the main section's former appearance.<ref name=\"nrhpinv3\"/>\n\nStanley Hall, built around 1879, was also designed in the [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] style. It was the hospital's maximum security facility in prior years.<ref name=\"nrhpinv3\"/> Stanley Hall was dismantled and removed some time after 1999.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nWoodward Hall, erected around 1886, is in the Queen Anne style.<ref name=\"nrhpinv3\"/> It has an irregular profile that is accentuated by many ells.

The Queen Anne style section of Woodward Hall was torn down in 2007, and there are tentative plans to develop a garden where it once stood. The \"newer\" section of Woodward Hall (built in the early 20th century at the same time Weeks Hall was built) still stands and houses the geriatric wards.\n\nWeeks Hall, built in 1896, was also constructed in the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] and, in addition, had features that suggested the influence of the [[Jacobethan Revival]].

The book is an indirect sequel to Shirky's ''[[Here Comes Everybody]]'', which covered the impact of [[social media]]. ''Cognitive Surplus'' focuses on describing the free time that individuals have to engage with collaborative activities within [[new media]]. Shirky's text searches to prove that global transformation can come from individuals committing their time to active engagement with technology. Overall response has been mixed with some critics praising Shirky's insights but also decrying some of the shortcomings of his theory.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Clay Shirky]] has long been interested in and published works concerning the Internet and its impact on society.  He currently works at [[New York University]], where he \"has been making the case that the Internet is an inherently participatory and social medium\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2010/12/07/new-media-expert-clay-shirky-to-become-professor-at-nyus-carter-journalism-institute-tisch-school-of-the-arts.html |title=New Media Expert Clay Shirky to Become Professor at NYU's Carter Journalism Institute, Tisch School of the Arts |last=Devitt |first=James |date=7 December 2010 |website=NYU News |publisher=New York University |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nShirky wrote this book two years after its prequel, ''[[Here Comes Everybody]]'', which relates to the topics of the Internet and organization of people, was published.  In it, Shirky argues that \u201cAs the Internet radically reduces the costs of collective action for everyone, it will transform the relationship between ordinary individuals and the large, hierarchical institutions that were a dominant force in 20th-century societies\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/features/2008/04/book-review-2008-04-1/ |title=Ars Book Review: \"Here Comes Everybody\" by Clay Shirky |website=Ars Technica |access-date=2016-02-23}}</ref> This transformation of relationships between individuals is a concept Shirky builds on in ''Cognitive Surplus''.   A central concern Shirky had in mind when writing it was in illuminating the difference between communal and civic values, and how the Internet is a vehicle for both. In particular, he was interested in showing \u201ceffusions of people pooling their spare time and talent\u201d and showing how we can create a culture \u201cthat celebrates the creation of civic value\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/43565-here-comes-clay-shirky.html |title=Here Comes Clay Shirky |website=PublishersWeekly.com |access-date=2016-02-23}}</ref>\n\nShirky has stated that he is interested in exploring \"the changes in the way people collaborate\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-disruptive-power-of-collaboration-an-interview-with-clay-shirky |title=The disruptive power of collaboration: An interview with Clay Shirky |website=McKinsey & Company |access-date=2016-02-23}}</ref> that are spurred on by technology and new media, and these changes are a large part of what ''Cognitive Surplus'' is devoted to examining.

While Shirky acknowledges that the activities that we use our cognitive surplus for may be frivolous (such as creating [[LOLcats]]),<ref name=\"independent\">{{Cite news |last=Walker |first=Tim |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/cognitive-surplus-by-clay-shirky-2027393.html |title=Cognitive Surplus, By Clay Shirky |date=July 16, 2010 |work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> the trend as a whole is leading to valuable and influential new forms of human expression. These forms of human collaboration that he argues the Internet provides take the form of four categories of varying degrees of value:  personal, communal, public, and civic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |url=https://archive.org/details/cognitivesurplus00shir_1/page/171 |title=Cognitive Surplus |publisher=Penguin Group |year=2010 |isbn=9781594202537 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cognitivesurplus00shir_1/page/171 171\u2013175]}}</ref> Shirky argues that while all of these are legitimate uses of \"cognitive surplus,\" the civic value (the power to actually change society) that social media provides is what should be celebrated about the Internet.\n\n===Chapter summaries===\n====''Gin, Television, and Cognitive Surplus'' ====\nShirky introduces the [[Gin Craze]] as an older version of a modern-day concern. Gin offered its consumers the ability to fall apart a little bit at a time.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |url=https://archive.org/details/cognitivesurplus00shir_1/page/1 |title=Cognitive Surplus |publisher=Penguin Group |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-59420-253-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cognitivesurplus00shir_1/page/1 1]}}</ref> He relates this to how society today deals with free time in relation to technology. Since the Second World War, increases in [[GDP]], educational attainment, and life span have forced industrialized world to grapple with something we'd never had to deal with on a national scale: free time.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shirky |first=Shirky |title=Cognitive Surplus |publisher=Penguin Group |page=4}}</ref> He claims that the [[sitcom]], along with other technology and social media, has become the modern day Gin Craze. Something that makes today remarkable is that we can treat free time as a general social asset that can be harnessed for large, communally created projects. Society never knows what to do with a surplus at first (hence \u201csurplus\u201d). The \"Milkshake Mistake\" is the idea that it is a mistake to look at the meaning of or potential of something by looking at the history and original purpose of a product (such as drinking milkshakes for breakfast). Shirky says we do this when thinking about media. The use of technology is much less determined by the tool/medium itself; when we use a network, the most important asset we get is access to one another. [[Ushahidi]] was one of the first examples of a program in response to this surplus of free time being used for a greater good (cognitive surplus). It was a service developed to help citizens track outbreaks of ethnic violence in Kenya. It grew to a bigger and better at reporting over a wide geographical area as a result of cognitive surplus. It brought people together to carve out enough collective good-will from the community to create resources that no one could have imagined years ago.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |title=Cognitive Surplus |publisher=Penguin Group |page=17}}</ref> Along with good-will acts, people with a surplus of free time also engage in the use of creativity ( [[I Can Has Cheezburger?|ICanHasCheezburger]]). Cognitive surplus, newly forced from previously disconnected island of time and talent, is just raw material. To get any value out of it, Shirky says, we have to make it mean something or be useful. We collectively aren't just a source of the surplus; we are also the people designing its use by our participation and by the things we expect of one another as we wrestle together with our new connectedness.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |title=Cognitive Surplus |publisher=Penguin Group |page=29}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Means'' ====\nIn the second chapter, Shirky discusses the impact of media on the personal lives of civilians, companies, and governments. Throughout the text, Shirky references the [[2008 US beef protest in South Korea|2008 Beef Revolts]] in South Korea and how they came about since they were led by [[K-pop]] fan girls. Shirky also referenced [[PickupPal]] and the tension between it and bus company Tentway-Wagar, who complained about the latter to the OHTB. Shirky discusses the publishing button and whether or not should exist since now anyone can publish. He references [[Naomi Wolf]]\u2019s ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'' and [[Harvey Swados]] and uses them as part of his argument. He also brings up ICanHasCheezeBurger, [[YouTube]], and [[AOL]] as well, all of which are platforms that anyone can use. Shirky compares all of this to the fifteenth century invention of the [[Printing press]] and also lists other forms of life changing media, including [[photographic plates]], [[CDs]], [[Radio]], and [[Television]].\n\n==== ''Motive'' ====\nIn the third chapter, Shirky explains that the means are platforms, tools, or systems we use that allow us to connect, learn, and share. The combination of time, place, and people which enable us to share and take action, is the opportunity. Shirky discusses the types of motivations that a person who shares would consider. Intrinsic motivations, which Shirky summarizes as a need for 1) increased competence, 2) autonomy over what we do, 3) membership of a group who share our values and beliefs, 4) the sharing of things with that group. Then, extrinsic motivations, like reward and recognition or punishment for certain behaviors. These motivations could also be classified into personal and social motivations. Social motivations include membership and sharing, while personal motivations include competence and autonomy. With the evidence from [[Benkler]] and [[Helen Nissenbaum|Nissenbaum]], it is concluded that social motivations reinforce personal ones. With the tools of today, we see many new groups; most of them large, public, and amateur groups. The goal for these groups is more about scope rather than size. The use of this public access media is to reach audiences that are ''like'' the group. Sharers have always had the same interests-or motivations- it is the opportunity that has changed them, and the ability to connect, share, and learn easily.\n\n==== ''Opportunity'' ====\nIn the fourth chapter, Shirky explores how means and motives alone cannot explain new uses for our cognitive surplus, explaining that we take the opportunities made available to us. He argues that we often discover unconventional routes to benefit society. Shirky cites examples such as the elderly adopting the [[Internet]] as new means for communication and skateboarders adapting drained swimming pools into skating ramps. The narrative about the drought-stricken pools proved an important point: the intended capabilities of something do not necessarily determine its functions. He goes on to discuss the [[Ultimatum game]], in which a proposer and responder are given the task of splitting ten dollars. According to [[behavioral economics]], proposers should always propose a split that heavily favors them and the responder should always accept it, because no matter how small their share is, there is still a gain. In practice, however, proposers tend to offer fair deals and responders tend to reject unfair proposals. On some level, we always feel we are in a social situation and will either treat each other fairly or punish those who do not. According to Shirky, this is why what he describes as the [[Public sector]] is so popular; it is designed to enrich society without any monetary incentive. In the public sector, digital networks connect people worldwide and give amateurs the opportunity to share their thoughts and work when they normally couldn't. There are no [[gatekeepers]] on the [[Internet]]; innovation is actively encouraged and younger generations in a changing environment can find their voice there.\n\n==== ''Culture'' ====\nThe fifth chapter is broken up into four parts, ''Culture as a Coordinating Tool'', ''The Economics of Sharing'', ''College Professors and Brain Surgeons'', and ''Patients Like Us''.  The first section of the chapter discusses an experiment that appeared in a paper published in the ''[[Journal of Legal Studies]]'', written by [[Uri Gneezy]] and Aldo Rustichini.  The experiment demonstrates the backfiring of an attempt to regulate group collaboration; when attempting to do so by ascribing monetary values to people's time, a community will then begin to view people who provide services as the service itself rather than as individuals.  This emphasizes Shirky's point that group collaboration is essential to its prosperity and functionality.  Another example he uses is [[The Invisible College]], an example of collaboration that resulted in a monumental scientific advancements because of the sense of a shared purpose.  Unlike the alchemists of their time, The Invisible College shared information with each other in order to further the field rather than claim individual advancements as their own.  Later Shirky emphasizes the sense of [[belongingness|belonging]] that is an intricate part of this group culture.  In his brain surgeon analogy he discusses the values of a [[professional]] versus an [[amateur]], and that while in the case of the brain surgeon people prefer the professional, this is not always the case; for instance, in cases such as food critics, people tend to prefer an outlet where ordinary people give their opinions.  He likens to the distinction between the services offered by a prostitute (professional at their craft) versus the intimacy between partners, demonstrating that a sense of belonging is often held in a higher regard than skill.  This sense of belonging opens up a new discussion with the example of patientslikeme.com in which patients of similar diseases can openly discuss their ailments and feel comfort in knowing that they are not the only ones experiencing it.  Furthermore, it allows researchers to collaborate with patients.  Thus demonstrating that social media platforms can be used to enhance this nature of belonging in culture, but can also produce real civic value.\n\n==== ''Personal, Communal, Public, Civic'' ====\nIn the sixth chapter, Shirky outlines the variations in the forms of sharing and the types of value that result. He argues that there are four main values: personal, communal, public, and civic. Personal value deals with the efforts of singular agents sharing ideas on a whim.  Communal value is sharing in a small group that serves the interests of the group members collaborating.  Public value deals with groups that share in order to produce projects that serve people outside of the group.  Civic value is when groups collaborate on a project that serves to benefit society at large.  Point being that value is determined on who is involved and the intended benefactors of their efforts and level of cooperation that is upheld amongst the group, and that ultimately cognitive surplus is the driving factor behind such efforts.  The impact of the efforts can be as minuscule (personal) as sharing a selfie with the world, to [[Hashtags]] that are created to garner large followings and support to the issues that can change the world.\n\n==== ''Looking for the Mouse'' ====\nIn the seventh and final chapter, Shirky starts to work towards his conclusion of how his novel is a resource and how society may utilize it. He references the happenings of the [[Post-World War II]] era and the resulting transformation that society endured. Shirky notes from [[Steve Weber]]\u2019s book ''The Success of Open Source'' that lesser costs nor technical quality are worthy explanations for why someone would collaborate on an open source project. Shirky states that there is a paradox in revolution in which is the result of someone being able to change the future of a previously-existing society. He also references other media that revolutionized human conversation, stating that [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]], a computer system that existed in the 1960s, was the ancestor of today's electronic devices. He also shares with his readers that [[SixDegrees.com|SixDegrees]] was the first social networking website, not Facebook and Friendster as everyone had previously thought. He makes several recommendations to his readers, some of them being that to know that it's impractical to start complex, start small, ask questions, and note that behavior is in pursuit of opportunity.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe negative criticisms largely address the issue of negative uses of cognitive surplus.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} For example, Shirky discusses ''lolcats'' in the book, but this is a pretty innocuous example of negative or trite uses of cognitive surplus, especially considering the reality of [[Cybercrime|cyber crimes]], and other far more drastically negative uses. The main criticism of Shirky is that he is not realistic about the many possible ways we might waste this cognitive surplus, or worse, the many terrible ways it can and is being used for destructive and criminal activities, for example the [[Jihadism|global Jihadist movement]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} On the positive side, Shirky is praised for explaining the potential opportunities we can harness. He shows us effectively that we can not only make better use of our time, but also, that technology enables us to do so in a way that maximizes our ability to share and communicate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Positive===\nOne critic [[Russell Davies]] writes, \"There are revealing thoughts in every chapter and they're particularly important for people trying to do business on the internet, because they shed light on some fundamental motivations and forces that we often miss or misconstrue,\".<ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=Russell|title=The Web's Fusion of Public and Private Media Confuses Us.|journal=Campaign|date=2010|issue=21}}</ref>  Sorin Adam Matei of [[Purdue University]], [[West Lafayette, Indiana|West Lafayette]] writes, \"Despite shortcomings, ''Cognitive Surplus'' remains overall a very well-written and generally well-informed contribution to our discussion about the social effects of [[social media]].

Davies says Shirky elucidated the personal/public media distinction \"That explains a lot to me. It's obvious when you read it but failing to grasp the fused state of public/personal media is responsible for a lot of the things we get wrong online. We often take it to be a commercial, public media space (and we always seem to be looking for another small group of professionals out there to deal with) - but it's not just that. Things that are perfectly appropriate in public media just don't work in personal media. You wouldn't steam open people's letters and insert magazines ads, but that's sometimes how we seem to behave.\" <ref name=\"Davies\" />\nUpon its release, ''Cognitive Surplus'' was praised by Tom Chatfield of ''[[The Guardian]]'' and James Harkin of ''[[Financial Times|The Financial Times]]'' who both are complimentary of Shirkey's depiction of the Internet and its effect on society.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/27/cognitive-surplus-clay-shirky-book-review |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 27, 2010 |last=Chatfield |first=Tom |title=Cognitive Surplus by Clay Shirky }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3a655a9a-8564-11df-aa2e-00144feabdc0.html |work=[[The Financial Times]] |date=July 5, 2010 |last=Harkin |first=James |title=Cognitive Surplus }}</ref>\n\n===Negative===\nHis approach has been criticized by [[Farhad Manjoo]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' for being too academic and for [[Wiktionary:cheerleading|cheerleading]] positive examples of the online use of cognitive surplus.<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/books/review/Manjoo-t.html |title=When the Screen Goes Blank |last=Manjoo |first=Farhad |authorlink=Farhad Manjoo |work=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |date=August 8, 2010 }}</ref> Similarly, Lehmann describes it as \"the latest, monotonous installment in the sturdy tradition of exuberant web yay-saying.\"  <ref name=\"Lehmann\" />\n\nLehmann's review compares the contradictions Shirky makes in his argument about quality being democratized to hailing \"a cascade of unrefereed digital content as a breakthrough in creativity and critical thought is roughly akin to greeting news of a massive national egg recall by laying off the country's food inspectors.\"<ref name=\"Lehmann\">{{cite journal|last1=Lehmann|first1=Chris|title=An Accelerated Grimace|journal=The Nation|date=March 21, 2011|pages=30\u201335|url=http://bs6vx4ge6d.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=An+Accelerated+Grimace&rft.jtitle=The+Nation&rft.au=Chris+Lehmann&rft.date=2011-03-21&rft.pub=Nation+Company+L.P&rft.issn=0027-8378&rft.volume=292&rft.issue=12&rft.spage=30&rft.externalDocID=2307026721&paramdict=en-US|accessdate=18 February 2016}}</ref> Moreover, he objects to Shirky's selective use of anecdotes to support his point.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" />  Meanwhile, he finds it disorienting and obscene to suggest the web is hailing a new economy and abolishing class in the midst of financial distress and joblessness.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /> He also questions Shirky's assumption that free time was squandered prior to the web and suggests instead people did useful things with their time. Furthermore, he questions the intrinsic value of time spent online as a lot of time spent online may be used for things like gambling and porn. There's nothing innately compassionate or generous about the web. For any good thing people do online, someone could also be doing something bad with the internet.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" />\n\nLehmann also suggests that a cognitive surplus raises a question about what the baseline value of time spent was to begin with, \"one,\" he claims \"that might be better phrased as either \u201cSurplus for what?\u201d or \u201cWhose surplus, white man?\u201d\" <ref name=\"Lehmann\" /> In the same vein, Lehmann accuses Shirky of being myopic. Shirky says the worst thing on the web is [[Lolcat|LOLcats]] when actually there are some bad things such as, for example, fake Obama birth certificates.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /> Shirky says you cannot communicate with society on the basis of a web search to which Lehmann responds,\n<blockquote>The idea of society as a terminally unresponsive, nonconversant entity would certainly be news to the generations of labor and gender-equality advocates who persistently engaged the social order with demands for the ballot and the eight-hour workday. It would likewise ring strangely in the ears of the leaders of the civil rights movement, who used a concerted strategy of nonviolent protest as a means of addressing an abundance-obsessed white American public who couldn't find the time to regard [[racial inequality]] as a pressing social concern. The explicit content of such protests, meanwhile, indicted that same white American public on the basis of the civic and political standards\u2014or rather double standards\u2014of equality and opportunity that fueled the nation's chauvinist self-regard.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /></blockquote>\nShirky bases a lot of his conclusions of generosity on the [[Ultimatum game|Ultimatum Game]] experiment to which Lehmann objects \"The utility of the Ultimatum Game for a new market enabled theory of human nature thins out considerably when one realizes that the players are bartering with unearned money.\" and if you \"Consult virtually any news story following up on a lottery winner's post-windfall life\u2014to say nothing of the well-chronicled implosion of the past decade's market in mortgage backed securities\u2014and you'll get a quick education in how playing games with other people's money can have a deranging effect on human behavior.\"  <ref name=\"Lehmann\" />\n\nLehmann also criticizes Shirky's expectation of the web to change economics and governmental systems. For example, he criticizes Shirky's idealising of amateurism:\n<blockquote>As for [[crowdsourcing]] being a \u201clabor of love\u201d (Shirky primly reminds us that the term \u201camateur\u201d \u201cderives from the Latin amare\u2014 \u2018to love\u2019\u201d), the governing metaphor here wouldn't seem to be digital sharecropping so much as the digital plantation. For all too transparent reasons of guilt sublimation, patrician apologists for antebellum slavery also insisted that their uncompensated workers loved their work, and likewise embraced their overseers as virtual family members. This is not, I should caution, to brand Shirky as a latter-day apologist for slavery but rather to note that it's an exceptionally arrogant tic of privilege to tell one's economic inferiors, online or off, what they do and do not love, and what the extra-material wellsprings of their motivation are supposed to be. To use an old-fashioned Enlightenment construct, it's at minimum an intrusion into a digital contributor's private life\u2014even in the barrier-breaking world of Web 2.0 oversharing and friending. The just and proper rejoinder to any propagandist urging the virtues of uncompensated labor from an empyrean somewhere far above mere \u201csociety\u201d is, \u201cYou try it, pal.\u201d</blockquote>\nThe idea of crowdsourcing as a more egalitarian economic tool also draws criticism saying crowdsourcing is just cost-cutting, much akin to outsourcing.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /> The possibility for the web to fundamental change the government is also questioned as\n<blockquote>Cognitive Surplus is already aging badly, with the WikiLeaks furor showing just how little web-based traffic in raw information, no matter how revelatory or embarrassing, has upended the lumbering agendas of the old nation-state on the global chessboard of realpolitik\u2014a place where everything has a price, often measured in human lives. More than that, though, Shirky's book inadvertently reminds us of the lesson we should have absorbed more fully with the 2000 collapse of the high-tech market: the [[utopia]]n enthusiasms of our country's cyber-elite exemplify not merely what the historian [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]] called \u201cthe enormous condescension of posterity\u201d but also a dangerous species of economic and civic illiteracy.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /></blockquote>\nThe Western Cold War attitude has spawned a delusion about the power of information spreading to topple authoritarian regimes. This will not be the case in Eastern countries.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /> Paul Barrett takes a similar though softer stance, claiming all of Shirky's examples are relatively tame and mildly progressive. Moreover, Shirky presents everything as civic change when some things such as [[carpool]]ing services are really stretching the term.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/magazine/content/10_31/b4189078965961.htm |title=The Stack: Cognitive Surplus by Clay Shirky |last=Barrett |first=Paul |date=July 22, 2010 |work=bloomberg.com }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Matei, \"A broader conclusion of the book is that converting 'cognitive surplus' into [[social capital]] and collective action is the product of technologies fueled by the passion of affirming the individual need for autonomy and competence.\" His enthusiasm for social media and for the Internet produces at times overly drawn statements.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /> Author [[Jonah Lehrer]] criticized what he saw as Shirky's premise that forms of consumption, cultural consumption in particular, are inherently less worthy than producing and sharing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/Cognitive-Surplus/ba-p/2733 |title=Cognitive Surplus |last=Lehrer |first=Jonah |date=June 9, 2010 |work=bnreview.barnsandnoble.com |authorlink=Jonah Lehrer }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Tenner, E.

The book is an indirect sequel to Shirky's ''[[Here Comes Everybody]]'', which covered the impact of [[social media]]. ''Cognitive Surplus'' focuses on describing the free time that individuals have to engage with collaborative activities within [[new media]]. Shirky's text searches to prove that global transformation can come from individuals committing their time to active engagement with technology. Overall response has been mixed with some critics praising Shirky's insights but also decrying some of the shortcomings of his theory.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Clay Shirky]] has long been interested in and published works concerning the Internet and its impact on society.  He currently works at [[New York University]], where he \"has been making the case that the Internet is an inherently participatory and social medium\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2010/12/07/new-media-expert-clay-shirky-to-become-professor-at-nyus-carter-journalism-institute-tisch-school-of-the-arts.html |title=New Media Expert Clay Shirky to Become Professor at NYU's Carter Journalism Institute, Tisch School of the Arts |last=Devitt |first=James |date=7 December 2010 |website=NYU News |publisher=New York University |access-date=18 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nShirky wrote this book two years after its prequel, ''[[Here Comes Everybody]]'', which relates to the topics of the Internet and organization of people, was published.  In it, Shirky argues that \u201cAs the Internet radically reduces the costs of collective action for everyone, it will transform the relationship between ordinary individuals and the large, hierarchical institutions that were a dominant force in 20th-century societies\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/features/2008/04/book-review-2008-04-1/ |title=Ars Book Review: \"Here Comes Everybody\" by Clay Shirky |website=Ars Technica |access-date=2016-02-23}}</ref> This transformation of relationships between individuals is a concept Shirky builds on in ''Cognitive Surplus''.   A central concern Shirky had in mind when writing it was in illuminating the difference between communal and civic values, and how the Internet is a vehicle for both. In particular, he was interested in showing \u201ceffusions of people pooling their spare time and talent\u201d and showing how we can create a culture \u201cthat celebrates the creation of civic value\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/interviews/article/43565-here-comes-clay-shirky.html |title=Here Comes Clay Shirky |website=PublishersWeekly.com |access-date=2016-02-23}}</ref>\n\nShirky has stated that he is interested in exploring \"the changes in the way people collaborate\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/the-disruptive-power-of-collaboration-an-interview-with-clay-shirky |title=The disruptive power of collaboration: An interview with Clay Shirky |website=McKinsey & Company |access-date=2016-02-23}}</ref> that are spurred on by technology and new media, and these changes are a large part of what ''Cognitive Surplus'' is devoted to examining.

While Shirky acknowledges that the activities that we use our cognitive surplus for may be frivolous (such as creating [[LOLcats]]),<ref name=\"independent\">{{Cite news |last=Walker |first=Tim |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/cognitive-surplus-by-clay-shirky-2027393.html |title=Cognitive Surplus, By Clay Shirky |date=July 16, 2010 |work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> the trend as a whole is leading to valuable and influential new forms of human expression. These forms of human collaboration that he argues the Internet provides take the form of four categories of varying degrees of value:  personal, communal, public, and civic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |url=https://archive.org/details/cognitivesurplus00shir_1/page/171 |title=Cognitive Surplus |publisher=Penguin Group |year=2010 |isbn=9781594202537 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cognitivesurplus00shir_1/page/171 171\u2013175]}}</ref> Shirky argues that while all of these are legitimate uses of \"cognitive surplus,\" the civic value (the power to actually change society) that social media provides is what should be celebrated about the Internet.\n\n===Chapter summaries===\n====''Gin, Television, and Cognitive Surplus'' ====\nShirky introduces the [[Gin Craze]] as an older version of a modern-day concern. Gin offered its consumers the ability to fall apart a little bit at a time.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |url=https://archive.org/details/cognitivesurplus00shir_1/page/1 |title=Cognitive Surplus |publisher=Penguin Group |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-59420-253-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cognitivesurplus00shir_1/page/1 1]}}</ref> He relates this to how society today deals with free time in relation to technology. Since the Second World War, increases in [[GDP]], educational attainment, and life span have forced industrialized world to grapple with something we'd never had to deal with on a national scale: free time.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shirky |first=Shirky |title=Cognitive Surplus |publisher=Penguin Group |page=4}}</ref> He claims that the [[sitcom]], along with other technology and social media, has become the modern day Gin Craze. Something that makes today remarkable is that we can treat free time as a general social asset that can be harnessed for large, communally created projects. Society never knows what to do with a surplus at first (hence \u201csurplus\u201d). The \"Milkshake Mistake\" is the idea that it is a mistake to look at the meaning of or potential of something by looking at the history and original purpose of a product (such as drinking milkshakes for breakfast). Shirky says we do this when thinking about media. The use of technology is much less determined by the tool/medium itself; when we use a network, the most important asset we get is access to one another. [[Ushahidi]] was one of the first examples of a program in response to this surplus of free time being used for a greater good (cognitive surplus). It was a service developed to help citizens track outbreaks of ethnic violence in Kenya. It grew to a bigger and better at reporting over a wide geographical area as a result of cognitive surplus. It brought people together to carve out enough collective good-will from the community to create resources that no one could have imagined years ago.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |title=Cognitive Surplus |publisher=Penguin Group |page=17}}</ref> Along with good-will acts, people with a surplus of free time also engage in the use of creativity ( [[I Can Has Cheezburger?|ICanHasCheezburger]]). Cognitive surplus, newly forced from previously disconnected island of time and talent, is just raw material. To get any value out of it, Shirky says, we have to make it mean something or be useful. We collectively aren't just a source of the surplus; we are also the people designing its use by our participation and by the things we expect of one another as we wrestle together with our new connectedness.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |title=Cognitive Surplus |publisher=Penguin Group |page=29}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Means'' ====\nIn the second chapter, Shirky discusses the impact of media on the personal lives of civilians, companies, and governments. Throughout the text, Shirky references the [[2008 US beef protest in South Korea|2008 Beef Revolts]] in South Korea and how they came about since they were led by [[K-pop]] fan girls. Shirky also referenced [[PickupPal]] and the tension between it and bus company Tentway-Wagar, who complained about the latter to the OHTB. Shirky discusses the publishing button and whether or not should exist since now anyone can publish. He references [[Naomi Wolf]]\u2019s ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'' and [[Harvey Swados]] and uses them as part of his argument. He also brings up ICanHasCheezeBurger, [[YouTube]], and [[AOL]] as well, all of which are platforms that anyone can use. Shirky compares all of this to the fifteenth century invention of the [[Printing press]] and also lists other forms of life changing media, including [[photographic plates]], [[CDs]], [[Radio]], and [[Television]].\n\n==== ''Motive'' ====\nIn the third chapter, Shirky explains that the means are platforms, tools, or systems we use that allow us to connect, learn, and share. The combination of time, place, and people which enable us to share and take action, is the opportunity. Shirky discusses the types of motivations that a person who shares would consider. Intrinsic motivations, which Shirky summarizes as a need for 1) increased competence, 2) autonomy over what we do, 3) membership of a group who share our values and beliefs, 4) the sharing of things with that group. Then, extrinsic motivations, like reward and recognition or punishment for certain behaviors. These motivations could also be classified into personal and social motivations. Social motivations include membership and sharing, while personal motivations include competence and autonomy. With the evidence from [[Benkler]] and [[Helen Nissenbaum|Nissenbaum]], it is concluded that social motivations reinforce personal ones. With the tools of today, we see many new groups; most of them large, public, and amateur groups. The goal for these groups is more about scope rather than size. The use of this public access media is to reach audiences that are ''like'' the group. Sharers have always had the same interests-or motivations- it is the opportunity that has changed them, and the ability to connect, share, and learn easily.\n\n==== ''Opportunity'' ====\nIn the fourth chapter, Shirky explores how means and motives alone cannot explain new uses for our cognitive surplus, explaining that we take the opportunities made available to us. He argues that we often discover unconventional routes to benefit society. Shirky cites examples such as the elderly adopting the [[Internet]] as new means for communication and skateboarders adapting drained swimming pools into skating ramps. The narrative about the drought-stricken pools proved an important point: the intended capabilities of something do not necessarily determine its functions. He goes on to discuss the [[Ultimatum game]], in which a proposer and responder are given the task of splitting ten dollars. According to [[behavioral economics]], proposers should always propose a split that heavily favors them and the responder should always accept it, because no matter how small their share is, there is still a gain. In practice, however, proposers tend to offer fair deals and responders tend to reject unfair proposals. On some level, we always feel we are in a social situation and will either treat each other fairly or punish those who do not. According to Shirky, this is why what he describes as the [[Public sector]] is so popular; it is designed to enrich society without any monetary incentive. In the public sector, digital networks connect people worldwide and give amateurs the opportunity to share their thoughts and work when they normally couldn't. There are no [[gatekeepers]] on the [[Internet]]; innovation is actively encouraged and younger generations in a changing environment can find their voice there.\n\n==== ''Culture'' ====\nThe fifth chapter is broken up into four parts, ''Culture as a Coordinating Tool'', ''The Economics of Sharing'', ''College Professors and Brain Surgeons'', and ''Patients Like Us''.  The first section of the chapter discusses an experiment that appeared in a paper published in the ''[[Journal of Legal Studies]]'', written by [[Uri Gneezy]] and Aldo Rustichini.  The experiment demonstrates the backfiring of an attempt to regulate group collaboration; when attempting to do so by ascribing monetary values to people's time, a community will then begin to view people who provide services as the service itself rather than as individuals.  This emphasizes Shirky's point that group collaboration is essential to its prosperity and functionality.  Another example he uses is [[The Invisible College]], an example of collaboration that resulted in a monumental scientific advancements because of the sense of a shared purpose.  Unlike the alchemists of their time, The Invisible College shared information with each other in order to further the field rather than claim individual advancements as their own.  Later Shirky emphasizes the sense of [[belongingness|belonging]] that is an intricate part of this group culture.  In his brain surgeon analogy he discusses the values of a [[professional]] versus an [[amateur]], and that while in the case of the brain surgeon people prefer the professional, this is not always the case; for instance, in cases such as food critics, people tend to prefer an outlet where ordinary people give their opinions.  He likens to the distinction between the services offered by a prostitute (professional at their craft) versus the intimacy between partners, demonstrating that a sense of belonging is often held in a higher regard than skill.  This sense of belonging opens up a new discussion with the example of patientslikeme.com in which patients of similar diseases can openly discuss their ailments and feel comfort in knowing that they are not the only ones experiencing it.  Furthermore, it allows researchers to collaborate with patients.  Thus demonstrating that social media platforms can be used to enhance this nature of belonging in culture, but can also produce real civic value.\n\n==== ''Personal, Communal, Public, Civic'' ====\nIn the sixth chapter, Shirky outlines the variations in the forms of sharing and the types of value that result. He argues that there are four main values: personal, communal, public, and civic. Personal value deals with the efforts of singular agents sharing ideas on a whim.  Communal value is sharing in a small group that serves the interests of the group members collaborating.  Public value deals with groups that share in order to produce projects that serve people outside of the group.  Civic value is when groups collaborate on a project that serves to benefit society at large.  Point being that value is determined on who is involved and the intended benefactors of their efforts and level of cooperation that is upheld amongst the group, and that ultimately cognitive surplus is the driving factor behind such efforts.  The impact of the efforts can be as minuscule (personal) as sharing a selfie with the world, to [[Hashtags]] that are created to garner large followings and support to the issues that can change the world.\n\n==== ''Looking for the Mouse'' ====\nIn the seventh and final chapter, Shirky starts to work towards his conclusion of how his novel is a resource and how society may utilize it. He references the happenings of the [[Post-World War II]] era and the resulting transformation that society endured. Shirky notes from [[Steve Weber]]\u2019s book ''The Success of Open Source'' that lesser costs nor technical quality are worthy explanations for why someone would collaborate on an open source project. Shirky states that there is a paradox in revolution in which is the result of someone being able to change the future of a previously-existing society. He also references other media that revolutionized human conversation, stating that [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]], a computer system that existed in the 1960s, was the ancestor of today's electronic devices. He also shares with his readers that [[SixDegrees.com|SixDegrees]] was the first social networking website, not Facebook and Friendster as everyone had previously thought. He makes several recommendations to his readers, some of them being that to know that it's impractical to start complex, start small, ask questions, and note that behavior is in pursuit of opportunity.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe negative criticisms largely address the issue of negative uses of cognitive surplus.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} For example, Shirky discusses ''lolcats'' in the book, but this is a pretty innocuous example of negative or trite uses of cognitive surplus, especially considering the reality of [[Cybercrime|cyber crimes]], and other far more drastically negative uses. The main criticism of Shirky is that he is not realistic about the many possible ways we might waste this cognitive surplus, or worse, the many terrible ways it can and is being used for destructive and criminal activities, for example the [[Jihadism|global Jihadist movement]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} On the positive side, Shirky is praised for explaining the potential opportunities we can harness. He shows us effectively that we can not only make better use of our time, but also, that technology enables us to do so in a way that maximizes our ability to share and communicate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Positive===\nOne critic [[Russell Davies]] writes, \"There are revealing thoughts in every chapter and they're particularly important for people trying to do business on the internet, because they shed light on some fundamental motivations and forces that we often miss or misconstrue,\".<ref name=\"Davies\">{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=Russell|title=The Web's Fusion of Public and Private Media Confuses Us.|journal=Campaign|date=2010|issue=21}}</ref>  Sorin Adam Matei of [[Purdue University]], [[West Lafayette, Indiana|West Lafayette]] writes, \"Despite shortcomings, ''Cognitive Surplus'' remains overall a very well-written and generally well-informed contribution to our discussion about the social effects of [[social media]].

Davies says Shirky elucidated the personal/public media distinction \"That explains a lot to me. It's obvious when you read it but failing to grasp the fused state of public/personal media is responsible for a lot of the things we get wrong online. We often take it to be a commercial, public media space (and we always seem to be looking for another small group of professionals out there to deal with) - but it's not just that. Things that are perfectly appropriate in public media just don't work in personal media.

Furthermore, he questions the intrinsic value of time spent online as a lot of time spent online may be used for things like gambling and porn. There's nothing innately compassionate or generous about the web. For any good thing people do online, someone could also be doing something bad with the internet.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" />\n\nLehmann also suggests that a cognitive surplus raises a question about what the baseline value of time spent was to begin with, \"one,\" he claims \"that might be better phrased as either \u201cSurplus for what?\u201d or \u201cWhose surplus, white man?\u201d\" <ref name=\"Lehmann\" /> In the same vein, Lehmann accuses Shirky of being myopic. Shirky says the worst thing on the web is [[Lolcat|LOLcats]] when actually there are some bad things such as, for example, fake Obama birth certificates.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /> Shirky says you cannot communicate with society on the basis of a web search to which Lehmann responds,\n<blockquote>The idea of society as a terminally unresponsive, nonconversant entity would certainly be news to the generations of labor and gender-equality advocates who persistently engaged the social order with demands for the ballot and the eight-hour workday. It would likewise ring strangely in the ears of the leaders of the civil rights movement, who used a concerted strategy of nonviolent protest as a means of addressing an abundance-obsessed white American public who couldn\u2019t find the time to regard [[racial inequality]] as a pressing social concern. The explicit content of such protests, meanwhile, indicted that same white American public on the basis of the civic and political standards\u2014or rather double standards\u2014of equality and opportunity that fueled the nation\u2019s chauvinist self-regard.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /></blockquote>\nShirky bases a lot of his conclusions of generosity on the [[Ultimatum game|Ultimatum Game]] experiment to which Lehmann objects \"The utility of the Ultimatum Game for a new market enabled theory of human nature thins out considerably when one realizes that the players are bartering with unearned money.\" and if you \"Consult virtually any news story following up on a lottery winner\u2019s post-windfall life\u2014to say nothing of the well-chronicled implosion of the past decade\u2019s market in mortgage backed securities\u2014and you\u2019ll get a quick education in how playing games with other people\u2019s money can have a deranging effect on human behavior.\"  <ref name=\"Lehmann\" />\n\nLehmann also criticizes Shirky's expectation of the web to change economics and governmental systems. For example, he criticizes Shirky's idealising of amateurism:\n<blockquote>As for [[crowdsourcing]] being a \u201clabor of love\u201d (Shirky primly reminds us that the term \u201camateur\u201d \u201cderives from the Latin amare\u2014 \u2018to love\u2019\u201d), the governing metaphor here wouldn\u2019t seem to be digital sharecropping so much as the digital plantation. For all too transparent reasons of guilt sublimation, patrician apologists for antebellum slavery also insisted that their uncompensated workers loved their work, and likewise embraced their overseers as virtual family members. This is not, I should caution, to brand Shirky as a latter-day apologist for slavery but rather to note that it\u2019s an exceptionally arrogant tic of privilege to tell one\u2019s economic inferiors, online or off, what they do and do not love, and what the extra-material wellsprings of their motivation are supposed to be. To use an old-fashioned Enlightenment construct, it\u2019s at minimum an intrusion into a digital contributor\u2019s private life\u2014even in the barrier-breaking world of Web 2.0 oversharing and friending. The just and proper rejoinder to any propagandist urging the virtues of uncompensated labor from an empyrean somewhere far above mere \u201csociety\u201d is, \u201cYou try it, pal.\u201d</blockquote>\nThe idea of crowdsourcing as a more egalitarian economic tool also draws criticism saying crowdsourcing is just cost-cutting, much akin to outsourcing.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /> The possibility for the web to fundamental change the government is also questioned as\n<blockquote>Cognitive Surplus is already aging badly, with the WikiLeaks furor showing just how little web-based traffic in raw information, no matter how revelatory or embarrassing, has upended the lumbering agendas of the old nation-state on the global chessboard of realpolitik\u2014a place where everything has a price, often measured in human lives. More than that, though, Shirky\u2019s book inadvertently reminds us of the lesson we should have absorbed more fully with the 2000 collapse of the high-tech market: the [[utopia]]n enthusiasms of our country\u2019s cyber-elite exemplify not merely what the historian [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]] called \u201cthe enormous condescension of posterity\u201d but also a dangerous species of economic and civic illiteracy.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /></blockquote>\nThe Western Cold War attitude has spawned a delusion about the power of information spreading to topple authoritarian regimes. This will not be the case in Eastern countries.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /> Paul Barrett takes a similar though softer stance, claiming all of Shirky's examples are relatively tame and mildly progressive. Moreover, Shirky presents everything as civic change when some things such as [[carpool]]ing services are really stretching the term.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/magazine/content/10_31/b4189078965961.htm |title=The Stack: Cognitive Surplus by Clay Shirky |last=Barrett |first=Paul |date=July 22, 2010 |work=bloomberg.com }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Matei, \"A broader conclusion of the book is that converting 'cognitive surplus' into [[social capital]] and collective action is the product of technologies fueled by the passion of affirming the individual need for autonomy and competence.\" His enthusiasm for social media and for the Internet produces at times overly drawn statements.<ref name=\"Lehmann\" /> Author [[Jonah Lehrer]] criticized what he saw as Shirky's premise that forms of consumption, cultural consumption in particular, are inherently less worthy than producing and sharing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/Cognitive-Surplus/ba-p/2733 |title=Cognitive Surplus |last=Lehrer |first=Jonah |date=June 9, 2010 |work=bnreview.barnsandnoble.com |authorlink=Jonah Lehrer }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Tenner, E.

It won the school's first City Championship in 1996 and followed that up by winning the 'A' Division title in 1997.  Also in 1996, Xavier won the first 'All-City' Swimming Championship by beating  [[New York City Department of Education|New York City Public School]] swimming champion [[Stuyvesant High School]].  Like many schools in Manhattan, Xavier does not have many athletic resources on-site.  As a result, the Xavier Swim Team has used various pools around the city, such as [[St. Francis College]] in Brooklyn, the [[Lower East Side]] [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]], and [[Humanities Preparatory Academy|Humanities High School]].  For many years, Xavier had residence at [[Borough of Manhattan Community College]], using their facilities for both practices and dual meets.\n\n=== Other sports ===\nIn 1859 the College of St. Francis Xavier and St. John's College (now [[Fordham University]]) played the first collegiate level baseball game, featuring the new nine-man team style of play. Fordham won the game 33-11.<ref>''The New York Times'', April 6, 2009, p D7</ref>\n\nXavier High School's JV Soccer team won the [[Catholic High School Athletic Association|CHSAA]] Intersectional Championship in both 2008 and 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xavierhs.org/s/717/index.aspx?sid=717&gid=1&page_id=259&pgid=253&cid=645&ecid=1148&search=jv%20soccer%20wins|title=This site is not configured|website=www.xavierhs.org|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n==Buildings==\n[[File:Xavier High School 34 East16th Street.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Additional building]]\n{{expand section|date=March 2017}}\nIn 2016, the school acquired space inside a 25 story building, 35 West 15th Street, to house Fernandez-Duminuco Hall, occupying {{convert|45000|sqft|sqm}} of space in the basement and six floors.

Walsh was an owner of Kurtis Kraft, the leading constructor of AAA championship cars. Parsons was a charger, needing cars to race against, frequently moving from last on the grid to a win in spectacular displays of dirt track driving ability. \n\nJohnnie Parsons had the dubious distinction of being the only Indianapolis 500 winner to have his name misspelled on the [[Borg-Warner Trophy]]. The silversmith carved \"Johnny\" instead of \"Johnnie.\" He had a son named [[Johnny Parsons|Johnny]] who competed at Indy a dozen times. In 1991, during a trophy restoration project, it was proposed to correct the spelling, albeit posthumously. However, it was decided to keep the error intact, as part of the trophy's lore. \n\n==Racing career==\nParsons first raced in open wheel cars on the West Coast of the United States in a [[midget car racing|midget car]]. He won the 1942 season championship in the [[United Midget Association]].

He won the season championship that season. He also won the [[1950 Indianapolis 500]]. He won the 1955 [[Turkey Night Grand Prix]] midget car race.\n\nAfter he retired, he became the Chief Steward for the [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] Midget division on the West Coast in the 1970s.\n\n==Awards==\n*He was inducted in the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/johnnie-parsons.html Johnnie Parsons] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref> in 2004.\n*He was inducted in the [[National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame]] in 1984.

However, Dick Rathmann (who had qualified) was mugged the day before the race and therefore deemed unable to drive. Parsons was selected as replacement driver for the car and allowed to start from the position Dick Rathmann had qualified the car at (in later years such a driver change would see the car in question moved to the rear of the field).\n\n==World Championship career summary==\nThe Indianapolis 500 was part of the FIA World Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indy during those years were credited with World Championship points and participation. Johnnie Parsons participated in 9 World Championship races. He won one race, set one fastest leading lap, and finished on the podium once. He accumulated a total of 12 championship points.\n\nParsons is one of only three drivers to win on his world championship d\u00e9but. The other two are [[Giuseppe Farina|Nino Farina]], who won the first world championship race{{snd}}the [[1950 British Grand Prix]], 17 days earlier{{snd}}and [[Giancarlo Baghetti]], who won the [[1961 French Grand Prix]].\n\n==Complete Formula One World Championship results==\n([[:Template:F1 driver results legend 2|key]]) (Races in ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n!

Walsh was an owner of Kurtis Kraft, the leading constructor of AAA championship cars. Parsons was a charger, needing cars to race against, frequently moving from last on the grid to a win in spectacular displays of dirt track driving ability. \n\nJohnnie Parsons had the dubious distinction of being the only Indianapolis 500 winner to have his name misspelled on the [[Borg-Warner Trophy]]. The silversmith carved \"Johnny\" instead of \"Johnnie.\" He had a son named [[Johnny Parsons|Johnny]] who competed at Indy a dozen times. In 1991, during a trophy restoration project, it was proposed to correct the spelling, albeit posthumously. However, it was decided to keep the error intact, as part of the trophy's lore. \n\n==Racing career==\nParsons first raced in open wheel cars on the West Coast of the United States in a [[midget car racing|midget car]]. He won the 1942 season championship in the [[United Midget Association]]. He won 18 feature events in the abbreviated season.<ref name=NMARHoF>[http://worthyofhonor.com/Inductees/Johnnie_Parsons.htm Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032911/http://worthyofhonor.com/Inductees/Johnnie_Parsons.htm |date=2007-09-27 }} at the [[National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame]]</ref> Parsons began racing in the [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] after [[World War II]]. He captured the third feature in the 1948 [[Night Before the 500]] midget race at the [[16th Street Speedway]]. Parsons finished second in his first Indy 500 in [[1949 Indianapolis 500|1949]]. He won the season championship that season. He also won the [[1950 Indianapolis 500]]. He won the 1955 [[Turkey Night Grand Prix]] midget car race.\n\nAfter he retired, he became the Chief Steward for the [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] Midget division on the West Coast in the 1970s.\n\n==Awards==\n*He was inducted in the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/johnnie-parsons.html Johnnie Parsons] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref> in 2004.\n*He was inducted in the [[National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame]] in 1984.

However, Dick Rathmann (who had qualified) was mugged the day before the race and therefore deemed unable to drive. Parsons was selected as replacement driver for the car and allowed to start from the position Dick Rathmann had qualified the car at (in later years such a driver change would see the car in question moved to the rear of the field).\n\n==World Championship career summary==\nThe Indianapolis 500 was part of the FIA World Championship from 1950 through 1960. Drivers competing at Indy during those years were credited with World Championship points and participation. Johnnie Parsons participated in 9 World Championship races. He won one race, set one fastest leading lap, and finished on the podium once. He accumulated a total of 12 championship points.\n\nParsons is one of only three drivers to win on his world championship d\u00e9but. The other two are [[Giuseppe Farina|Nino Farina]], who won the first world championship race{{snd}}the [[1950 British Grand Prix]], 17 days earlier{{snd}}and [[Giancarlo Baghetti]], who won the [[1961 French Grand Prix]].\n\n==Complete Formula One World Championship results==\n([[:Template:F1 driver results legend 2|key]]) (Races in ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n!
