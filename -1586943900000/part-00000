She began her career as a [[mezzo-soprano]] at the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]] in 1900; ultimately transitioning into the leading [[soprano]] repertoire at that theatre in 1912. She performed extensively in the United States from 1914\u20131917 and was also heard as a guest artist at theatres in the French provinces, Monaco, Portugal, and Switzerland during her career. In 1924 she founded her own opera company in Paris with whom she actively performed up until 1930.\n\nDuring her early career, B\u00e9riza was married to the French tenor [[Lucien Muratore]]. In 1906&ndash;1907, they appeared on several [[Phonograph cylinder|Edison cylinder]] recordings together where she was billed under the name '''Magli Muratore'''. She was also billed under that name on a 1910 [[Path\u00e9 Records]] recording which also included performances by [[Albert Vaguet]] and [[Henri Albers]]. She divorced Muratore in 1913 so he could marry the soprano [[Lina Cavalieri]]. On the stage she performed mainly under the name Marguerite B\u00e9riza, sometimes shortening it to '''Magli B\u00e9riza'''.
