It became HMS ''Tern'' (II) when the airfield was transferred to the [[Admiralty]] by [[RAF Coastal Command]] in 1944, as a satellite of {{HMS|Tern}} at [[Twatt, Orkney|Twatt]] in [[Orkney]]. It never saw any action during the war and was placed into ''care and maintenance'' in 1949.\n\nDounreay is near the [[A836 road]], about {{Convert|9|mi}} west of the town of [[Thurso]], which grew rapidly when the research establishment was developed during the mid-20th century. The establishment remained a major element in the economy of Thurso and Caithness until 1994 when the government ordered that the reactors be closed for good; a large workforce employed in the clean-up of the site (which is scheduled to continue until at least 2025) remains.<ref name=\"Robots\"/>\n\n==Toponymy==\n[[Robert Gordon of Straloch|Robert Gordon]]'s map of Caithness, 1642, uses ''Dounrae'' as the name of the castle.\n\n[[William J. Watson]]'s ''The Celtic Place-names of Scotland'' gives the origin as ''D\u00fanrath'', and suggests that it may be a reference to a [[broch]].  This is the commonly accepted toponymy.\n\n==Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment==\n[[File:Dounreay Prototype Fast Reactor.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial shot ~1979.

Originally it was known as the Admiralty Reactor Test Establishment (ARTE).\n\nFor over 40 years Vulcan has been the cornerstone of the Royal Navy's nuclear propulsion programme, testing and proving the operation of five generations of reactor core. Its reactors have significantly led the operational submarine plants in terms of operation hours, proving systems, procedures and safety. The reactors were run at higher levels of intensity than those on submarines with the intention of discovering any system problems before they might be encountered on board submarines.<ref name=bbc-20140306/><ref name=dunne-20150722/>\n\n[[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], which designs and procures all the reactor plants for the Royal Navy from its Derby offices, operates Vulcan on behalf of the MoD and employs around 280 staff there, led by a small team of staff from the Royal Navy. Reactors developed include the [[Rolls-Royce PWR|PWR1 and PWR2]].\n\nIn 2011 the MoD stated that NRTE could be scaled down or closed after 2015 when the current series of tests ends.

The reactor plant was recognised by the Royal Navy as one of Her Majesty's Submarines (HMS) and was commissioned as HMS ''Vulcan'' in 1963. It went critical in 1965. HMS ''Vulcan'' is a Rolls-Royce PWR 1 reactor plant and tested Cores A, B and Z before being shut down in 1984. In 1987, the plant was re-commissioned as LAIRD (Loss of Coolant Accident Investigation Rig Dounreay) a non-nuclear test rig, the only one of its kind in the world. LAIRD trials simulated loss of coolant accidents to prove the effectiveness of systems designed to protect the reactor in loss-of-coolant accidents.\n\n===Shore Test Facility (STF)===\nThe second reactor, [[PWR2]], is housed in the Shore Test Facility (STF), was commissioned in 1987, and went critical with Core G the same year. The plant was shut down in 1996, and work began to refit the plant with the current core, Core H, in February 1997. This work was completed in 2000 and after two years of safety justification the plant went critical in 2002. Vulcan Trials Operation and Maintenance (VTOM) (the programme under which Core H is tested) was completed and the reactor shut down on 21 July 2015. The reactor will be de-fuelled and examined, and post operational work will continue to 2022.

Originally it was known as the Admiralty Reactor Test Establishment (ARTE).\n\nFor over 40 years Vulcan has been the cornerstone of the Royal Navy's nuclear propulsion programme, testing and proving the operation of five generations of reactor core. Its reactors have significantly led the operational submarine plants in terms of operation hours, proving systems, procedures and safety.

HMS ''Vulcan'' is a Rolls-Royce PWR 1 reactor plant and tested Cores A, B and Z before being shut down in 1984. In 1987, the plant was re-commissioned as LAIRD (Loss of Coolant Accident Investigation Rig Dounreay) a non-nuclear test rig, the only one of its kind in the world.

The first television series, called ''Star Trek'' and now known as \"''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]''{{-\"}}, debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on [[NBC]]. It followed the voyages of the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before\". The USS ''Enterprise'' was a space exploration vessel built by the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the 23rd century. The [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] includes the ''Original Series'', an animated series, six spin-off television series, the [[Star Trek (film series)|film franchise]], and further adaptations in several media.\n\nIn creating ''Star Trek'', Roddenberry was inspired by [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series of novels, [[Jonathan Swift]]{{'s}} ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and television [[Western (genre)|westerns]] such as ''[[Wagon Train]]''. These adventures continued in the 22-episode ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' and six feature films. Six new television series were eventually produced: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' follows the crew of a new starship ''Enterprise'' a century after the original series; ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' are set contemporaneously with the ''Next Generation'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent ''Star Trek'' television series, ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', [[streaming television|stream]] exclusively on digital platforms. The adventures of the ''Next Generation'' crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] called the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. Three films were made in this alternate universe. An additional television series is in development, ''[[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]''. Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\n''Star Trek'' has been a [[cult following|cult phenomenon]] for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|title=Like 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek,' Potter is a modern phenomenon|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=2007-07-02|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2011-10-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|archive-date=2011-06-28|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Fans of the franchise are called \"[[Trekkie]]s\" or \"Trekkers\".

[[Paramount Pictures]] and Roddenberry began developing a new series, ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'', in May 1975 in response to the franchise's newfound popularity. Work on the series ended when the proposed [[Paramount Television Service]] folded.\n\nFollowing the success of the science fiction movies ''[[Star Wars]]''{{Hsp}}''{{Efn|''Star Wars'' has become the name of the franchise, while the first film, released in 1977, was officially re-titled ''Episode IV: A New Hope'' by [[Lucasfilm]] in 1981.}}'' and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', Paramount adapted the planned pilot episode of ''Phase II'' into the feature film ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. The film opened in North America on December 7, 1979, with mixed reviews from critics. The film earned $139 million worldwide, below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel. The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels.\n\nThe success of the sequel, ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', reversed the fortunes of the franchise. While the sequel grossed less than the first movie, ''The Wrath of Khan''{{'}}s lower production costs made it net more profit. Paramount produced six ''Star Trek'' feature films between 1979 and 1991.\n\nIn response to the popularity of ''Star Trek'' feature films, the franchise returned to television with ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' in 1987.

The poor box office performance in 2002 of the film ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis|Nemesis]]'' cast an uncertain light upon the future of the franchise. Paramount relieved Berman, the franchise producer, of control of ''Star Trek''.\n\n=== Film reboots (''Kelvin'' Timeline) (2005\u20132016) ===\nIn 2005, Paramount's parent company [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] split into two companies, the [[CBS Corporation]] owner of [[CBS Television Studios]], and [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] owner of Paramount Pictures. CBS owned the film brand while Paramount owned the film library and would continue the film franchise. Paramount was the first company to try to revive the franchise, which it hired a new creative team to reinvigorate in 2007. Writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] and producer [[J. J. Abrams]] had the freedom to reinvent the feel of the franchise.\n\nThe team created the franchise's eleventh film, ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. ''Star Trek'' was a prequel of the original series set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], later named the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. This gave the film and sequels freedom from the need to conform to the franchise's canonical timeline.

The profit-sharing agreement for the series split proceeds between Norway, Desilu\u2014later [[Paramount Television (original)|Paramount Television]], William Shatner, and NBC. However, ''Star Trek'' lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount.\n\nWith NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1970|fmt=eq}}) offered by the studio.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Paramount would go on to license the series for the syndication market worldwide. NBC's remaining broadcast and distribution rights eventually returned to Paramount sometime before 1986, which coincided with the development of what would become ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Desilu was acquired by [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]]. The studio was reorganized as the [[Paramount Television (original)|television production division]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], which Gulf+Western had acquired in 1966. Gulf+Western sold its remaining industrial assets in 1989, renaming itself Paramount Communications.\n\nSometime before 1986, [[Sumner Redstone]] acquired a controlling stake of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] via his family's theater chain, [[National Amusements]]. Viacom was originally established in 1952 as a division of [[CBS]] responsible for syndicating the network's programming, then called CBS Films. In 1994, Viacom and Paramount Communications merged.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Viacom then merged with its former parent, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|CBS Corporation]], in 1999.\n\n=== Split ownership (2005\u20132019) ===\nIn 2005, the Redstone family reorganized Viacom, spinning off the conglomerate's assets as two independent groups: the new [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]], and the new [[CBS Corporation]].

The first television series, called ''Star Trek'' and now known as \"''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]''{{-\"}}, debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on [[NBC]]. It followed the voyages of the [[Starship Enterprise|starship USS ''Enterprise'']] on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before\". The USS ''Enterprise'' was a space exploration vessel built by the [[United Federation of Planets]] in the 23rd century. The [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] includes the ''Original Series'', an animated series, six spin-off television series, the [[Star Trek (film series)|film franchise]], and further adaptations in several media.\n\nIn creating ''Star Trek'', Roddenberry was inspired by [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series of novels, [[Jonathan Swift]]{{'s}} ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', and television [[Western (genre)|westerns]] such as ''[[Wagon Train]]''. These adventures continued in the 22-episode ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' and six feature films. Six new television series were eventually produced: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' follows the crew of a new starship ''Enterprise'' a century after the original series; ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' are set contemporaneously with the ''Next Generation'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent ''Star Trek'' television series, ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Picard]]'', [[streaming television|stream]] exclusively on digital platforms. The adventures of the ''Next Generation'' crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] called the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. Three films were made in this alternate universe. An additional television series is in development, ''[[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]''. Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\n''Star Trek'' has been a [[cult following|cult phenomenon]] for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|title=Like 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek,' Potter is a modern phenomenon|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=2007-07-02|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2011-10-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628193551/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003769419_webpotter02.html|archive-date=2011-06-28|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> Fans of the franchise are called \"[[Trekkie]]s\" or \"Trekkers\".

CBS owned the film brand while Paramount owned the film library and would continue the film franchise. Paramount was the first company to try to revive the franchise, which it hired a new creative team to reinvigorate in 2007. Writers [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] and producer [[J. J. Abrams]] had the freedom to reinvent the feel of the franchise.\n\nThe team created the franchise's eleventh film, ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'', releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. ''Star Trek'' was a prequel of the original series set in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]], later named the ''Kelvin'' Timeline. This gave the film and sequels freedom from the need to conform to the franchise's canonical timeline. The eleventh ''Star Trek'' film's marketing campaign targeted non-fans, even stating in the film's advertisements that \"this is not your father's ''Star Trek''\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103824300|title=Some Older 'Star Trek' Fans May Skip This Voyage|last=Adler|first=Margo|date=2009-05-06|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=2011-10-19}}</ref> It also would not interfere with CBS's franchise.\n\nThe film earned considerable critical and financial success, grossing (in inflation-adjusted dollars) more box office sales than any previous ''Star Trek'' film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://airlockalpha.com/6469/star-trek-becomes-highest-grossing-franchise-film-html|title='Star Trek' Becomes Highest Grossing Franchise Film|last=Hinman|first=Michael|date=2009-06-23|website=[[Airlock Alpha]]|access-date=2011-10-19}}</ref> The plaudits include the franchise's first [[Academy Award]] (for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|makeup]]).

Such conflict often arose from friction between \"by-the-book\" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together.

The profit-sharing agreement for the series split proceeds between Norway, Desilu\u2014later [[Paramount Television (original)|Paramount Television]], William Shatner, and NBC. However, ''Star Trek'' lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount.\n\nWith NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 ({{Inflation|US|150000|1970|fmt=eq}}) offered by the studio.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Paramount would go on to license the series for the syndication market worldwide. NBC's remaining broadcast and distribution rights eventually returned to Paramount sometime before 1986, which coincided with the development of what would become ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Desilu was acquired by [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]]. The studio was reorganized as the [[Paramount Television (original)|television production division]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], which Gulf+Western had acquired in 1966. Gulf+Western sold its remaining industrial assets in 1989, renaming itself Paramount Communications.\n\nSometime before 1986, [[Sumner Redstone]] acquired a controlling stake of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] via his family's theater chain, [[National Amusements]]. Viacom was originally established in 1952 as a division of [[CBS]] responsible for syndicating the network's programming, then called CBS Films. In 1994, Viacom and Paramount Communications merged.<ref name=\"Davies\" /> Viacom then merged with its former parent, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|CBS Corporation]], in 1999.\n\n=== Split ownership (2005\u20132019) ===\nIn 2005, the Redstone family reorganized Viacom, spinning off the conglomerate's assets as two independent groups: the new [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|Viacom]], and the new [[CBS Corporation]]. National Amusements and the Redstone family retained approximately 80% ownership of both CBS and Viacom.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=National Amusements, Inc.
