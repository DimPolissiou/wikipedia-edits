The short biography attached to his pencil portrait explains that he was an inventor of a steam carriage, (actually the modifier for safety reasons), the gravitating compass and a tape-loom. He  was a great industrial improver, with great enthusiasm for modern machinery. He\nintroduced \u201csteam\u201d to Caithness by improving and making previous designs safer.

He also invented an automatic rail-carriage-washer for the American market.\nOne of his most unexpected inventions was an artificial leg, with which he won a prize at the\nFrench Exhibition in Paris in 1866.

4th Earl of Onslow]], and Florence Coulston Gardner. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[New College, Oxford]] before joining the [[Diplomatic Service]] in 1901.\n\n==Diplomatic career==\nHe became an [[attach\u00e9]] to [[Madrid]] a year later, [[Third Secretary]] to [[Tangier]] in 1903 and to [[St Petersburg]] in 1904 and [[Second Secretary]] to [[Berlin]] in 1907. In 1909, he became assistant private secretary to [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]], the [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]].

He now resides in [[Alberta]], Canada.\n\nShe started show business at the age of ten as a backup dancer of her mother and at the age of 12 she started to be a backup singer and frontacts in some minor and major shows. She began performing solo in 1982, using the name '''Louise Ramsey'''.\n\nThe young Louise did not finish high school in the Philippines because of her busy lifestyle as a child performer. She nonetheless managed to receive high marks and was once elected [[class president]].\n\n=== In the United States ===\nHer mother Elizabeth decided to leave for the United States in June 1985, and brought Louise with her. There she continued her solo singing stints, performing with other [[Overseas Filipino]] artists like Tillie Moreno, Eddie Mercado, Lerma dela Cruz, and the duo Reycards.\n\nLife in America was likewise difficult for both Jaya and her mother. They stayed in different cities in California. She attended [[John Marshall High School (Los Angeles)|John Marshall High School]] in Los Angeles, which at the time already had a large [[Filipino-American]] student population.  She ran away from home in 1988 after finishing high school, moving to New York with a friend and landing a job as a backup vocalist for [[Stevie B]]'s group of musicians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filipinomusica.com/jaya.html|title=\u2013 filipinomusica.com|work=filipinomusica.com|accessdate=April 12, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017083839/http://www.filipinomusica.com/jaya.html|archivedate=October 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== US debuts ===\nRamsey was re-christened \"Jaya\" in 1989 by her American producer after signing a record deal in the United States. After one year, Jaya moved to Florida, where she was offered to be a ghost-singer for an album but after listening to her voice, the management decided to do the album with Jaya.\n\n=== Philippine debuts ===\n1995 was a turning point in Jaya's musical career. [[Pilita Corrales]], dubbed \"Asia's Queen of Songs\", noticed her voice after Jaya did an opening act for Corrales, Carmen Soriano, the late Bert \"Tawa\" Marcelo, and Elizabeth in the United States. Corrales then asked Jaya if she would like to return to [[Manila]] and record an album, to which she agreed. Jaya [[Balikbayan|returned to the Philippines]] and signed a record deal with [[Viva Records (Philippines)|Viva Records]] in March 1995 and completed her first local album. Five songs were recorded in the US while the rest were done in the Philippines.\n\nJaya is noted for being the Philippine music industry's female record holder of a seven-times platinum album.<ref>[[List of best-selling albums in the Philippines]]</ref> She was a big hit when Pinoys first heard her belt out soul ditties in 1996. Her winning the 1996 Metropop Song Festival via Danny Tan's \"Sometimes You Just Know\" made her the biggest star on the rise at the close of the last century.

This composition also received the grand prize, the Best Song award.\n\nShe adorns ''Magpakailan pa Man'' (Up to the End), with soulful, [[Toni Braxton]]-styled flourishes, and renders the upbeat, \"Together\" with [[panache]] and verve. Her assured handling of the delicately nuanced, \"Sana'y Maulit Muli\" (May it Recur Again), is a ''tour de force''. The album sold quintuple-platinum (200,000 units sold).<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/in-the-raw/id337161764 In the Raw by Jaya \u2013 Download In the Raw on iTunes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nShe released a Christmas album, entitled ''Kung Kailan Pasko'' which contained traditional [[Christmas carols|carols]] alongside original compositions, including a [[jazz]] version of ''[[The Christmas Song]]''.<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/kung-kailan-pasko/id340811737 Kung Kailan Pasko by Jaya \u2013 Download Kung Kailan Pasko on iTunes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 1999, PolyMax Records, a label of then-PolyGram Records Philippines (now an affiliate of Universal Records) released Jaya's ''A Love Album'', first released in 1992 in Japan under the same title. The album consists of songs taken from an earlier Jaya album, also called ''A Love Album'', released in the United States in 1989, as well as songs recorded specifically for the 1992 Japanese release. In 1992, while touring Japan as a backup singer and keyboardist for American R&B artist Stevie B., Jaya was approached by the Japanese label [[EMI Music Japan|Toshiba/EMI]] to make an album for Japanese release. ''A Love Album'' was released in Japan in conjunction with Jaya's American label, LMR Records, which still owns master rights, and from whom PolyMax obtained permission to release the album in the Philippines (according to Kazu Watanabe, managing director of PolyMax Records). ''A Love Album'' is exquisitely produced, and Jaya acquits herself well on the album's upbeat R&B/dance-styled tunes and soulful ballads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mp3.com/albums/375048/summary.html|title=MP3.com|work=mp3.com|accessdate=April 12, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911032226/http://www.mp3.com/albums/375048/summary.html|archivedate=September 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Jaya released, her fifth album released in her native country since 1996, entitled ''Honesty'' originally done by [[Billy Joel]], was also her career single.\n\n''Honesty'' differs greatly from Jaya's two previous major albums released in the Philippines, 1996's ''Jaya'' and 1997's ''In the Raw''. Though, as before, ''Honesty'' contains mostly passionate, easy-listening love songs, this time out her approach is more intimate. She doesn't add many soulful flourishes as before, nor does she allow herself to soar passionately to the heavens, which she often did on her previous albums.\n\nAnother major difference is the inclusion of three modern, [[rhythm and blues]] styled songs, including, \"We Thang,\" \"Tear to Fall\" and \"In My Dreams.\" These songs are far more contemporary and have much more international appeal than the easy-listening love songs which dominate Jaya's music.<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/honesty/id338501386 Honesty by Jaya \u2013 Download Honesty on iTunes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAfter five years in the recording scene, she released her first greatest hits album, entitled ''Five'' featuring a duet of ''Habang May Buhay'' (While Still having Life) with [[Regine Velasquez]] and ''Kung Wala Na'' (If Gone) from the ''Abandonada'' soundtrack.\n\nIn 1999, Jaya faced a big challenge when she did her first musical, the [[Ramayana]]-based ''Rama at Sita'' that starred [[Lani Misalucha]]. Her performance as the [[Rakshasa|demon]] king [[Ravana]]'s sister, [[Surpanakha|Soorphanaka]], was memorable for her skillful treatment of risque songs and sultry dancing.<ref>[http://www.inquirer.net/saturday/jul99wk2/spc_3.htm Jaya's concert series starts July 16 \u2013 SATURDAY SPECIAL (July 10, 1999)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827025316/http://www.inquirer.net/saturday/jul99wk2/spc_3.htm |date=August 27, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1999, Jaya was offered to be a main host in a GMA Network variety show called \"SOP\".\n\n=== 2000: ''Unleashed'' and concert scene ===\nIn 2001, Jaya released her sixth ''Unleashed'' album. Jaya sings in a relaxed, confident manner, and performs middle-of-the-road songs that mostly have depth and quality. Jaya mostly foregoes the soulful embellishments that were plentiful in her first two albums, 1996's ''Jaya'' and 1997's ''In the Raw'', although every so often she adds a few unwritten notes in a passionate, soulful manner. She approached her last album, 1999's ''Honesty'', in the refined manner that she furthers on ''Unleashed''. Jaya covers [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"Love Hurts\" and [[John Lennon]]'s \"Love\" in an understated, yet enjoyable manner. [[Johnny Nash]]'s \"I Can See Clearly\" features an imaginative, bass-heavy arrangement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mp3.com/albums/492784/summary.html|title=MP3.com|work=mp3.com|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, she released her first live album, entitled, ''Jaya Live at the Araneta''.

Several guest artists also have spots, including Regine Velasquez, who performs Abba's \"Dancing Queen\"; boy band Jeremiah, who accompanies Jaya on remakes of songs by American boy bands, including [[Westlife]]'s \"Swear It Again\"; and male singers Wency Cornejo, KC Montero, and Rivermaya's vocalist and songwriter, Rico Blanco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/jaya-live-at-the-araneta-2001-album-by-jaya|title=Answers \u2013 The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|work=answers.com|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter 4 years of hiatus in the music scene, Jaya returned with her seventh studio album entitled, ''Fall in Love Again''.

Jaya [[Balikbayan|returned to the Philippines]] and signed a record deal with [[Viva Records (Philippines)|Viva Records]] in March 1995 and completed her first local album. Five songs were recorded in the US while the rest were done in the Philippines.\n\nJaya is noted for being the Philippine music industry's female record holder of a seven-times platinum album.<ref>[[List of best-selling albums in the Philippines]]</ref> She was a big hit when Pinoys first heard her belt out soul ditties in 1996. Her winning the 1996 Metropop Song Festival via Danny Tan's \"Sometimes You Just Know\" made her the biggest star on the rise at the close of the last century.  Her first album under Viva Records hit an all-time high of 9 times platinum. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://megaprodu.multiply.com/reviews/item/7|title=Mega Producer \u2013 Jaya Cool Change<!-- Bot generated title -->|work=multiply.com|accessdate=April 12, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523080933/http://megaprodu.multiply.com/reviews/item/7|archivedate=May 23, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, she released her third album ''In the Raw'', (second in the Philippines) the follow-up to her massive-selling 1996 Philippine debut album, ''Jaya'', which sold nine times platinum, (360,000 units; platinum is 40,000 units sold).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mp3.com/albums/375045/downloads.html|title=MP3.com|work=mp3.com|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn this year also, 1997, she started performing in SOP, a Sunday variety noontime show in [[GMA Network]]. \n\nShe also won as Best Interpreter at the Asia Song Festival held in [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] in February 1997 for her rendition of the song \"You Lift Me Up\", composed by Danny Tan with lyrics by Dodjie Simon. This composition also received the grand prize, the Best Song award.\n\nShe adorns ''Magpakailan pa Man'' (Up to the End), with soulful, [[Toni Braxton]]-styled flourishes, and renders the upbeat, \"Together\" with [[panache]] and verve. Her assured handling of the delicately nuanced, \"Sana'y Maulit Muli\" (May it Recur Again), is a ''tour de force''. The album sold quintuple-platinum (200,000 units sold).<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/in-the-raw/id337161764 In the Raw by Jaya \u2013 Download In the Raw on iTunes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nShe released a Christmas album, entitled ''Kung Kailan Pasko'' which contained traditional [[Christmas carols|carols]] alongside original compositions, including a [[jazz]] version of ''[[The Christmas Song]]''.<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/kung-kailan-pasko/id340811737 Kung Kailan Pasko by Jaya \u2013 Download Kung Kailan Pasko on iTunes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 1999, PolyMax Records, a label of then-PolyGram Records Philippines (now an affiliate of Universal Records) released Jaya's ''A Love Album'', first released in 1992 in Japan under the same title. The album consists of songs taken from an earlier Jaya album, also called ''A Love Album'', released in the United States in 1989, as well as songs recorded specifically for the 1992 Japanese release. In 1992, while touring Japan as a backup singer and keyboardist for American R&B artist Stevie B., Jaya was approached by the Japanese label [[EMI Music Japan|Toshiba/EMI]] to make an album for Japanese release. ''A Love Album'' was released in Japan in conjunction with Jaya's American label, LMR Records, which still owns master rights, and from whom PolyMax obtained permission to release the album in the Philippines (according to Kazu Watanabe, managing director of PolyMax Records). ''A Love Album'' is exquisitely produced, and Jaya acquits herself well on the album's upbeat R&B/dance-styled tunes and soulful ballads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mp3.com/albums/375048/summary.html|title=MP3.com|work=mp3.com|accessdate=April 12, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911032226/http://www.mp3.com/albums/375048/summary.html|archivedate=September 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Jaya released, her fifth album released in her native country since 1996, entitled ''Honesty'' originally done by [[Billy Joel]], was also her career single.\n\n''Honesty'' differs greatly from Jaya's two previous major albums released in the Philippines, 1996's ''Jaya'' and 1997's ''In the Raw''. Though, as before, ''Honesty'' contains mostly passionate, easy-listening love songs, this time out her approach is more intimate. She doesn't add many soulful flourishes as before, nor does she allow herself to soar passionately to the heavens, which she often did on her previous albums.\n\nAnother major difference is the inclusion of three modern, [[rhythm and blues]] styled songs, including, \"We Thang,\" \"Tear to Fall\" and \"In My Dreams.\" These songs are far more contemporary and have much more international appeal than the easy-listening love songs which dominate Jaya's music.<ref>[https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/honesty/id338501386 Honesty by Jaya \u2013 Download Honesty on iTunes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAfter five years in the recording scene, she released her first greatest hits album, entitled ''Five'' featuring a duet of ''Habang May Buhay'' (While Still having Life) with [[Regine Velasquez]] and ''Kung Wala Na'' (If Gone) from the ''Abandonada'' soundtrack.\n\nIn 1999, Jaya faced a big challenge when she did her first musical, the [[Ramayana]]-based ''Rama at Sita'' that starred [[Lani Misalucha]]. Her performance as the [[Rakshasa|demon]] king [[Ravana]]'s sister, [[Surpanakha|Soorphanaka]], was memorable for her skillful treatment of risque songs and sultry dancing.<ref>[http://www.inquirer.net/saturday/jul99wk2/spc_3.htm Jaya's concert series starts July 16 \u2013 SATURDAY SPECIAL (July 10, 1999)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827025316/http://www.inquirer.net/saturday/jul99wk2/spc_3.htm |date=August 27, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1999, Jaya was offered to be a main host in a GMA Network variety show called \"SOP\".\n\n=== 2000: ''Unleashed'' and concert scene ===\nIn 2001, Jaya released her sixth ''Unleashed'' album. Jaya sings in a relaxed, confident manner, and performs middle-of-the-road songs that mostly have depth and quality. Jaya mostly foregoes the soulful embellishments that were plentiful in her first two albums, 1996's ''Jaya'' and 1997's ''In the Raw'', although every so often she adds a few unwritten notes in a passionate, soulful manner. She approached her last album, 1999's ''Honesty'', in the refined manner that she furthers on ''Unleashed''. Jaya covers [[Roy Orbison]]'s \"Love Hurts\" and [[John Lennon]]'s \"Love\" in an understated, yet enjoyable manner. [[Johnny Nash]]'s \"I Can See Clearly\" features an imaginative, bass-heavy arrangement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mp3.com/albums/492784/summary.html|title=MP3.com|work=mp3.com|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, she released her first live album, entitled, ''Jaya Live at the Araneta''. The album is dominated by performances of American hits. For example, the album starts with a performance of [[Aretha Franklin]]'s 1960s hit \"[[Respect (song)|Respect]]\", and also includes [[Labelle]]'s \"[[Lady Marmalade]]\", [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]],\" and Roy Orbison's \"[[Love Hurts]].\" She performs several of these ballads here, including her first hit in the Philippines, \"Dahil Tanging Ikaw\" (Because It's Only You). Several guest artists also have spots, including Regine Velasquez, who performs Abba's \"Dancing Queen\"; boy band Jeremiah, who accompanies Jaya on remakes of songs by American boy bands, including [[Westlife]]'s \"Swear It Again\"; and male singers Wency Cornejo, KC Montero, and Rivermaya's vocalist and songwriter, Rico Blanco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/jaya-live-at-the-araneta-2001-album-by-jaya|title=Answers \u2013 The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions|work=answers.com|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter 4 years of hiatus in the music scene, Jaya returned with her seventh studio album entitled, ''Fall in Love Again''. Friends, old and new helped Jaya put the album together. One of these is [[Ogie Alcasid]], who composed and produced \"Ako'y Sa'yo\" later revived by [[Regine Velasquez]], \"Maging Akin Ka Lamang\" and their duet of \"Bakit Di Mo Sabihin\". Another one is Vehnee Saturno, who wrote and produced most of Jaya's early hits.

All of the songs were presented with new arrangements in various musical genres. The first single was \"Is It Over?\" originally sung by [[Ronnie Milsap]] which received Platinum award in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinoyexchange.com/forums/showthread.php?t=381320&page=237|title=NINA Soul SIREigNs Thread 7.5 and Everywhere You Are There We'll Be......|work=pinoyexchange.com|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter her Platinum Record solo album, \"Cool Change, \" Ramsey released her ninth studio album entitled, ''Real.Love.Stories.''

The album received a critical response, after experimenting with a variety of sounds in her previous outings, \"Jaya comes to terms with what she is really all about as a singer in \"All Souled Out.\" She triumphs in making the material sound genuine, largely because it is perfect for her.

Many grevilleas have a propensity to interbreed freely, and extensive hybridisation and selection of horticulturally desirable attributes has led to the commercial release of many named [[cultivars]]. Among the best known is 'Robyn Gordon', a small shrub up to {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high and wide which can flower 12 months of the year in subtropical climates.
