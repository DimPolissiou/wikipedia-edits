Dental composite resins have certain properties that will benefit patients according to the patient's cavity. It has a micro-mechanical retention property that makes composite more effective for filling small cavities where amalgam fillings are not as effective and could therefore fall out (due to the macro-mechanical retention property of amalgam). Synthetic resins evolved as restorative materials since they were insoluble, of good tooth-like appearance, insensitive to dehydration, easy to manipulate and reasonably inexpensive. Composite resins are most commonly composed of [[Bis-GMA]] and other dimethacrylate [[monomer]]s (TEGMA, UDMA, HDDMA), a filler material such as [[silica]] and in most current applications, a [[photoinitiator]]. [[Dimethylglyoxime]] is also commonly added to achieve certain physical properties such as flow-ability. Further tailoring of physical properties is achieved by formulating unique concentrations of each constituent.<ref name=Ull>{{Ullmann|title=Dental Materials|authors=Robert G.

Depending on the skill of the dentist, patient characteristics and the type and location of damage, composite restorations can have similar longevity to amalgam restorations. (See [[Dental composite#Longevity and clinical performance|Longevity and clinical performance]].) In comparison to amalgam, the appearance of resin-based composite restorations is far superior.\n\n==History of use==\nTraditionally resin-based composites set by a chemical setting reaction through [[polymerization]] between two pastes.

Composite resins displayed superior qualities, in that they had better mechanical properties than [[silicate]]s and unfulfilled resins. Composite resins were also seen to be beneficial in that the resin would be presented in paste form and, with convenient pressure or bulk insertion technique, would facilitate clinical handling. The faults with composite resins at this time were that they had poor appearance, poor marginal adaptation, difficulties with [[polishing]], difficulty with adhesion to the tooth surface, and occasionally, loss of anatomical form.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''The Microfilled Period'''\n\nIn 1978, various microfilled systems were introduced into the European market.<ref name=\":3\" /> These composite resins were appealing, in that they were capable of having an extremely smooth surface when finished. These microfilled composite resins also showed a better clinical colour stability and higher resistance to wear than conventional composites, which favoured their tooth tissue-like appearance as well as clinical effectiveness. However, further research showed a progressive weakness in the material over time, leading to micro-cracks and step-like material loss around the composite margin. In 1981, microfilled composites were improved remarkably with regard to marginal retention and adaptation. It was decided, after further research, that this type of composite could be used for most [[Dental restoration|restorations]] provided the acid etch technique was used and a bonding agent was applied.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''The Hybrid Period'''\n\nHybrid composites were introduced in the 1980s and are more commonly known as [[Glass ionomer cement|resin-modified glass ionomer cements]] (RMGICs).<ref name=\":0\" /> The material consists of a powder containing a radio-opaque fluoroaluminosilicate glass and a photoactive liquid contained in a dark bottle or capsule.<ref name=\":0\" /> The material was introduced, as resin composites on their own were not suitable for [[Tooth decay|Class II cavities]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Posterior Composite Resin Dental Restorative Materials|last=Vanherle|first=Guido|last2=Smith|first2=Dennis C|publisher=Peter Szule Publishing Co.|year=1985|isbn=|location=The Netherlands|pages=28\u201329|quote=}}</ref> RMGICs can be used instead.

In the 1990s and 2000s, such composites were greatly improved and have a compression strength sufficient for use in posterior [[Tooth|teeth]].\n[[image:MethmethacrylateBPA-glyc.png|thumb|left|334px|Chemical structure of [[bis-GMA]] (bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate), bearing two polymerizable groups, it is prone to form a crosslinked polymer that is used in dental restorations.<ref name=Ull/>]]\n\n==Method and clinical application==\nToday's composite resins have low polymerization shrinkage and low coefficients of thermal shrinkage, which allows them to be placed in bulk while maintaining good adaptation to cavity walls. The placement of composite requires meticulous attention to procedure or it may fail prematurely.  The tooth must be kept perfectly dry during placement or the resin will likely fail to adhere to the tooth.  Composites are placed while still in a soft, dough-like state, but when exposed to light of a certain blue wavelength (typically 470&nbsp;nm<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rueggeberg|first1=Frederick|title=State-of-the-art: Dental Photocuring - A review|journal=Dental Materials|date=2011|volume=27|issue=1|pages=39\u201352|doi=10.1016/j.dental.2010.10.021|pmid=21122903}}</ref>), they polymerize and harden into the solid filling (for more information, see [[Light activated resin]]).  It is challenging to harden all of the composite, since the light often does not penetrate more than 2\u20133&nbsp;mm into the composite. If too thick an amount of composite is placed in the tooth, the composite will remain partially soft, and this soft unpolymerized composite could ultimately lead to leaching of free monomers with potential toxicity and/or leakage of the bonded joint leading to recurring dental pathology. The dentist should place composite in a deep filling in numerous increments, curing each 2\u20133&nbsp;mm section fully before adding the next. In addition, the clinician must be careful to adjust the bite of the composite filling, which can be tricky to do. If the filling is too high, even by a subtle amount, that could lead to chewing sensitivity on the tooth. A properly placed composite is comfortable, of good appearance, strong and durable, and could last 10 years or more.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kubo|first=Shisei|date=2011-02-01|title=Longevity of resin composite restorations|journal=Japanese Dental Science Review|volume=47|issue=1|pages=43\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.jdsr.2010.05.002|issn=1882-7616}}</ref>\n\nThe most desirable finish surface for a composite resin can be provided by [[aluminum oxide]] disks. Classically, [[Dental restoration#Restoration classifications|Class III]] composite preparations were required to have retention points placed entirely in dentin. A syringe was used for placing composite resin because the possibility of trapping air in a restoration was minimized.  Modern techniques vary, but conventional wisdom states that because there have been great increases in bonding strength due to the use of dentin primers in the late 1990s, physical retention is not needed except for the most extreme of cases. Primers allow the dentin's collagen fibers to be \"sandwiched\" into the resin, resulting in a superior physical and chemical bond of the filling to the tooth. Indeed, composite usage was highly controversial in the dental field until primer technology was standardized in the mid to late 1990s.  The enamel margin of a composite resin preparation should be beveled in order to improve the appearance and expose the ends of the enamel rods for acid attack. The correct technique of enamel etching prior to placement of a composite resin restoration includes etching with 30%-50% [[phosphoric acid]] and rinsing thoroughly with water and drying with air only. In preparing a cavity for restoration with composite resin combined with an acid etch technique, all enamel cavosurface angles should be obtuse angles. Contraindications for composite include varnish and zinc oxide-[[eugenol]]. Composite resins for [[Dental restoration#Restoration classifications|Class II]] restorations were not indicated because of excessive occlusal wear in the 1980s and early 1990s. Modern bonding techniques and the increasing unpopularity of amalgam filling material have made composites more attractive for Class II restorations.  Opinions vary, but composite is regarded as having adequate longevity and wear characteristics to be used for permanent Class II restorations. Whether composite materials last as long or has the leakage and sensitivity properties when compared to Class II amalgam restorations was described as a matter of debate in 2008.<ref name=\"DOI10.4103/0972-0707.45247\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shenoy | first1 = A. | title = Is it the end of the road for dental amalgam?

Without a filler the resin wears easily, exhibits high shrinkage and is exothermic. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler [[glasses]] and [[glass ceramics]]. The [[filler (materials)|filler]] gives the composite greater strength, wear resistance, decreased polymerisation shrinkage, improved translucency, fluorescence and colour, and a reduced exothermic reaction on polymerisation. It also however causes the resin composite to become more brittle with an increased elastic modulus.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied Dental Materials|last=Bonsor|first=Steven|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=71}}</ref> Glass fillers are found in multiple different compositions allowing an improvement on the optical and mechanical properties of the material. Ceramic fillers include zirconia-silica and zirconium oxide.\n\nMatrices such as BisHPPP and BBP, contained in the universal adhesive BiSGMA, have been demonstrated to increase the cariogenicity of bacteria leading to the occurrence of secondary caries at the composite-dentin interface. BisHPPP and BBP cause an increase of [[glycosyltransferase]] in S. mutans bacteria,  which results in increased production of sticky glucans that allow S.mutans' adherence to the tooth. This results in a cariogenic biofilms at the interface of composite and tooth. The cariogenic activity of bacteria increases with concentration of the matrix materials.  BisHPPP has furthermore been shown to regulate bacterial genes, making bacteria more cariogenic, thus compromising the longevity of composite restorations. Researchers are highlighting the need for new composite materials to be developed which eliminate the cariogenic products currently contained in composite resin and universal adhesives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sadeghinejad|first=Lida|last2=Cvitkovitch|first2=Dennis G|last3=Siqueira|first3=Walter L.|last4=Merritt|first4=Justin|last5=Santerre|first5=J Paul|last6=Finer|first6=Yoav|date=2017-02-01|title=Mechanistic, Genomic and Proteomic Study on the Effects of BisGMA-derived Biodegradation Product on Cariogenic Bacteria|journal=Dental Materials |volume=33|issue=2|pages=175\u2013190|doi=10.1016/j.dental.2016.11.007|pmc=5253116|pmid=27919444}}</ref>\n\nA coupling agent such as [[silane]] is used to enhance the bond between these two components. An initiator package (such as: [[camphorquinone]] (CQ), [[phenylpropanedione]] (PPD) or [[lucirin]] (TPO)) begins the [[polymerization]] reaction of the resins when blue light is applied. Various additives can control the rate of reaction.\n\n=== Filler types and particle size ===\nResin filler can be made of glasses or ceramics. Glass fillers are usually made of crystalline silica, silicone dioxide, lithium/barium-aluminium glass, and borosilicate glass containing zinc/strontium/lithium. Ceramic fillers are made of zirconia-silica, or zirconium oxide.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A clinical guide to applied dental materials|last=J.|first=Bonsor, Stephen|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone|others=Pearson, Gavin J.|isbn=9780702031588|location=Amsterdam|pages=73\u201375|oclc=824491168}}</ref>\n\nFillers can be further subdivided based on their particle size and shapes such as:\n\n==== Macrofilled filler ====\nMacrofilled fillers have a particle size ranging from 5 - 10&nbsp;\u00b5m. They have good mechanical strength but poor wear resistance. Final restoration is difficult to polish adequately leaving rough surfaces, and therefore this type of resin is plaque retentive.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Microfilled filler ====\nMicrofilled fillers are made of colloidal silica with a particle size of 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m. Resin with this type of filler is easier to polish compared to macrofilled. However, its mechanical properties are compromised as filler load is lower than in conventional (only 40-45% by weight). Therefore, it is contraindicated for load-bearing situations, and has poor wear resistance.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Hybrid filler ====\nHybrid filler contains particles of various sizes with filler load of 75-85% by weight. It was designed to get the benefits of both macrofilled and microfilled fillers. Resins with hybrid filler have reduced thermal expansion and higher mechanical strength. However, it has higher polymerisation shrinkage due to a larger volume of diluent monomer which controls viscosity of resin.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Nanofilled filler ====\nNanofilled composite has a filler particle size of 20-70&nbsp;nm. Nanoparticles form nanocluster units and act as a single unit. They have high mechanical strength similar to hybrid material, high wear resistance, and are easily polished. However, nanofilled resins are difficult to adapt to the cavity margins due to high volume of filler.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Bulk filler ====\nBulk filler is composed of non-agglomerated silica and zirconia particles. It has nanohybrid particles and filler load of 77% by weight. Designed to decrease clinical steps with possibility of light curing through 4-5mm incremental depth, and reduce stress within remaining tooth tissue. Unfortunately, it is not as strong in compression and has decreased wear resistance compared to conventional material.&nbsp;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chesterman|first=J.|last2=Jowett|first2=A.|last3=Gallacher|first3=A.|last4=Nixon|first4=P.|title=Bulk-fill resin-based composite restorative materials: a review|journal=BDJ|language=en|volume=222|issue=5|pages=337\u2013344|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.2017.214|pmid=28281590|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nAdvantages of composites:\n\n* Appearance: The main advantage of a direct dental composite over traditional materials such as [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] is improved tooth tissue-mimicry. Composites can be in a wide range of tooth colors allowing near invisible restoration of teeth. Composite fillings can be closely matched to the color of existing teeth. Aesthetics are especially critical in anterior teeth region - see [[Aesthetic anterior composite restoration]]s.\n* Bonding to tooth structure: Composite fillings micro-mechanically bond to tooth structure. This strengthens the tooth's structure and restores its original physical integrity. The discovery of acid etching (producing enamel irregularities ranging from 5-30 micrometers in depth) of teeth to allow a micro-mechanical bond to the tooth allows good adhesion of the restoration to the tooth. Very high bond strengths to tooth structure, both enamel and dentin, can be achieved with the current generation of dentin bonding agents. \n* Tooth-sparing preparation: The fact that composite fillings are glued (bonded) to the tooth means that unlike amalgam fillings, there is no need for the dentist to create retentive features destroying healthy tooth. Unlike amalgam, which just fills a hole and relies on the geometry of the hole to retain the filling, composite materials are bonded to the tooth. In order to achieve the necessary geometry to retain an amalgam filling, the dentist may need to drill out a significant amount of healthy tooth material. In the case of a composite restoration, the geometry of the hole (or \"box\") is less important because a composite filling bonds to the tooth. Therefore less healthy tooth needs to be removed for a composite restoration. \n* Less-costly and more conservative alternative to [[dental crown]]s: In some situations, a composite restoration may be offered as a less-expensive (though possibly less durable) alternative to a dental crown, which can be a very expensive treatment. Installation of a dental crown usually requires removal of significant healthy tooth material so the crown can fit over or into the natural tooth. Composite restoration conserves more of the natural tooth.\n*Alternative to tooth removal: As a composite restoration bonds to the tooth and can restore the original physical integrity of a damaged or decayed tooth, in some cases composite restoration can preserve a tooth that might not be salvageable with amalgam restoration. For example, depending on the location and extent of decay, it might not be possible to create a void (a \"box\") of the geometry necessary to retain an amalgam filling.\n* Versatility: Composite fillings can be used to repair chipped, broken or worn teeth<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web|title=Dental Health and Tooth Fillings|url=http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/dental-health-fillings?page=2|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> which would not be repairable using amalgam fillings.\n* Repairability: In many cases of minor damage to a composite filling, the damage can be easily repaired by adding additional composite. An amalgam filling might require complete replacement.\n*Longer working time: The light-curing composite allows the on-demand setting and longer working time to some degree for the operator compared to amalgam restoration.\n* Reduced quantity of mercury released to the environment: Composites avoid mercury environmental contamination associated with dentistry. When amalgam fillings are drilled for height adjustment, repair or replacement, some mercury-containing amalgam is inevitably washed down drains. (See [[Dental amalgam controversy#Environmental impact|Dental amalgam controversy - Environmental impact]]) When amalgam fillings are prepared by dentists, improperly disposed excess material may enter landfills or be incinerated. Cremation of bodies containing amalgam fillings releases mercury into the environment. (See [[Dental amalgam controversy#Cremation|Dental amalgam controversy - Cremation]])\n* Reduced mercury exposure for dentists: Preparing new amalgam fillings and drilling into existing amalgam fillings exposes dentists to mercury vapor. Use of composite fillings avoids this risk, unless the procedure also involves removing an existing amalgam filling. A review article found studies indicating that dental work involving mercury may be an occupational hazard with respect to reproductive processes, glioblastoma (brain cancer), renal function changes, allergies and immunotoxicological effects.<ref name=\"Bj\u00f8rklund1991\">{{cite journal |author=Bj\u00f8rklund G |title=Mercury in the dental office.

Some dental insurance plans may provide reimbursement for composite restoration only on front teeth where amalgam restorations would be particularly objectionable on cosmetic grounds. Thus, patients may be required to pay the entire charge for composite restorations on posterior teeth. For example one dental insurer states that most of their plans will pay for resin (i.e. composite) fillings only \"on the teeth where their cosmetic benefit is critical: the six front teeth (incisors and cuspids) and on the facial (cheek side) surfaces of the next two teeth (bicuspids).\"<ref name=\"Delta Dental\"/> Even if charges are paid by private insurance or government programs, the higher cost is incorporated in dental insurance premiums or tax rates.

Polymerization is accomplished typically with a hand held [[Dental Curing Light|curing light]] that emits specific [[wavelength]]s keyed to the [[Radical initiator|initiator]] and [[catalyst]] packages involved. When using a curing light, the light should be held as close to the resin surface as possible, a shield should be placed between the light tip and the operator's eyes. Curing time should be increased for darker resin shades. Light cured resins provide denser restoration than self-cured resins because no mixing is required that might introduce air bubble [[porosity]].\n\nDirect dental composites can be used for:\n* Filling cavity preparations\n* Filling gaps ([[Diastema (dentistry)|diastemas]]) between teeth using a shell-like veneer or\n* Minor reshaping of teeth\n* Partial crowns on single teeth\n\n=== Setting mechanisms of resin composite ===\nTypes of setting mechanisms:\n* Chemical cure (self-cure / dark cure)\n* Light cure\n* Dual cure (setting both chemically and by light)\nChemically cured resin composite is a two-paste system (base and catalyst) which starts to set when the base and the catalyst are mixed together.\n\nLight cured resin composites contains a photo-initiator (e.g. camphorquinone) and an accelerator. The activator present in light activated composite is diethyl-amino-ethyl-methacrylate (amine) or diketone.They interact when exposed to light at wavelength of 400-500&nbsp;nm, i.e, blue region of the visible light spectrum.  The composite sets when it is exposed to light energy at a set wavelength of light. Light cured resin composites are also sensitive to ambient light, and therefore, polymerisation can begin before use of the curing light.\n\nDual cured resin composite contains both photo-initiators and chemical accelerators, allowing the material to set even where there is insufficient light exposure for light curing.\n\nChemical [[polymerisation inhibitor]]s (e.g. monomethyl ether of hydroquinone) are added to the resin composite to prevent polymerisation of the material during storage, increasing its shelf life.\n\n=== Classification of resin composites according to handling characteristics ===\nThis classification divides resin composite into three broad categories based on their handling characteristics:\n* Universal: advocated for general use, oldest subtype of resin composite\n* Flowable: fluid consistency, used for very small restorations\n* Packable: stiffer, more viscous material used solely for posterior parts of the mouth\n\nManufacturers manipulate the handling characteristics by altering the constituents of the material. Generally, the stiffer materials (packable) exhibit a higher filler content whilst fluid materials (flowable) exhibit lower filler loading.\n\n'''Universal:'''\nThis is the traditional presentation of resin composites and performs well in many situations. However, their use is limited in specialised practice where more complex aesthetic treatments are undertaken. Indications include: the restoration of class I, II and III and IV where aesthetics is not paramount, and the repair of non-carious tooth surface loss (NCTSL) lesions. Contraindications include: restoration of ultraconservative cavities, in areas where aesthetics is critical, and where insufficient enamel is available for etching.\n[[File:Flowable composite.jpg|thumb|263x263px|The use of flowable composite in early decay of lower molar teeth.]]\n'''Flowable:'''\nFlowable composites represent a relatively newer subset of resin-based composite material, dating back to the mid-1990s. Compared to universal composite, flowables have a reduced filler content (37\u201353%) thereby exhibiting ease of handling, lower viscosity, compressive strength, wear resistance and greater polymerisation shrinkage. Due to the poorer mechanical properties, flowable composites should be used with caution in high stress-bearing areas. However, due to its favourable wetting properties, it can adapt intimately to enamel and dentine surfaces. Indications include: restoration of small class I cavities, preventive resin restorations (PRR), fissure sealants, cavity liners, repair of deficient amalgam margins, and class V (abfraction) lesions caused by NCTSL. Contraindications include: in high stress-bearing areas, restoration of large multi-surface cavities, and if effective moisture control is unattainable.\n\n'''Packable:'''\nPackable composites were developed to be used in posterior situations. Unlike flowable composite, they exhibit a higher viscosity thereby necessitating greater force upon application to 'pack' the material into the prepared cavity. Their handling characteristics is more similar to dental amalgam, in that greater force is required to condense the material into the cavity. Therefore, they can be thought of as 'tooth-coloured amalgam'. The increased viscosity is achieved by a higher filler content (>60% by volume) \u2013 thereby making the material stiffer and more resistant to fracture, two properties that are ideal for materials to be used in the posterior region of the mouth. The disadvantage of the associated increased filler content is the potential risk of introducing voids along the cavity walls and between each layer of material. In order to seal any marginal deficiencies, the use of a single layer of flowable composite at the base of a cavity has been advocated when undertaking Class II posterior composite restorations when using packable composite.\n\n==Indirect dental composites==\n\nIndirect composite is cured outside the mouth, in a processing unit that is capable of delivering higher intensities and levels of energy than handheld lights can. Indirect composites can have higher filler levels, are cured for longer times and curing shrinkage can be handled in a better way.\nAs a result, they are less prone to shrinkage stress and marginal gaps<ref name=\"ElevenYearEvaluation\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00784-003-0201-z | volume=7 | title=Composite resin fillings and inlays.

Dental composite resins have certain properties that will benefit patients according to the patient's cavity. It has a micro-mechanical retention property that makes composite more effective for filling small cavities where amalgam fillings are not as effective and could therefore fall out (due to the macro-mechanical retention property of amalgam). Synthetic resins evolved as restorative materials since they were insoluble, of good tooth-like appearance, insensitive to dehydration, easy to manipulate and reasonably inexpensive. Composite resins are most commonly composed of [[Bis-GMA]] and other dimethacrylate [[monomer]]s (TEGMA, UDMA, HDDMA), a filler material such as [[silica]] and in most current applications, a [[photoinitiator]]. [[Dimethylglyoxime]] is also commonly added to achieve certain physical properties such as flow-ability. Further tailoring of physical properties is achieved by formulating unique concentrations of each constituent.<ref name=Ull>{{Ullmann|title=Dental Materials|authors=Robert G.

(See [[Dental composite#Longevity and clinical performance|Longevity and clinical performance]].) In comparison to amalgam, the appearance of resin-based composite restorations is far superior.\n\n==History of use==\nTraditionally resin-based composites set by a chemical setting reaction through [[polymerization]] between two pastes.

Composite resins displayed superior qualities, in that they had better mechanical properties than [[silicate]]s and unfulfilled resins. Composite resins were also seen to be beneficial in that the resin would be presented in paste form and, with convenient pressure or bulk insertion technique, would facilitate clinical handling. The faults with composite resins at this time were that they had poor appearance, poor marginal adaptation, difficulties with [[polishing]], difficulty with adhesion to the tooth surface, and occasionally, loss of anatomical form.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''The Microfilled Period'''\n\nIn 1978, various microfilled systems were introduced into the European market.<ref name=\":3\" /> These composite resins were appealing, in that they were capable of having an extremely smooth surface when finished. These microfilled composite resins also showed a better clinical colour stability and higher resistance to wear than conventional composites, which favoured their tooth tissue-like appearance as well as clinical effectiveness. However, further research showed a progressive weakness in the material over time, leading to micro-cracks and step-like material loss around the composite margin. In 1981, microfilled composites were improved remarkably with regard to marginal retention and adaptation. It was decided, after further research, that this type of composite could be used for most [[Dental restoration|restorations]] provided the acid etch technique was used and a bonding agent was applied.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''The Hybrid Period'''\n\nHybrid composites were introduced in the 1980s and are more commonly known as [[Glass ionomer cement|resin-modified glass ionomer cements]] (RMGICs).<ref name=\":0\" /> The material consists of a powder containing a radio-opaque fluoroaluminosilicate glass and a photoactive liquid contained in a dark bottle or capsule.<ref name=\":0\" /> The material was introduced, as resin composites on their own were not suitable for [[Tooth decay|Class II cavities]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Posterior Composite Resin Dental Restorative Materials|last=Vanherle|first=Guido|last2=Smith|first2=Dennis C|publisher=Peter Szule Publishing Co.|year=1985|isbn=|location=The Netherlands|pages=28\u201329|quote=}}</ref> RMGICs can be used instead.

The placement of composite requires meticulous attention to procedure or it may fail prematurely.  The tooth must be kept perfectly dry during placement or the resin will likely fail to adhere to the tooth.  Composites are placed while still in a soft, dough-like state, but when exposed to light of a certain blue wavelength (typically 470&nbsp;nm<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rueggeberg|first1=Frederick|title=State-of-the-art: Dental Photocuring - A review|journal=Dental Materials|date=2011|volume=27|issue=1|pages=39\u201352|doi=10.1016/j.dental.2010.10.021|pmid=21122903}}</ref>), they polymerize and harden into the solid filling (for more information, see [[Light activated resin]]).  It is challenging to harden all of the composite, since the light often does not penetrate more than 2\u20133&nbsp;mm into the composite. If too thick an amount of composite is placed in the tooth, the composite will remain partially soft, and this soft unpolymerized composite could ultimately lead to leaching of free monomers with potential toxicity and/or leakage of the bonded joint leading to recurring dental pathology. The dentist should place composite in a deep filling in numerous increments, curing each 2\u20133&nbsp;mm section fully before adding the next. In addition, the clinician must be careful to adjust the bite of the composite filling, which can be tricky to do. If the filling is too high, even by a subtle amount, that could lead to chewing sensitivity on the tooth. A properly placed composite is comfortable, of good appearance, strong and durable, and could last 10 years or more.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kubo|first=Shisei|date=2011-02-01|title=Longevity of resin composite restorations|journal=Japanese Dental Science Review|volume=47|issue=1|pages=43\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.jdsr.2010.05.002|issn=1882-7616}}</ref>\n\nThe most desirable finish surface for a composite resin can be provided by [[aluminum oxide]] disks. Classically, [[Dental restoration#Restoration classifications|Class III]] composite preparations were required to have retention points placed entirely in dentin. A syringe was used for placing composite resin because the possibility of trapping air in a restoration was minimized.  Modern techniques vary, but conventional wisdom states that because there have been great increases in bonding strength due to the use of dentin primers in the late 1990s, physical retention is not needed except for the most extreme of cases. Primers allow the dentin's collagen fibers to be \"sandwiched\" into the resin, resulting in a superior physical and chemical bond of the filling to the tooth. Indeed, composite usage was highly controversial in the dental field until primer technology was standardized in the mid to late 1990s.  The enamel margin of a composite resin preparation should be beveled in order to improve the appearance and expose the ends of the enamel rods for acid attack. The correct technique of enamel etching prior to placement of a composite resin restoration includes etching with 30%-50% [[phosphoric acid]] and rinsing thoroughly with water and drying with air only. In preparing a cavity for restoration with composite resin combined with an acid etch technique, all enamel cavosurface angles should be obtuse angles. Contraindications for composite include varnish and zinc oxide-[[eugenol]]. Composite resins for [[Dental restoration#Restoration classifications|Class II]] restorations were not indicated because of excessive occlusal wear in the 1980s and early 1990s. Modern bonding techniques and the increasing unpopularity of amalgam filling material have made composites more attractive for Class II restorations.  Opinions vary, but composite is regarded as having adequate longevity and wear characteristics to be used for permanent Class II restorations. Whether composite materials last as long or has the leakage and sensitivity properties when compared to Class II amalgam restorations was described as a matter of debate in 2008.<ref name=\"DOI10.4103/0972-0707.45247\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shenoy | first1 = A. | title = Is it the end of the road for dental amalgam?

Without a filler the resin wears easily, exhibits high shrinkage and is exothermic. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler [[glasses]] and [[glass ceramics]]. The [[filler (materials)|filler]] gives the composite greater strength, wear resistance, decreased polymerisation shrinkage, improved translucency, fluorescence and colour, and a reduced exothermic reaction on polymerisation. It also however causes the resin composite to become more brittle with an increased elastic modulus.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied Dental Materials|last=Bonsor|first=Steven|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=71}}</ref> Glass fillers are found in multiple different compositions allowing an improvement on the optical and mechanical properties of the material.

BisHPPP and BBP cause an increase of [[glycosyltransferase]] in S. mutans bacteria,  which results in increased production of sticky glucans that allow S.mutans' adherence to the tooth. This results in a cariogenic biofilms at the interface of composite and tooth. The cariogenic activity of bacteria increases with concentration of the matrix materials.  BisHPPP has furthermore been shown to regulate bacterial genes, making bacteria more cariogenic, thus compromising the longevity of composite restorations. Researchers are highlighting the need for new composite materials to be developed which eliminate the cariogenic products currently contained in composite resin and universal adhesives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sadeghinejad|first=Lida|last2=Cvitkovitch|first2=Dennis G|last3=Siqueira|first3=Walter L.|last4=Merritt|first4=Justin|last5=Santerre|first5=J Paul|last6=Finer|first6=Yoav|date=2017-02-01|title=Mechanistic, Genomic and Proteomic Study on the Effects of BisGMA-derived Biodegradation Product on Cariogenic Bacteria|journal=Dental Materials |volume=33|issue=2|pages=175\u2013190|doi=10.1016/j.dental.2016.11.007|pmc=5253116|pmid=27919444}}</ref>\n\nA coupling agent such as [[silane]] is used to enhance the bond between these two components.

Various additives can control the rate of reaction.\n\n=== Filler types and particle size ===\nResin filler can be made of glasses or ceramics. Glass fillers are usually made of crystalline silica, silicone dioxide, lithium/barium-aluminium glass, and borosilicate glass containing zinc/strontium/lithium. Ceramic fillers are made of zirconia-silica, or zirconium oxide.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A clinical guide to applied dental materials|last=J.|first=Bonsor, Stephen|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone|others=Pearson, Gavin J.|isbn=9780702031588|location=Amsterdam|pages=73\u201375|oclc=824491168}}</ref>\n\nFillers can be further subdivided based on their particle size and shapes such as:\n\n==== Macrofilled filler ====\nMacrofilled fillers have a particle size ranging from 5 - 10&nbsp;\u00b5m. They have good mechanical strength but poor wear resistance. Final restoration is difficult to polish adequately leaving rough surfaces, and therefore this type of resin is plaque retentive.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Microfilled filler ====\nMicrofilled fillers are made of colloidal silica with a particle size of 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m. Resin with this type of filler is easier to polish compared to macrofilled. However, its mechanical properties are compromised as filler load is lower than in conventional (only 40-45% by weight). Therefore, it is contraindicated for load-bearing situations, and has poor wear resistance.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Hybrid filler ====\nHybrid filler contains particles of various sizes with filler load of 75-85% by weight. It was designed to get the benefits of both macrofilled and microfilled fillers. Resins with hybrid filler have reduced thermal expansion and higher mechanical strength. However, it has higher polymerisation shrinkage due to a larger volume of diluent monomer which controls viscosity of resin.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Nanofilled filler ====\nNanofilled composite has a filler particle size of 20-70&nbsp;nm. Nanoparticles form nanocluster units and act as a single unit. They have high mechanical strength similar to hybrid material, high wear resistance, and are easily polished. However, nanofilled resins are difficult to adapt to the cavity margins due to high volume of filler.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Bulk filler ====\nBulk filler is composed of non-agglomerated silica and zirconia particles. It has nanohybrid particles and filler load of 77% by weight. Designed to decrease clinical steps with possibility of light curing through 4-5mm incremental depth, and reduce stress within remaining tooth tissue. Unfortunately, it is not as strong in compression and has decreased wear resistance compared to conventional material.&nbsp;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chesterman|first=J.|last2=Jowett|first2=A.|last3=Gallacher|first3=A.|last4=Nixon|first4=P.|title=Bulk-fill resin-based composite restorative materials: a review|journal=BDJ|language=en|volume=222|issue=5|pages=337\u2013344|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.2017.214|pmid=28281590|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nAdvantages of composites:\n\n* Appearance: The main advantage of a direct dental composite over traditional materials such as [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] is improved tooth tissue-mimicry. Composites can be in a wide range of tooth colors allowing near invisible restoration of teeth. Composite fillings can be closely matched to the color of existing teeth. Aesthetics are especially critical in anterior teeth region - see [[Aesthetic anterior composite restoration|Aesthetic anterior composite restorations]].\n* Bonding to tooth structure: Composite fillings micro-mechanically bond to tooth structure. This strengthens the tooth's structure and restores its original physical integrity. The discovery of acid etching (producing enamel irregularities ranging from 5-30 micrometers in depth) of teeth to allow a micro-mechanical bond to the tooth allows good adhesion of the restoration to the tooth. Very high bond strengths to tooth structure, both enamel and dentin, can be achieved with the current generation of dentin bonding agents. \n* Tooth-sparing preparation: The fact that composite fillings are glued (bonded) to the tooth means that unlike amalgam fillings, there is no need for the dentist to create retentive features destroying healthy tooth. Unlike amalgam, which just fills a hole and relies on the geometry of the hole to retain the filling, composite materials are bonded to the tooth. In order to achieve the necessary geometry to retain an amalgam filling, the dentist may need to drill out a significant amount of healthy tooth material. In the case of a composite restoration, the geometry of the hole (or \"box\") is less important because a composite filling bonds to the tooth. Therefore less healthy tooth needs to be removed for a composite restoration. \n* Less-costly and more conservative alternative to [[dental crown]]s: In some situations, a composite restoration may be offered as a less-expensive (though possibly less durable) alternative to a dental crown, which can be a very expensive treatment. Installation of a dental crown usually requires removal of significant healthy tooth material so the crown can fit over or into the natural tooth. Composite restoration conserves more of the natural tooth.\n*Alternative to tooth removal: As a composite restoration bonds to the tooth and can restore the original physical integrity of a damaged or decayed tooth, in some cases composite restoration can preserve a tooth that might not be salvageable with amalgam restoration. For example, depending on the location and extent of decay, it might not be possible to create a void (a \"box\") of the geometry necessary to retain an amalgam filling.\n* Versatility: Composite fillings can be used to repair chipped, broken or worn teeth<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web|title=Dental Health and Tooth Fillings|url=http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/dental-health-fillings?page=2|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> which would not be repairable using amalgam fillings.\n* Repairability: In many cases of minor damage to a composite filling, the damage can be easily repaired by adding additional composite. An amalgam filling might require complete replacement.\n*Longer working time: The light-curing composite allows the on-demand setting and longer working time to some degree for the operator compared to amalgam restoration.\n* Reduced quantity of mercury released to the environment: Composites avoid mercury environmental contamination associated with dentistry. When amalgam fillings are drilled for height adjustment, repair or replacement, some mercury-containing amalgam is inevitably washed down drains. (See [[Dental amalgam controversy#Environmental impact|Dental amalgam controversy - Environmental impact]]) When amalgam fillings are prepared by dentists, improperly disposed excess material may enter landfills or be incinerated. Cremation of bodies containing amalgam fillings releases mercury into the environment. (See [[Dental amalgam controversy#Cremation|Dental amalgam controversy - Cremation]])\n* Reduced mercury exposure for dentists: Preparing new amalgam fillings and drilling into existing amalgam fillings exposes dentists to mercury vapor. Use of composite fillings avoids this risk, unless the procedure also involves removing an existing amalgam filling. A review article found studies indicating that dental work involving mercury may be an occupational hazard with respect to reproductive processes, glioblastoma (brain cancer), renal function changes, allergies and immunotoxicological effects.<ref name=\"Bj\u00f8rklund1991\">{{cite journal |author=Bj\u00f8rklund G |title=Mercury in the dental office.

Most current microhybrid and nanohybrid composites have a polymerization shrinkage that ranges from 2% to 3.5%. Composite shrinkage can be reduced by altering the molecular and bulk composition of the resin.<ref>For example, ''UltraSeal XT Plus'' uses Bis-GMA without dimethacrylate and was found to have a shrinkage of 5.63%, 30 minutes after curing.  On the other hand, this same study found that ''Heliomolar'', which uses Bis-GMA, UDMA and decandiol dimethacrylate, had a shrinkage of 2.00%, 30 minutes after curing.{{cite journal|title= Polymerization shrinkage and contraction stress of dental resin composites|journal=Dental Materials|year=2005|first=CJ|last= KLEVERLAAN|volume=21|issue=12|pages=1150\u20137|doi= 10.1016/j.dental.2005.02.004|url=|pmid= 16040118|last2= Feilzer|first2= AJ }} Retrieved 2009-04-16.</ref> In the field of dental restorative materials, reduction of composite shrinkage has been achieved with some success.<ref name=\"DOI10.4103/0972-0707.45247\" /> Among the newest materials, silorane resin exhibits lower polymerization shrinkage, compared to the dimethacrylates.<ref name=\"DOI10.4103/0972-0707.45247\"/>\n* Durability: In some situations, composite fillings may not last as long as amalgam fillings under the pressure of chewing, particularly if used for large cavities.

Due to the longer time involved, the fee charged by a dentist for a composite restoration may be higher than for an amalgam restoration.<ref name=\"WebMD\"/> \n*Costs: Composite restoration cases generally have limited insurance coverage. Some dental insurance plans may provide reimbursement for composite restoration only on front teeth where amalgam restorations would be particularly objectionable on cosmetic grounds. Thus, patients may be required to pay the entire charge for composite restorations on posterior teeth. For example one dental insurer states that most of their plans will pay for resin (i.e. composite) fillings only \"on the teeth where their cosmetic benefit is critical: the six front teeth (incisors and cuspids) and on the facial (cheek side) surfaces of the next two teeth (bicuspids).\"<ref name=\"Delta Dental\"/> Even if charges are paid by private insurance or government programs, the higher cost is incorporated in dental insurance premiums or tax rates. In the UK, dental composites are not covered by NHS for the restoration of posterior teeth. Patients, therefore, may require to pay the entire charge of the treatment or have to pay according to the private charge rate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/dentists/whats-available-on-the-nhs/|title=What's available on the NHS?|date=2018-08-02|website=nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==Direct dental composites==\n[[File:Polymerisationslampe an 20090930 03.JPG|thumb|right|A hand-held wand that emits primary blue light (\u03bbmax=450-470nm) is used to cure the resin within a dental patient's mouth.]]Direct dental composites are placed by the dentist in a clinical setting. Polymerization is accomplished typically with a hand held [[Dental Curing Light|curing light]] that emits specific [[wavelength]]s keyed to the [[Radical initiator|initiator]] and [[catalyst]] packages involved. When using a curing light, the light should be held as close to the resin surface as possible, a shield should be placed between the light tip and the operator's eyes. Curing time should be increased for darker resin shades. Light cured resins provide denser restoration than self-cured resins because no mixing is required that might introduce air bubble [[porosity]].\n\nDirect dental composites can be used for:\n* Filling cavity preparations\n* Filling gaps ([[Diastema (dentistry)|diastemas]]) between teeth using a shell-like veneer or\n* Minor reshaping of teeth\n* Partial crowns on single teeth\n\n=== Setting mechanisms of resin composite ===\nTypes of setting mechanisms:\n* Chemical cure (self-cure / dark cure)\n* Light cure\n* Dual cure (setting both chemically and by light)\nChemically cured resin composite is a two-paste system (base and catalyst) which starts to set when the base and the catalyst are mixed together.\n\nLight cured resin composites contains a photo-initiator (e.g. camphorquinone) and an accelerator. The activator present in light activated composite is diethyl-amino-ethyl-methacrylate (amine) or diketone.They interact when exposed to light at wavelength of 400-500&nbsp;nm, i.e, blue region of the visible light spectrum.  The composite sets when it is exposed to light energy at a set wavelength of light. Light cured resin composites are also sensitive to ambient light, and therefore, polymerisation can begin before use of the curing light.\n\nDual cured resin composite contains both photo-initiators and chemical accelerators, allowing the material to set even where there is insufficient light exposure for light curing.\n\nChemical [[polymerisation inhibitor]]s (e.g. monomethyl ether of hydroquinone) are added to the resin composite to prevent polymerisation of the material during storage, increasing its shelf life.\n\n=== Classification of resin composites according to handling characteristics ===\nThis classification divides resin composite into three broad categories based on their handling characteristics:\n* Universal: advocated for general use, oldest subtype of resin composite\n* Flowable: fluid consistency, used for very small restorations\n* Packable: stiffer, more viscous material used solely for posterior parts of the mouth\n\nManufacturers manipulate the handling characteristics by altering the constituents of the material. Generally, the stiffer materials (packable) exhibit a higher filler content whilst fluid materials (flowable) exhibit lower filler loading.\n\n'''Universal:'''\nThis is the traditional presentation of resin composites and performs well in many situations. However, their use is limited in specialised practice where more complex aesthetic treatments are undertaken. Indications include: the restoration of class I, II and III and IV where aesthetics is not paramount, and the repair of non-carious tooth surface loss (NCTSL) lesions. Contraindications include: restoration of ultraconservative cavities, in areas where aesthetics is critical, and where insufficient enamel is available for etching.\n[[File:Flowable composite.jpg|thumb|263x263px|The use of flowable composite in early decay of lower molar teeth.]]\n'''Flowable:'''\nFlowable composites represent a relatively newer subset of resin-based composite material, dating back to the mid-1990s. Compared to universal composite, flowables have a reduced filler content (37\u201353%) thereby exhibiting ease of handling, lower viscosity, compressive strength, wear resistance and greater polymerisation shrinkage. Due to the poorer mechanical properties, flowable composites should be used with caution in high stress-bearing areas. However, due to its favourable wetting properties, it can adapt intimately to enamel and dentine surfaces. Indications include: restoration of small class I cavities, preventive resin restorations (PRR), fissure sealants, cavity liners, repair of deficient amalgam margins, and class V (abfraction) lesions caused by NCTSL. Contraindications include: in high stress-bearing areas, restoration of large multi-surface cavities, and if effective moisture control is unattainable.\n\n'''Packable:'''\nPackable composites were developed to be used in posterior situations. Unlike flowable composite, they exhibit a higher viscosity thereby necessitating greater force upon application to 'pack' the material into the prepared cavity. Their handling characteristics is more similar to dental amalgam, in that greater force is required to condense the material into the cavity. Therefore, they can be thought of as 'tooth-coloured amalgam'. The increased viscosity is achieved by a higher filler content (>60% by volume) \u2013 thereby making the material stiffer and more resistant to fracture, two properties that are ideal for materials to be used in the posterior region of the mouth. The disadvantage of the associated increased filler content is the potential risk of introducing voids along the cavity walls and between each layer of material. In order to seal any marginal deficiencies, the use of a single layer of flowable composite at the base of a cavity has been advocated when undertaking Class II posterior composite restorations when using packable composite.\n\n==Indirect dental composites==\n\nIndirect composite is cured outside the mouth, in a processing unit that is capable of delivering higher intensities and levels of energy than handheld lights can. Indirect composites can have higher filler levels, are cured for longer times and curing shrinkage can be handled in a better way.\nAs a result, they are less prone to shrinkage stress and marginal gaps<ref name=\"ElevenYearEvaluation\">Composite resin fillings and inlays.

For example, an entire crown can be cured in a single process cycle in an extra-oral curing unit, compared to a millimeter layer of a filling.\n\nAs a result, full crowns and even bridges (replacing multiple teeth) can be fabricated with these systems.\n\nIndirect dental composites can be used for:\n* Filling [[Dental caries|cavities]] in teeth, as fillings, [[Inlays and onlays|inlays and/or onlays]]\n* Filling gaps (diastemas) between teeth using a shell-like veneer or\n* Reshaping of teeth\n* Full or partial [[Crown (dentistry)|crown]]s on single teeth\n* Bridges spanning 2-3 teeth\n\nA stronger, tougher and more durable product is expected in principle.
