His father was a painter<ref>Giancarlo Francesconi, by E. Tadini, Milano, Salone Annunciata, 1959</ref> who edited Il Corriere dei piccoli and conceived Il Corriere dei ragazzi,<ref>Sergio Badino, Conversazione con Carlo Chendi. Da Pepito alla Disney e oltre: cinquant'anni di fumetto vissuti da protagonista, Tenu\u00e9 2006</ref> while his mother, an advertiser, created a number of famous advertising campaigns. Francesconi spent his early years in QT8, a working class quarter in Milan that rose up alongside a huge pile of post-war rubble which would later become Monte Stella. At the age of five, won over by a concert by Svjatoslav Richter, he began to learn the piano. Although he was accepted into the junior high school section of the city's conservatory six years later, he instinctively pulled out, thinking that it was too academic and conventional. Instead,  even though he had in the meantime moved with his family to a more central quarter of Milan, Francesconi opted to attend the junior high school in QT8. In this way from a very early age his relationship with music and life in general took on a course of responsibility and constant choice, of research and direct experimentation.\n\n== Education ==\n''We need to profoundly rethink and filter in a determined way the enormously rich potential that has been elaborated in the past and to use it for expressive purposes.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in VV. AA.  La loi musicale \u2013 Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (d\u00e9s)apprend, edited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\nFrancesconi returned to the Conservatory of Milan in 1974, while he was still attending the Berchet Classical Languages High School, and explored the length and breadth of the musical landscape, taking an interest in every possible dimension of sound.<ref name=\"auto1\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani - Appendix VII (2007)</ref> He played in jazz and rock groups as well as in classical concerts, he worked as a session man in recording studios, and he composed music for theatre, cinema, advertising, and television. These were all rewarding experiences, not least from an economic point of view, but they were not enough. He realised that a truly living language, while looking at the present, draws its lifeblood from its roots. The time had come for him to dig into the tradition of music to which he belonged. The Milan Conservatory was opening more and more space to contemporary music so Francesconi enrolled in the composition course conducted by Azio Corghi. \"From him I learnt the trade, the fundamentals, counterpoint and those things, professional seriousness and open-mindedness.\"<ref>Ricciarda Belgiojoso, \"Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi\", Postmedia Books, 2013</ref> In the meantime he continued to explore electronic music and in 1977 took time out to immerse himself in jazz at the Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\n=== A student of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]===\n''The mountain is in front of us and it is necessary to pass over it, with enormous force and patience. It's not enough just to contemplate it nor to sneak by it via secondary paths much less go backwards claiming that the mountain is not there.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in VV. AA. La loi musicale \u2013 Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (d\u00e9s)apprend, \u00e9dited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\n[[Donnerstag aus Licht]] went on stage at the [[Teatro alla Scala]] in Milan in 1981. Stockhausen is a historical reference point: Francesconi admired him for his extraordinary organisational consistency, for his tireless search for a linguistic unity. He was also deeply struck by the visionary quality of this initial opera. He wanted to observe the composer at work so he enrolled in the intensive course that Stockhausen held in Rome that same year. \"From him I learnt rigor, at first imbibing it by osmosis, and then demythologising it.\"<ref>Ricciarda Belgiojoso, Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi, Postmedia Books, 2013</ref>[7]\n\n=== Meeting and collaboration with [[Luciano Berio]] ===\n''Luciano didn't talk much about the more 'technical' and delicate aspects of his work as a composer. I remember that when he least expected it, I would fire questions at him point blank, hoping to pick up some tips. His replies were like enigmas. They had something sacral about them and they required divining rituals to decode them.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Per Luciano, Centro studi Luciano Berio, www.lucianoberio.org</ref>\nWith Berio Francesconi studied above all in the field, just like the workshop artisans of old, acting as his assistant from 1981 to 1984. He worked directly on the score of ''La vera storia'' and participated in the production as rehearsal pianist and second conductor/substitute maestro. In 1984 he collaborated with the composer in the rewriting of Monteverdi's ''Orfeo''. He was also present with Berio at Tanglewood where he attended one of his famous summer courses.\n\n== Activities, works, research ==\n\nIn 1984 three of Francesconi's pieces, including ''Passacaglia'', for large orchestra (1982), were selected for the [[Gaudeamus International Composers Award]] in Amsterdam. This first important recognition on the international scene created a useful tie with the Dutch music scene and laid the foundation for further commissions. Meanwhile, in Italy, thanks to a commission from the Teatro Lirico di Cagliari, Francesconi had the opportunity to seriously put into practice for the first time his idea of a \"polyphony of languages\": ''Suite 1984''. The polyphony that I have in mind hasn't got anything to do with the \"postmodern\" or collage, the exotic pastiche, the provincial chinoiserie of our grandparents (but also of Stockhausen and certain pop groups). Instead, it is a free fusion of ideas in a compact and linguistically very solid body that reveals its profound energies in its inner profundity and not in an exterior heterogeneity. Energies that come from the earth, from popular culture, from ancient African and Oriental cultures.<ref name=\"auto5\">Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in AA.VV. La loi musicale \u2013 Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (d\u00e9s)apprend, edited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\"In 1984 the Teatro Lirico in Cagliari presented a quartet made up of the pianist and composer [[Franco D'Andrea]] together with the group Africa Djol\u00e9 led by the master percussionist Fode Youla from Guinea. The idea was then conceived that the music of this group be recreated in symphonic form (''Suite 1984'') by the 28 year-old Luca Francesconi for a performance by the theatre's orchestra under the direction of Francesconi himself, a recent product of rigorous musical studies, assistant to Luciano Berio and 'jazz student of D'Andrea', as he used to like to define himself. The concert attracted experts from all over the place anxious to hear novelties and promising syncretisms of various musical civilisations, and it was a triumph.\"<ref name=\"auto7\">Franco Fayenz, Si chiude la ribalta della Scala per Quartett, antologia di soluzioni geniali, Il Sole 24 ore, May 8th 2011</ref> \"Orchestra, African percussionists and jazz quintet: the choice of instrumental make-up itself contained in an explicit manner the generative nucleus of one of the principal aesthetic motors of the music of Luca Francesconi: the tendency to place alongside one another, following the rules of contrast and fusion, sounds and languages of highly diverse origins.\"<ref>Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani- VII Appendix (2007)</ref>\n\n=== 1984-1990 ===\n\nFrancesconi's first record, an LP recorded in the United States, contained ''Viaggiatore insonne'', on a text by [[Sandro Penna]]. \"Francesconi's attitude as a composer is in fact similar to that of a tireless traveller, who explores linguistic spaces in search of their ever shifting confines, and who conducts an etiological study to determine the confines between noise and sound, between instinct and reason.\"<ref name=\"auto3\">Robert Coheur, A fuoco, 4\u00b0 studio sulla memoria, www.modernmusix.com</ref>\nThe new piece ''Vertige'', for string orchestra, was performed in Strasbourg. Francesconi composed various works for ensemble which were performed in Cagliari (''Onda sonante'', for eight instruments, commissioned by the Nieuw Ensemble; conductor: Ed Spanjaard (1985)), Paris (''Tracce'', for flute (1986)), Citt\u00e0 di Castello (''Da cap''o, for nine instruments (1988)), Middelburg (Finta-di-nulla, for soprano and nineteen instruments on a text by Umberto Fiori; Xenakis Ensemble; conductor: Diego Masson; and soprano: Marie Duisit (1991)), and Brussels (''Encore/Da capo'', for 9 instruments; Ictus Ensemble, conducted by the composer (1995)).\nIn 1984 [[Casa Ricordi]] became Francesconi's publisher and since then has published all his works.\nIn 1985 he was invited to the Festival Musica \u2018900 in Trent for a series of public conversations with [[Franco Donatoni]]. This meeting proved extremely important; talking with the great Verona composer, both in their public conversations and during train trips together, Francesconi felt that he reached a solution for a number of unresolved problems. ''Plot in fiction'', dedicated to Franco Donatoni, was in many ways the happy outcome of this experience.\n\n=== Plot in Fiction ===\n\n''The really difficult thing is to write works with a rich and articulated complex of meanings and events: works, that is, that are capable of assuming a linguistic structure, of being a world (Mahler!), but whose complexity is transparent.''<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n''Plot in Fiction'', for oboe and cor anglais or clarinet and chamber group (1986), constructs its sonoric line around key notes within a rigorous formal framework.<ref name=\"auto\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia italiana Treccani, VII Appendix, 2007</ref> \"The point here is to find the \"plot\" in the \"fiction\", the narrative line that twists and turns through the complexity and intricacy of a \"mass of everyday symbols\".<ref>Christopher Thomas, Metier, msvcd 92018, www.divineartrecords.com</ref> What's involved is an architecture that guides the listener within the composition: the search for a compositional transparency (without, however, ever slipping into simplicity; the means employed leave unaltered the quality of the composer's thought), based on pure energy, directly perceptible, without any need to exhibit the mechanisms underlying it.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> The piece was performed for the first time at the Festival Musica '900 in Trent by Ensemble Musique Oblique under the direction of Sandro Gorli; the soloist was Diego Dini Ciacci.\n\n=== Mambo ===\n\nAt this point I would say that it is no longer possible to talk of a language devoid of code or morphogenesis, i.e. of a language that comes into being while the aesthetic event is being produced. It's necessary to also come to terms with a substratum, with what I call semantic pressure, that is with history.<ref name=\"auto4\">Ricciarda Belgiojoso, Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi, Postmedia books, 2013</ref>\n\nMambo, for solo piano, is Francesconi's most jazz-like piece, and it reveals clearly his search for an ever uneasy equilibrium between sonoric materials, gathered in their primitive state, and the evocative power of history, from which the composer cannot remove himself. In the piece there is an overlap of a rhythmic ostinato in a low register, a series of ascending-descending diatonic lines, and, finally, a sequence of pounding 4-note chords. In this continual 'friction of contraries' resides the aesthetic motor of Francesconi's music as well as the powerful charge of sonoric seduction that his works carry.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Francesconi exploits as a precious resource the capacity for intense analysis developed in Western culture. He takes a shared musical reference and dissects it remorselessly until he lays bare further possibilities of development, of transformation. Wielding its 'semantic pressure' as though it were a picklock, he presses further and further inwards, towards the energy-bearing roots of sound.\n\n=== AGON, centre for music research and experimentation ===\n\nIt's important for composers to confront the use of computers face-on; even empirically, at a basic level. To search for, study, and promote new means through which to communicate with them, new interfaces. It's important for them to help to lead mankind back to the centre of his machines.<ref>Luca Francesconi, Cerca e ricerca, Milano 1994</ref>\n\nIn 1990 Francesconi founded AGON with two great utopian visions in mind. The first was that it is still possible and desperately important to work together, cooperatively, imagining projects to realise together with others, to exchange experiences, ideas. AGON came into being as an organism with a public identity: \"it is not my or your studio\"; it aspires to be a place where it's possible to talk, meet, and not just pursue one's own interest. The second utopian idea was to start from below and not from high-tech; to depart from the musical needs of composers with a view to stimulating a different relationship, simpler, \"less terroristic\", between real musicians and machines.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Handling electronics also serves, according to Francesconi, to recuperate a physical, auditive approach to musical composition, which, if limited to paper and pencil, runs the risk of becoming too speculative, weakening the direct relationship with the sonoric material.<ref name=\"auto8\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani - VII Appendice (2007)</ref> AGON has for many years been one of the most active centres in Italy for music research and production.<ref name=\"auto8\"/>\n\n=== Riti neurali ===\n\n''Complexity is always a question of quality, not quantity. What really matters is transparency in an overall density. This means that I should only make use of a particularly articulated syntax if I really need to, or, in other words, only if I've got particularly articulated things to say.''<ref name=\"auto2\">Luca Francesconi, Complessit\u00e0, Milan 1989</ref>\n\nComposed in 1991, for violin and eight instruments, ''Riti neurali'' is Francesconi's third study on memory. Like many of his works, it develops the material on multiple levels, pursuing labyrinthine paths. Nonetheless, its clearly delineated textures offer the listener unmistakable points of reference.<ref>Beth E. Levy, Furious Craft, 8 December 2008, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Forum, Music program, San Francisco Contemporary Music Players</ref> The soloist establishes a vast array of relations with the small orchestra (guiding it, allowing himself to be guided, contradicting it, ignoring it, etc.), at the same time assuming various positions himself ... The complexity of the counterpoint arises out of the simultaneity of the various positions.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> \"There are things that evoke other things, or that acquire meaning in relation to other things. We are subjected, in a certain sense, to a historically determined perceptive destiny. Whether we want to be or not. The illusion of the tabula rasa, of pure transparency, is not enough. Probably it's better to take account of this perceptive problem right from the start and to consider it one of the compositional parameters.\"<ref name=\"auto2\"/> The work was commissioned by Radio France and the world premiere took place in Paris on 14 January 1992: [[Asko Ensemble]]; conductor: Denis Cohen, and soloist: Irvine Arditti.\nWhile a series of performances followed on from one another in Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, and Antwerp, an extensive portrait at the Venice Biennale, in 1993, definitively consolidated Francescon's reputation in Italy as well: the Nieuw Ensemble Amsterdam, Arditti and Ensemble Modern (with the newly commissioned Plot II) joined forces in a single concert dedicated to the composer's music at the Teatro La Fenice.\n\n=== Etymo ===\n\n''The great challenge is to maintain in the composer the two levels, the compositional and the emotive, and to ensure that these continually charge each other with responsibility for the form of the work up until in the end they arrive at a balanced result.''<ref>Massimiliano Viel, Incontro con Luca Francesconi: Il calcolo e l'intuizione. L'elettronica come sfida, in Sonus, Materiali per la musica contemporanea, issue n.11, December 1993</ref>\n\nBetween 1993 and 1994 Francesconi worked and taught in Paris in the hyper-technological workshop [[Ircam]], where \"you model sound with your hands\". On commission from Ircam, he carried out computer analysis on sounds and their behaviour right down to their roots, their etymon, to realise \"one of the most convincing and at the same time impetuous musical equivalents of the writing of Baudelaire, striving with clarity of mind to achieve a secure control over the insidious relationship between words and music.\"<ref>David Osmonde Smith, 'Un no man's land fertile: Francesconi et le th\u00e9\u00e2tre musical', in Musica program for Luca Francesconi, Ballata, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie, Brussels, October 2002.</ref>\nThe piece is based almost entirely on [[Baudelaire]]'s poem ''Le Voyage'', of which at two points we hear the soprano declaim two key fragments: \"Dites, qu'avez-vous vu?\" (Speak, what have you seen?). The computer analysis of this question constitutes the DNA that structures the entire piece, from the microstructure to the macroform.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The result is a multi-levelled organism that in 25 minutes lays out its basic material (phonemes, instrumental particles, electronic transformation) and then proceeds to join it all together in increasingly complex structures. Everything begins with a question on the origin of meaning (in Greek: \"etymon\"). What is there before the word, and what models language? And finally, what allows us to transcend language? In the beginning there is pre-language, its premises. Etymo, a work furnished with huge white wings, starts out with the primordial mumblings of language, in phonemes. Nothing is intelligible, alliterations that roll off and slip away (or fluctuate) and an orchestra that appears suspended, as if it were waiting. These phonetic and musical particles aggregate in a contrapuntal overlapping which in the end explodes in an ocean of profundity from which the first words arise.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> An important example of how Francesconi employs electronics in a masterly way to broaden the expressive range and colour of instruments. The physicality of the performance remains at the centre of the work, but the electronics helps it to reach an extreme expressive intensity.<ref>Hubert Culot, Music Web International, Review of Etymo, Da capo, A fuoco, Animus, Kairos</ref>\n''A fuoco ''(1995) is Francesconi's fourth study on memory; ''Animus'', for trombone and computer (1996), was performed in Paris, while the London Sinfonietta took ''Plot in fiction'' to Santa Cecilia in Rome (1996).\n\n=== Wanderer ===\n\n''The effort to formalise creative thought and thought as a whole is extremely important for composers as well, but by the same token the \"analogical\" and qualitative approach of the artist helps to play down their relationship with technological instruments and above all to reaffirm the impossibility of discretising, quantifying human experience; the impossibility of converting into binary code and sending via fibre optic cable the sum total of existence, the totality of aesthetic experience, of the body, of affection, of the world.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Cerca e ricerca, MIlan 1994</ref>\n\nOn 17 January 2000 [[Riccardo Muti]] conducted ''Wanderer'' at the Scala in Milan. \"This voyager is man who, after conducting an inventory of the generations that have preceded him, takes with him only the bare essentials to set out on a path towards the immensity of possible spaces. At the dawn of the new millennium Luca Francesconi frees himself from the crushing weight of tradition, especially that generated by serialism and its worshipers. After extensive research into tempo, into tempi, one might say, into sonoric texture, the composer here explores a type of language that favours narration.<ref name=\"auto6\">Wanderer - Cobalt, Scarlet : two colours of dawn, http://www.lamediatheque.be/travers_sons/0103ag01.html</ref>\n\n=== Cobalt, Scarlet: Two Colours of Dawn ===\n\n''Music is closer than any other form of expression to that nucleus of \"existential energy\" that lives deep within us.''<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n2000 was also the year of Cobalt, Scarlet: Two Colors of Dawn. \"A single movement of twenty three minutes for large orchestra divided into parallel - at times counterpoised \u2013 groups begins with a pianissimo of metallic gleams that emanate alternately from the two sides of the stage. Then, other percussion instruments, wind instruments and brass instruments, join in<!--not a mistake--> in a subdued manner, developing, transforming planes of volume and colour. But it is an unexpected metallic accent exploding like a burst of profundity that fills the auditorium not so much with clamour as with presence, rapture.\"<ref>Chris Pasles, Old works and new shine equally bright, Los Angeles Times, November 22nd 2003</ref> \"With this composition Luca Francesconi reached a turning point in his career, enriching his exploration into the heart of sonoric material with greater sensibility and emotivity. In this way his music acceded to a broader artistic dimension, that of a harmonious encounter of technique and psychology in the broadest sense of the term.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n== Music theatre ==\n\nFrom 1985 to the present Luca Francesconi has composed eight works of a theatrical stamp, from ''Scene'', on a text by Umberto Fiori, to the chamber opera In ''Ostaggio'', from ''Lips, Eyes Bang'', for actress/singer, twelve instruments and live audio/video, to the video-opera Striaz. ''Ballata'',  commissioned by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de La Monnaie in Brussels/di Bruxelles and with stage direction by Achim Freyer, was staged in 2002.\n\n=== Ballata ===\n''My idea was to turn over a new leaf, to free myself so to speak from the 20th century. I wanted to use all the expressive densities that that century conceded to me, and for me it was a kind of synthesis of the musical experiences that had struck me most.''<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nIn 1994 Luca Francesconi had realised an opera for radio (and eventual winner of the Prix Italia), ''Ballata del rovescio del mondo'', on a text by Umberto Fiori; in 1996 his continuing, close collaboration with the Milan poet resulted in his third work for music theatre, ''Ballata'', drawn from [[Samuel Coleridge]]'s  [[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]. Divided into two acts, ''Ballata'' makes use of a large orchestra with an enlarged percussion section; on the right of the stage is an instrumental ensemble inspired by Gypsy orchestras, while four female choirs distributed at the four angles of the auditorium \"function as walls that open and close towards the irrational, memory, towards flashbacks\". Electronic sounds elaborated at Ircam<ref>Anne Genette, Ballata, www.lamediatheque.</ref> contribute to the spatial disorientation. Originally, for the role of the ancient mariner, Francesconi had thought of Sting, with whom he had recorded the first song of the opera ''Day After Day''.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> In the end, however, the collaboration did not eventuate for reasons of language (Sting did not feel up to singing and acting in Italian), but the idea remained of a present-day narrator who, like the ancient mariner, is condemned to wander around the globe in search of someone to whom to recount his incredible adventures, from shipwreck to the glaciers of the South Pole, from the scorching sun of the equator to the appearance of monsters and a phantomatic sailing ship. The temporal plane is split: on stage the ancient mariner tells his story and at the same time he appears as a young man in the midst of a storm. Various compositional techniques follow on from one another, from early expressionism onwards, integrated with other traditions, like folk music. \"Luca Francesconi develops an orchestral writing that is inventive, sensual and seductive all at the same time, deftly integrating electronic resources elaborated by Ircam. But, much more, he makes masterful use of an armoury of ardent vocality that is seasoned but anything but worn-out \u2013 from Brecht's spoken song to Monteverdi's madrigal, passing from the songs of English Baroque opera to all the immortals of Italian lyric opera, from Verdi to Berio, of whom he was a student.\"<ref>Marie-Aude Roux, Ballata, drame syncretique de Francesconi, Le Monde, November 14th, 2002</ref>\n\n=== Buffa opera ===\n\n''Who said that music today necessarily has to create angst? It's enough to think that Albanese used to come running onto the stage pursued by a cigarette two and half metres tall.''<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\n''Buffa opera'', on a text by  [[Stefano Benni]], went on stage at the Piccolo Teatro di Milano in 2002. It featured [[Antonio Albanese]] on stage for the whole opera as actor/singer alongside the chorus and the Buffa orchestra, a fully-fledged character, conducted by the composer himself. Linking up with the tradition of opera buffa, ''Buffa opera'' is an immediately accessible piece of comic music theatre which filled the Piccolo Teatro for thirty evenings before being revived at the Teatro Morlacchi in Perugia.<ref>Anna Bandettini, L'umanit\u00e0 salvata da uno scarafaggio, Repubblica, May 11th  2002</ref> \"It was not difficult to imagine that Stefano Benni's text, with its surreal metaphors, would prove so enjoyable. And it was just as easy to predict that the highly inventive 'libretto' would be greatly enhanced by the likeability, comicality and irony of a superb actor like Antonio Albanese. What was less obvious, however, was that the music of Luca Francesconi would prove just as appealing. Not because the Milan musician doesn't have the track record of a thoroughbred composer but because on perusing his catalogue \u2013 a very extensive one for an under-50 \u2013 one is struck by the presence of pieces characterised by a highly dramatic temper, if not by an out-and-out tragic intensity. Instead, in Buffa Opera, a work in which the world of today is seen from the partial but acute perspective of insects \u2013 be they cockroaches, bees, butterflies or spiders \u2013 Francesconi was able to use a vast array of stylistically characterised objects (from jazz to avant-garde, from the musical to the canzonetta) to send up the music of today and the way that it is consumed\".<ref>Enrico Girardi, Musica buffa per insetti, Corriere della sera, May 22nd 2002</ref>\n\nCommissioned by the Holland Festival, ''Gesualdo Considered as a Murderer'', on a libretto by Vittorio Sermonti, was performed for the first time in Amsterdam in June 2004. It was directed by Giorgio Barberio Corsetti. \"The overall work, ably supported by remarkable performances by Davide Damiani in the role of Gesualdo, Eberhard Franscesco Lorenz in the role of his Iago-like servant and especially Alda Caiello in the role of his wife's chambermaid, revealed a highly passionate motivation \u2013 a demonstration of very mature theatre on the part of a composer with a genuine talent for drama\".<ref>Andrew Clements, Gesualdo Considered as a Murder, The Guardian, Friday 11 June 2004</ref>\n[[File:Quartett in Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|Quartett in Buenos Aires, Col\u00f3n Theater, June 2015]]\n\n=== Quartett ===\n{{Advert|date=August 2018}}\n''Don't run the risk of coming, unless you're prepared to be forced to call into question what you do and what you are. This is a violent, blasphemous opera made up of raw sexual instincts and total absence of compassion. The only two characters on stage are the personification of cynicism; they have vowed never to love again.''<ref>[[Tom Service]], Luca Francesconi: do you dare go to his opera?, The Guardian, 19 June 2014</ref>\n\n2011 saw the world premiere at the Scala in Milan of an opera that has since been taking the world by storm: 45 performances in three different full productions and in concert form. Luca Francesconi's eighth music theatre work, jointly commissioned by Teatro alla Scala, Wiener Festwochen and Ircam, is entitled ''Quartett'' and is based on a text by [[Heiner M\u00fcller]] drawn in its turn from [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]'s [[Les liaisons dangereuses]]. The title is in German, as in M\u00fcller's work, while the libretto has been elaborated by the composer himself in English from the original text: \"Because the English language, even in its most beautiful and elegant form, is by now a kind of Esperanto. And because it is the language that best fits in with the syncretisms of European music, jazz, folk, popular music and electronics that have long been present in my scores\".<ref name=\"auto7\"/> The opera has a single act, thirteen scenes, and lasts a total of an hour and twenty minutes. Only two characters on stage, a small orchestra in the orchestra pit, a large orchestra and choir off-stage (available as a recording effected at the Scala in Milan), and electronics (Studio Ircam, Serge Lemouton: live and pre-recorded sounds).\nThe stage direction at the Scala was entrusted to Alex Olle of [[La Fura dels Baus]], who concentrated the action in a huge box suspended twelve metres above the stage, projecting onto the full breadth of the backdrop videos representing the outside world. Allison Cook, mezzo-soprano, interpreted the Marquise de Merteuil, alternating with Sinead Mulhern; Robin Adams, baritone, was Vicomte de Valmont. The conductor was Susanna M\u00e4lkki. This production was revived in 2012 in Vienna (Wiener FestWochen: conductor: Peter Rundel), in 2013 at the Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam (the opening of the Holland Festival; conductor: Susanna M\u00e4lkki) and at the Opera di Lille (Ensemble Ictus: conductor: Georges-Elie Octors), and in 2014 in Lisbon (Gulbenkian Foundation: conductor: Susanna M\u00e4lkki).\n\n''Quartett'' was performed in concert form at the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris by Ensemble Intercontemporain (March 2013). A first new production was staged in Porto and Strasburg, once again with Allison Cook and Robin Adams, and with Remix Ensemble under the direction of Brad Lubman. The stage direction, scenery and costumes were by Nuno Carinhas and the lighting by Nuno Meira (Casa da Musica in Porto on 24 September 2013 and Festival Musica in Strasburg on 28 September 2013).\n\nThe opera was produced again in London by the Royal Opera House in a coproduction with the Op\u00e9ra di Rouen and the London Sinfonietta, from 18 to 28 June 2014, with stage direction by John Fulljames. Two casts alternated for the ten performances (Leigh Melrose and Kristin Ch\u00e1vez; and Mark Stone and Angelica Voje) on the metallic structures of a post-atomic bunker realised by Soutra Gilmour, with lighting by Bruno Poet and videos by Ravi Deepres projected onto tattered screens dropped from above in the restrained atmosphere of the Linbury Studio. Under the structures warm and dim lights lit up the London Sinfonietta, conducted by Andrew Gourlay.\n\nIn 2015 the Malm\u00f6 Opera presented a fourth production. It was directed by Stefan Johansson, with scenery by Jan Lundberg. Kirstin Chavez interpreted the Marquise de Merteuil and Christian Miedl Vicomte de Valmont; the conductor was Ralf Kircher.\n\nThe La Fura  del Baus production was performed again in Buenos Aires, [[Col\u00f3n Theater]], in June 2015, with Allison Cook and Robin Adams, director Alex Olle, conductor Brad Lubman. \"The press wasn't indifferent at all: \"La Fura dels Baus strikes in America as well\" (El Pa\u00eds); \"An high voltage opera\" (Clar\u00edn); \"To the limits of the opera\" (La Naci\u00f3n); \"Portrait of a crippled bourgeoisie\" (P\u00e1gina 12). \"Quartett: a wonderful and yet very demanding opera\" (\u00c1mbito Financiero).<ref>Alexander Destuet, Quartett de Luca Francesconi: la Fura dels Baus ataca otra vez, La Vanguardia  July 3rd 2015</ref>\n\n==== Conception ====\n\"Heiner M\u00fcller's idea centres on the relationship of a couple: a man and a woman enclosed in a room. They evidently have a past, as well as a turbulent present; there is a kind of fa\u00e7ade that clearly serves to hide certain things, but it is torn apart by the conflict that lies behind it and that explodes in a fierce, indeed cruel manner. It is clear that something sinister lies in the background: manipulation, betrayal, jealousy. This is not a 19th century opera, but rather an authentic multi-media experience: two orchestras, plus a choir. There is a chamber orchestra, agile and quick, that produces an initial perceptive short circuit: we hear a number of things from very close up, as if we were peeking into the protagonists' private life. Then there is an intermediate space, which is the space of dreams, in which the sound begins to become softer. Finally, there is the additional space of 'out there', which is actually beyond the theatre: a large orchestra and a large choir that are elsewhere and that are reproduced in the theatre by technological means thereby creating a different time and space. A room, almost a cell, a prison, is suspended in mid-air. So we see the characters move and act like insects in a terrarium, as they transform, exchange roles, impersonate a kind of tiny theatre all of their own, change masks. At the end of this dramaturgic construction there remains only the woman, leaving us to intuit an idea of salvation.\"<ref>Quartett - interview to Luca Francesconi, Teatro alla Scala, Season 2010/2011</ref>\n\n== The Venice Biennale ==\nToday's semantic dictionary can put us in contact with other cultures, embolden us to recuperate magmatic sonorities. The Tarantola del Salento, the songs of Sardinia, African polyphonies. Ethnic music can open deep landscapes of the soul, obscure regions, forgotten loci of consciousness. It's necessary to be courageous, and, like Tarkovsky's Stalker, venture to where ferocious energies lie, in their primitive state. Not \"stravaganti\" (strange) but \"extra vagans\" (wandering beyond) towards the incandescent core of origins<ref>Giuseppina Manin, La musica \u00e8 finita, Corriere della sera, September 16th 2008</ref>\n\nFrom 2008 to 2011 Francesconi was the artistic director of the Venice Music Biennale. His imprint was immediately recognisable in the themes of the four festivals (\"Roots/Future\", \"The body of sound\", \"Don Giovanni and the man of stone\" and \"Mutants\") and it broadened out further in the conception of the festival as the ideal place \"to seek new and different forms of perception and attention.\"<ref>Silva Menetto, Alla Biennale protagonisti il Don Giovanni a Venezia e giovani ensemble da tutta Europa, Il Sole 24 ore, September 30th 2010</ref> Beyond the confines of concert halls and theatres, listeners freely chose how to approach the music, which was disseminated through the city as though on a stage in movement, accessible and without limits. This was the basic idea behind Exit, the celebratory evening/night that brought each of the four festivals to a close, transforming the Teatro alle Tese into a distended human body (Exit 02), \"an experience with variable geometry, a new way of living space, sound and time from sunset to dawn\",<ref>Giacomo Botteri, La ricerca dei valori e delle idealit\u00e0 perdute, domenica 19 ottobre 2008, www.nonsolocinema.it</ref> or inviting the public to take a boat towards the Island of San Michele to pay homage to Stravinsky in the form of three clarinet pieces at his tomb and to then participate in a banquet that evoked the finale of Don Giovanni. Don Giovanni was also at the heart of one of the most famous experiments in this four-year period: \"Palazzo Pisani, home of the B. Marcello Conservatory, is the site chosen for the staging of Don Giovanni a Venezia, conceived by Francesconi himself. For this initiative, which has been defined as an opera-labyrinth, the public is asked not just to exercise its sensibility but also its intelligence, so as to try to create a kind of gap between space and time in which music can be inserted. After scrapping the old structure of the concert, Francesconi borrows three key scenes from Mozart's original \u2013 the duel between Don Giovanni and the Commendatore, the seduction of Zerlina and the death of Don Giovanni \u2013 and puts them on stage cyclically, in three different locations within the ancient Venetian palace, inserting in the loggie, palace rooms and courtyards another eight original pieces commissioned from contemporary composers. The spectator, as if he were to enter into a huge gallery and to decide autonomously how and what to look at, will have before his eyes a plurality of musical, scenic, theatrical and visual events to combine, putting aside the perceptive habits of space and time.\"<ref>Silva Menetto, Alla Biennale protagonisti il Don Giovanni a Venezia e giovani ensemble da tutta Europa, Il Sole 24 ore, September 16th 2010</ref>\n\n== Teaching ==\n''This thing which has happened to me is unique much more than rare. In any case, I think it important to draw it to the attention of the readers of the Giornale della Musica, genuine music lovers in Italy (another rarity). I would not speak about an exquisitely private matter if it did not provide an opportunity to stimulate reflection and perhaps even a debate on the disastrous state in which culture in Italy finds itself, in particular musical culture. I have resigned from the State Conservatory.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Il sacrificio dei musicisti italiani, Milano, 2005</ref>\n\nLuca Francesconi has taught for twenty five years in Italy's conservatories and at the University of Ohio, in Rotterdam and in Strasburg. He has held master classes throughout Europe and the world, from Japan to the United States, from China to Canada. Until 2019 he has taught composition at the [[Malm\u00f6 Academy of Music]] (part of [[Lund University]]), where he directed the composition department.\n\n== Other collaborations ==\n''I learnt a huge amount from the way Ronconi worked on a text, an out-and-out excavation down to the deepest level.''<ref>Ricciarda Belgiojoso, \"A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi\", Postmedia Books, 2013</ref>\n\n2000 marked two other important experiences. The Piccolo Teatro in Milan commissioned him to write the music for Calder\u00f3n de la Barca's pi\u00e8ce La vida es sue\u00f1o, with stage direction by Luca Ronconi, who in that very year took over the direction of the theatre from Giorgio Strehler.\nHe wrote the music for Paolo Rosa's film Il mnemonista, produced by Studio Azzurro.\n\n== 2014 ==\nTwo important international symphonic commissions mark the year.\n\n=== Duende. The Dark Notes ===\nA dangerous descent into the infernal depths of the dark notes, to rediscover a primordial force in perhaps the most history-laden instrument of the West.<ref>Attilio Piovano, \u2018Duende, the Dark Notes\u2018 di Luca Francesconi in prima a Torino, Il corriere musicale, May 3rd 2014</ref>\n\nWritten for the extraordinary soloist Leila Josefowicz, this concerto for violin and orchestra was jointly commissioned by SR Swedish Radio and the BBC Proms. Performed in Stockholm in February 2014, in Turin in May 2014 and in June 2015 for the BBC Proms. \u00abIt was well worth the wait. As the title suggests, Francesconi's concerto takes the idea of the Duende, the dark, demonic spirit of flamenco, as its starting point, but the music never seems simplistically pictorial or programmatic. Instead, with the violin as protagonist, the five movements (the last two merged seamlessly together) evoke a threatening world of extremes, of heightened emotions and dramatically contrasted colours and registers. The orchestra weaves febrile webs around solo writing whose cracked arpeggios and steep scales manage to be more or less traditionally virtuosic within musical contexts that are anything but conventional, especially in the ferocious cadenza at the heart of the final movement. Josefowicz's playing was immensely committed and astoundingly vivid, and it emerged in even sharper, more subtle focus in the Radio 3 recording, which also resolved many of the textures that had seemed rather blurred in the hall.\u00bb<ref>Andrew Clements, Prom 13: BBCSO/M\u00e4lkki/Josefowicz review \u2013 committed and astoundingly vivid, The Guardian, July 28th 2015</ref>\n\n''Duende'' was ranked number 6 in the Guardian's list of the top 10 classical concerts and operas of 2015<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/16/top-10-classical-concerts-opera-2015|title=The top 10 classical concerts and operas of 2015|first1=Andrew|last1=Clements|first2=Guardian|last2=music|date=December 16, 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Dentro non ha tempo ===\n\"Curious, that title, 'Dentro non ha tempo'. It can be read in three ways: as the temporal suspension that someone who dies leaves in those that have loved him/her. As a reference to the great musical tradition from which Luciana came, the Abbado family: a homage to the past that has no time. Finally, an allusion to the form of the composition, based on three bars of Mozart's Don Giovanni dilated 29 times.

Radio Filharmonisch Orkest, conductor Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4.

(The Strasbourg MUSICA festival presented the French premiere on 3 October at the closing concert of the festival's 33rd edition.)<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\"When two pianos are involved, we can imagine them as two, frighteningly powerful, fiendish machines. With this piece, in addition to the two pianos, there's also a symphonic orchestra: I love the play of mirrors and the spell-binding multiplications of two pianos in unison with an orchestra. It's an infinite source of meanings: meanings that I need to find, in spite of the destructuration of reality all around us. In a small gesture towards this powerful resistance, I have incorporated a brief homage to Luciano Berio's Concerto for Two Pianos, one of the pieces that have left a profound mark on my life.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ricordi.com/it-IT/|title=Ricordi|website=www.ricordi.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Bread, water and salt ===\n\nOn October 3 at the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome, Sir Antonio Pappano together with the soprano Pumeza Matshikiza and the Orchestra and Choir of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, performed the world premiere of ''Bread, Water and Salt'' on texts by [[Nelson Mandela]]. This piece by Francesconi has been chosen to inaugurate the Orchestra di Santa Cecilia's 2015-16 concert season and will be dedicated by the orchestra to Ludwig van Beethoven.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\nFrancesconi says: \"This piece was planned together with the 9th Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven, in order to create a link between the brotherhood idea of Beethoven and Schiller and what it may means today. We've chosen Mandela because of his simple adherence to the spirituality of the body, of the bread, of the sofference that can be defeated. Of the goodness, that may seem a worn out common place to us, but for the people who have nothing left, not even dignity, it is the part of the human being that may save them, that may save us. It may defeat the cold  cynicism that perverts our relationships.

His father was a painter<ref>Giancarlo Francesconi, by E. Tadini, Milano, Salone Annunciata, 1959</ref> who edited Il Corriere dei piccoli and conceived Il Corriere dei ragazzi,<ref>Sergio Badino, Conversazione con Carlo Chendi. Da Pepito alla Disney e oltre: cinquant'anni di fumetto vissuti da protagonista, Tenu\u00e9 2006</ref> while his mother, an advertiser, created a number of famous advertising campaigns. Francesconi spent his early years in QT8, a working class quarter in Milan that rose up alongside a huge pile of post-war rubble which would later become Monte Stella. At the age of five, won over by a concert by Svjatoslav Richter, he began to learn the piano. Although he was accepted into the junior high school section of the city's conservatory six years later, he instinctively pulled out, thinking that it was too academic and conventional. Instead,  even though he had in the meantime moved with his family to a more central quarter of Milan, Francesconi opted to attend the junior high school in QT8. In this way from a very early age his relationship with music and life in general took on a course of responsibility and constant choice, of research and direct experimentation.\n\n== Education ==\n''We need to profoundly rethink and filter in a determined way the enormously rich potential that has been elaborated in the past and to use it for expressive purposes.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in VV. AA.  La loi musicale \u2013 Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (d\u00e9s)apprend, edited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\nFrancesconi returned to the Conservatory of Milan in 1974, while he was still attending the Berchet Classical Languages High School, and explored the length and breadth of the musical landscape, taking an interest in every possible dimension of sound.<ref name=\"auto1\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani - Appendix VII (2007)</ref> He played in jazz and rock groups as well as in classical concerts, he worked as a session man in recording studios, and he composed music for theatre, cinema, advertising, and television. These were all rewarding experiences, not least from an economic point of view, but they were not enough. He realised that a truly living language, while looking at the present, draws its lifeblood from its roots. The time had come for him to dig into the tradition of music to which he belonged. The Milan Conservatory was opening more and more space to contemporary music so Francesconi enrolled in the composition course conducted by Azio Corghi. \"From him I learnt the trade, the fundamentals, counterpoint and those things, professional seriousness and open-mindedness.\"<ref>Ricciarda Belgiojoso, \"Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi\", Postmedia Books, 2013</ref> In the meantime he continued to explore electronic music and in 1977 took time out to immerse himself in jazz at the Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\n=== A student of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]===\n''The mountain is in front of us and it is necessary to pass over it, with enormous force and patience. It's not enough just to contemplate it nor to sneak by it via secondary paths much less go backwards claiming that the mountain is not there.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in VV. AA. La loi musicale \u2013 Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (d\u00e9s)apprend, \u00e9dited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\n[[Donnerstag aus Licht]] went on stage at the [[Teatro alla Scala]] in Milan in 1981. Stockhausen is a historical reference point: Francesconi admired him for his extraordinary organisational consistency, for his tireless search for a linguistic unity. He was also deeply struck by the visionary quality of this initial opera. He wanted to observe the composer at work so he enrolled in the intensive course that Stockhausen held in Rome that same year. \"From him I learnt rigor, at first imbibing it by osmosis, and then demythologising it.\"<ref>Ricciarda Belgiojoso, Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi, Postmedia Books, 2013</ref>[7]\n\n=== Meeting and collaboration with [[Luciano Berio]] ===\n''Luciano didn't talk much about the more 'technical' and delicate aspects of his work as a composer. I remember that when he least expected it, I would fire questions at him point blank, hoping to pick up some tips. His replies were like enigmas. They had something sacral about them and they required divining rituals to decode them.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Per Luciano, Centro studi Luciano Berio, www.lucianoberio.org</ref>\nWith Berio Francesconi studied above all in the field, just like the workshop artisans of old, acting as his assistant from 1981 to 1984. He worked directly on the score of ''La vera storia'' and participated in the production as rehearsal pianist and second conductor/substitute maestro. In 1984 he collaborated with the composer in the rewriting of Monteverdi's ''Orfeo''. He was also present with Berio at Tanglewood where he attended one of his famous summer courses.\n\n== Activities, works, research ==\n\nIn 1984 three of Francesconi's pieces, including ''Passacaglia'', for large orchestra (1982), were selected for the [[Gaudeamus International Composers Award]] in Amsterdam. This first important recognition on the international scene created a useful tie with the Dutch music scene and laid the foundation for further commissions. Meanwhile, in Italy, thanks to a commission from the Teatro Lirico di Cagliari, Francesconi had the opportunity to seriously put into practice for the first time his idea of a \"polyphony of languages\": ''Suite 1984''. The polyphony that I have in mind hasn't got anything to do with the \"postmodern\" or collage, the exotic pastiche, the provincial chinoiserie of our grandparents (but also of Stockhausen and certain pop groups). Instead, it is a free fusion of ideas in a compact and linguistically very solid body that reveals its profound energies in its inner profundity and not in an exterior heterogeneity. Energies that come from the earth, from popular culture, from ancient African and Oriental cultures.<ref name=\"auto5\">Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in AA.VV. La loi musicale \u2013 Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (d\u00e9s)apprend, edited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\"In 1984 the Teatro Lirico in Cagliari presented a quartet made up of the pianist and composer [[Franco D'Andrea]] together with the group Africa Djol\u00e9 led by the master percussionist Fode Youla from Guinea. The idea was then conceived that the music of this group be recreated in symphonic form (''Suite 1984'') by the 28 year-old Luca Francesconi for a performance by the theatre's orchestra under the direction of Francesconi himself, a recent product of rigorous musical studies, assistant to Luciano Berio and 'jazz student of D'Andrea', as he used to like to define himself. The concert attracted experts from all over the place anxious to hear novelties and promising syncretisms of various musical civilisations, and it was a triumph.\"<ref name=\"auto7\">Franco Fayenz, Si chiude la ribalta della Scala per Quartett, antologia di soluzioni geniali, Il Sole 24 ore, May 8th 2011</ref> \"Orchestra, African percussionists and jazz quintet: the choice of instrumental make-up itself contained in an explicit manner the generative nucleus of one of the principal aesthetic motors of the music of Luca Francesconi: the tendency to place alongside one another, following the rules of contrast and fusion, sounds and languages of highly diverse origins.\"<ref>Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani- VII Appendix (2007)</ref>\n\n=== 1984-1990 ===\n\nFrancesconi's first record, an LP recorded in the United States, contained ''Viaggiatore insonne'', on a text by [[Sandro Penna]]. \"Francesconi's attitude as a composer is in fact similar to that of a tireless traveller, who explores linguistic spaces in search of their ever shifting confines, and who conducts an etiological study to determine the confines between noise and sound, between instinct and reason.\"<ref name=\"auto3\">Robert Coheur, A fuoco, 4\u00b0 studio sulla memoria, www.modernmusix.com</ref>\nThe new piece ''Vertige'', for string orchestra, was performed in Strasbourg. Francesconi composed various works for ensemble which were performed in Cagliari (''Onda sonante'', for eight instruments, commissioned by the Nieuw Ensemble; conductor: Ed Spanjaard (1985)), Paris (''Tracce'', for flute (1986)), Citt\u00e0 di Castello (''Da cap''o, for nine instruments (1988)), Middelburg (Finta-di-nulla, for soprano and nineteen instruments on a text by Umberto Fiori; Xenakis Ensemble; conductor: Diego Masson; and soprano: Marie Duisit (1991)), and Brussels (''Encore/Da capo'', for 9 instruments; Ictus Ensemble, conducted by the composer (1995)).\nIn 1984 [[Casa Ricordi]] became Francesconi's publisher and since then has published all his works.\nIn 1985 he was invited to the Festival Musica \u2018900 in Trent for a series of public conversations with [[Franco Donatoni]]. This meeting proved extremely important; talking with the great Verona composer, both in their public conversations and during train trips together, Francesconi felt that he reached a solution for a number of unresolved problems. ''Plot in fiction'', dedicated to Franco Donatoni, was in many ways the happy outcome of this experience.\n\n=== Plot in Fiction ===\n\n''The really difficult thing is to write works with a rich and articulated complex of meanings and events: works, that is, that are capable of assuming a linguistic structure, of being a world (Mahler!), but whose complexity is transparent.''<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n''Plot in Fiction'', for oboe and cor anglais or clarinet and chamber group (1986), constructs its sonoric line around key notes within a rigorous formal framework.<ref name=\"auto\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia italiana Treccani, VII Appendix, 2007</ref> \"The point here is to find the \"plot\" in the \"fiction\", the narrative line that twists and turns through the complexity and intricacy of a \"mass of everyday symbols\".<ref>Christopher Thomas, Metier, msvcd 92018, www.divineartrecords.com</ref> What's involved is an architecture that guides the listener within the composition: the search for a compositional transparency (without, however, ever slipping into simplicity; the means employed leave unaltered the quality of the composer's thought), based on pure energy, directly perceptible, without any need to exhibit the mechanisms underlying it.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> The piece was performed for the first time at the Festival Musica '900 in Trent by Ensemble Musique Oblique under the direction of Sandro Gorli; the soloist was Diego Dini Ciacci.\n\n=== Mambo ===\n\nAt this point I would say that it is no longer possible to talk of a language devoid of code or morphogenesis, i.e. of a language that comes into being while the aesthetic event is being produced. It's necessary to also come to terms with a substratum, with what I call semantic pressure, that is with history.<ref name=\"auto4\">Ricciarda Belgiojoso, Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi, Postmedia books, 2013</ref>\n\nMambo, for solo piano, is Francesconi's most jazz-like piece, and it reveals clearly his search for an ever uneasy equilibrium between sonoric materials, gathered in their primitive state, and the evocative power of history, from which the composer cannot remove himself. In the piece there is an overlap of a rhythmic ostinato in a low register, a series of ascending-descending diatonic lines, and, finally, a sequence of pounding 4-note chords. In this continual 'friction of contraries' resides the aesthetic motor of Francesconi's music as well as the powerful charge of sonoric seduction that his works carry.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Francesconi exploits as a precious resource the capacity for intense analysis developed in Western culture. He takes a shared musical reference and dissects it remorselessly until he lays bare further possibilities of development, of transformation. Wielding its 'semantic pressure' as though it were a picklock, he presses further and further inwards, towards the energy-bearing roots of sound.\n\n=== AGON, centre for music research and experimentation ===\n\nIt's important for composers to confront the use of computers face-on; even empirically, at a basic level. To search for, study, and promote new means through which to communicate with them, new interfaces. It's important for them to help to lead mankind back to the centre of his machines.<ref>Luca Francesconi, Cerca e ricerca, Milano 1994</ref>\n\nIn 1990 Francesconi founded AGON with two great utopian visions in mind. The first was that it is still possible and desperately important to work together, cooperatively, imagining projects to realise together with others, to exchange experiences, ideas. AGON came into being as an organism with a public identity: \"it is not my or your studio\"; it aspires to be a place where it's possible to talk, meet, and not just pursue one's own interest. The second utopian idea was to start from below and not from high-tech; to depart from the musical needs of composers with a view to stimulating a different relationship, simpler, \"less terroristic\", between real musicians and machines.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Handling electronics also serves, according to Francesconi, to recuperate a physical, auditive approach to musical composition, which, if limited to paper and pencil, runs the risk of becoming too speculative, weakening the direct relationship with the sonoric material.<ref name=\"auto8\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani - VII Appendice (2007)</ref> AGON has for many years been one of the most active centres in Italy for music research and production.<ref name=\"auto8\"/>\n\n=== Riti neurali ===\n\n''Complexity is always a question of quality, not quantity. What really matters is transparency in an overall density. This means that I should only make use of a particularly articulated syntax if I really need to, or, in other words, only if I've got particularly articulated things to say.''<ref name=\"auto2\">Luca Francesconi, Complessit\u00e0, Milan 1989</ref>\n\nComposed in 1991, for violin and eight instruments, ''Riti neurali'' is Francesconi's third study on memory. Like many of his works, it develops the material on multiple levels, pursuing labyrinthine paths.

We are subjected, in a certain sense, to a historically determined perceptive destiny. Whether we want to be or not. The illusion of the tabula rasa, of pure transparency, is not enough.

L'elettronica come sfida, in Sonus, Materiali per la musica contemporanea, issue n.11, December 1993</ref>\n\nBetween 1993 and 1994 Francesconi worked and taught in Paris in the hyper-technological workshop [[Ircam]], where \"you model sound with your hands\". On commission from Ircam, he carried out computer analysis on sounds and their behaviour right down to their roots, their etymon, to realise \"one of the most convincing and at the same time impetuous musical equivalents of the writing of Baudelaire, striving with clarity of mind to achieve a secure control over the insidious relationship between words and music.\"<ref>David Osmonde Smith, 'Un no man's land fertile: Francesconi et le th\u00e9\u00e2tre musical', in Musica program for Luca Francesconi, Ballata, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie, Brussels, October 2002.</ref>\nThe piece is based almost entirely on [[Baudelaire]]'s poem ''Le Voyage'', of which at two points we hear the soprano declaim two key fragments: \"Dites, qu'avez-vous vu?\" (Speak, what have you seen?). The computer analysis of this question constitutes the DNA that structures the entire piece, from the microstructure to the macroform.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The result is a multi-levelled organism that in 25 minutes lays out its basic material (phonemes, instrumental particles, electronic transformation) and then proceeds to join it all together in increasingly complex structures. Everything begins with a question on the origin of meaning (in Greek: \"etymon\"). What is there before the word, and what models language? And finally, what allows us to transcend language? In the beginning there is pre-language, its premises. Etymo, a work furnished with huge white wings, starts out with the primordial mumblings of language, in phonemes. Nothing is intelligible, alliterations that roll off and slip away (or fluctuate) and an orchestra that appears suspended, as if it were waiting. These phonetic and musical particles aggregate in a contrapuntal overlapping which in the end explodes in an ocean of profundity from which the first words arise.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> An important example of how Francesconi employs electronics in a masterly way to broaden the expressive range and colour of instruments. The physicality of the performance remains at the centre of the work, but the electronics helps it to reach an extreme expressive intensity.<ref>Hubert Culot, Music Web International, Review of Etymo, Da capo, A fuoco, Animus, Kairos</ref>\n''A fuoco ''(1995) is Francesconi's fourth study on memory; ''Animus'', for trombone and computer (1996), was performed in Paris, while the London Sinfonietta took ''Plot in fiction'' to Santa Cecilia in Rome (1996).\n\n=== Wanderer ===\n\n''The effort to formalise creative thought and thought as a whole is extremely important for composers as well, but by the same token the \"analogical\" and qualitative approach of the artist helps to play down their relationship with technological instruments and above all to reaffirm the impossibility of discretising, quantifying human experience; the impossibility of converting into binary code and sending via fibre optic cable the sum total of existence, the totality of aesthetic experience, of the body, of affection, of the world.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Cerca e ricerca, MIlan 1994</ref>\n\nOn 17 January 2000 [[Riccardo Muti]] conducted ''Wanderer'' at the Scala in Milan. \"This voyager is man who, after conducting an inventory of the generations that have preceded him, takes with him only the bare essentials to set out on a path towards the immensity of possible spaces. At the dawn of the new millennium Luca Francesconi frees himself from the crushing weight of tradition, especially that generated by serialism and its worshipers. After extensive research into tempo, into tempi, one might say, into sonoric texture, the composer here explores a type of language that favours narration.<ref name=\"auto6\">Wanderer - Cobalt, Scarlet : two colours of dawn, http://www.lamediatheque.be/travers_sons/0103ag01.html</ref>\n\n=== Cobalt, Scarlet: Two Colours of Dawn ===\n\n''Music is closer than any other form of expression to that nucleus of \"existential energy\" that lives deep within us.''<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n2000 was also the year of Cobalt, Scarlet: Two Colors of Dawn. \"A single movement of twenty three minutes for large orchestra divided into parallel - at times counterpoised \u2013 groups begins with a pianissimo of metallic gleams that emanate alternately from the two sides of the stage. Then, other percussion instruments, wind instruments and brass instruments, join in<!--not a mistake--> in a subdued manner, developing, transforming planes of volume and colour. But it is an unexpected metallic accent exploding like a burst of profundity that fills the auditorium not so much with clamour as with presence, rapture.\"<ref>Chris Pasles, Old works and new shine equally bright, Los Angeles Times, November 22nd 2003</ref> \"With this composition Luca Francesconi reached a turning point in his career, enriching his exploration into the heart of sonoric material with greater sensibility and emotivity. In this way his music acceded to a broader artistic dimension, that of a harmonious encounter of technique and psychology in the broadest sense of the term.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n== Music theatre ==\n\nFrom 1985 to the present Luca Francesconi has composed eight works of a theatrical stamp, from ''Scene'', on a text by Umberto Fiori, to the chamber opera In ''Ostaggio'', from ''Lips, Eyes Bang'', for actress/singer, twelve instruments and live audio/video, to the video-opera Striaz. ''Ballata'',  commissioned by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de La Monnaie in Brussels/di Bruxelles and with stage direction by Achim Freyer, was staged in 2002.\n\n=== Ballata ===\n''My idea was to turn over a new leaf, to free myself so to speak from the 20th century. I wanted to use all the expressive densities that that century conceded to me, and for me it was a kind of synthesis of the musical experiences that had struck me most.''<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nIn 1994 Luca Francesconi had realised an opera for radio (and eventual winner of the Prix Italia), ''Ballata del rovescio del mondo'', on a text by Umberto Fiori; in 1996 his continuing, close collaboration with the Milan poet resulted in his third work for music theatre, ''Ballata'', drawn from [[Samuel Coleridge]]'s  [[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]. Divided into two acts, ''Ballata'' makes use of a large orchestra with an enlarged percussion section; on the right of the stage is an instrumental ensemble inspired by Gypsy orchestras, while four female choirs distributed at the four angles of the auditorium \"function as walls that open and close towards the irrational, memory, towards flashbacks\". Electronic sounds elaborated at Ircam<ref>Anne Genette, Ballata, www.lamediatheque.</ref> contribute to the spatial disorientation. Originally, for the role of the ancient mariner, Francesconi had thought of Sting, with whom he had recorded the first song of the opera ''Day After Day''.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> In the end, however, the collaboration did not eventuate for reasons of language (Sting did not feel up to singing and acting in Italian), but the idea remained of a present-day narrator who, like the ancient mariner, is condemned to wander around the globe in search of someone to whom to recount his incredible adventures, from shipwreck to the glaciers of the South Pole, from the scorching sun of the equator to the appearance of monsters and a phantomatic sailing ship. The temporal plane is split: on stage the ancient mariner tells his story and at the same time he appears as a young man in the midst of a storm. Various compositional techniques follow on from one another, from early expressionism onwards, integrated with other traditions, like folk music. \"Luca Francesconi develops an orchestral writing that is inventive, sensual and seductive all at the same time, deftly integrating electronic resources elaborated by Ircam. But, much more, he makes masterful use of an armoury of ardent vocality that is seasoned but anything but worn-out \u2013 from Brecht's spoken song to Monteverdi's madrigal, passing from the songs of English Baroque opera to all the immortals of Italian lyric opera, from Verdi to Berio, of whom he was a student.\"<ref>Marie-Aude Roux, Ballata, drame syncretique de Francesconi, Le Monde, November 14th, 2002</ref>\n\n=== Buffa opera ===\n\n''Who said that music today necessarily has to create angst? It's enough to think that Albanese used to come running onto the stage pursued by a cigarette two and half metres tall.''<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\n''Buffa opera'', on a text by  [[Stefano Benni]], went on stage at the Piccolo Teatro di Milano in 2002. It featured [[Antonio Albanese]] on stage for the whole opera as actor/singer alongside the chorus and the Buffa orchestra, a fully-fledged character, conducted by the composer himself. Linking up with the tradition of opera buffa, ''Buffa opera'' is an immediately accessible piece of comic music theatre which filled the Piccolo Teatro for thirty evenings before being revived at the Teatro Morlacchi in Perugia.<ref>Anna Bandettini, L'umanit\u00e0 salvata da uno scarafaggio, Repubblica, May 11th  2002</ref> \"It was not difficult to imagine that Stefano Benni's text, with its surreal metaphors, would prove so enjoyable. And it was just as easy to predict that the highly inventive 'libretto' would be greatly enhanced by the likeability, comicality and irony of a superb actor like Antonio Albanese. What was less obvious, however, was that the music of Luca Francesconi would prove just as appealing. Not because the Milan musician doesn't have the track record of a thoroughbred composer but because on perusing his catalogue \u2013 a very extensive one for an under-50 \u2013 one is struck by the presence of pieces characterised by a highly dramatic temper, if not by an out-and-out tragic intensity. Instead, in Buffa Opera, a work in which the world of today is seen from the partial but acute perspective of insects \u2013 be they cockroaches, bees, butterflies or spiders \u2013 Francesconi was able to use a vast array of stylistically characterised objects (from jazz to avant-garde, from the musical to the canzonetta) to send up the music of today and the way that it is consumed\".<ref>Enrico Girardi, Musica buffa per insetti, Corriere della sera, May 22nd 2002</ref>\n\nCommissioned by the Holland Festival, ''Gesualdo Considered as a Murderer'', on a libretto by Vittorio Sermonti, was performed for the first time in Amsterdam in June 2004. It was directed by Giorgio Barberio Corsetti. \"The overall work, ably supported by remarkable performances by Davide Damiani in the role of Gesualdo, Eberhard Franscesco Lorenz in the role of his Iago-like servant and especially Alda Caiello in the role of his wife's chambermaid, revealed a highly passionate motivation \u2013 a demonstration of very mature theatre on the part of a composer with a genuine talent for drama\".<ref>Andrew Clements, Gesualdo Considered as a Murder, The Guardian, Friday 11 June 2004</ref>\n[[File:Quartett in Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|Quartett in Buenos Aires, Col\u00f3n Theater, June 2015]]\n\n=== Quartett ===\n{{Advert|date=August 2018}}\n''Don't run the risk of coming, unless you're prepared to be forced to call into question what you do and what you are.

Luca Francesconi's eighth music theatre work, jointly commissioned by Teatro alla Scala, Wiener Festwochen and Ircam, is entitled ''Quartett'' and is based on a text by [[Heiner M\u00fcller]] drawn in its turn from [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]'s [[Les liaisons dangereuses]]. The title is in German, as in M\u00fcller's work, while the libretto has been elaborated by the composer himself in English from the original text: \"Because the English language, even in its most beautiful and elegant form, is by now a kind of Esperanto. And because it is the language that best fits in with the syncretisms of European music, jazz, folk, popular music and electronics that have long been present in my scores\".<ref name=\"auto7\"/> The opera has a single act, thirteen scenes, and lasts a total of an hour and twenty minutes. Only two characters on stage, a small orchestra in the orchestra pit, a large orchestra and choir off-stage (available as a recording effected at the Scala in Milan), and electronics (Studio Ircam, Serge Lemouton: live and pre-recorded sounds).\nThe stage direction at the Scala was entrusted to Alex Olle of [[La Fura dels Baus]], who concentrated the action in a huge box suspended twelve metres above the stage, projecting onto the full breadth of the backdrop videos representing the outside world. Allison Cook, mezzo-soprano, interpreted the Marquise de Merteuil, alternating with Sinead Mulhern; Robin Adams, baritone, was Vicomte de Valmont. The conductor was Susanna M\u00e4lkki. This production was revived in 2012 in Vienna (Wiener FestWochen: conductor: Peter Rundel), in 2013 at the Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam (the opening of the Holland Festival; conductor: Susanna M\u00e4lkki) and at the Opera di Lille (Ensemble Ictus: conductor: Georges-Elie Octors), and in 2014 in Lisbon (Gulbenkian Foundation: conductor: Susanna M\u00e4lkki).\n\n''Quartett'' was performed in concert form at the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris by Ensemble Intercontemporain (March 2013). A first new production was staged in Porto and Strasburg, once again with Allison Cook and Robin Adams, and with Remix Ensemble under the direction of Brad Lubman. The stage direction, scenery and costumes were by Nuno Carinhas and the lighting by Nuno Meira (Casa da Musica in Porto on 24 September 2013 and Festival Musica in Strasburg on 28 September 2013).\n\nThe opera was produced again in London by the Royal Opera House in a coproduction with the Op\u00e9ra di Rouen and the London Sinfonietta, from 18 to 28 June 2014, with stage direction by John Fulljames. Two casts alternated for the ten performances (Leigh Melrose and Kristin Ch\u00e1vez; and Mark Stone and Angelica Voje) on the metallic structures of a post-atomic bunker realised by Soutra Gilmour, with lighting by Bruno Poet and videos by Ravi Deepres projected onto tattered screens dropped from above in the restrained atmosphere of the Linbury Studio. Under the structures warm and dim lights lit up the London Sinfonietta, conducted by Andrew Gourlay.\n\nIn 2015 the Malm\u00f6 Opera presented a fourth production. It was directed by Stefan Johansson, with scenery by Jan Lundberg. Kirstin Chavez interpreted the Marquise de Merteuil and Christian Miedl Vicomte de Valmont; the conductor was Ralf Kircher.\n\nThe La Fura  del Baus production was performed again in Buenos Aires, [[Col\u00f3n Theater]], in June 2015, with Allison Cook and Robin Adams, director Alex Olle, conductor Brad Lubman. \"The press wasn't indifferent at all: \"La Fura dels Baus strikes in America as well\" (El Pa\u00eds); \"An high voltage opera\" (Clar\u00edn); \"To the limits of the opera\" (La Naci\u00f3n); \"Portrait of a crippled bourgeoisie\" (P\u00e1gina 12). \"Quartett: a wonderful and yet very demanding opera\" (\u00c1mbito Financiero).<ref>Alexander Destuet, Quartett de Luca Francesconi: la Fura dels Baus ataca otra vez, La Vanguardia  July 3rd 2015</ref>\n\n==== Conception ====\n\"Heiner M\u00fcller's idea centres on the relationship of a couple: a man and a woman enclosed in a room. They evidently have a past, as well as a turbulent present; there is a kind of fa\u00e7ade that clearly serves to hide certain things, but it is torn apart by the conflict that lies behind it and that explodes in a fierce, indeed cruel manner. It is clear that something sinister lies in the background: manipulation, betrayal, jealousy. This is not a 19th century opera, but rather an authentic multi-media experience: two orchestras, plus a choir. There is a chamber orchestra, agile and quick, that produces an initial perceptive short circuit: we hear a number of things from very close up, as if we were peeking into the protagonists' private life. Then there is an intermediate space, which is the space of dreams, in which the sound begins to become softer. Finally, there is the additional space of 'out there', which is actually beyond the theatre: a large orchestra and a large choir that are elsewhere and that are reproduced in the theatre by technological means thereby creating a different time and space. A room, almost a cell, a prison, is suspended in mid-air. So we see the characters move and act like insects in a terrarium, as they transform, exchange roles, impersonate a kind of tiny theatre all of their own, change masks. At the end of this dramaturgic construction there remains only the woman, leaving us to intuit an idea of salvation.\"<ref>Quartett - interview to Luca Francesconi, Teatro alla Scala, Season 2010/2011</ref>\n\n== The Venice Biennale ==\nToday's semantic dictionary can put us in contact with other cultures, embolden us to recuperate magmatic sonorities. The Tarantola del Salento, the songs of Sardinia, African polyphonies. Ethnic music can open deep landscapes of the soul, obscure regions, forgotten loci of consciousness. It's necessary to be courageous, and, like Tarkovsky's Stalker, venture to where ferocious energies lie, in their primitive state. Not \"stravaganti\" (strange) but \"extra vagans\" (wandering beyond) towards the incandescent core of origins<ref>Giuseppina Manin, La musica \u00e8 finita, Corriere della sera, September 16th 2008</ref>\n\nFrom 2008 to 2011 Francesconi was the artistic director of the Venice Music Biennale. His imprint was immediately recognisable in the themes of the four festivals (\"Roots/Future\", \"The body of sound\", \"Don Giovanni and the man of stone\" and \"Mutants\") and it broadened out further in the conception of the festival as the ideal place \"to seek new and different forms of perception and attention.\"<ref>Silva Menetto, Alla Biennale protagonisti il Don Giovanni a Venezia e giovani ensemble da tutta Europa, Il Sole 24 ore, September 30th 2010</ref> Beyond the confines of concert halls and theatres, listeners freely chose how to approach the music, which was disseminated through the city as though on a stage in movement, accessible and without limits. This was the basic idea behind Exit, the celebratory evening/night that brought each of the four festivals to a close, transforming the Teatro alle Tese into a distended human body (Exit 02), \"an experience with variable geometry, a new way of living space, sound and time from sunset to dawn\",<ref>Giacomo Botteri, La ricerca dei valori e delle idealit\u00e0 perdute, domenica 19 ottobre 2008, www.nonsolocinema.it</ref> or inviting the public to take a boat towards the Island of San Michele to pay homage to Stravinsky in the form of three clarinet pieces at his tomb and to then participate in a banquet that evoked the finale of Don Giovanni. Don Giovanni was also at the heart of one of the most famous experiments in this four-year period: \"Palazzo Pisani, home of the B. Marcello Conservatory, is the site chosen for the staging of Don Giovanni a Venezia, conceived by Francesconi himself. For this initiative, which has been defined as an opera-labyrinth, the public is asked not just to exercise its sensibility but also its intelligence, so as to try to create a kind of gap between space and time in which music can be inserted. After scrapping the old structure of the concert, Francesconi borrows three key scenes from Mozart's original \u2013 the duel between Don Giovanni and the Commendatore, the seduction of Zerlina and the death of Don Giovanni \u2013 and puts them on stage cyclically, in three different locations within the ancient Venetian palace, inserting in the loggie, palace rooms and courtyards another eight original pieces commissioned from contemporary composers. The spectator, as if he were to enter into a huge gallery and to decide autonomously how and what to look at, will have before his eyes a plurality of musical, scenic, theatrical and visual events to combine, putting aside the perceptive habits of space and time.\"<ref>Silva Menetto, Alla Biennale protagonisti il Don Giovanni a Venezia e giovani ensemble da tutta Europa, Il Sole 24 ore, September 16th 2010</ref>\n\n== Teaching ==\n''This thing which has happened to me is unique much more than rare. In any case, I think it important to draw it to the attention of the readers of the Giornale della Musica, genuine music lovers in Italy (another rarity). I would not speak about an exquisitely private matter if it did not provide an opportunity to stimulate reflection and perhaps even a debate on the disastrous state in which culture in Italy finds itself, in particular musical culture. I have resigned from the State Conservatory.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Il sacrificio dei musicisti italiani, Milano, 2005</ref>\n\nLuca Francesconi has taught for twenty five years in Italy's conservatories and at the University of Ohio, in Rotterdam and in Strasburg.

Performed in Stockholm in February 2014, in Turin in May 2014 and in June 2015 for the BBC Proms. \u00abIt was well worth the wait. As the title suggests, Francesconi's concerto takes the idea of the Duende, the dark, demonic spirit of flamenco, as its starting point, but the music never seems simplistically pictorial or programmatic. Instead, with the violin as protagonist, the five movements (the last two merged seamlessly together) evoke a threatening world of extremes, of heightened emotions and dramatically contrasted colours and registers. The orchestra weaves febrile webs around solo writing whose cracked arpeggios and steep scales manage to be more or less traditionally virtuosic within musical contexts that are anything but conventional, especially in the ferocious cadenza at the heart of the final movement. Josefowicz's playing was immensely committed and astoundingly vivid, and it emerged in even sharper, more subtle focus in the Radio 3 recording, which also resolved many of the textures that had seemed rather blurred in the hall.\u00bb<ref>Andrew Clements, Prom 13: BBCSO/M\u00e4lkki/Josefowicz review \u2013 committed and astoundingly vivid, The Guardian, July 28th 2015</ref>\n\n''Duende'' was ranked number 6 in the Guardian's list of the top 10 classical concerts and operas of 2015<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/16/top-10-classical-concerts-opera-2015|title=The top 10 classical concerts and operas of 2015|first1=Andrew|last1=Clements|first2=Guardian|last2=music|date=December 16, 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Dentro non ha tempo ===\n\"Curious, that title, 'Dentro non ha tempo'. It can be read in three ways: as the temporal suspension that someone who dies leaves in those that have loved him/her. As a reference to the great musical tradition from which Luciana came, the Abbado family: a homage to the past that has no time. Finally, an allusion to the form of the composition, based on three bars of Mozart's Don Giovanni dilated 29 times.

It's an infinite source of meanings: meanings that I need to find, in spite of the destructuration of reality all around us. In a small gesture towards this powerful resistance, I have incorporated a brief homage to Luciano Berio's Concerto for Two Pianos, one of the pieces that have left a profound mark on my life.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ricordi.com/it-IT/|title=Ricordi|website=www.ricordi.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Bread, water and salt ===\n\nOn October 3 at the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome, Sir Antonio Pappano together with the soprano Pumeza Matshikiza and the Orchestra and Choir of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, performed the world premiere of ''Bread, Water and Salt'' on texts by [[Nelson Mandela]].

We've chosen Mandela because of his simple adherence to the spirituality of the body, of the bread, of the sofference that can be defeated.

There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore. Mainly, those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic.

There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore. Mainly, those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in [[Singlish]] and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans \u201cidiots\u201d for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic.

JAWS is produced by the Blind and Low Vision Group of [[Freedom Scientific]].\n\nAn August\u2013September 2019 screen reader user survey by [[WebAIM]], a web accessibility company, found JAWS to be the second-most popular screen reader worldwide, displaced for the first time by [[NonVisual Desktop Access]]; 40.1% of survey participants used it as a primary screen reader, while 61.7% of participants used it often.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/|title=Screen Reader User Survey #8|publisher=[[WebAIM]]|accessdate=September 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJAWS supports all versions of Windows released since [[Windows Vista]]. There are two versions of the program: the ''Home'' edition for non-commercial use and the ''Professional''  edition for commercial environments. Before JAWS 16, the ''Home'' edition was called ''Standard'', and only worked on home Windows operating systems.<ref>\"[https://support.freedomscientific.com/downloads/jaws/JAWSWhatsNew?version=16 Enhancements and Improvements in JAWS 16]\", Freedom Scientific.

In 1985, Henter, along with a {{US$|180,000|link=yes}} investment from Bill Joyce, founded the ''Henter-Joyce Corporation'' in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].  Joyce sold his interest in the company back to Henter in 1990.  In April 2000, Henter-Joyce, Blazie Engineering, and Arkenstone, Inc. merged to form [[Freedom Scientific]].\n\nJAWS was originally created for the [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]].  It was one of several screen readers giving blind users access to text-mode MS-DOS applications.  A feature unique to JAWS at the time was its use of cascading menus, in the style of the popular Lotus 1-2-3 application.  What set JAWS apart from other screen readers of the era was its use of [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] that allowed users to customize the user interface and work better with various applications.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nTed Henter and Rex Skipper wrote the original JAWS code in the mid-1980s, releasing version 2.0 in mid-1990.  Skipper left the company after the release of version 2.0, and following his departure, [[Charles Oppermann]] was hired to maintain and improve the product.  Oppermann and Henter regularly added minor and major features and frequently released new versions.  Freedom Scientific now offers JAWS for MS-DOS as a [[freeware]] download from their web site.<ref name=\"Trace\" /><ref>[http://www2.freedomscientific.com/downloads/jaws/JAWS-previous-downloads.asp More JAWS downloads].  Freedom Scientific. Retrieved August 31, 2008.</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Henter-Joyce released a highly modified version of JAWS for people with learning disabilities.  This product, called WordScholar, is no longer available.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.nfbnet.org/files/newsletters/H-J_9309.TXT\n|title=Henter-Joyce Newsletter\n|date=September 1993\n}}</ref>\n\n=== JAWS for Windows ===\n\nIn 1992, as [[Microsoft Windows]] became more popular, Oppermann began work on a new version of JAWS.  A principal design goal was not to interfere with the natural user interface of Windows and to continue to provide a strong macro facility.  Test and beta versions of JAWS for Windows (JFW) were shown at conferences throughout 1993 and 1994.  During this time, developer Glen Gordon started working on the code, ultimately taking over its development when Oppermann was hired by Microsoft in November 1994.

In 1985, Henter, along with a {{US$|180,000|link=yes}} investment from Bill Joyce, founded the ''Henter-Joyce Corporation'' in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].  Joyce sold his interest in the company back to Henter in 1990.  In April 2000, Henter-Joyce, Blazie Engineering, and Arkenstone, Inc. merged to form [[Freedom Scientific]].\n\nJAWS was originally created for the [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]].  It was one of several screen readers giving blind users access to text-mode MS-DOS applications.  A feature unique to JAWS at the time was its use of cascading menus, in the style of the popular Lotus 1-2-3 application.  What set JAWS apart from other screen readers of the era was its use of [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] that allowed users to customize the user interface and work better with various applications.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nTed Henter and Rex Skipper wrote the original JAWS code in the mid-1980s, releasing version 2.0 in mid-1990.  Skipper left the company after the release of version 2.0, and following his departure, [[Charles Oppermann]] was hired to maintain and improve the product.  Oppermann and Henter regularly added minor and major features and frequently released new versions.  Freedom Scientific now offers JAWS for MS-DOS as a [[freeware]] download from their web site.<ref name=\"Trace\" /><ref>[http://www2.freedomscientific.com/downloads/jaws/JAWS-previous-downloads.asp More JAWS downloads].

A principal design goal was not to interfere with the natural user interface of Windows and to continue to provide a strong macro facility.  Test and beta versions of JAWS for Windows (JFW) were shown at conferences throughout 1993 and 1994.  During this time, developer Glen Gordon started working on the code, ultimately taking over its development when Oppermann was hired by Microsoft in November 1994.

Described in 1996, it was the first dinosaur taxon outside of [[Avialae]] (birds and their immediate relatives) to be found with evidence of [[feather]]s. It was covered with a coat of very simple [[Protein filament|filament]]-like feathers. Structures that indicate colouration have also been preserved in some of its feathers, which makes ''Sinosauropteryx'' the first non-avialian dinosaurs where colouration has been determined. The colouration includes a reddish and light banded tail. Some contention has arisen with an alternative interpretation of the filamentous impression as remains of [[collagen]] fibres, but this has not been widely accepted.\n\n''Sinosauropteryx'' was a small theropod with an unusually long tail and short arms. The longest known specimen reaches up to {{convert|1.07|m|ft|abbr=off|sigfig=3}} in length, with an estimated weight of {{convert|0.55|kg|lb|abbr=off|sigfig=3}} It was a close relative of the similar but older genus ''[[Compsognathus]]'', both genera belonging to the [[family (biology)|family]] Compsognathidae. Only one [[species]] of ''Sinosauropteryx'' has been named: ''S. prima'', meaning \"first\" in reference to its status as the first feathered non-avialian dinosaur species discovered. Three specimens have been described. The third specimen previously assigned to this genus represents either a second, as-yet unnamed species or a distinct, related genus.\n\n''Sinosauropteryx'' lived in what is now northeastern [[China]] during the early [[Cretaceous]] [[Geologic time scale#Terminology|period]]. It was among the first dinosaurs discovered from the [[Yixian Formation]] in [[Liaoning Province]], and was a member of the [[Jehol Biota]]. Well-preserved fossils of this species illustrate many aspects of its biology, such as its diet and reproduction.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Sinosauropteryx scale.png|thumb|Size of adult and sub-adult specimens, compared with a human]]\n''Sinosauropteryx'' was a small [[bipedalism|bipedal]] [[theropod]], noted for its short arms, large first finger (thumbs), and long tail.

The skull of ''Sinosauropteryx'' was 15% longer than its [[femur|thigh bones]], unlike in ''Compsognathus'', where the skull and thigh bones are approximately equivalent in length. The arms of ''Sinosauropteryx'' ([[humerus]] and [[radius (bone)|radius]]) were only 30% the length of its legs (thigh bone and [[tibia|shin]]), compared to 40% in ''Compsognathus''.<ref name=chenetal1998/> Additionally, ''Sinosauropteryx'' had several features unique among all other theropods. It had 64 [[vertebra]]e in its tail. This high number made its tail the longest relative to body length of any theropod.<ref name=chenetal1998/> Its hands were long compared to its arms, about 84% to 91% of the length of the rest of the arm (humerus and radius), and half the length of the foot. The first and second digits were about the same length, with a large claw on the first digit.<ref name=currie&chen2001/> The first fingers were large, being both longer and thicker than either of the bones of the forearm.<ref name=chenetal1998/> The teeth differed slightly (they were [[heterodont]]) based on position: those near the tips of the upper jaws (on the [[premaxilla]]e) were slender and lacked serrations, while those behind them (on the [[maxilla]]e) were serrated and laterally compressed. The teeth of the lower jaws were similarly differentiated.<ref name=currie&chen2001/>\n\nA pigmented area in the abdomen of the holotype has been suggested as possible traces of organs,<ref name=chenetal1998/> and was interpreted as the [[liver]] by John Ruben and colleagues, which they described as part of a [[crocodilia]]n-like \"[[Lung#Reptilian lungs|hepatic piston]]\" respiratory system.<ref name=JRetal97>{{cite journal |last=Ruben |first=J.A. |author2=Jones, T.D. |author3=Geist, N.R. |author4= Hillenius, W.J.  |year=1997 |title=Lung structure and ventilation in theropod dinosaurs and early birds |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5341 |pages=1267\u20131270 |doi=10.1126/science.278.5341.1267|bibcode=1997Sci...278.1267R }}</ref> A later study, while agreeing that the pigmented area represented something originally inside the body, found no defined structure and noted that any organs would have been distorted by the processes that flattened the skeleton into an essentially two-dimensional form.<ref name=currie&chen2001/> Dark pigment is also present in the eye region of the holotype and another specimen.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n\n===Feathers===\n{{See also|Feathered dinosaurs}}\n[[File:Sinosauropteryx-1.jpg|left|thumb|Holotype and referred specimen with diagrams showing feathers and internal tissue]]\nAll described specimens of ''Sinosauropteryx'' preserve [[integument|integumentary structures]] (filaments arising from the skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of [[feather]]s. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and top and bottom of the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified on the sides of the body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the [[anatomical terms of location#dorsal and ventral|ventral]] feathers having been removed by decomposition.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n\nThe filaments are preserved with a gap between the bones, which several authors have noted corresponds closely to the expected amount of skin and muscle tissue that would have been present in life. The feathers are closest to the bone on the skull and end of the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more musculature would be expected, indicating that the filaments were external to the skin and do not correspond with [[subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] structures.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n[[File:Sinosauropteryx plumage fossils.jpg|thumb|upright|Preserved plumage in various specimens]] \nThe filaments exhibit random orientations and are often wavy, which has been interpreted as evidence that they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along the edges and light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding [[hair]]s of similarly sized mammals.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n\nThe length of the filaments varies across the body. On the type specimen, they are shortest just in front of the eyes, with a length of {{convert|13|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Going further along the body, the filaments rapidly increase in length until reaching lengths of {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} over the [[scapula|shoulder blades]]. The length remains uniform over the back, until beyond the hips, when the filaments lengthen again and reach their maximum length midway down the tail at {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The filaments on the underside of the tail are shorter overall and decrease in length more rapidly than those on the dorsal surface. By the 25th tail vertebrae, the filaments on the underside reach a length of only {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The longest feathers present on the forearm measured {{convert|14|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n\nThough the feathers are too dense to isolate a single structure for examination, several studies have suggested the presence of two distinct filament types (thick and thin) interspersed with each other. The thick filaments tend to appear 'stiffer' than thin filaments, and the thin filaments tend to lie parallel to each other but at angles to nearby thick filaments. These properties suggest that the individual feathers consisted of a central quill (''rachis'') with thinner ''barbs'' branching off from it, similar to but more primitive in structure than modern bird feathers.<ref name=currie&chen2001/> Overall, the filaments most closely resemble the \"plumules\" or down-like feathers of some modern birds, with a thick central quill and long, thin barbs. The same structures are seen in other fossils from the Yixian Formation, including ''[[Confuciusornis]]''.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n\nHowever, a 2018 study considered that the thick filaments could simply be bundles of thin filaments overlapping each other. This possibility is supported by the observation that thin filaments tend to run parallel to both each other ''and'' thick filaments, rather than branching out as earlier authors identified. Some of the thick filaments are quite long yet end in small tufts of thin filaments. [[Down feather|Plumaceous]], down-like feathering typically has an opposite appearance, with a short central quill and long tufts. In addition, the thick filaments preserve no evidence of [[Calcium phosphate]], the mineral which modern feather quills are made of. The large amount of curvature present in the filaments also makes a strong central quill unlikely. Thus, the idea that thick filaments are simply bundles of thin filaments is less unusual than the idea that they were a variant of quilled plumaceous feathers which developed a morphology opposite that of birds and other feathered theropods. As a whole, the study preferred the hypothesis that ''Sinosauropteryx'' feathers were simple single-branch filaments, although it is conceivable that they were occasionally joined at the base into tufts as predecessors to down-like plumaceous feathers.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Evan T.

Some fossils of ''Sinosauropteryx'' show an alternation of lighter and darker bands preserved on the tail. Chen and colleagues initially interpreted this banding pattern as an artifact of the splitting between the main slab and counter-slab in which the original specimen was preserved.<ref name=chenetal1998/> However, Longrich suggested in his 2002 presentation for the [[Society of Vertebrate Paleontology]] that these specimens actually preserve remnants of the colouration pattern the animal would have exhibited in life. He argued that the dark, banded areas on the tail were too evenly spaced to have been caused by random separation of the fossil slabs, and that they represent fossilized pigments present in the feathers. Additionally, rather than an artifact of preservation or decomposition, the presence of dark feathers along only the top of the body may also reflect the colour pattern in life, indicating that ''Sinosauropteryx prima'' was [[Countershading|countershaded]] with dark colouration on its back and lighter colouration on its underside, with bands or stripes on the tail for camouflage.<ref name=longrich2002/>\n\nLongrich's conclusions were supported in a paper first published online in the journal ''Nature'' in January 2010. Fucheng Zhang and colleagues examined the fossilized feathers of several dinosaurs and early birds, and found evidence that they preserved [[melanosome]]s, the cells that give the feathers of modern birds their colour. Among the specimens studied was a previously undescribed specimen of ''Sinosauropteryx'', IVPP&nbsp;V14202. By examining melanosome structure and distribution, Zhang and colleagues were able to confirm the presence of light and dark bands of colour in the tail feathers of ''Sinosauropteryx''. Furthermore, the team was able to compare melanosome types to those of modern birds to determine a general range of colour. From the presence of phaeomelanosomes, spherical melanosomes that make and store red pigment, they concluded that the darker feathers of ''Sinosauropteryx'' were chestnut or reddish brown in colour.<ref name=zhangetal2010/> More research on the coloration of ''Sinosauropteryx'' reveals that it had a raccoon-like bandit mask and countershading patterns most likely associated with an open habitat, indicating that the Jehol likely had a range of habitat types.<ref name=\"2017color\">{{cite journal | last1 = Smithwick | first1 = F.M. | last2 = Nicholls | first2 = R. | last3 = Cuthill | first3 = I.C. | last4 = Vinther | first4 = J. | title = Countershading and Stripes in the Theropod Dinosaur ''Sinosauropteryx'' Reveal Heterogeneous Habitats in the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota | journal = Current Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 21 | pages = 3337\u20133343.e2 | date = 2017 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2017.09.032 | pmid = 29107548 | url = http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31197-1}}</ref>\n\n==History of discovery==\n{{see also|Origin of birds}}\n[[File:Sinosauropteryx.jpg|thumb|Skeletal diagram showing known remains of the holotype and a referred specimen]] \nThe first fossil specimen of the dinosaur later named ''Sinosauropteryx prima'' was uncovered in August 1996 by Li Yumin. Yumin was a farmer and part-time fossil hunter who often prospected around Liaoning Province to acquire fossils to sell to individuals and museums. Yumin recognized the unique quality of the specimen, which was separated into two slabs, and sold the slabs to two separate museums in China: the National Geological Museum in [[Beijing]], and the [[Nanjing]] Institute of Geology and Paleontology.

The integument of ''Sinosauropteryx'' was closely compared to less controversial evidence of collagen fibers preserved in the [[ichthyosaur]] ''[[Stenopterygius]]''. Although the collagen hypothesis claimed that the central shafts (rachises) of purported theropod feathers were actually misidentified examples of shaft-like collagen fibers, higher quality imagery showed that these similarities were artificial. The supposed shafts in ichthyosaur collagen were actually scratch marks, cracks, and crevasses created during preparation of one of the ichthyosaur specimens. On the other hand, the shafts in the ''Sinosauropteryx'' specimens were legitimate examples of fossilized structures. The collagen hypothesis also claims that ''Sinosauropteryx'' integument includes beaded structures similar to structures occasionally found in decaying collagen of modern sea mammals. However, this claim was also unsupported, with Smithwick ''et al.'' finding no evidence of the beaded structures which collagen hypothesis proponents identified on the specimens. The study proposes that some areas of the fossil preserved in three dimensions cast shadows which would have resembled beaded structures in low quality photographs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|author1=Fiann M.

The longest known specimen reaches up to {{convert|1.07|m|ft|abbr=off|sigfig=3}} in length, with an estimated weight of {{convert|0.55|kg|lb|abbr=off|sigfig=3}} It was a close relative of the similar but older genus ''[[Compsognathus]]'', both genera belonging to the [[family (biology)|family]] Compsognathidae. Only one [[species]] of ''Sinosauropteryx'' has been named: ''S. prima'', meaning \"first\" in reference to its status as the first feathered non-avialian dinosaur species discovered. Three specimens have been described. The third specimen previously assigned to this genus represents either a second, as-yet unnamed species or a distinct, related genus.\n\n''Sinosauropteryx'' lived in what is now northeastern [[China]] during the early [[Cretaceous]] [[Geologic time scale#Terminology|period]]. It was among the first dinosaurs discovered from the [[Yixian Formation]] in [[Liaoning Province]], and was a member of the [[Jehol Biota]]. Well-preserved fossils of this species illustrate many aspects of its biology, such as its diet and reproduction.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Sinosauropteryx scale.png|thumb|Size of adult and sub-adult specimens, compared with a human]]\n''Sinosauropteryx'' was a small [[bipedalism|bipedal]] [[theropod]], noted for its short arms, large first finger (thumbs), and long tail.

The skull of ''Sinosauropteryx'' was 15% longer than its [[femur|thigh bones]], unlike in ''Compsognathus'', where the skull and thigh bones are approximately equivalent in length. The arms of ''Sinosauropteryx'' ([[humerus]] and [[radius (bone)|radius]]) were only 30% the length of its legs (thigh bone and [[tibia|shin]]), compared to 40% in ''Compsognathus''.<ref name=chenetal1998/> Additionally, ''Sinosauropteryx'' had several features unique among all other theropods. It had 64 [[vertebra]]e in its tail. This high number made its tail the longest relative to body length of any theropod.<ref name=chenetal1998/> Its hands were long compared to its arms, about 84% to 91% of the length of the rest of the arm (humerus and radius), and half the length of the foot.

The teeth of the lower jaws were similarly differentiated.<ref name=currie&chen2001/>\n\nA pigmented area in the abdomen of the holotype has been suggested as possible traces of organs,<ref name=chenetal1998/> and was interpreted as the [[liver]] by John Ruben and colleagues, which they described as part of a [[crocodilia]]n-like \"[[Lung#Reptilian lungs|hepatic piston]]\" respiratory system.<ref name=JRetal97>{{cite journal |last=Ruben |first=J.A. |author2=Jones, T.D. |author3=Geist, N.R. |author4= Hillenius, W.J.  |year=1997 |title=Lung structure and ventilation in theropod dinosaurs and early birds |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5341 |pages=1267\u20131270 |doi=10.1126/science.278.5341.1267|bibcode=1997Sci...278.1267R }}</ref> A later study, while agreeing that the pigmented area represented something originally inside the body, found no defined structure and noted that any organs would have been distorted by the processes that flattened the skeleton into an essentially two-dimensional form.<ref name=currie&chen2001/> Dark pigment is also present in the eye region of the holotype and another specimen.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n\n===Feathers===\n{{See also|Feathered dinosaurs}}\n[[File:Sinosauropteryx-1.jpg|left|thumb|Holotype and referred specimen with diagrams showing feathers and internal tissue]]\nAll described specimens of ''Sinosauropteryx'' preserve [[integument|integumentary structures]] (filaments arising from the skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of [[feather]]s. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and top and bottom of the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified on the sides of the body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the [[anatomical terms of location#dorsal and ventral|ventral]] feathers having been removed by decomposition.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n\nThe filaments are preserved with a gap between the bones, which several authors have noted corresponds closely to the expected amount of skin and muscle tissue that would have been present in life. The feathers are closest to the bone on the skull and end of the tail, where little to no muscle was present, and the gap increases over the back vertebrae, where more musculature would be expected, indicating that the filaments were external to the skin and do not correspond with [[subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] structures.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n[[File:Sinosauropteryx plumage fossils.jpg|thumb|upright|Preserved plumage in various specimens]] \nThe filaments exhibit random orientations and are often wavy, which has been interpreted as evidence that they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along the edges and light internally, suggesting that they were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding [[hair]]s of similarly sized mammals.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n\nThe length of the filaments varies across the body. On the type specimen, they are shortest just in front of the eyes, with a length of {{convert|13|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Going further along the body, the filaments rapidly increase in length until reaching lengths of {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} over the [[scapula|shoulder blades]]. The length remains uniform over the back, until beyond the hips, when the filaments lengthen again and reach their maximum length midway down the tail at {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The filaments on the underside of the tail are shorter overall and decrease in length more rapidly than those on the dorsal surface. By the 25th tail vertebrae, the filaments on the underside reach a length of only {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The longest feathers present on the forearm measured {{convert|14|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n\nThough the feathers are too dense to isolate a single structure for examination, several studies have suggested the presence of two distinct filament types (thick and thin) interspersed with each other. The thick filaments tend to appear 'stiffer' than thin filaments, and the thin filaments tend to lie parallel to each other but at angles to nearby thick filaments. These properties suggest that the individual feathers consisted of a central quill (''rachis'') with thinner ''barbs'' branching off from it, similar to but more primitive in structure than modern bird feathers.<ref name=currie&chen2001/> Overall, the filaments most closely resemble the \"plumules\" or down-like feathers of some modern birds, with a thick central quill and long, thin barbs. The same structures are seen in other fossils from the Yixian Formation, including ''[[Confuciusornis]]''.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n\nHowever, a 2018 study considered that the thick filaments could simply be bundles of thin filaments overlapping each other. This possibility is supported by the observation that thin filaments tend to run parallel to both each other ''and'' thick filaments, rather than branching out as earlier authors identified. Some of the thick filaments are quite long yet end in small tufts of thin filaments. [[Down feather|Plumaceous]], down-like feathering typically has an opposite appearance, with a short central quill and long tufts. In addition, the thick filaments preserve no evidence of [[Calcium phosphate]], the mineral which modern feather quills are made of. The large amount of curvature present in the filaments also makes a strong central quill unlikely. Thus, the idea that thick filaments are simply bundles of thin filaments is less unusual than the idea that they were a variant of quilled plumaceous feathers which developed a morphology opposite that of birds and other feathered theropods. As a whole, the study preferred the hypothesis that ''Sinosauropteryx'' feathers were simple single-branch filaments, although it is conceivable that they were occasionally joined at the base into tufts as predecessors to down-like plumaceous feathers.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Evan T.

Some fossils of ''Sinosauropteryx'' show an alternation of lighter and darker bands preserved on the tail. Chen and colleagues initially interpreted this banding pattern as an artifact of the splitting between the main slab and counter-slab in which the original specimen was preserved.<ref name=chenetal1998/> However, Longrich suggested in his 2002 presentation for the [[Society of Vertebrate Paleontology]] that these specimens actually preserve remnants of the colouration pattern the animal would have exhibited in life. He argued that the dark, banded areas on the tail were too evenly spaced to have been caused by random separation of the fossil slabs, and that they represent fossilized pigments present in the feathers. Additionally, rather than an artifact of preservation or decomposition, the presence of dark feathers along only the top of the body may also reflect the colour pattern in life, indicating that ''Sinosauropteryx prima'' was [[Countershading|countershaded]] with dark colouration on its back and lighter colouration on its underside, with bands or stripes on the tail for camouflage.<ref name=longrich2002/>\n\nLongrich's conclusions were supported in a paper first published online in the journal ''Nature'' in January 2010. Fucheng Zhang and colleagues examined the fossilized feathers of several dinosaurs and early birds, and found evidence that they preserved [[melanosome]]s, the cells that give the feathers of modern birds their colour. Among the specimens studied was a previously undescribed specimen of ''Sinosauropteryx'', IVPP&nbsp;V14202. By examining melanosome structure and distribution, Zhang and colleagues were able to confirm the presence of light and dark bands of colour in the tail feathers of ''Sinosauropteryx''. Furthermore, the team was able to compare melanosome types to those of modern birds to determine a general range of colour. From the presence of phaeomelanosomes, spherical melanosomes that make and store red pigment, they concluded that the darker feathers of ''Sinosauropteryx'' were chestnut or reddish brown in colour.<ref name=zhangetal2010/> More research on the coloration of ''Sinosauropteryx'' reveals that it had a raccoon-like bandit mask and countershading patterns most likely associated with an open habitat, indicating that the Jehol likely had a range of habitat types.<ref name=\"2017color\">{{cite journal | last1 = Smithwick | first1 = F.M. | last2 = Nicholls | first2 = R. | last3 = Cuthill | first3 = I.C. | last4 = Vinther | first4 = J. | title = Countershading and Stripes in the Theropod Dinosaur ''Sinosauropteryx'' Reveal Heterogeneous Habitats in the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota | journal = Current Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 21 | pages = 3337\u20133343.e2 | date = 2017 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2017.09.032 | pmid = 29107548 | url = http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31197-1}}</ref>\n\n==History of discovery==\n{{see also|Origin of birds}}\n[[File:Sinosauropteryx.jpg|thumb|Skeletal diagram showing known remains of the holotype and a referred specimen]] \nThe first fossil specimen of the dinosaur later named ''Sinosauropteryx prima'' was uncovered in August 1996 by Li Yumin. Yumin was a farmer and part-time fossil hunter who often prospected around Liaoning Province to acquire fossils to sell to individuals and museums. Yumin recognized the unique quality of the specimen, which was separated into two slabs, and sold the slabs to two separate museums in China: the National Geological Museum in [[Beijing]], and the [[Nanjing]] Institute of Geology and Paleontology. The director of the Beijing museum, Ji Qiang, recognized the importance of the find, as did visiting Canadian palaeontologist [[Phil Currie]] and artist Michael Skrepnick, who became aware of the fossil by chance as they explored the Beijing museum's collections after leading a fossil tour of the area during the first week of October, 1996. Currie recognized the significance of the fossil immediately. As ''The New York Times'' quoted him, \"When I saw this slab of [[siltstone]] mixed with volcanic ash in which the creature is embedded, I was bowled over.\"<ref name=nyt2006>{{cite news|last=Browne|first=M.W.|title=Feathery Fossil Hints Dinosaur-Bird Link|newspaper=New York Times|date=19 October 1996 |page=Section 1 page 1 of the New York edition}}</ref> When originally described, the authors named ''Sinosauropteryx'', meaning \"Chinese Reptilian Wing''.<ref name=jiji1996>{{cite journal|last=Ji|first=Q.|last2=Ji|first2=S.|year=1996 |title= On the discovery of the earliest bird fossil in China (''Sinosauropteryx'' gen. nov.) and the origin of birds|url=http://www.paleoglot.org/files/Ji%26Ji_96.pdf|journal= Chinese Geology |volume=10 |issue=233 |pages=30\u201333}}</ref>\n\nChinese authorities initially barred photographs of the specimen from publication.

The integument of ''Sinosauropteryx'' was closely compared to less controversial evidence of collagen fibers preserved in the [[ichthyosaur]] ''[[Stenopterygius]]''. Although the collagen hypothesis claimed that the central shafts (rachises) of purported theropod feathers were actually misidentified examples of shaft-like collagen fibers, higher quality imagery showed that these similarities were artificial. The supposed shafts in ichthyosaur collagen were actually scratch marks, cracks, and crevasses created during preparation of one of the ichthyosaur specimens. On the other hand, the shafts in the ''Sinosauropteryx'' specimens were legitimate examples of fossilized structures. The collagen hypothesis also claims that ''Sinosauropteryx'' integument includes beaded structures similar to structures occasionally found in decaying collagen of modern sea mammals. However, this claim was also unsupported, with Smithwick ''et al.'' finding no evidence of the beaded structures which collagen hypothesis proponents identified on the specimens. The study proposes that some areas of the fossil preserved in three dimensions cast shadows which would have resembled beaded structures in low quality photographs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|author1=Fiann M.

An area of the bone with an irregular surface was considered evidence that some collagen fibers were less decayed than others. However, Smithwick ''et al.'s'' study noted that, after further preparation, this irregular surface was simply a layer of sediment with a different color than the rest of the slab. The 'frill' or 'halo' of collagen identified by Feduccia was also determined to be misidentified sediment surrounding one of the specimens. Smithwick ''et al''.'s study concluded by stating that the integument preserved on ''Sinosauropteryx'' closely resembled that of birds preserved in the same formation. Purported features of collagen fibers were in fact misidentified shadows formed by scratches or irregular sediment, a misidentification perpetuated by the low quality of early ''Sinosauropteryx'' photographs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Sinosauropteryx prima.JPG|thumb|Undescribed fossil specimen at the [[Hong Kong Science Museum]]]]\n[[File:Sinosauropteryx GMV 2124.jpg|thumb|upright|Cast of the skeleton belonging to GMV 2124, which is probably not a ''Sinosauropteryx'']]\nDespite its feathers, most palaeontologists do not consider ''Sinosauropteryx'' to be a bird.

They found that it was a small primitive bird with a relatively high skull, blunt rostrum and a slightly high premaxilla; that the antorbital fenestra was elliptical but not enlarged, the dentary was robust, the surangular was narrow and elongated, and the dentition is extremely well developed and acute; that there are over 50 extremely elongated caudals, constituting 60% of the body length, and the forelimb is extremely short with a short and thick humerus; the pubis was elongated and extremely inflated at its distal end and the ischium is broad; the hind limb was long and robust, the tibia is only slightly longer than the femur, the tarsals are separated, and the metatarsals are relatively robust with unfused proximal ends; the feathers are short, small, and uniform; many ornament the top of the skull, cervical, and dorsal regions, in addition to the dorsal and ventral caudal region.<ref name=jiji1996/>\n\n==Palaeobiology==\n===Diet===\n[[File:Sinosauropteryx with Dalinghosaurus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''Sinosauropteryx'' preying on ''[[Dalinghosaurus]]'', by [[Bob Nicholls]]]] \nThe specimen NIGP&nbsp;127587 was preserved with the remains of a [[lizard]] in its gut region, indicating that small, fast-moving animals made up part of the diet of ''Sinosauropteryx prima''. Numerous lizards of this type have been found in the same rocks as ''Sinosauropteryx''.<ref name=chenetal1998/> These lizards have been interpreted as most likely belonging to the genus ''[[Dalinghosaurus]]''. ''Dalinghosaurus'' was probably a fast-running lizard adapted to living in open habitats, much like ''Sinosauropteryx'' itself.<ref name=\"2017color\"/>\n\nThe possible ''Sinosauropteryx'' specimen GMV&nbsp;2124 (''Sinosauropteryx?''&nbsp;sp.) was found with three mammal jaws in its gut region. Hurum, Luo, and Kielan-Jaworowska (2006) identified two of these jaws as belonging to ''[[Zhangheotherium]]'' and the third to ''[[Sinobaatar]]'', showing that these two mammals were part of the animal's diet. ''Zhangheotherium'' is known to have had a spur on the ankle, like the modern [[platypus]], which would indicate that ''Sinosauropteryx'' fed on possibly venomous mammals.<ref name=hurumetal2006>{{cite journal |last=Hurum |first=J.H. |author2=Luo, Z.-X. |author3= Kielan-Jaworowska, Z.  |year=2006 |title=Were mammals originally venomous? |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages= 1\u201311 |url=https://www.app.pan.pl/article/item/app51-001.html }}</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe same specimen of ''S. prima'' which had preserve a lizard in its stomach contents (NIGP&nbsp;127587) also had several small [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in its abdomen. Two eggs were preserved just in front of and above the [[pubis (bone)|pubic]] boot, and several more may lie underneath them on the slab. It is unlikely that they were eaten by the animal, as they are in the wrong part of the body cavity for the egg shells to have remained intact. It is more likely that they are unlaid eggs produced by the animal itself, proving the specimen to be a female. Each egg measured {{convert|36|mm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|26|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The presence of two developed eggs suggests that ''Sinosauropteryx'' had dual [[oviduct]]s and laid eggs in pairs, like other theropods.<ref name=chenetal1998/>\n\n==Palaeoecology==\n''Sinosauropteryx'', as a [[Yixian Formation]] dinosaur, is a member of the [[Jehol Biota]], the assemblage of organisms found in the Yixian Formation and overlying [[Jiufotang Formation]].<ref name=zhou2006/> The Yixian Formation is composed largely of [[volcanic rock]]s such as [[andesite]] and [[basalt]]. Between the volcanic layers are several beds of [[sedimentary rock]]s representing deposition in a [[lake]].<ref name=chenetal1998/> The freshwater lake strata of the Yixian Formation have preserved a wide variety of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. [[Gymnosperm]] forests were extensive, with a few early [[angiosperm|flowering plants]] as well. [[Ostracod]]s and insects were diverse, and [[bivalve]]s and [[gastropod]]s were abundant. Mammals and birds are also well known from the formation. The setting was subject to periodic mortality events including volcanic eruptions, [[wildfire]]s, and [[limnic eruption|noxious gases erupting from the lakes]].<ref name=zhou2006/> The climate has been interpreted as [[temperate]], with distinct wet and dry seasons.<ref name=wangetal2006conifer>Wang, Y.; Zheng, S.; Yang, X.; Zhang, W.; and Ni, Q.

Senator [[William Fulbright]] of Arkansas, a moderate, had worked behind the scenes to tone down the original harsh draft.

Instead, was mostly a states' rights diatribe against the judicial branch for overstepping its role.<ref>Brent J.

The debates preceding the submission of the 14th Amendment clearly show that there was no intent that it should affect the system of education maintained by the States.\"\n*\"This unwarranted exercise of power by the Court, contrary to the Constitution, is creating chaos and confusion in the States principally affected.

Michelle initially disowns her brothers but is reconciled with Liam after Paul's death.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a45520/liam-reveals-all-to-michelle.html|title=Liam reveals all to Michelle|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=29 April 2007|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nLiam dates [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]), thinking that she is an estate agent but she is secretly working as a female escort. Liam's sister-in-law, Carla, goes shopping regularly with Leanne, and one day one of Leanne's clients sees them together and asks Carla if she is an escort too. Carla reluctantly agrees to keep Leanne's secret from Liam.\n\nPaul discovers Leanne's secret when he books an escort to come to a hotel room he has booked and Leanne turns up; they agree to keep each other's secret until Carla finds out, and refuses to believe that Paul and Leanne haven't slept together. In an attempt to convince her, Paul kidnaps Leanne and locks her in his car boot. After jumping a red traffic light at a crossroads, Paul's [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] crashes into a skip and overturns. Liam rescues Leanne from the boot of the car, but Carla reveals that Leanne is working as a prostitute, and their relationship does not survive the revelation. Paul dies of his injuries in hospital and Liam is devastated by his brother's death and blames Leanne.\n\nLiam is attracted to Maria Sutherland, with whom he begins a casual relationship. A few weeks into their relationship, Maria discovers that she is pregnant, and they decide to abort the child. Liam is happy with this initially but after comments made by Carla, he proposes to Maria. He asks her to keep the baby and she agrees happily, unaware of Liam's hidden feelings for Carla.  Maria buys Liam a dog, Ozzy.  During a trip to the Lake District in January 2008, Liam falls down a ravine while searching for Ozzy.  While semi-conscious, he calls out for Carla, making Maria feel insecure. In an attempt to cement their relationship, she brings their wedding forward to 11 February 2008. Liam is a little shocked, but agrees.\n\nDuring an argument with Carla about her new boyfriend, Liam and Carla kiss passionately. She pulls away, leaving them confused about their feelings for each other. Liam tries to concentrate on his relationship with Maria and their baby but Carla starts interfering between him and Maria. She attempts to create opportunities to seduce Liam, such as booking a double room at a hotel for a conference they are to attend together. Carla's plans are ruined when Tony turns up at the hotel.\n\nCarla tries to warn Maria off Liam. Prior to the wedding, Maria spots Carla kissing him, and almost calls off the wedding. When Maria refuses to get out of the car, he goes outside and convinces her that she is the one for him. He insists that all he wants was a life with her and their baby and they marry, even though he knows that he really loves Carla.\n\nDuring April 2008, after a row with Liam about him spending the night at Carla's, Maria is horrified to discover that her baby has stopped kicking. She goes with sonographer [[Marcus Dent]] ([[Charlie Condou]]) for an emergency scan and is told that her child has died. On 30 April, still estranged from Liam, she goes into hospital and gives birth to the deceased infant. She decides not to tell Liam that she has lost the baby because she fears that Liam has only married her because she was pregnant.\n\nMaria keeps the news of the [[stillbirth]] from Liam and stays at [[Audrey Roberts]]'s ([[Sue Nicholls]]). Liam only finds out about his child's death from the [[midwife]] when she calls to check on Maria. The newly married couple have a huge argument, which climaxes in Maria declaring that the marriage is over, just under three months into it. With Maria leaving him, Liam sinks into depression and seeks comfort in Carla, sleeping with her. Later that day, Liam is just leaving Carla's flat when they stop in the doorway for a goodbye kiss unaware that up the road walking is their assistant [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]). On catching glimpse of the lovers, Rosie quickly jumps out of their sight and seizing an opportunity, takes a video of the tender moment before Liam drives off. Liam and Carla later agree that he will tell Maria about their relationship but instead Maria apologises for not telling him sooner that she lost the baby and asks him to give her a second chance. So, that day, he tells Carla that he and Maria are back together and are off on holiday.\n\nOn their return, Carla's revenge is to insist that Liam sell his share of ''Underworld'' to Tony or she would tell Maria about them sleeping together. Liam gives in, as he and Maria are discussing trying for another baby.\n\nBored at home all day, Liam and his cousin, [[Tom Kerrigan (Coronation Street)|Tom Kerrigan]] ([[Philip McGinley]]) start a new business called ''Lad Rags''. Tom, however, fails to persuade the bank to loan them \u00a350K so he asks Carla to invest, which she does. Liam is furious when he finds out, telling Tom that her 25% share is coming out of his half of the business. Knowing that neither Tony or Maria would be pleased about them working together, they agree to keep it a secret from them and it is clear that Liam and Carla still have strong feelings for each other.\n\nIn September 2008, Rosie Webster decides to seduce Tony and invites him to a hotel room. When he arrives, he is stunned to find Rosie draped over the bed semi-naked and it all becomes clear to Tony what her game is. He subsequently harshly rejects Rosie, telling her he only has eyes for Carla and that she is nothing but a silly little girl. Humiliated, Rosie exacts her revenge and shows Tony the video footage of Liam and Carla kissing. Upon seeing the footage, Tony is silenced and leaves the hotel with Rosie's phone, which he later dumps in the canal after copying the video.\n\nInitially hesitant, Tony sees red when he catches Carla with Liam once again, and plans his revenge. The next day Tony surprises Carla by taking her, Liam and Maria to the lakes on a weekend away, raising suspicion with Liam and Carla who begin to question what he is up to. At the lakes, Tony leads Liam astray on a country walk and the pair end up stood at the edge of a cave cliff with Liam clearly very anxious as it brings back memories of his fall in the Lake District in January that year. Liam is left stunned however when Tony chooses that moment to ask him to be his best man at his wedding to Carla. As they hug, Tony jokingly says that he is going to push Liam over the edge, an ominous sign of Liam's fate.\n\nThe following week, upon seeing Carla in her wedding dress, Liam reignites his passion with her as they sleep together once more, with Tony almost catching them in the act as he dashs home. The next day, as the stag and hen parties are about to commence, Liam meets Carla in secret to remind her that he loves her and desperately urges her to call off the wedding. In a moment alone during her hen party, Carla sits down for a heart-to-heart with best friend Leanne, who tells her to follow her heart. Her words strike a chord and Carla finally decides she is going to end her engagement to Tony to be with Liam but when Michelle and Maria return to the table, Michelle shares her suspicion that Maria is pregnant, which she happily confirms to the group. Carla is heartbroken and, not wanting to be the one to take away the unborn child's father, urges Maria to tell Liam the news.\n\nThat night, as the boys are on a pub crawl, Liam realises he has left his wallet behind in the pub that they have just left and is told by Tony to go back and get it. However, as Liam is walking across the road, he is hit and killed instantly by a car at high speed driven by [[Jimmy Dockerson]] ([[Robert Beck (actor)|Robert Beck]]), the man who Tony had hired to kill Liam. In tears, Tony falls to the floor, and orders everyone to move out of the way and call an ambulance. Moments after the incident, Maria arrives to tell Liam her news but is distraught to find him lying motionless on the road. Carla, meanwhile, is forced to hold back the true extent of her own devastation as husband-to-be Tony looms over the lifeless body. Later, Tony heads to the canal and out of his pocket he pulls Liam's wallet which he had stolen earlier as part of his elaborate plan to kill his love rival. Tony then callously takes out the cash in the wallet throws it into the water below. Liam's funeral is held on 27 October 2008.\n\n==Creation and casting==\n''Coronation Street'''s Connor family were introduced by producer [[Steve Frost]] after [[Kym Marsh]] made a series of guest appearances as singer [[Michelle Connor]].

Liam calls on his wealthy brother [[Paul Connor (Coronation Street)|Paul]] ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]) to help him purchase the factory.

Liam's sister-in-law, Carla, goes shopping regularly with Leanne, and one day one of Leanne's clients sees them together and asks Carla if she is an escort too. Carla reluctantly agrees to keep Leanne's secret from Liam.\n\nPaul discovers Leanne's secret when he books an escort to come to a hotel room he has booked and Leanne turns up; they agree to keep each other's secret until Carla finds out, and refuses to believe that Paul and Leanne haven't slept together. In an attempt to convince her, Paul kidnaps Leanne and locks her in his car boot. After jumping a red traffic light at a crossroads, Paul's [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] crashes into a skip and overturns. Liam rescues Leanne from the boot of the car, but Carla reveals that Leanne is working as a prostitute, and their relationship does not survive the revelation. Paul dies of his injuries in hospital and Liam is devastated by his brother's death and blames Leanne.\n\nLiam is attracted to Maria Sutherland, with whom he begins a casual relationship. A few weeks into their relationship, Maria discovers that she is pregnant, and they decide to abort the child. Liam is happy with this initially but after comments made by Carla, he proposes to Maria. He asks her to keep the baby and she agrees happily, unaware of Liam's hidden feelings for Carla.  Maria buys Liam a dog, Ozzy.  During a trip to the Lake District in January 2008, Liam falls down a ravine while searching for Ozzy.  While semi-conscious, he calls out for Carla, making Maria feel insecure. In an attempt to cement their relationship, she brings their wedding forward to 11 February 2008. Liam is a little shocked, but agrees.\n\nDuring an argument with Carla about her new boyfriend, Liam and Carla kiss passionately. She pulls away, leaving them confused about their feelings for each other. Liam tries to concentrate on his relationship with Maria and their baby but Carla starts interfering between him and Maria. She attempts to create opportunities to seduce Liam, such as booking a double room at a hotel for a conference they are to attend together. Carla's plans are ruined when Tony turns up at the hotel.\n\nCarla tries to warn Maria off Liam. Prior to the wedding, Maria spots Carla kissing him, and almost calls off the wedding.
