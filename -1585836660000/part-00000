He is reportedly a drug trafficker for the [[Gulf Cartel]], a criminal group based in [[Tamaulipas]], Mexico. According to the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas]], between 2005 and 2014, Briones Ruiz and his network were responsible for cocaine trafficking from Mexico to the U.S., smuggling the cash proceeds back into Mexico, conducting money laundering from these earnings, and structuring financial activities to hide the illegal nature of his earnings. He did this through his family-run gasoline company, Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. A fugitive from U.S. justice, Briones Ruiz faces up to life imprisonment and up to US$10 million in fines from his drug trafficking activities alone.\n\n==Early life and background==\nAbel Briones Ruiz was born in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas]], Mexico,<ref name=\":3\" /> on 31 October 1973 to Abel Briones and Magdalena Ruiz Carri\u00f3n. His birth was registered in Matamoros in 1974.{{efn|The information on his birth certificate can be retrieved in the cited source by using his [[Unique Population Registry Code]] (CURP), BIRA731031HTSRZB03, along with one of his parents' names.<ref name=\"acta\" />}}<ref name=\"acta\" /> He is married to Myriam Susana Beattie Mart\u00ednez.<ref name=\"JAXRQ\" />\n\nHe owns several hotels and a Matamoros-based gas company, Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V., which is located on the highway connecting Matamoros with [[Reynosa]].<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> According to the [[Public Registry of Property and Commerce]] (RPPC), Briones Ruiz registered Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. as a commercial entity in 2009. He has listed himself as a commercial business owner. In an RPPC assembly in 2012, he reported MXN$4.3 million in investments to justify an expansion in his company.<ref name=\"IFNmm\" /> That year, Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. opened up a Pemex station at their location but were only licensed short-term by Pemex to operate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn January 2016, Pemex granted Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. a license to sell their standard and premium gasoline, effectively superseding the short-term license they owned. The licence allowed for Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. to operate for 30 years should they follow the conditions stipulated in the contract. Among the conditions were for Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. to ensure safety regulations, product control standards, insurance requirements, and that financial reports and transactions were kept for record-keeping.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Career ==\nBriones Ruiz, known also by his alias \"Cacho\", is a suspected drug trafficker of the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"PVepP\" /> On 22 October 2014, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas]] (S.D. Tex) filed a sealed indictment against Briones Ruiz and three of his collaborators: Beattie Mart\u00ednez, Rogelio Nieto Gonz\u00e1lez (his brother-in-law), and an unnamed individual.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"MF1rZ\" /> The indictment was unsealed in court on 18 May 2015.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to the indictment, Briones Ruiz and his network conspired to smuggle with intent to distribute over {{Convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of [[cocaine]] from Mexico to the U.S. between 1 January 2005 and 22 October 2014. They were also charged with money laundering and illegal financial structuring.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nFor the drug charges, they faced from ten years to [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life imprisonment]] and up to US$10 million in fines.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> For the money laundering charges, they faced up to 20 years in prison and up to US$500,000 in fines. In addition, for smuggling drug proceeds internationally, they faced a maximum of 20 years in prison and US$500,000 in fines. Briones Ruiz and his wife were believed to have structured their transactions to hide the nature of their criminal activities; if found guilty, they faced up to ten years in prison and US$500,000 in fines. U.S. authorities were also seeking to forfeiture Nieto Gonz\u00e1lez's properties.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBriones Ruiz and the rest of his network are from Matamoros and U.S. authorities believe they are not residing in the U.S.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"hDBkh\" /> The case against Briones Ruiz and his network was built and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Hess. It included information from a joint investigation from the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), the [[United States Customs and Border Protection Authorization Act|Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), [[Texas Department of Public Safety]], Cameron County District Attorney's Office, the [[Cameron County Sheriff's Office]], the [[Willacy County Sheriff's Office]], and the Texas police departments of [[San Benito, Texas|San Benito]], [[Harlingen, Texas|Harlingen]], [[Port Isabel, Texas|Port Isabel]], and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], across the border from Matamoros.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Economic sanctions ===\nOn 21 May 2015, the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC), a branch of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], sanctioned Briones Ruiz under the [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]] (\"Kingpin Act\") for providing support to the international operations of the Gulf Cartel. He is designated as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker (SDNT).<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic sanction extends to four of Briones Ruiz's collaborators: Nieto Gonz\u00e1lez, Beattie de Briones, Ruiz Carri\u00f3n and Claudia Aid\u00e9 Briones Ruiz (his sister).<ref name=\"W16OA\" /> The sanction also extends to his company, Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V.<ref name=\"Xm02T\" /> As part of the sanction, the U.S. government prohibited U.S. citizens from engaging in business activities with these entities and individuals, and froze all of their U.S.-based assets.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to the OFAC, Briones Ruiz and his collaborators are responsible for smuggling cocaine shipments from Mexico to the U.S. Southwestern border. The drugs were distributed in U.S. states of Texas and Tennessee.<ref name=\"M0Rb7\" /> The earnings generated by their drug operations were smuggled back into Mexico by Briones Ruiz's network.<ref name=\":1\" /> His network used Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. to launder the Gulf Cartel's proceeds in Mexico and the U.S., where they deposited some of their earnings in Texan bank accounts. They bought multiple properties in Texas but U.S. authorities did not confirm how many. Most of the properties were seized by the U.S. Department of Justice as part of this investigation. Investigators stated that Briones Ruiz is the head of the criminal network and uses his family to further the Gulf Cartel's operations.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe information in the Kingpin Act designation was built by the DEA's field office in Brownsville and the S.D. Tex. If found guilty in a civil court, Briones Ruiz would face up to US$1.075 million in fines per violation. In a criminal court, Briones Ruiz (facing trial as a corporate officer of Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V.) would face up to 30 years in prison and up to US$5 million in fines. His corporation can face up to US$10 million in fines if a court determines that it participated in the stimulated charges.<ref name=\":1\" /> Briones Ruiz has an outstanding arrest warrant for his arrest in the U.S.; they have not issued a formal extradition request.<ref name=\":2\" /> Briones Ruiz is considered innocent until proven guilty of the drug offenses through [[Procedural due process|due process]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 10 July 2019, Mexico's [[Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera (Mexico)|Financial Intelligence Unit]] (UIF) informed the [[Attorney General of Mexico|Attorney General's Office]] (FGR) of the existence of eight gas stations that were suspected of being involved in money laundering.<ref name=\"52ykY\" /> Among them was Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. The UIF highlighted that Briones Ruiz's company was sanctioned by the OFAC years back. In order to limit their suspected laundering activities, the Mexican government froze all Mexican bank accounts owned by Briones Ruiz, his sister and that of Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V.<ref name=\"0ARL6\" /> The company was also blocked from being able to generate an official [[Servicio de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria|Tax Administration Service]] (SAT) digital logo, which effectively prevents it from conducting business operations. However, Briones Ruiz and his sister responded by issuing [[writ of amparo|writs of amparo]] to prevent the government from freezing their bank accounts. In the report, the UIF noted that another of the sanctioned gas companies,  KNG Ultra S.A. de C.V. (also known as Ultragas M\u00e9xico), made business transactions with Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V.<ref name=\"IFpGP\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mexican Drug War]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20150521.aspx|title=Counter Terrorism Designations; Iran Designations; Counter Narcotics Designations|last=|first=|date=21 May 2015|website=|publisher=[[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404183235/https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20150521.aspx|archive-date=4 April 2018|access-date=}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"acta\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gob.mx/ActaNacimiento/|title=Acta de nacimiento|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Government of Mexico]]|language=Spanish|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916134023/https://www.gob.mx/ActaNacimiento/|archive-date=16 September 2018|access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://validacion.cre.gob.mx/113d46c3-d8b5-4840-98fc-a4f2274cefc5.pdf|title=Permisos de expendio en estaciones de servicio (N\u00fam.

The licence allowed for Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. to operate for 30 years should they follow the conditions stipulated in the contract. Among the conditions were for Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. to ensure safety regulations, product control standards, insurance requirements, and that financial reports and transactions were kept for record-keeping.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Career ==\nBriones Ruiz, known also by his alias \"Cacho\", is a suspected drug trafficker of the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"PVepP\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/gulf-cartel-profile/|title=Gulf Cartel|last=|first=|date=30 January 2020|website=|publisher=[[InSight Crime]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401151723/https://www.insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/gulf-cartel-profile/|archive-date=1 April 2020|access-date=}}</ref> On 22 October 2014, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas]] (S.D.

They were also charged with money laundering and illegal financial structuring.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nFor the drug charges, they faced from ten years to [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life imprisonment]] and up to US$10 million in fines.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> For the money laundering charges, they faced up to 20 years in prison and up to US$500,000 in fines. In addition, for smuggling drug proceeds internationally, they faced a maximum of 20 years in prison and US$500,000 in fines. Briones Ruiz and his wife were believed to have structured their transactions to hide the nature of their criminal activities; if found guilty, they faced up to ten years in prison and US$500,000 in fines. U.S. authorities were also seeking to forfeiture Nieto Gonz\u00e1lez's properties.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBriones Ruiz and the rest of his network are from Matamoros and U.S. authorities believe they are not residing in the U.S.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"hDBkh\" /> The case against Briones Ruiz and his network was built and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Hess. It included information from a joint investigation from the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), the [[United States Customs and Border Protection Authorization Act|Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), [[Texas Department of Public Safety]], Cameron County District Attorney's Office, the [[Cameron County Sheriff's Office]], the [[Willacy County Sheriff's Office]], and the Texas police departments of [[San Benito, Texas|San Benito]], [[Harlingen, Texas|Harlingen]], [[Port Isabel, Texas|Port Isabel]], and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], across the border from Matamoros.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Economic sanctions ===\nOn 21 May 2015, the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC), a branch of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], sanctioned Briones Ruiz under the [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]] (\"Kingpin Act\") for providing support to the international operations of the Gulf Cartel. He is designated as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker (SDNT).<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic sanction extends to four of Briones Ruiz's collaborators: Nieto Gonz\u00e1lez, Beattie de Briones, Ruiz Carri\u00f3n and Claudia Aid\u00e9 Briones Ruiz (his sister).<ref name=\"W16OA\" /> The sanction also extends to his company, Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V.<ref name=\"Xm02T\" /> As part of the sanction, the U.S. government prohibited U.S. citizens from engaging in business activities with these entities and individuals, and froze all of their U.S.-based assets.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to the OFAC, Briones Ruiz and his collaborators are responsible for smuggling cocaine shipments from Mexico to the U.S. Southwestern border. The drugs were distributed in U.S. states of Texas and Tennessee.<ref name=\"M0Rb7\" /> The earnings generated by their drug operations were smuggled back into Mexico by Briones Ruiz's network.<ref name=\":1\" /> His network used Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. to launder the Gulf Cartel's proceeds in Mexico and the U.S., where they deposited some of their earnings in Texan bank accounts. They bought multiple properties in Texas but U.S. authorities did not confirm how many. Most of the properties were seized by the U.S. Department of Justice as part of this investigation. Investigators stated that Briones Ruiz is the head of the criminal network and uses his family to further the Gulf Cartel's operations.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe information in the Kingpin Act designation was built by the DEA's field office in Brownsville and the S.D. Tex. If found guilty in a civil court, Briones Ruiz would face up to US$1.075 million in fines per violation. In a criminal court, Briones Ruiz (facing trial as a corporate officer of Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V.) would face up to 30 years in prison and up to US$5 million in fines. His corporation can face up to US$10 million in fines if a court determines that it participated in the stimulated charges.<ref name=\":1\" /> Briones Ruiz has an outstanding arrest warrant for his arrest in the U.S.; they have not issued a formal extradition request.<ref name=\":2\" /> Briones Ruiz is considered innocent until proven guilty of the drug offenses through [[Procedural due process|due process]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 10 July 2019, Mexico's [[Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera (Mexico)|Financial Intelligence Unit]] (UIF) informed the [[Attorney General of Mexico|Attorney General's Office]] (FGR) of the existence of eight gas stations that were suspected of being involved in money laundering.<ref name=\"52ykY\" /> Among them was Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. The UIF highlighted that Briones Ruiz's company was sanctioned by the OFAC years back. In order to limit their suspected laundering activities, the Mexican government froze all Mexican bank accounts owned by Briones Ruiz, his sister and that of Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V.<ref name=\"0ARL6\" /> The company was also blocked from being able to generate an official [[Servicio de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria|Tax Administration Service]] (SAT) digital logo, which effectively prevents it from conducting business operations. However, Briones Ruiz and his sister responded by issuing [[writ of amparo|writs of amparo]] to prevent the government from freezing their bank accounts. In the report, the UIF noted that another of the sanctioned gas companies,  KNG Ultra S.A. de C.V. (also known as Ultragas M\u00e9xico), made business transactions with Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V.<ref name=\"IFpGP\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mexican Drug War]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20150521.aspx|title=Counter Terrorism Designations; Iran Designations; Counter Narcotics Designations|last=|first=|date=21 May 2015|website=|publisher=[[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404183235/https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20150521.aspx|archive-date=4 April 2018|access-date=}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"acta\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gob.mx/ActaNacimiento/|title=Acta de nacimiento|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Government of Mexico]]|language=Spanish|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916134023/https://www.gob.mx/ActaNacimiento/|archive-date=16 September 2018|access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://validacion.cre.gob.mx/113d46c3-d8b5-4840-98fc-a4f2274cefc5.pdf|title=Permisos de expendio en estaciones de servicio (N\u00fam.

The metric\ncombines a task's index of difficulty (''ID'') with the movement time (''MT'', in seconds) in selecting the target.  In Fitts's words, \n\"The average rate of information generated by a series of movements is the average information per movement divided by the time per movement.\"<ref name=Fitts1954>{{cite journal |last=Fitts |first=Paul M. |title=The information capacity of the human motor system in controlling the amplitude of movement |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=47 |number=6 |date=June 1954 |pages=381\u2013391 |doi=10.1037/h0055392 |pmid=13174710|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3087289229146fc344560478aac366e4977749c0 }}</ref>  Thus,\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\text{IP} = \\Bigg(\\frac{\\text{ID}} {\\text{MT}}\\Bigg)</math>\n\nToday, ''IP'' is more commonly called ''throughput'' (''TP'').  It is also common to include an adjustment for accuracy in the calculation.\n\nResearchers after Fitts began the practice of building linear regression equations and examining the \ncorrelation (''r'') for goodness of fit.  The equation expresses the relationship between\n''MT'' and the ''D'' and ''W'' task parameters:\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\text{MT} = a + b \\cdot \\text{ID} = a + b \\cdot \\log_2 \\Bigg(\\frac{2D}{W}\\Bigg)</math>\n\n[[File:Fitts&#039; Law Evaluation English.svg|thumb|Graph of the linear relationship of Fitts's law parameters]]\n\nwhere:\n*\t''MT'' is the average time to complete the movement.\n*\t''a'' and ''b'' are constants that depend on the choice of input device and are usually determined empirically by [[regression analysis]].

Slower but more precise movement in order to acquire the target\n\nThe first phase is defined by the distance to the target. In this phase the distance can be closed quickly while still being imprecise. The second movement tries to perform a slow and controlled precise movement to actually hit the target.\nThe task duration scales linearly in regards to difficulty.<ref name=\"Graham\">{{cite journal |title=Physical versus virtual pointing |journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |date=1996 |last=Graham |first=E.

L. |pages=292\u2013299 }}</ref> But as different tasks can have the same difficulty, it is derived that distance has a greater impact on the overall task completion time than target size. \n\nOften it is cited that Fitts's law can be applied to [[eye tracking]]. This seems to be at least a controversial topic as Drewes showed.<ref name=\"Drewes2011\">{{cite book |last=Drewes |first1=H. |title=Eye Gaze Tracking for Human Computer Interaction |chapter=Dissertation |publisher=LMU M\u00fcnchen: Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Mathematik, Informatik und Statistik |year=2011 }}</ref> During fast [[Eye movement#Saccades|saccadic eye movements]] the user is blind.

In Fitts's law, the distance represents signal strength, while target width is noise.\n\nUsing this form of the model, the difficulty of a pointing task was equated to a quantity of information transmitted (in units of bits) by performing the task. This was justified by the assertion that pointing reduces to an information processing task. Although no formal mathematical connection was established between Fitts's law and the Shannon-Hartley theorem it was inspired by, the Shannon form of the law has been used extensively, likely due to the appeal of quantifying motor actions using information theory. In 2002 the [[ISO 9241]] was published, providing standards for human\u2013computer interface testing, including the use of the Shannon form of Fitts's law. It has been shown that the information transmitted via serial keystrokes on a keyboard and the information implied by the ''ID'' for such a task are not consistent.<ref name=Soukoreff2011>{{cite journal\t|last1=Soukoreff |first1=R.

The authors note, though, that the error is negligible and only has to be accounted for in comparisons of devices with known entropy or measurements of human information processing capabilities.\n\n== Adjustment for accuracy: use of the effective target width ==\n\nAn important improvement to Fitts's law was proposed by Crossman in 1956 (see Welford, 1968, pp.&nbsp;147\u2013148)<ref name=Welford>{{cite book |last=Welford |first=A.

If the selections are logged as ''x'' coordinates along the axis of approach to the target, then\n\n<math display=\"block\">W_e = 4.133 \\times SD_x</math>\n\nThis yields\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\text{ID}_e = \\log_2 \\Bigg(\\frac{D}{W_e}+1\\Bigg)</math>\n\nand hence\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\text{IP} = \\Bigg(\\frac{ID_e} {MT}\\Bigg)</math>\n\nIf the selection coordinates are normally distributed, ''W''<sub>e</sub> spans 96% of the \ndistribution.  If the observed error rate was 4% in the sequence of trials, then ''W''<sub>e</sub> = ''W''.  If the error rate was greater than 4%, ''W''<sub>e</sub> > ''W'', and if the error rate was less than 4%, ''W''<sub>e</sub> < ''W''.  By using ''W''<sub>e</sub>, a Fitts' law model more closely\nreflects what users actually did, rather than what they were asked to do.\n\nThe main advantage in computing ''IP'' as above is that spatial variability, or accuracy, is included in the measurement.\nWith the adjustment for accuracy, Fitts's law\nmore truly encompasses the speed-accuracy tradeoff.  The equations above appear in ISO 9241-9 as the recommended method of\ncomputing ''throughput''.\n\n== Welford's model: innovations driven by predictive power ==\nNot long after the original model was proposed, a 2-factor variation was proposed under the intuition that target distance and width have separate effects on movement time. Welford's model, proposed in 1968, separated the influence of target distance and width into separate terms, and provided improved predictive power:<ref name=\"Welford\"/>\n\n<math display=\"block\">T = a + b_1 \\log_2 (D) + b_2 \\log_2 (W)</math>\n\nThis model has an additional parameter, so its predictive accuracy cannot be directly compared with 1-factor forms of Fitts's law. However, a variation on Welford's model inspired by the Shannon formulation,\n\n<math display=\"block\">T = a + b_1 \\log_2 (D+W) + b_2 \\log_2 (W) = a + b\\log_2 \\left(\\frac{D+W}{W^k}\\right)</math>\n\nThe additional parameter ''k'' allows the introduction of angles into the model. Now the users position can be accounted for. The influence of the angle can be weighted using the exponent. This addition was introduced by Kopper et al. in 2010.<ref name=\"Kopper2010\">{{cite journal |title=A human motor behavior model for distal pointing tasks |journal=International Journal of Human\u2013Computer Studies |last=Kopper |first=R. |last2=Bowman |first2=D.

If the latter are not incorporated into the model, then average movement times can be artificially decreased.\n\n== Temporal targets ==\nFitts's law deals only with targets defined in space. However, a target can be defined purely on the time axis, which is called a temporal target. A blinking target or a target moving toward a selection area are examples of temporal targets. Similar to space, the distance to the target (i.e., temporal distance ''D''<sub>t</sub>) and the width of the target (i.e., temporal width ''W''<sub>t</sub>) can be defined for temporal targets as well. The temporal distance is the amount of time a person must wait for a target to appear. The temporal width is a short duration from the moment the target appears until it disappears. For example, for a blinking target, ''D''<sub>t</sub> can be thought of as the period of blinking and ''W''<sub>t</sub> as the duration of the blinking. As with targets in space, the larger the ''D''<sub>t</sub> or the smaller the ''W''<sub>t</sub>, the more difficult it becomes to select the target.\n\nThe task of selecting the temporal target is called ''temporal pointing''. The model for temporal pointing was first presented to the [[human\u2013computer interaction]] field in 2016<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Byungjoo|last2=Oulasvirta|first2=Antti|date=2016|title=Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '16|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1857\u20131868|doi=10.1145/2858036.2858143|isbn=9781450333627}}</ref>. The model predicts the error rate, the human performance in temporal pointing, as a function of temporal index of difficulty (''ID''<sub>t</sub>):\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\text{ID}_{t} = \\log_2 \\Bigg(\\frac{D_{t}}{W_{t}}\\Bigg)</math>\n\n== Implications for UI design ==\n[[File:Magic Corners English.jpg|thumb|Magic Corners in [[Microsoft Windows]]]]\n[[File:Radial Menu English.jpg|thumb|Radial menu]]\n\nMultiple design guidelines for [[GUI|GUIs]] can be derived from the implications of Fitts's law.  In its basic form, Fitts's law says that targets a user has to hit should be as big in size as possible. This derived from the ''W'' parameter. More specifically, the effective size of the button should be as big as possible, meaning that their form has to be optimized for the movement direction of the user onto the target.\n\nLayouts should also group functions that are used commonly with each other close. Optimizing for the ''D'' parameter in this way allows for smaller travel times.\n\nPlacing layout elements on the four edges of the screen allows for infinitely large targets in one dimension and therefore present ideal scenarios. As the user's pointer will always stop at the edge, they can move the mouse with the greatest possible speed and still hit the target. The target area is effectively infinitely long along the movement axis. Therefore, this guideline is called \u201cRule of the infinite edges\u201d. The use of this rule can be seen for example in [[MacOS]], which places the menu bar always on the top left edge of the screen instead of the current programs windowframe.<ref name=\"Hale2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.particletree.com/features/visualizing-fittss-law/ |title=Visualizing Fitts's Law |last=Hale |first=K |publisher=Particletree |date=2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.is/WPAJb |archivedate=2019-12-08 |accessdate=2019-12-08 }}</ref>\n\nThis effect can be exaggerated at the four corners of a screen. At these points two edges collide and form a theoretically infinitely big button. [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] places its \"Start\" button in the lower left corner and [[Microsoft Office]] 2007 uses the upper left corner for its \"Office\" menu. These four spots get called the \u201cmagic corners\u201d.\n<ref name=\"Jensen2002\">{{cite web |url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jensenh/2006/08/22/giving-you-fitts/ |title=Giving You Fitts |last=Jensen |first=H. |publisher=Microsoft Developer |date=2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.is/OVvvC |archivedate=2019-12-08 |accessdate=2019-12-08 }}</ref>\nContradicting this rule is the positioning of the closing button by [[Microsoft]], which locates it in the upper right corner. The action of this button can be misused very easily in fullscreen applications due to its placement. [[MacOS]] places the button on the upper left side of the program window and the menu bar fills out the magic corner with another button.\n\nA UI that allows for pop-up menus rather than fixed drop-down menus reduces travel times for the ''D'' parameter. The user can continue interaction right from their mouse position and don't have to move to a different preset area. Many operating systems use this when displaying right-click context menus. As the menu starts right on the pixel which the user clicked on, this pixel is referred to as the \"magic\" or \"prime pixel\".<ref name=\"Zhao2002\">{{cite journal |title=Fitt's Law: Modeling Movement Time in HCI |journal=Theories in Computer Human Interaction |year=2002 |last=Zhao |first=H. |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1337/1b377afc61d4dc918cd69edf66e78a834067.pdf |accessdate=2019-12-08 }}</ref>\n\nJames Boritz et al.

The metric\ncombines a task's index of difficulty (''ID'') with the movement time (''MT'', in seconds) in selecting the target.

In Fitts's law, the distance represents signal strength, while target width is noise.\n\nUsing this form of the model, the difficulty of a pointing task was equated to a quantity of information transmitted (in units of bits) by performing the task. This was justified by the assertion that pointing reduces to an information processing task. Although no formal mathematical connection was established between Fitts's law and the Shannon-Hartley theorem it was inspired by, the Shannon form of the law has been used extensively, likely due to the appeal of quantifying motor actions using information theory. In 2002 the [[ISO 9241]] was published, providing standards for human\u2013computer interface testing, including the use of the Shannon form of Fitts's law. It has been shown that the information transmitted via serial keystrokes on a keyboard and the information implied by the ''ID'' for such a task are not consistent.<ref name=Soukoreff2011>{{cite journal\t|last1=Soukoreff |first1=R.

The authors note, though, that the error is negligible and only has to be accounted for in comparisons of devices with known entropy or measurements of human information processing capabilities.\n\n== Adjustment for accuracy: use of the effective target width ==\n\nAn important improvement to Fitts's law was proposed by Crossman in 1956 (see Welford, 1968, pp.&nbsp;147\u2013148)<ref name=Welford>{{cite book |last=Welford |first=A.

If the selections are logged as ''x'' coordinates along the axis of approach to the target, then\n\n<math display=\"block\">W_e = 4.133 \\times SD_x</math>\n\nThis yields\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\text{ID}_e = \\log_2 \\Bigg(\\frac{D}{W_e}+1\\Bigg)</math>\n\nand hence\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\text{IP} = \\Bigg(\\frac{ID_e} {MT}\\Bigg)</math>\n\nIf the selection coordinates are normally distributed, ''W''<sub>e</sub> spans 96% of the \ndistribution.  If the observed error rate was 4% in the sequence of trials, then ''W''<sub>e</sub> = ''W''.  If the error rate was greater than 4%, ''W''<sub>e</sub> > ''W'', and if the error rate was less than 4%, ''W''<sub>e</sub> < ''W''.  By using ''W''<sub>e</sub>, a Fitts' law model more closely\nreflects what users actually did, rather than what they were asked to do.\n\nThe main advantage in computing ''IP'' as above is that spatial variability, or accuracy, is included in the measurement.\nWith the adjustment for accuracy, Fitts's law\nmore truly encompasses the speed-accuracy tradeoff.  The equations above appear in ISO 9241-9 as the recommended method of\ncomputing ''throughput''.\n\n== Welford's model: innovations driven by predictive power ==\nNot long after the original model was proposed, a 2-factor variation was proposed under the intuition that target distance and width have separate effects on movement time. Welford's model, proposed in 1968, separated the influence of target distance and width into separate terms, and provided improved predictive power:<ref name=\"Welford\"/>\n\n<math display=\"block\">T = a + b_1 \\log_2 (D) + b_2 \\log_2 (W)</math>\n\nThis model has an additional parameter, so its predictive accuracy cannot be directly compared with 1-factor forms of Fitts's law. However, a variation on Welford's model inspired by the Shannon formulation,\n\n<math display=\"block\">T = a + b_1 \\log_2 (D+W) + b_2 \\log_2 (W) = a + b\\log_2 \\left(\\frac{D+W}{W^k}\\right)</math>\n\nThe additional parameter ''k'' allows the introduction of angles into the model. Now the users position can be accounted for. The influence of the angle can be weighted using the exponent. This addition was introduced by Kopper et al. in 2010.<ref name=\"Kopper2010\">{{cite journal |title=A human motor behavior model for distal pointing tasks |journal=International Journal of Human\u2013Computer Studies |last=Kopper |first=R. |last2=Bowman |first2=D.

If the latter are not incorporated into the model, then average movement times can be artificially decreased.\n\n== Temporal targets ==\nFitts's law deals only with targets defined in space. However, a target can be defined purely on the time axis, which is called a temporal target. A blinking target or a target moving toward a selection area are examples of temporal targets. Similar to space, the distance to the target (i.e., temporal distance ''D''<sub>t</sub>) and the width of the target (i.e., temporal width ''W''<sub>t</sub>) can be defined for temporal targets as well. The temporal distance is the amount of time a person must wait for a target to appear. The temporal width is a short duration from the moment the target appears until it disappears. For example, for a blinking target, ''D''<sub>t</sub> can be thought of as the period of blinking and ''W''<sub>t</sub> as the duration of the blinking. As with targets in space, the larger the ''D''<sub>t</sub> or the smaller the ''W''<sub>t</sub>, the more difficult it becomes to select the target.\n\nThe task of selecting the temporal target is called ''temporal pointing''. The model for temporal pointing was first presented to the [[human\u2013computer interaction]] field in 2016<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Byungjoo|last2=Oulasvirta|first2=Antti|date=2016|title=Modelling Error Rates in Temporal Pointing|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '16|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1857\u20131868|doi=10.1145/2858036.2858143|isbn=9781450333627}}</ref>. The model predicts the error rate, the human performance in temporal pointing, as a function of temporal index of difficulty (''ID''<sub>t</sub>):\n\n<math display=\"block\">\\text{ID}_{t} = \\log_2 \\Bigg(\\frac{D_{t}}{W_{t}}\\Bigg)</math>\n\n== Implications for UI design ==\n[[File:Magic Corners English.jpg|thumb|Magic Corners in [[Microsoft Windows]]]]\n[[File:Radial Menu English.jpg|thumb|Radial menu]]\n\nMultiple design guidelines for [[GUI|GUIs]] can be derived from the implications of Fitts's law.  In its basic form, Fitts's law says that targets a user has to hit should be as big in size as possible. This derived from the ''W'' parameter. More specifically, the effective size of the button should be as big as possible, meaning that their form has to be optimized for the movement direction of the user onto the target.\n\nLayouts should also group functions that are used commonly with each other close. Optimizing for the ''D'' parameter in this way allows for smaller travel times.\n\nPlacing layout elements on the four edges of the screen allows for infinitely large targets in one dimension and therefore present ideal scenarios. As the user's pointer will always stop at the edge, they can move the mouse with the greatest possible speed and still hit the target. The target area is effectively infinitely long along the movement axis. Therefore, this guideline is called \u201cRule of the infinite edges\u201d. The use of this rule can be seen for example in [[MacOS]], which places the menu bar always on the top left edge of the screen instead of the current programs windowframe.<ref name=\"Hale2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.particletree.com/features/visualizing-fittss-law/ |title=Visualizing Fitts's Law |last=Hale |first=K |publisher=Particletree |date=2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.is/WPAJb |archivedate=2019-12-08 |accessdate=2019-12-08 }}</ref>\n\nThis effect can be exaggerated at the four corners of a screen. At these points two edges collide and form a theoretically infinitely big button. [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] places its \"Start\" button in the lower left corner and [[Microsoft Office]] 2007 uses the upper left corner for its \"Office\" menu. These four spots get called the \u201cmagic corners\u201d.\n<ref name=\"Jensen2002\">{{cite web |url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jensenh/2006/08/22/giving-you-fitts/ |title=Giving You Fitts |last=Jensen |first=H. |publisher=Microsoft Developer |date=2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.is/OVvvC |archivedate=2019-12-08 |accessdate=2019-12-08 }}</ref>\nContradicting this rule is the positioning of the closing button by [[Microsoft]], which locates it in the upper right corner. The action of this button can be misused very easily in fullscreen applications due to its placement. [[MacOS]] places the button on the upper left side of the program window and the menu bar fills out the magic corner with another button.\n\nA UI that allows for pop-up menus rather than fixed drop-down menus reduces travel times for the ''D'' parameter. The user can continue interaction right from their mouse position and don't have to move to a different preset area. Many operating systems use this when displaying right-click context menus. As the menu starts right on the pixel which the user clicked on, this pixel is referred to as the \"magic\" or \"prime pixel\".<ref name=\"Zhao2002\">{{cite journal |title=Fitt's Law: Modeling Movement Time in HCI |journal=Theories in Computer Human Interaction |year=2002 |last=Zhao |first=H. |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1337/1b377afc61d4dc918cd69edf66e78a834067.pdf |accessdate=2019-12-08 }}</ref>\n\nJames Boritz et al.

At the age of eighteen Mubarik began to break away from religion due to contradictions between the teachings of the [[Quran|Qu'ran]] and the way people practice the religion. At first he attempted to practice [[Quranism|Qu'ranism]], but eventually he began to pursue more scientific thought and is no longer religious. However, Mubarik states that Islam still influences him and his music to an extent.<ref name=\":55\" />\n\nMubarik grew up in a \"very working class background, which has obviously shaped a lot of [his] political leanings\". He has repeatedly expressed anti-capitalist sentiment on various interviews and is a self-described [[Marxist-Leninist-Maoist|Marxist-Lenninist-Maoist]]. His political leanings have heavily influenced his musical content, which can be seen most clearly on ''Ilah''.\n\nMubarik's political views have influenced his nationality, which he expressed on his podcast by saying that, \"I was born and live in a place that most people call Canada, which is a [[Settler colonialism|settler-colonial]] state. But I prefer to call it [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. I usually never call myself [[Canadians|Canadian]], but just consider myself to be [[African Americans|African]]\"\n\nMubarik moved to [[Edmonton]] in the spring of 2019.\n\n== Politics and Podcast ==\n\n=== Political Activism and Organizing ===\nIn October of 2016 Mubarik was walking in downtown [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] when he witnessed an altercation between a white woman and a black taxi driver. The woman was attempting to physically harm the taxi driver while yelling obscenities at him, including the [[N-word]] and the phrase \"go back to Africa\". Mubarik videotaped the incident and posted it on [[Facebook]] where he commented on the event saying, \"Racism is 100 per cent intertwined with [[capitalism]] and overall inequality\". The woman has since been investigated by the [[Hamilton Police Service|Hamilton Police]] Hate Crime Unit and has been charged with assault.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Carter|first=Adam|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|title=Woman calls cab driver n\u2014ger during altercation caught on tape|date=October 4, 2016|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=February 16, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008130145/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|archive-date=October 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|title=Emay \u2013 Bakkah: The History of Humankind|last=Njegovan|first=Biljana|date=October 28, 2016|website=Cut From Steel|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225205419/http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first community organizing that Mubarik was involved with was done through the organization called the Young Communist League a democratic socialist group in Canada.

At the age of eighteen Mubarik began to break away from religion due to contradictions between the teachings of the [[Quran|Qu'ran]] and the way people practice the religion. At first he attempted to practice [[Quranism|Qu'ranism]], but eventually he began to pursue more scientific thought and is no longer religious. However, Mubarik states that Islam still influences him and his music to an extent.<ref name=\":55\" />\n\nMubarik grew up in a \"very working class background, which has obviously shaped a lot of [his] political leanings\". He has repeatedly expressed anti-capitalist sentiment on various interviews and is a self-described [[Marxist-Leninist-Maoist|Marxist-Lenninist-Maoist]]. His political leanings have heavily influenced his musical content, which can be seen most clearly on ''Ilah''.\n\nMubarik's political views have influenced his nationality, which he expressed on his podcast by saying that, \"I was born and live in a place that most people call Canada, which is a [[Settler colonialism|settler-colonial]] state. But I prefer to call it [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]].
