Zimmerman then became known as the \"dead mouse guy\" among friends. He tried to change his name to \"Deadmouse\" in an online chat room, but it was too long, so he shortened it to \"Deadmau5\". \"Maus\" is the German word for \"mouse\" and is pronounced the same as in English; the ending 5 instead of an 's' is a form of [[leet]].<ref name=\"aritcle0101\" />\n\nZimmerman created the original logo\u2014called \"mau5head\"\u2014while learning how to use some 3D modelling software.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2010/may/28/deadmau5|title=Paul Morley meets deadmau5 \u2013 The Guardian|accessdate=October 1, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615072350/http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2010/may/28/deadmau5|archivedate=June 15, 2015}}</ref> The logo appears in many different colors and designs, and has been shown on the cover art of most of Zimmerman's albums.

It tells the story of an adolescent boy who joins an [[outlaw]] band and takes part in a great rebellion against the [[Feudalism|feudal]] elite.  Trease's first novel, ''Bows Against the Barons'' marks the start of his prolific career as a historical novelist. It is notable for reinterpreting the Robin Hood legend and revitalizing the conventions of children's [[historical fiction]] in 20th-century Britain.\n\n==Plot introduction==\nSet in medieval England, ''Bows Against the Barons'' relates the adventures of a [[peasant]] boy who becomes an outlaw and joins the band of Robin Hood. Together, they take up arms against the masters of England and fight for the rights of the common people. The protagonist's former master tries to suppress them, but at great cost.\n\nThe title refers to the primary weapon of the outlaws \u2013 the [[longbow]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n''Bows Against the Barons'' takes place during the final months of Robin Hood's life, beginning in early June, and ending in the following year about February. It is largely told from the viewpoint of Dickon, a sixteen-year-old peasant boy from the village of [[Oxton, Nottinghamshire|Oxton]].\n\n===Chapters 1\u20139===\nThe novel opens by depicting Dickon's hardships as a [[serf]] on a [[baron]]ial [[Manorialism|manor]]. The boy being whipped by his [[bailiff]] for missing work and harassed by the village priest for not paying [[tithe]]. Despite his youth, Dickon has to serve as his family's breadwinner because his father Dick has been conscripted as an archer for the [[Crusades]]. His troubles are compounded when the King's deer from nearby [[Sherwood Forest]] ravage his garden's.  Moved by anger, Dickon kills one of the deer with an arrow. He then flees into Sherwood to avoid the penalties of [[poaching]]. Eventually, he meets [[Alan-a-Dale]], who leads him to Robin Hood's band. Proving adept at archery, Dickon is welcomed into their company.\n\nDisguised as a weaver's apprentice, Dickon becomes Robin's messenger to all of [[Nottingham]]'s rebels. Led by a bridle-smith, Dickon and the populace assemble in the market-place to protest working conditions and demand the release of imprisoned workers. The [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] attempts to disperse them, but Robin and his outlaws arrive and overwhelm the Sheriff. In the resulting riot the imprisoned workers are freed. However, mounted soldiers from [[Nottingham Castle]] arrive to quash the revolt.\n\nPursued by a horseman, Dickon escapes through secret passages and reaches the safety of Sherwood, but he is captured by [[royal forest]]ers and escorted north to be tried for poaching. However, Alan manages to make contact with Dickon, having disguised himself as a blind [[minstrel]] and his messages as [[doggerel]]. On Alan's instructions, Dickon attempts to delay the foresters' journey. His plans almost go awry when he meets his former master Sir Rolf D'Eyncourt, who has returned from the Crusades and now attempts to reclaim Dickon. Fortunately, the head forester refuses to hand over the boy, insisting on the priority of royal justice. As his journey resumes, Dickon vows revenge when he learns that his father has been killed in battle.  When Dickon and the foresters eventually reach a village, the blacksmith and the villagers protest Dickon's captivity. In the ensuing struggle, a forester almost kills Dickon, but Alan arrives in time and saves him. Together, they join the villagers in defeating the foresters.\n\nLater, soldiers are dispatched from Nottingham to punish the villagers, but Robin and his band ambush and defeat them before they reach their destination.\n\n===Chapters 10\u201320===\nIn the meantime, Sir Rolf exploits and oppresses his tenants in his pursuit of wealth and luxury. The outlaws of Sherwood oppose him, stirring up the serfs to resist his tyranny. Allied with neighboring barons, Sir Rolf pens the outlaws in Sherwood and attempts to hunt them down. The outlaws defeat them by hiding in trees and picking off his men from camouflaged positions. As they celebrate their victory, Robin reveals his ultimate goal \u2013 the overthrow of all masters and freedom for the people of England.\n\nThe outlaws now prepare for an attack on D'Eyncourt Castle, gathering money for their needs. Alan leads Dickon and others to waylay the Abbot of Rufford, disguising themselves as  knights and luring him into an ambush. Seeing Dickon's talent for disguises, Robin sends the boy to infiltrate D'Eyncourt Castle and acquire information about its defences. Disguised as a [[Page (servant)|page]] with bleached hair, Dickon manages to penetrate D'Eyncourt on Christmas, but is betrayed by an undyed lock of hair. Pursued, he hides on the chapel's beams and eventually escapes from the castle, surviving a [[crossbow]] shot.\n\nWith Dickon's information, the outlaws finally attack D'Eyncourt Castle during winter. Alan leads Dickon and a group of outlaws to infiltrate and capture the castle [[keep]]. Taking up positions on its [[battlement]]s, they pick off D'Eyncourt's defenders with their arrows while Robin launches the main assault on the outer walls. His combined force of outlaws and serfs eventually breaks through and razes the castle. Dickon kills his former bailiff, while [[Little John]] kills Sir Rolf.\n\nHeartened by their success, the outlaws attempt to march on Nottingham itself. However, the [[Earl of Wessex]] traps them in a [[pincer movement]] between Nottingham and [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]] and defeats them all. When his ally the Archbishop wonders aloud why the rebels die so willingly on the swords of his soldiers the Earl replies grimly: \"because they know that they are going to win - but not in my time\".\n\nAlan, [[Friar Tuck]] and [[Will Scarlet]] are among those killed. Dickon, Robin and Little John survive the battle and flee north with other survivors to [[Yorkshire]], undergoing much hardship on their journey. Dickon almost drowns in a [[bog]]. Wounded, Robin takes refuge in [[Kirklees, Kirklees|Kirklees]], whose prioress [[Bloodletting|bleeds]] him to death to claim a reward from the Earl. Alerted by an arrow shot by Robin from his deathbed, the outlaws reclaim his body and burn down the priory in revenge.\n\nAfter burying Robin, the outlaw band breaks up. Dickon and Little John are the only ones who remain dedicated to Robin's cause. They depart for the [[High Peak (upland)|High Peak]] in Derbyshire, determined to continue Robin's work and fulfill his visionary ideal.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Fictional characters===\nIn order of appearance:\n* '''Dickon''': The protagonist.

In the last two chapters, it shifts north through the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]] into [[Yorkshire]]. As a Robin Hood novel, ''Bows Against the Barons'' features many places associated with the legend: [[Sherwood Forest]], [[Nottingham]], [[Kirklees, Kirklees|Kirklees]], [[Hathersage]]. [[Barnsdale]] is mentioned several times as an alternative refuge and destination for Sherwood's outlaws. The novel also alludes briefly to [[Edwinstowe]].\n\nThe novel takes place during the period of the [[Crusades]], although it does not specify which one. It mentions that Sir Rolf has campaigned in the [[Holy Land]] and visited the \"rotting courts of Eastern Europe\",<ref name=\"Chapter 10\">Chapter 10.</ref> an allusion to the [[Byzantine Empire]] in its decline. Sir Rolf's tyranny is attributed in part to \"[[Derogatory use of \"Byzantine\"|new notions of cruelty and luxury]]\" picked up in the latter place.<ref name=\"Chapter 10\"/> The novel also alludes to the [[Norman Conquest]] as a historical background, depicting Nottingham as a town divided between [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Normans|Norman]] [[borough]]s, and comparing the battle between Robin and Wessex to the [[Battle of Hastings]].\n\nIn his 1948 foreword and 1966 postscript, Trease compares his novel's events to the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381]], and his version of Robin Hood to medieval rebels such as [[Wat Tyler]], [[Kett's Rebellion|Robert Kett]] and [[Jack Cade]].<ref name=\"Trease, Foreword, 7\">Trease, Foreword, 7.</ref><ref name=\"Trease, Postscript, 151\">Trease, Postscript, 151.</ref>\n\n==Major themes==\n[[File:Bows Against the Barons (Boland).jpg|thumb|right|Foreground from the first-edition illustration of the Nottingham riot.]] ''Bows Against the Barons'' is notable for its leftwing [[Revisionism (fictional)|revision]] of the Robin Hood legend. In contrast to earlier depictions of the outlaw as a nobleman and loyal subject of the king, it portrays Robin as a [[Populism|populist]] figure of the [[Far left|radical left]].<ref name=\"Knight 178-180\">Knight 178\u2013180.</ref><ref>Watson 714 on \"Geoffrey Trease\": \"Politically, he stood well to the left, and the Robin Hood and his comrades of Trease's first novel, ''Bows Against the Barons'' (1934), would have been more at home in Moscow than in Hollywood.\"</ref> The novel depicts Robin's outlaws as guerilla rebels who aid workers in a medieval [[class struggle]] against their masters,<ref name=\"Knight 178-180\"/> and it employs much revolutionary rhetoric, bearing chapter titles such as \"Comrades of the Forest\" and \"The People Speak\".<ref name=\"Knight 178\">Knight 178.</ref> The Robin Hood scholar [[Stephen Thomas Knight]] describes the novel as being \"rich with the leftist enthusiasm of the mid 1930s\",<ref name=\"Knight 178\"/> comparing the Nottingham riot scene to [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''.<ref name=\"Knight 178\"/>\n\nThe first edition of ''Bows Against the Barons'' supplemented the novel's leftist rhetoric with illustrations of a similar nature. For example, one of these illustrations depicts the Nottingham riot as a crowd scene filled with [[Hammer and sickle|hammer-and-sickle]] imagery.<ref name=\"Knight 178\"/> (See image to the right.)\n\n''Bows Against the Barons'' is also a [[Coming of age|coming-of-age]] story that depicts an adolescent protagonist's attempts to overcome difficulties and understand his place in the world.<ref name=\"Barnhouse\">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4063/is_200301/ai_n9183036 Barnhouse] 3.</ref>\n\n==Literary context==\n\n===Background===\nTrease began composing ''Bows Against the Barons'' in 1933.<ref>Trease, \"Fifty years on\", 150.</ref> In his 1948 foreword and 1966 postscript to the novel, he explained his motivation for doing so.<ref name=\"Trease, Foreword, 7\"/><ref name=\"Trease, Postscript, 151\"/> Since childhood, he had enjoyed reading stories about Robin Hood but also felt doubtful about some details in these stories \u2013 for example, the portrayal of outlaw life with its hardships as \"jolly\",<ref name=\"Trease, Foreword, 7\"/><ref name=\"Trease, Postscript, 151\"/> and Robin's subservience to the king. Trease thus wanted to \"create a new picture of Sherwood Forest which should be truer to life\".<ref name=\"Trease, Foreword, 7\"/><ref name=\"Trease, Postscript, 151\"/>\n\nIn a 1996 essay, Trease provided a more detailed context for his novel's composition:\n \n{{quote|As a child, I had been a [[G. A. Henty|Henty]] addict... [and] had absorbed the Henty values \u2013 the glories of war, the superiority of the [[British Empire]] and a white skin, the inferiority of the female...

[I]n 1933 I was a rather naive Left-wing member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], newly married and struggling to survive as a freelance writer.... [A]fter a rejected novel and other disappointments the desperate idea came to me, though even then it was largely prompted by my political sympathies. Why should children be educated \u2013 indeed indoctrinated \u2013 with Right-wing views and then later have to be laboriously converted, one by one, to the Left-wing gospel? Could we not catch them young?<ref>Trease, \"Sixty years on\", 132\u2013133.</ref>}}\n\nTo realise his idea, Trease approached a publisher associated with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] and made his proposal for a leftist Robin Hood novel.<ref name=\"Trease, Sixty Years on, 133\">Trease, \"Sixty Years on\", 133.</ref> It was accepted. ''Bows Against the Barons'' was written \"at white-hot speed\"<ref name=\"Trease, Sixty Years on, 133\"/> and published in the following year.\n\nIn later years, Trease was critical about his own novel. He found fault with its historical errors and lack of research, both of which he attributed to youthful over-confidence,<ref name=\"Trease, Fifty years on, 151\"/> and made efforts to \"remove the worst blemishes\" in later editions.<ref name=\"Trease, Fifty years on, 152\">Trease, \"Fifty years on\", 152.</ref> He also criticised the novel for being \"propagandist\"<ref name=\"Trease, Fifty years on, 151\"/> and toned down its leftist rhetoric in later editions \u2013 for example, removing the words \"[[working class|workers]]\" and \"[[comrade]]\" from much of the text.<ref name=\"Knight 180\"/> However, Trease also acknowledged its \"vitality\"<ref name=\"Trease, Fifty years on, 152\"/> as a \"young man's book\".<ref>Trease, Postscript, 152.</ref>\n\n===Reception===\nInitially, the novel met a largely indifferent response in Britain and the United States. As the author later recalled, it was \"neither denounced nor derided but largely ignored\".<ref name=\"Trease, Sixty Years on, 133\"/> However, it was an immediate success in the [[Soviet Union]], which resulted in a five-month visit there by the author and his wife to collect [[royalties]] in 1935.<ref name=\"Trease, Sixty Years on, 133\"/><ref>[http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/history.html#trease British Children's Historical Novels: Geoffrey Trease.]</ref> It was at this time that he contributed to a journal called 'International Literature: Organ of the International Union of Revolutionary Writers' Number 7 (1935) with an article 'Revolutionary Literature for the Young' in which he lays out some principles of what this should be and suggests that there should be a new kind of hero in children's books.\n\nIn ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' (1984), [[Humphrey Carpenter]] and Mari Prichard criticised ''Bows Against the Barons'' for its \"political preaching\",<ref name=\"Carpenter and Prichard 541\">Carpenter and Prichard 541.</ref> especially for making \"Robin [speak] like a member of the British Communist Party during the 1930s\".<ref name=\"Carpenter and Prichard 541\"/> However, they also praised the novel as \"a well-crafted adventure story, showing the narrative skill which is characteristic of all Trease's fiction\".<ref name=\"Carpenter and Prichard 541\"/>\n\n===Significance===\nAs Trease's first novel, ''Bows Against the Barons'' marks his debut in children's historical fiction. He would continue contributing to this genre until 1997.<ref>See the main [[Geoffrey Trease]] article for a list of his books.</ref>\n\n''Bows Against the Barons'' is notable for its radical reworking of conventions for children's historical fiction in Britain. Its anti-authoritarian stance challenged the conservative values that had dominated the genre since the 19th century,<ref>Watson 7 on \"adventure fiction\": \"G.A. Henty's numerous historical adventure stories[']... choice of setting, character and action express[es] the ideals of contemporary British imperialism. [W.E. Johns' ''Biggles'' series is characterized by] anachronistic attitudes to race, gender, class and patriotism... As society's attitudes to conflict and morality shifted, the historical adventure story of the 19th century changed. The change began with Geoffrey Trease's ''Bows Against the Barons'' (1934), a radical retelling of the Robin Hood stories.\"</ref><ref>Hollindale 205: \"The last fifty years have seen a sea-change in historical fiction for children.... The first change came in England in the 1930s, most notably in Geoffrey Trease's groundbreaking ''Bows Against the Barons''. Trease's novel, a left-wing representation of the Robin Hood story, signaled a dissatisfaction with romantic and patriotic stereotypes in historical fiction, and a belief that historical stories could be more politically sophisticated, more carefully researched, and more skeptical of self-gratifying national myths than stories of this kind had previously been.\"</ref> especially the [[imperialist]] works of [[G. A. Henty]].<ref>Watson 7.</ref> Its modern prose style, [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] characterisation, and [[Realism (arts)|realist]] attention to the harshness of medieval life all mark significant departures from the [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] focus and [[Romanticism|romantic]] glamour that had dominated the genre since the 19th century.<ref>Watson 335 on \"historical fiction\": \"In Britain in the middle of the 20th century, the innovations of Geoffrey Trease introduced a fresh modern style and a democratic point of view to a genre that had become fossilized.... As early as 1934, when he wrote ''Bows Against the Barons''..., he was determined... to show not the glamour of its hero, but the brutal conditions in which the peasants lived. This represented a marked change in the outlook of children's historical fiction, which in the 19th century had worked on the assumption that a middle-class readership would be primarily interested in the lives of the aristocracy.\"</ref><ref>Fisher 491: \"[The] early books [of juvenile historical fiction] were in the main adventures or historical romances, rather than attempts to create a living past. In 1934 Geoffrey Trease wrote ''Bows Against the Barons'' and changed the nature of the genre. He painted a picture of a man fighting injustice and oppression, not the swashbuckling Robin Hood of legend but a revolutionary character, a real living person who just happened to be from the past, full of colour and vigour.\"</ref> These changes anticipate the mid-20th-century renewal of children's historical fiction by writers such as [[Rosemary Sutcliff]], [[Henry Treece]], [[Cynthia Harnett]] and Trease himself.<ref>Watson 7, 335. He credits them with continuing Trease's \"liberalisation of the historical adventure novel\" (7) and inaugurating the \"golden age\" of children's historical fiction (335).</ref>\n\nIn a 1995 ''[[Socialist Review]]'' article on children's fiction, [[Alan Gibbons]] cites ''Bows Against the Barons'' as a seminal work of socialist literature for children, praising it as an \"inspirational read\" and comparing its conclusion to [[Howard Fast]]'s ''[[Spartacus (Fast novel)|Spartacus]]''.<ref>[http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/sr190/gibbons.htm \"Once upon a time.\"]</ref>\n\nA 2003 ''[[The Assembly on Literature for Adolescents|ALAN Review]]'' article credits ''Bows Against the Barons'' with founding the genre of the [[young adult fiction|young adult]] Robin Hood novel.<ref name=\"Barnhouse\"/> Subsequent contributions to this genre have included [[Monica Furlong]]'s ''Robin's Country'', [[Theresa Tomlinson]]'s ''Forestwife'' trilogy, [[Nancy Springer]]'s ''Rowan Hood'' series, [[Robin McKinley]]'s ''The Outlaws of Sherwood'' and Michael Cadnum's ''Forbidden Forest''.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4063/is_200301/ai_n9183036 Barnhouse] 4\u20138.</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n* 1934, UK, Martin Lawrence, [http://worldcat.org/oclc/6171653 OCLC 6171653], Hardcover.

It tells the story of an adolescent boy who joins an [[outlaw]] band and takes part in a great rebellion against the [[Feudalism|feudal]] elite.  Trease's first novel, ''Bows Against the Barons'' marks the start of his prolific career as a historical novelist. It is notable for reinterpreting the Robin Hood legend and revitalizing the conventions of children's [[historical fiction]] in 20th-century Britain.\n\n==Plot introduction==\nSet in medieval England, ''Bows Against the Barons'' relates the adventures of a [[peasant]] boy who becomes an outlaw and joins the band of Robin Hood. Together, they take up arms against the masters of England and fight for the rights of the common people. The protagonist's former master tries to suppress them, but at great cost.\n\nThe title refers to the primary weapon of the outlaws \u2013 the [[longbow]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n''Bows Against the Barons'' takes place during the final months of Robin Hood's life, beginning in early June, and ending in the following year about February. It is largely told from the viewpoint of Dickon, a sixteen-year-old peasant boy from the village of [[Oxton, Nottinghamshire|Oxton]].\n\n===Chapters 1\u20139===\nThe novel opens by depicting Dickon's hardships as a [[serf]] on a [[baron]]ial [[Manorialism|manor]]. The boy being whipped by his [[bailiff]] for missing work and harassed by the village priest for not paying [[tithe]]. Despite his youth, Dickon has to serve as his family's breadwinner because his father Dick has been conscripted as an archer for the [[Crusades]]. His troubles are compounded when the King's deer from nearby [[Sherwood Forest]] ravage his garden's.  Moved by anger, Dickon kills one of the deer with an arrow. He then flees into Sherwood to avoid the penalties of [[poaching]]. Eventually, he meets [[Alan-a-Dale]], who leads him to Robin Hood's band. Proving adept at archery, Dickon is welcomed into their company.\n\nDisguised as a weaver's apprentice, Dickon becomes Robin's messenger to all of [[Nottingham]]'s rebels. Led by a bridle-smith, Dickon and the populace assemble in the market-place to protest working conditions and demand the release of imprisoned workers. The [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] attempts to disperse them, but Robin and his outlaws arrive and overwhelm the Sheriff. In the resulting riot the imprisoned workers are freed. However, mounted soldiers from [[Nottingham Castle]] arrive to quash the revolt.\n\nPursued by a horseman, Dickon escapes through secret passages and reaches the safety of Sherwood, but he is captured by [[royal forest]]ers and escorted north to be tried for poaching. However, Alan manages to make contact with Dickon, having disguised himself as a blind [[minstrel]] and his messages as [[doggerel]]. On Alan's instructions, Dickon attempts to delay the foresters' journey. His plans almost go awry when he meets his former master Sir Rolf D'Eyncourt, who has returned from the Crusades and now attempts to reclaim Dickon. Fortunately, the head forester refuses to hand over the boy, insisting on the priority of royal justice. As his journey resumes, Dickon vows revenge when he learns that his father has been killed in battle.  When Dickon and the foresters eventually reach a village, the blacksmith and the villagers protest Dickon's captivity. In the ensuing struggle, a forester almost kills Dickon, but Alan arrives in time and saves him. Together, they join the villagers in defeating the foresters.\n\nLater, soldiers are dispatched from Nottingham to punish the villagers, but Robin and his band ambush and defeat them before they reach their destination.\n\n===Chapters 10\u201320===\nIn the meantime, Sir Rolf exploits and oppresses his tenants in his pursuit of wealth and luxury. The outlaws of Sherwood oppose him, stirring up the serfs to resist his tyranny. Allied with neighboring barons, Sir Rolf pens the outlaws in Sherwood and attempts to hunt them down. The outlaws defeat them by hiding in trees and picking off his men from camouflaged positions. As they celebrate their victory, Robin reveals his ultimate goal \u2013 the overthrow of all masters and freedom for the people of England.\n\nThe outlaws now prepare for an attack on D'Eyncourt Castle, gathering money for their needs. Alan leads Dickon and others to waylay the Abbot of Rufford, disguising themselves as  knights and luring him into an ambush. Seeing Dickon's talent for disguises, Robin sends the boy to infiltrate D'Eyncourt Castle and acquire information about its defences. Disguised as a [[Page (servant)|page]] with bleached hair, Dickon manages to penetrate D'Eyncourt on Christmas, but is betrayed by an undyed lock of hair. Pursued, he hides on the chapel's beams and eventually escapes from the castle, surviving a [[crossbow]] shot.\n\nWith Dickon's information, the outlaws finally attack D'Eyncourt Castle during winter. Alan leads Dickon and a group of outlaws to infiltrate and capture the castle [[keep]]. Taking up positions on its [[battlement]]s, they pick off D'Eyncourt's defenders with their arrows while Robin launches the main assault on the outer walls. His combined force of outlaws and serfs eventually breaks through and razes the castle. Dickon kills his former bailiff, while [[Little John]] kills Sir Rolf.\n\nHeartened by their success, the outlaws attempt to march on Nottingham itself. However, the [[Earl of Wessex]] traps them in a [[pincer movement]] between Nottingham and [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]] and defeats them all. When his ally the Archbishop wonders aloud why the rebels die so willingly on the swords of his soldiers the Earl replies grimly: \"because they know that they are going to win - but not in my time\".\n\nAlan, [[Friar Tuck]] and [[Will Scarlet]] are among those killed. Dickon, Robin and Little John survive the battle and flee north with other survivors to [[Yorkshire]], undergoing much hardship on their journey. Dickon almost drowns in a [[bog]]. Wounded, Robin takes refuge in [[Kirklees, Kirklees|Kirklees]], whose prioress [[Bloodletting|bleeds]] him to death to claim a reward from the Earl. Alerted by an arrow shot by Robin from his deathbed, the outlaws reclaim his body and burn down the priory in revenge.\n\nAfter burying Robin, the outlaw band breaks up. Dickon and Little John are the only ones who remain dedicated to Robin's cause. They depart for the [[High Peak (England)|High Peak]] in Derbyshire, determined to continue Robin's work and fulfill his visionary ideal.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Fictional characters===\nIn order of appearance:\n* '''Dickon''': The protagonist.

Appears briefly during the Nottingham riot.\n* '''[[Kirklees, Kirklees|The Prioress of Kirklees Priory]]''': Appears in the last chapter as Robin's murderer. Depicted as a pale, sinister nun.\n\n==Setting==\n''Bows Against the Barons'' takes place largely in the [[English Midlands]], primarily in [[Nottinghamshire]]. In the last two chapters, it shifts north through the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]] into [[Yorkshire]]. As a Robin Hood novel, ''Bows Against the Barons'' features many places associated with the legend: [[Sherwood Forest]], [[Nottingham]], [[Kirklees, Kirklees|Kirklees]], [[Hathersage]]. [[Barnsdale]] is mentioned several times as an alternative refuge and destination for Sherwood's outlaws. The novel also alludes briefly to [[Edwinstowe]].\n\nThe novel takes place during the period of the [[Crusades]], although it does not specify which one. It mentions that Sir Rolf has campaigned in the [[Holy Land]] and visited the \"rotting courts of Eastern Europe\",<ref name=\"Chapter 10\">Chapter 10.</ref> an allusion to the [[Byzantine Empire]] in its decline. Sir Rolf's tyranny is attributed in part to \"[[Derogatory use of \"Byzantine\"|new notions of cruelty and luxury]]\" picked up in the latter place.<ref name=\"Chapter 10\"/> The novel also alludes to the [[Norman Conquest]] as a historical background, depicting Nottingham as a town divided between [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] and [[Normans|Norman]] [[borough]]s, and comparing the battle between Robin and Wessex to the [[Battle of Hastings]].\n\nIn his 1948 foreword and 1966 postscript, Trease compares his novel's events to the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381]], and his version of Robin Hood to medieval rebels such as [[Wat Tyler]], [[Kett's Rebellion|Robert Kett]] and [[Jack Cade]].<ref name=\"Trease, Foreword, 7\">Trease, Foreword, 7.</ref><ref name=\"Trease, Postscript, 151\">Trease, Postscript, 151.</ref>\n\n==Major themes==\n[[File:Bows Against the Barons (Boland).jpg|thumb|right|Foreground from the first-edition illustration of the Nottingham riot.]] ''Bows Against the Barons'' is notable for its leftwing [[Revisionism (fictional)|revision]] of the Robin Hood legend. In contrast to earlier depictions of the outlaw as a nobleman and loyal subject of the king, it portrays Robin as a [[Populism|populist]] figure of the [[Far left|radical left]].<ref name=\"Knight 178-180\">Knight 178\u2013180.</ref><ref>Watson 714 on \"Geoffrey Trease\": \"Politically, he stood well to the left, and the Robin Hood and his comrades of Trease's first novel, ''Bows Against the Barons'' (1934), would have been more at home in Moscow than in Hollywood.\"</ref> The novel depicts Robin's outlaws as guerilla rebels who aid workers in a medieval [[class struggle]] against their masters,<ref name=\"Knight 178-180\"/> and it employs much revolutionary rhetoric, bearing chapter titles such as \"Comrades of the Forest\" and \"The People Speak\".<ref name=\"Knight 178\">Knight 178.</ref> The Robin Hood scholar [[Stephen Thomas Knight]] describes the novel as being \"rich with the leftist enthusiasm of the mid 1930s\",<ref name=\"Knight 178\"/> comparing the Nottingham riot scene to [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''.<ref name=\"Knight 178\"/>\n\nThe first edition of ''Bows Against the Barons'' supplemented the novel's leftist rhetoric with illustrations of a similar nature. For example, one of these illustrations depicts the Nottingham riot as a crowd scene filled with [[Hammer and sickle|hammer-and-sickle]] imagery.<ref name=\"Knight 178\"/> (See image to the right.)\n\n''Bows Against the Barons'' is also a [[Coming of age|coming-of-age]] story that depicts an adolescent protagonist's attempts to overcome difficulties and understand his place in the world.<ref name=\"Barnhouse\">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4063/is_200301/ai_n9183036 Barnhouse] 3.</ref>\n\n==Literary context==\n\n===Background===\nTrease began composing ''Bows Against the Barons'' in 1933.<ref>Trease, \"Fifty years on\", 150.</ref> In his 1948 foreword and 1966 postscript to the novel, he explained his motivation for doing so.<ref name=\"Trease, Foreword, 7\"/><ref name=\"Trease, Postscript, 151\"/> Since childhood, he had enjoyed reading stories about Robin Hood but also felt doubtful about some details in these stories \u2013 for example, the portrayal of outlaw life with its hardships as \"jolly\",<ref name=\"Trease, Foreword, 7\"/><ref name=\"Trease, Postscript, 151\"/> and Robin's subservience to the king. Trease thus wanted to \"create a new picture of Sherwood Forest which should be truer to life\".<ref name=\"Trease, Foreword, 7\"/><ref name=\"Trease, Postscript, 151\"/>\n\nIn a 1996 essay, Trease provided a more detailed context for his novel's composition:\n \n{{quote|As a child, I had been a [[G. A. Henty|Henty]] addict... [and] had absorbed the Henty values \u2013 the glories of war, the superiority of the [[British Empire]] and a white skin, the inferiority of the female... You sided with the [[Cavaliers]] against the [[Roundheads]], the French aristocrats against the howling mob. The working class were tolerated only if faithful retainers. By the end of my schooldays I was abandoning such values.... [I]n 1933 I was a rather naive Left-wing member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], newly married and struggling to survive as a freelance writer.... [A]fter a rejected novel and other disappointments the desperate idea came to me, though even then it was largely prompted by my political sympathies. Why should children be educated \u2013 indeed indoctrinated \u2013 with Right-wing views and then later have to be laboriously converted, one by one, to the Left-wing gospel? Could we not catch them young?<ref>Trease, \"Sixty years on\", 132\u2013133.</ref>}}\n\nTo realise his idea, Trease approached a publisher associated with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] and made his proposal for a leftist Robin Hood novel.<ref name=\"Trease, Sixty Years on, 133\">Trease, \"Sixty Years on\", 133.</ref> It was accepted. ''Bows Against the Barons'' was written \"at white-hot speed\"<ref name=\"Trease, Sixty Years on, 133\"/> and published in the following year.\n\nIn later years, Trease was critical about his own novel. He found fault with its historical errors and lack of research, both of which he attributed to youthful over-confidence,<ref name=\"Trease, Fifty years on, 151\"/> and made efforts to \"remove the worst blemishes\" in later editions.<ref name=\"Trease, Fifty years on, 152\">Trease, \"Fifty years on\", 152.</ref> He also criticised the novel for being \"propagandist\"<ref name=\"Trease, Fifty years on, 151\"/> and toned down its leftist rhetoric in later editions \u2013 for example, removing the words \"[[working class|workers]]\" and \"[[comrade]]\" from much of the text.<ref name=\"Knight 180\"/> However, Trease also acknowledged its \"vitality\"<ref name=\"Trease, Fifty years on, 152\"/> as a \"young man's book\".<ref>Trease, Postscript, 152.</ref>\n\n===Reception===\nInitially, the novel met a largely indifferent response in Britain and the United States. As the author later recalled, it was \"neither denounced nor derided but largely ignored\".<ref name=\"Trease, Sixty Years on, 133\"/> However, it was an immediate success in the [[Soviet Union]], which resulted in a five-month visit there by the author and his wife to collect [[royalties]] in 1935.<ref name=\"Trease, Sixty Years on, 133\"/><ref>[http://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/history.html#trease British Children's Historical Novels: Geoffrey Trease.]</ref> It was at this time that he contributed to a journal called 'International Literature: Organ of the International Union of Revolutionary Writers' Number 7 (1935) with an article 'Revolutionary Literature for the Young' in which he lays out some principles of what this should be and suggests that there should be a new kind of hero in children's books.\n\nIn ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' (1984), [[Humphrey Carpenter]] and Mari Prichard criticised ''Bows Against the Barons'' for its \"political preaching\",<ref name=\"Carpenter and Prichard 541\">Carpenter and Prichard 541.</ref> especially for making \"Robin [speak] like a member of the British Communist Party during the 1930s\".<ref name=\"Carpenter and Prichard 541\"/> However, they also praised the novel as \"a well-crafted adventure story, showing the narrative skill which is characteristic of all Trease's fiction\".<ref name=\"Carpenter and Prichard 541\"/>\n\n===Significance===\nAs Trease's first novel, ''Bows Against the Barons'' marks his debut in children's historical fiction. He would continue contributing to this genre until 1997.<ref>See the main [[Geoffrey Trease]] article for a list of his books.</ref>\n\n''Bows Against the Barons'' is notable for its radical reworking of conventions for children's historical fiction in Britain. Its anti-authoritarian stance challenged the conservative values that had dominated the genre since the 19th century,<ref>Watson 7 on \"adventure fiction\": \"G.A. Henty's numerous historical adventure stories[']... choice of setting, character and action express[es] the ideals of contemporary British imperialism. [W.E. Johns' ''Biggles'' series is characterized by] anachronistic attitudes to race, gender, class and patriotism... As society's attitudes to conflict and morality shifted, the historical adventure story of the 19th century changed. The change began with Geoffrey Trease's ''Bows Against the Barons'' (1934), a radical retelling of the Robin Hood stories.\"</ref><ref>Hollindale 205: \"The last fifty years have seen a sea-change in historical fiction for children.... The first change came in England in the 1930s, most notably in Geoffrey Trease's groundbreaking ''Bows Against the Barons''. Trease's novel, a left-wing representation of the Robin Hood story, signaled a dissatisfaction with romantic and patriotic stereotypes in historical fiction, and a belief that historical stories could be more politically sophisticated, more carefully researched, and more skeptical of self-gratifying national myths than stories of this kind had previously been.\"</ref> especially the [[imperialist]] works of [[G. A. Henty]].<ref>Watson 7.</ref> Its modern prose style, [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] characterisation, and [[Realism (arts)|realist]] attention to the harshness of medieval life all mark significant departures from the [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] focus and [[Romanticism|romantic]] glamour that had dominated the genre since the 19th century.<ref>Watson 335 on \"historical fiction\": \"In Britain in the middle of the 20th century, the innovations of Geoffrey Trease introduced a fresh modern style and a democratic point of view to a genre that had become fossilized.... As early as 1934, when he wrote ''Bows Against the Barons''..., he was determined... to show not the glamour of its hero, but the brutal conditions in which the peasants lived. This represented a marked change in the outlook of children's historical fiction, which in the 19th century had worked on the assumption that a middle-class readership would be primarily interested in the lives of the aristocracy.\"</ref><ref>Fisher 491: \"[The] early books [of juvenile historical fiction] were in the main adventures or historical romances, rather than attempts to create a living past. In 1934 Geoffrey Trease wrote ''Bows Against the Barons'' and changed the nature of the genre. He painted a picture of a man fighting injustice and oppression, not the swashbuckling Robin Hood of legend but a revolutionary character, a real living person who just happened to be from the past, full of colour and vigour.\"</ref> These changes anticipate the mid-20th-century renewal of children's historical fiction by writers such as [[Rosemary Sutcliff]], [[Henry Treece]], [[Cynthia Harnett]] and Trease himself.<ref>Watson 7, 335. He credits them with continuing Trease's \"liberalisation of the historical adventure novel\" (7) and inaugurating the \"golden age\" of children's historical fiction (335).</ref>\n\nIn a 1995 ''[[Socialist Review]]'' article on children's fiction, [[Alan Gibbons]] cites ''Bows Against the Barons'' as a seminal work of socialist literature for children, praising it as an \"inspirational read\" and comparing its conclusion to [[Howard Fast]]'s ''[[Spartacus (Fast novel)|Spartacus]]''.<ref>[http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/sr190/gibbons.htm \"Once upon a time.\"]</ref>\n\nA 2003 ''[[The Assembly on Literature for Adolescents|ALAN Review]]'' article credits ''Bows Against the Barons'' with founding the genre of the [[young adult fiction|young adult]] Robin Hood novel.<ref name=\"Barnhouse\"/> Subsequent contributions to this genre have included [[Monica Furlong]]'s ''Robin's Country'', [[Theresa Tomlinson]]'s ''Forestwife'' trilogy, [[Nancy Springer]]'s ''Rowan Hood'' series, [[Robin McKinley]]'s ''The Outlaws of Sherwood'' and Michael Cadnum's ''Forbidden Forest''.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4063/is_200301/ai_n9183036 Barnhouse] 4\u20138.</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n* 1934, UK, Martin Lawrence, [http://worldcat.org/oclc/6171653 OCLC 6171653], Hardcover.

The feeder runs through Whaley Bridge, and with the Combs feed enters the canal system in a pool close to the transhipment shed at the Whaley Bridge canal basin.\n\nThe reservoir is fed from the Todd Brook, a stream which has a catchment area of around {{convert|1700|ha}} including the moorland on [[Shining Tor]] and farmland around [[Kettleshulme]] village. Water enters the reservoir on its north bank via a small waterfall. The first several inches of water do not flow into the reservoir but flow down the reservoir's run-off into the [[River Goyt]]. The reservoir often receives little or no inflow during periods when rainfall does not allow the level to exceed the barrier, and this often affects  the reservoir's water level, particularly in the summer months.\n\nThe reservoir's dam is built from earth with a [[puddle clay]] core. The embankment is straight in plan and approximately 310m long. The average crest level is 187.3mAOD. In August 2019, concrete panels on its spillway were dislodged after heavy rain, triggering the evacuation of parts of Whaley Bridge and the surrounding area due to the possibility of the dam collapsing.\n\n==Dam works==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nGrowth of traffic on the Peak Forest Canal meant that that water supply from Combs Reservoir proved insufficient, despite the trustees of the [[Macclesfield Canal]] allowing the transfer of water from the summit level of their [[Sutton Lane Ends|Sutton]] Reservoir. The General Assembly of the Peak Forest Canal company approved the adoption of the site of Toddbrook Reservoir in June 1834 on the advice of Samuel Taylor, a land surveyor (a further reservoir on the Hockham Brook above [[Chapel Milton]] was never completed). Negotiations for the sale of the land began in June 1834 but were not concluded until 1839. Work did not go smoothly: from the start, concerns were expressed over the geology of the site and the known existence of coal workings below the valley, and various sites were considered for the dam. John Wood drew up the first plans, though these were amended on the advice of various consultant engineers, including Robert Matthews (engineer of the [[Rochdale Canal]]) and Nicholas Brown, who had experience of building reservoirs.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyes|2012|p=75\u201376}}</ref> Contracts for the reservoir construction were awarded to William Collinge and Richard and William Walker in August 1836. Geological problems continued to dog the project, and the site of the dam was altered on the advice of [[William Mackenzie (contractor)|William Mackenzie]] in 1837. As a stopgap, waters from the Todd Brook were diverted around the reservoir site and into the canal, and this solution proved so effective that consideration was even given to abandoning the reservoir project. Ultimately, however, construction continued using new plans supervised by Mackenzie and the reservoir's completion was reported in the canal committee's annual report of June 1841.

He had an excellent reputation as a divisional-level tactician. [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], described Freyberg as his \"salamander\" due to his love of fire and wanting to be always in the middle of the action.<ref>Stevens (1962), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Bard-c6-19.html#n121 p. 121.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023043604/http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Bard-c6-19.html#n121 |date=23 October 2008 }} Ancient superstition had it that the lizard-like salamander could live in fire.</ref> An exploding German shell wounded Freyberg at the [[Battle of Mersa Matruh]] in June 1942 but he soon returned to the battlefield.{{r|life1942081728}} Freyberg disagreed strongly with his superior, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]], the Eighth Army commander and insisted that as a commander of a national contingent he had the right to refuse orders if those orders ran counter to the New Zealand national interest. Freyberg enjoyed a good relationship with General [[Bernard Montgomery]], the Eighth Army commander from August 1942, who thought highly of the experienced New Zealand commander.\n\nIn the climactic [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] (October\u2013November 1942) the 2nd New Zealand Division played a vital part in the breakthrough by the Eighth Army; for his leadership, Freyberg was immediately promoted to [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=35794 |date=20 November 1942 |page=3|supp=y}}</ref> During the pursuit of the [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] to Tunisia, where they surrendered in May 1943, he led the New Zealanders on a series of well-executed left hooks to outflank Axis defence lines.

After six weeks in hospital he returned to command the New Zealand Division in its final operations, the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy]], which involved a series of river crossings and an advance of {{convert|250|mi|km|abbr=on}} in three weeks. By the time of the German surrender, the New Zealanders had reached Trieste, having liberated both [[Padua]] and [[Venice]], where there was a brief standoff with Yugoslav partisans.

The two occasions that Freyberg commanded at Corps level\u2014at Crete and [[Monte Cassino]]\u2014were less successful. Throughout the war he showed a disdain for danger. He showed notable concern for the welfare of his soldiers, taking a common-sense attitude to discipline and ensuring the establishment of social facilities for his men. He had become a very popular commander with the New Zealand soldiers by the time he left his command in 1945.\n[[File:Major General Sir Bernard Cyril Freyberg VC (16160704063).jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Freyberg, executed by [[Peter McIntyre (artist)|Peter McIntyre]], an official war artist of the 2NZEF]]\nFreyberg is closely associated with the controversial decision to bomb the ancient monastery at Monte Cassino in February 1944. Freyberg, commanding the troops which fought what later became known as the [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Second and Third Battles of Monte Cassino]], became convinced the abbey, founded in 529 AD, was being used as a military stronghold. The analysis of one of Freyberg's divisional commanders, Major-General [[Francis Tuker]] of the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]], concluded in a memo to Freyberg that, regardless of whether the monastery was occupied by the Germans, it should be demolished to prevent its occupation. He pointed out that with {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}}-high walls made of masonry at least {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick, it was impossible for engineers to break in and that bombing with \"blockbuster\" bombs would be the only solution since {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs would be \"next to useless\".<ref>Majdalany, pp. 114\u2013115.</ref> [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Sir [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]], commander of the [[15th Army Group]] (later the [[Allied Armies in Italy]]), agreed to the bombing (which did not employ blockbuster bombs). After the monastery's destruction, the ruins were occupied by [[Wehrmacht|German forces]], which held the position until 18 May. Following the war, the abbot of the monastery and other monks said that German troops had not occupied the inside of the abbey and it was not being used for military purposes.<ref>Hapgood, D, & Richardson, D, 1987.

He had become a very popular commander with the New Zealand soldiers by the time he left his command in 1945.\n[[File:Major General Sir Bernard Cyril Freyberg VC (16160704063).jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Freyberg, executed by [[Peter McIntyre (artist)|Peter McIntyre]], an official war artist of the 2NZEF]]\nFreyberg is closely associated with the controversial decision to bomb the ancient monastery at Monte Cassino in February 1944. Freyberg, commanding the troops which fought what later became known as the [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Second and Third Battles of Monte Cassino]], became convinced the abbey, founded in 529 AD, was being used as a military stronghold. The analysis of one of Freyberg's divisional commanders, Major-General [[Francis Tuker]] of the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]], concluded in a memo to Freyberg that, regardless of whether the monastery was occupied by the Germans, it should be demolished to prevent its occupation. He pointed out that with {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}}-high walls made of masonry at least {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick, it was impossible for engineers to break in and that bombing with \"blockbuster\" bombs would be the only solution since {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs would be \"next to useless\".<ref>Majdalany, pp. 114\u2013115.</ref> [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Sir [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]], commander of the [[15th Army Group]] (later the [[Allied Armies in Italy]]), agreed to the bombing (which did not employ blockbuster bombs). After the monastery's destruction, the ruins were occupied by [[Wehrmacht|German forces]], which held the position until 18 May. Following the war, the abbot of the monastery and other monks said that German troops had not occupied the inside of the abbey and it was not being used for military purposes.<ref>Hapgood, D, & Richardson, D, 1987.

It was created by the 1926 union of the German-inhabited (formerly Sz\u00e1szr\u00e9gen) and the Hungarian-inhabited (formerly Magyarr\u00e9gen) city, and later joined with the two smaller communities of Apalina (Hungarian: ''Abaf\u00e1ja''; German: ''Bendorf'') and Iernu\u021beni (Hungarian: ''Radn\u00f3tf\u00e1ja''; German: ''Etschdorf''), added in 1956. Formally, the latter two are separate villages administered by the city.\n\n==History==\n[[File:ReghinChurch.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Transylvanian Saxons' Lutheran Church]]\nReghin was first mentioned in 1228 in a charter of [[List of Hungarian rulers|Hungarian King]] [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] as ''Regun'' \u2013 however, evidence of its strategic location and defence system suggests that the town might have been considerably older, possibly founded by [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Ladislaus I]].\n\nDespite the devastations of the city during the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol invasion]] (1241) and during the [[Tatar invasions|Tatar]] and [[Cumans|Cuman]] incursions (1285), the town developed rapidly: already in the second half of the 13th century the city was the residence and power centre of the families Tomaj and Kacsik, to whom the nearby lands were awarded by the Hungarian Crown. Reghin became a minor ecclesiastical centre in 1330, with the building of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church ([[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] at the time, it now serves the [[Protestant]] community) in the German part of the city; it is still the largest church in the area, and hosts the oldest [[Medieval Latin]] inscription of any church in Transylvania. The Hungarian part of the city has an even older church, initially built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style.\n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century the settlement gained [[Town privileges|city rights]], and, from 1427, the right to hold fairs. In the 16th and 17th century Reghin was devastated by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops on several occasions. It burned to the ground in 1848. In 1910, the population of the city included 7,310 inhabitants, of which 2,994 were [[Ethnic Germans|Germans]] ([[Transylvanian Saxons]]), 2,947 [[Magyars|Hungarians]], and 1,311 [[Romanians]]. [http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=Maros-Torda]\n\nIn 1920 Reghin was assigned to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]], together with the rest of Transylvania. In 1940, as a consequence of the [[Second Vienna Award]], the city became part of Hungary, together with the North of Transylvania. Almost 30% of the inhabitants were Jews at that time. In May 1944, the Jews were gathered in the [[Reghin ghetto]] and on 4 June 1944 were deported to Auschwitz. In 1945, the city again became part of Romania.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Reghin lost some of its former Transylvanian Saxon character \u2013 as many Germans left for [[Western Germany]] during the latter stages of [[Communist Romania]] \u2013 and ethnic [[Romanians]] were settled in their place.  The data of the 1992 census showed a population of 24,601 Romanians, 12,471 Hungarian, 1,790 [[Romani people|Romani]], and 346 Germans. In 1994 Reghin was declared a [[Municipiu|city]].\n\n==Jewish history of Reghin==\n\n[[Jews]] began to settle in Reghin at the close of the 18th century, an organized community was established only during the middle of the 19th century, probably in 1849. The majority of the Jews came from [[Bukovina]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. As a result of the battles during the Revolution of 1848 against Austria and the riots in Transylvania, Reghin and its Jewish population suffered severely. The first Jewish settlers, who arrived mainly from Bukovina and Galicia, were Orthodox, and the community remained Orthodox throughout its existence. [[\u1e24asidic]] influence was also felt. Besides the synagogue, there were two prayerhouses (kloyz) where the [[\u1e24asidim]] used to pray and had their own rabbis. A prominent figure in the community during its early years was the Orthodox [[rabbi]] Hillel Pollak (who was spiritually close to the extreme Orthodox rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/reghin|title=Reghin|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>\n\nA Jewish elementary school was founded in 1874. (Later it ceased its activities but was reestablished in 1910 and functioned until 1940.) The language of instruction in the school was Hungarian until 1918 after which it was Romanian. In 1885 the community became the administrative center for all the Jews of the district. The community numbered 282 in 1866, about 40 families in 1889, and 394 persons (about 7% of the total population) in 1891. Jews engaged in commerce, industry, and [[crafts]]. Their trade and industry were mainly connected with timber and some of them owned sawmills; there were also unskilled Jewish workers employed in the timber industry. The institutions of the community assisted the poor. Some of the \u1e24adarim established by the community translated the Pentateuch into German instead of [[Yiddish]] in order to facilitate study of this language by the children. From 1919 there was considerable Zionist activity in Reghin, and many members of the youth organizations emigrated to Ere\u1e93 Israel. The community numbered 1,587 (about 16% of the total population) in 1930, and 1,653 (about 10% of the total) in 1941.\n\nBetween the two world wars the Jews suffered from the nationalist and [[antisemitic]] activities of members of the [[Iron Guard]], and from the official antisemitic policies of most of the Romanian governments. The change of rule in 1940 (from Romanian to Hungarian) did not bring with it any improvement, as was hoped by the Jews, who remembered their legal emancipation in 1867 by the Austro-Hungarian authorities.\n\n===Holocaust and aftermath===\nIn the summer of 1944 the local Jews were concentrated into [[Reghin ghetto|a ghetto]] set up in a brick factory. Jews from the surrounding area were also brought there. From this [[ghetto]] about 6,000 Jews were deported to [[Auschwitz]] by the Hungarian authorities, at the request of the Nazi occupiers.\n\nAfter World War II, in 1947 a community numbering about 820 was formed mostly by survivors of the [[death camps]] and other Jews who had arrived in Reghin from places in different parts of Romania. The community gradually declined as a result of immigration to [[Israel]] and elsewhere. In 1971 there were still some 20 to 25 families living in Reghin and even fewer in the early 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Reghin|title=YIVO - Reghin|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nReghin possesses some of the architectural elements that are unique in [[Transylvania]]. The stylistic details and the wrought iron balconies in the centre of the town are examples that prove the artistry of the local [[Artisan|craftsmen]]. One passes everyday by the apparently modest, yet defining signs of an ancient civilization. They personalize almost each and every building from the center of the town, making the visitor feel the fragrance of times gone by.<ref name=\"Costea\">{{cite book|last=Costea|first=Ioan I. |title=Reghin: Destin \u0219i istorie}}</ref>\n\nThe Evangelical church also known as the \"Saxon church\" has a tower that measures more than 47m high. The four smaller towers are proofs of the town's \"Right to the sword\". The construction of the church began at the end of the 13th century. Over the years, the architecture was modified because the church underwent many dramatic events. It was set on fire in 1400, 1630 and 1778. The documents reveal the use of several styles of early and transition [[gothic style]]. The church was consolidated in 1501 and since 1551, when the Transylvanian Saxons adopted the [[Lutheran Reformation]], on the main wall are written the words: \"Redemption cometh not from war, it is for peace that we all pray.\". Inside the church there is an organ with 20 registers that dates from 1784.<ref name=\"Costea\"/>\n\nThe Huszar Castle, former Bornemisza, situated in Apalina dates from the 13th\u201314th centuries and was restored in the 19th century. In the old mansion of the castle lived between 1584 and 1592 Gyulai P\u00e1l of Apalina (1559\u20131592). He was a royal diplomat, historian, chronicler, doctor and classical poet. The castle was built in the [[Renaissance]] style with [[baroque]] elements. In 1953 the castle was taken over and used by different educational institutions for disabled persons. It has recently been returned to its owners according to the new laws of property.<ref name=\"Costea\"/>\n\n==Culture==\nThe \"Petru Maior\" municipal library has more than 130,000 books, among which one dating from the 16th century. Another important book is [[Petru Maior]]'s \"History of the Romanians' Origins in Dacia\".<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\">{{cite book|last=Ploie\u0219teanu|first=Grigore |last2=\u0218ara |first2=Marin|title=Reghinul cultural|year=2006|location=Reghin}}</ref>\n\nThe Ethnographic Museum has a rich patrimony, grouped in 49 collections of ethnography, folk art, artistry, records. The edifice is a monument of architecture built in 1892. The items exhibited concern trades, national costumes, and tradition specific to the upper course of the [[Mure\u0219 River]], Gurghiu valley and part of the [[Transylvanian Plain]].<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\nThe \"Eugen Nicoara\" community centre was built between 1938 and 1939 when Dr. [[Eugen Nicoara]] was the president of the Reghin department of Astra Foundation. Representations of theatre, folk music, dances, chamber music, etc. are held on the stage of this building.<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\nThe building in which the \"Alexandru Ceusianu\" secondary school functions was constructed in 1870 and housed the local law court. Lately in the post-war period, there was the Hungarian pedagogical school. Close by, was the house of the writer and magistrate [[Alexandru Ceusianu]].<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\n==Economy==\nThe industry of Reghin is closely related to the traditions of the medieval trades and of the modern cooperative associations. Starting with the resources in the close vicinity, rich in wood and farm produces, the goods of the private producers from Reghin are in the market all over Romania and abroad. The wood processing industry is represented by companies such as Larix, Gralemn, Remex, Bucin-Mob, Prolemn, and Amis. Reghin is well known for the industry of the musical instruments, especially of violins.

It was created by the 1926 union of the German-inhabited (formerly Sz\u00e1szr\u00e9gen) and the Hungarian-inhabited (formerly Magyarr\u00e9gen) city, and later joined with the two smaller communities of Apalina (Hungarian: ''Abaf\u00e1ja''; German: ''Bendorf'') and Iernu\u021beni (Hungarian: ''Radn\u00f3tf\u00e1ja''; German: ''Etschdorf''), added in 1956. Formally, the latter two are separate villages administered by the city.\n\n==History==\n[[File:ReghinChurch.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Transylvanian Saxons' Lutheran Church]]\nReghin was first mentioned in 1228 in a charter of [[List of Hungarian rulers|Hungarian King]] [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] as ''Regun'' \u2013 however, evidence of its strategic location and defence system suggests that the town might have been considerably older, possibly founded by [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Ladislaus I]].\n\nDespite the devastations of the city during the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol invasion]] (1241) and during the [[Tatar invasions|Tatar]] and [[Cumans|Cuman]] incursions (1285), the town developed rapidly: already in the second half of the 13th century the city was the residence and power centre of the families Tomaj and Kacsik, to whom the nearby lands were awarded by the Hungarian Crown. Reghin became a minor ecclesiastical centre in 1330, with the building of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church ([[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] at the time, it now serves the [[Protestant]] community) in the German part of the city; it is still the largest church in the area, and hosts the oldest [[Medieval Latin]] inscription of any church in Transylvania. The Hungarian part of the city has an even older church, initially built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style.\n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century the settlement gained [[Town privileges|city rights]], and, from 1427, the right to hold fairs. In the 16th and 17th century Reghin was devastated by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops on several occasions. It burned to the ground in 1848. In 1910, the population of the city included 7,310 inhabitants, of which 2,994 were [[Ethnic Germans|Germans]] ([[Transylvanian Saxons]]), 2,947 [[Magyars|Hungarians]], and 1,311 [[Romanians]]. [http://www.talmamedia.com/php/district/district.php?county=Maros-Torda]\n\nIn 1920 Reghin was assigned to Romania by the [[Treaty of Trianon]], together with the rest of Transylvania. In 1940, as a consequence of the [[Second Vienna Award]], the city became part of Hungary, together with the North of Transylvania. Almost 30% of the inhabitants were Jews at that time. In May 1944, the Jews were gathered in the [[Reghin ghetto]] and on 4 June 1944 were deported to Auschwitz. In 1945, the city again became part of Romania.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Reghin lost some of its former Transylvanian Saxon character \u2013 as many Germans left for [[Western Germany]] during the latter stages of [[Communist Romania]] \u2013 and ethnic [[Romanians]] were settled in their place.  The data of the 1992 census showed a population of 24,601 Romanians, 12,471 Hungarian, 1,790 [[Romani people|Romani]], and 346 Germans. In 1994 Reghin was declared a [[Municipiu|city]].\n\n==Jewish history of Reghin==\n\n[[Jews]] began to settle in Reghin at the close of the 18th century, an organized community was established only during the middle of the 19th century, probably in 1849. The majority of the Jews came from [[Bukovina]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. As a result of the battles during the Revolution of 1848 against Austria and the riots in Transylvania, Reghin and its Jewish population suffered severely. The first Jewish settlers, who arrived mainly from Bukovina and Galicia, were Orthodox, and the community remained Orthodox throughout its existence. [[\u1e24asidic]] influence was also felt. Besides the synagogue, there were two prayerhouses (kloyz) where the [[\u1e24asidim]] used to pray and had their own rabbis. A prominent figure in the community during its early years was the Orthodox [[rabbi]] Hillel Pollak (who was spiritually close to the extreme Orthodox rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/reghin|title=Reghin|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>\n\nA Jewish elementary school was founded in 1874. (Later it ceased its activities but was reestablished in 1910 and functioned until 1940.) The language of instruction in the school was Hungarian until 1918 after which it was Romanian. In 1885 the community became the administrative center for all the Jews of the district. The community numbered 282 in 1866, about 40 families in 1889, and 394 persons (about 7% of the total population) in 1891. Jews engaged in commerce, industry, and [[crafts]]. Their trade and industry were mainly connected with timber and some of them owned sawmills; there were also unskilled Jewish workers employed in the timber industry. The institutions of the community assisted the poor. Some of the \u1e24adarim established by the community translated the Pentateuch into German instead of [[Yiddish]] in order to facilitate study of this language by the children. From 1919 there was considerable Zionist activity in Reghin, and many members of the youth organizations emigrated to Ere\u1e93 Israel. The community numbered 1,587 (about 16% of the total population) in 1930, and 1,653 (about 10% of the total) in 1941.\n\nBetween the two world wars the Jews suffered from the nationalist and [[antisemitic]] activities of members of the [[Iron Guard]], and from the official antisemitic policies of most of the Romanian governments. The change of rule in 1940 (from Romanian to Hungarian) did not bring with it any improvement, as was hoped by the Jews, who remembered their legal emancipation in 1867 by the Austro-Hungarian authorities.\n\n===Holocaust and aftermath===\nIn the summer of 1944 the local Jews were concentrated into [[Reghin ghetto|a ghetto]] set up in a brick factory. Jews from the surrounding area were also brought there. From this [[ghetto]] about 6,000 Jews were deported to [[Auschwitz]] by the Hungarian authorities, at the request of the Nazi occupiers.\n\nAfter World War II, in 1947 a community numbering about 820 was formed mostly by survivors of the [[death camps]] and other Jews who had arrived in Reghin from places in different parts of Romania. The community gradually declined as a result of immigration to [[Israel]] and elsewhere. In 1971 there were still some 20 to 25 families living in Reghin and even fewer in the early 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Reghin|title=YIVO - Reghin|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nReghin possesses some of the architectural elements that are unique in [[Transylvania]]. The stylistic details and the wrought iron balconies in the centre of the town are examples that prove the artistry of the local [[Artisan|craftsmen]]. One passes everyday by the apparently modest, yet defining signs of an ancient civilization. They personalize almost each and every building from the center of the town, making the visitor feel the fragrance of times gone by.<ref name=\"Costea\">{{cite book|last=Costea|first=Ioan I. |title=Reghin: Destin \u0219i istorie}}</ref>\n\nThe Evangelical church also known as the \"Saxon church\" has a tower that measures more than 47m high. The four smaller towers are proofs of the town's \"Right to the sword\". The construction of the church began at the end of the 13th century. Over the years, the architecture was modified because the church underwent many dramatic events. It was set on fire in 1400, 1630 and 1778. The documents reveal the use of several styles of early and transition [[gothic style]]. The church was consolidated in 1501 and since 1551, when the Transylvanian Saxons adopted the [[Lutheran Reformation]], on the main wall are written the words: \"Redemption cometh not from war, it is for peace that we all pray.\". Inside the church there is an organ with 20 registers that dates from 1784.<ref name=\"Costea\"/>\n\nThe Huszar Castle, former Bornemisza, situated in Apalina dates from the 13th\u201314th centuries and was restored in the 19th century. In the old mansion of the castle lived between 1584 and 1592 Gyulai P\u00e1l of Apalina (1559\u20131592). He was a royal diplomat, historian, chronicler, doctor and classical poet. The castle was built in the [[Renaissance]] style with [[baroque]] elements. In 1953 the castle was taken over and used by different educational institutions for disabled persons. It has recently been returned to its owners according to the new laws of property.<ref name=\"Costea\"/>\n\n==Culture==\nThe \"Petru Maior\" municipal library has more than 130,000 books, among which one dating from the 16th century. Another important book is [[Petru Maior]]'s \"History of the Romanians' Origins in Dacia\".<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\">{{cite book|last=Ploie\u0219teanu|first=Grigore |last2=\u0218ara |first2=Marin|title=Reghinul cultural|year=2006|location=Reghin}}</ref>\n\nThe Ethnographic Museum has a rich patrimony, grouped in 49 collections of ethnography, folk art, artistry, records. The edifice is a monument of architecture built in 1892. The items exhibited concern trades, national costumes, and tradition specific to the upper course of the [[Mure\u0219 River]], Gurghiu valley and part of the [[Transylvanian Plain]].<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\nThe \"Eugen Nicoara\" community centre was built between 1938 and 1939 when Dr. [[Eugen Nicoara]] was the president of the Reghin department of Astra Foundation. Representations of theatre, folk music, dances, chamber music, etc. are held on the stage of this building.<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\nThe building in which the \"Alexandru Ceusianu\" secondary school functions was constructed in 1870 and housed the local law court. Lately in the post-war period, there was the Hungarian pedagogical school. Close by, was the house of the writer and magistrate [[Alexandru Ceusianu]].<ref name=\"Ploie\u0219teanu 2006\"/>\n\n==Economy==\nThe industry of Reghin is closely related to the traditions of the medieval trades and of the modern cooperative associations. Starting with the resources in the close vicinity, rich in wood and farm produces, the goods of the private producers from Reghin are in the market all over Romania and abroad. The wood processing industry is represented by companies such as Larix, Gralemn, Remex, Bucin-Mob, Prolemn, and Amis. Reghin is well known for the industry of the musical instruments, especially of violins. There are many companies that produces instruments using the famous resonance wood from [[Gurghiu Mountains|Calimani and Gurghiu]] forests. The violins made in Reghin are used abroad. The \"Hora\" Company is the first to manufacture instruments. In time, other companies were set up among which \"Gliga Instrumente Muzicale\". [[Yehudi Menuhin]] used a violin made by \"Gliga\" company.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pop|first=Simion T. |title=Comorile Transilvaniei: REGHIN|year=2008|publisher=ROMGHID|location=Reghin|isbn=978-973-88446-1-2}}</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nReghin is presented by [[FCM Av\u00e2ntul Reghin|Av\u00e2ntul Reghin]] at association football.

{"title_page": "Edward Judson", "text_new": "{{for|the British trade union leader|Edward Judson (trade unionist)}}\n{{Baptist}}\n'''Edward Judson''' (1844\u20131914) was an [[United States|American]] [[Baptist]] clergyman, born in [[Moulmein]], [[Myanmar|British Burma]], a son of the missionary [[Adoniram Judson]] and his second wife, [[Sarah Hall Boardman]]. He graduated from [[Brown University]] in 1863. In 1868, he was appointed [[professor]] of Latin and modern languages at Madison (now [[Colgate University|Colgate]]) University. In 1874\u201375, he  traveled abroad, and after being ordained into the Baptist ministry in the latter year, served as pastor of a church in [[Orange, New Jersey|Orange]], [[New Jersey|N.

In April 1941 the go ahead was given for the construction of an oil pipeline from Avonmouth, where a large number of new protected storage tanks had been constructed, to the Thames (A/T pipeline).  Concern as to the vulnerability of the fuel import facilities, led to the construction in 1942 of a pipeline linking the import facilities in the Stanlow area with those at Avonmouth.<ref>D.J.Payton-Smith: Oil - A Study of War-time Policy and Administration p225 and 226. HMSO SBN 11 630074 4</ref>  This was followed by the construction of a pipeline running from off the A/T pipeline to the Southampton area for the stockpiling of fuel for the possible second front (R/H pipeline). During 1943 an entire ring-main linking the Mersey, the Avonmouth area, the Thames and up to the Humber area, was constructed. This was later extended into East Anglia to supply both the RAF and the United States Army Air Force (USAAF).<ref>Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p49, p51 to 53 and p62 to 65. {{ISBN|9780992855468}}</ref>\n\nLinked to the GPSS were the cross-channel PLUTO pipelines which ran from the Isle of Wight to Cherbourg (code named BAMBI) and from Dungeness to Boulogne (code named DUMBO).

New storage depots were built on this pipeline and a third new import facility was constructed on the Humber.<ref>Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p95 to p101. {{ISBN|9780992855468}}</ref>\n\nThe first commercial usage of the system was immediately after the war to supply a depot on the River Severn from Avonmouth.<ref>A.L.Adams: The Development and Use of the Department of Energy's Oil Pipelines and Storages p7 (Paper 1980).</ref> In the early 1950s some aviation fuel was pumped from Avonmouth to a depot on the Thames to supply Heathrow airport by road tanker from there.  Esso also used the network to pump aviation fuel from the Fawley refinery to the Thames depot to supply Heathrow.  The late 1950s also saw a spur off one of the PLUTO pipelines, originally from the Thames to Dungeness, brought back into operation to pump fuel from the Isle of Grain to the Thames Depot.  From there aviation fuel was carried to Heathrow Airport, no longer by road tanker but via the first commercial pipeline which was constructed by Shell-Mex & BP in 1959.<ref>A.L.Adams: The Development and Use of the Department of Energy's Oil Pipelines and Storages p8 (Paper 1980).</ref>\n\nIn 1967 an agreement was reached with Conoco for leasing five petroleum storage depots for road loading of ground fuels.  These were all supplied from the Immingham refinery which was connected to the GPSS pipeline network.  During the late 1970s and early 1980s two commercial road loading facilities and two additional refineries were also connected to the GPSS.<ref>Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p115 to 117. {{ISBN|9780992855468}}</ref>  There were a substantial number of depots that were not on the pipeline network.  In the 1970s most of these were closed down.  In the 1980s it was decided by the government that large scale strategic storage of petroleum as a civil reserve was no longer required.  The salt cavities and some of the storage depots previously used for civil reserve storage were either closed or leased commercially.<ref>Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p126 to 133 and 141 to 142. {{ISBN|9780992855468}}</ref>\n\nThe management of civil storage depots and the pipeline network initially came under the Board of Trade and then in 1942 under the Ministry of Fuel Power.  This became the Department of Energy in the 1970s.  In 1975 the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) was set up and took over the running of the Department's system.<ref>A.L.Adams: The Development and Use of the Department of Energy's Oil Pipelines and Storages p9 (Paper 1980).</ref> In 1985 the government closed BNOC but kept the GPSS and the [[Oil and Pipelines Agency]] (OPA) was set up by Act of Parliament purely to manage the GPSS.<ref>HMSO: The Oil and Pipelines Act 1985</ref>  Air Ministry storage depots and spur pipelines had been managed by the ministry and later by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) but in 1989 it was decided by the government to merge these sites and pipelines with the rest of the GPSS under the management of OPA.<ref>Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p149 to 150. {{ISBN|9780992855468}}</ref> Although the GPSS remained officially secret until the end of the Cold War, knowledge of it was in fact already in the public domain through the publication of various books an papers such as the Official History, Adams' papers and the series of articles in the Petroleum Times - 'Petroleum at War'.\n\nPrivate-sector usage was encouraged, but limited; the OPA's task was to provide \"maximum development of private sector usage of the GPSS, provided this did not impinge upon its primary purpose of supplying the required fuel for defence purposes and did not require capital investment from public funds.\" As a result, the pipeline was extended and developed to allow connection to: all UK-based oil refineries and major fuel processing depots; as well as all major civilian airports - including [[London Heathrow|Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick|Gatwick]], [[Stansted Airport|Stansted]] and [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] - during the period of the [[Cold War]]. As a result of the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|2000 fuel protests]], Defence Secretary [[Geoff Hoon]] instructed the MoD to plan for extension of the GPSS to beat any future fuel blockade.<ref name=GuardUKOil>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/apr/06/uk.oil</ref>\n\n==Operations==\n\nDuring World War Two to protect the pipeline from damage or look for possible leaks, a team of men and women was employed to patrol the pipeline.  Each person was responsible for a section of pipeline eight to ten miles long.<ref>Pathe News - Trans-Britain Pipeline</ref> This was clearly very manpower intensive and later it was possible to use commercial not RAF helicopters to patrol the pipelines on a fortnightly basis and helicopter landing pads were constructed on the depots.  In the 1950s a means of preventing pipeline corrosion known as [[cathodic protection]] became available.  This applies a voltage to the pipeline such that the natural electrical action which takes place between pipe and soil leading to corrosion is reversed.  Cathodic protection was applied to the pipeline system on a rolling programme which started in 1954 and was completed in 1970.<ref>Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 2017 p121. {{ISBN|9780992855468}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war the locations of the pipelines were marked with identification posts with bright yellow roofs with a thick black line.

Esso also used the network to pump aviation fuel from the Fawley refinery to the Thames depot to supply Heathrow.  The late 1950s also saw a spur off one of the PLUTO pipelines, originally from the Thames to Dungeness, brought back into operation to pump fuel from the Isle of Grain to the Thames Depot.  From there aviation fuel was carried to Heathrow Airport, no longer by road tanker but via the first commercial pipeline which was constructed by Shell-Mex & BP in 1959.<ref>A.L.Adams: The Development and Use of the Department of Energy's Oil Pipelines and Storages p8 (Paper 1980).</ref>\n\nIn 1967 an agreement was reached with Conoco for leasing five petroleum storage depots for road loading of ground fuels.  These were all supplied from the Immingham refinery which was connected to the GPSS pipeline network.  During the late 1970s and early 1980s two commercial road loading facilities and two additional refineries were also connected to the GPSS.<ref>Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p115 to 117. {{ISBN|9780992855468}}</ref>  There were a substantial number of depots that were not on the pipeline network.  In the 1970s most of these were closed down.  In the 1980s it was decided by the government that large scale strategic storage of petroleum as a civil reserve was no longer required.  The salt cavities and some of the storage depots previously used for civil reserve storage were either closed or leased commercially.<ref>Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p126 to 133 and 141 to 142. {{ISBN|9780992855468}}</ref>\n\nThe management of civil storage depots and the pipeline network initially came under the Board of Trade and then in 1942 under the Ministry of Fuel Power.  This became the Department of Energy in the 1970s.  In 1975 the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) was set up and took over the running of the Department's system.<ref>A.L.Adams: The Development and Use of the Department of Energy's Oil Pipelines and Storages p9 (Paper 1980).</ref> In 1985 the government closed BNOC but kept the GPSS and the [[Oil and Pipelines Agency]] (OPA) was set up by Act of Parliament purely to manage the GPSS.<ref>HMSO: The Oil and Pipelines Act 1985</ref>  Air Ministry storage depots and spur pipelines had been managed by the ministry and later by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) but in 1989 it was decided by the government to merge these sites and pipelines with the rest of the GPSS under the management of OPA.<ref>Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 1936 to 2015 published 2017 p149 to 150. {{ISBN|9780992855468}}</ref> Although the GPSS remained officially secret until the end of the Cold War, knowledge of it was in fact already in the public domain through the publication of various books an papers such as the Official History, Adams' papers and the series of articles in the Petroleum Times - 'Petroleum at War'.\n\nPrivate-sector usage was encouraged, but limited; the OPA's task was to provide \"maximum development of private sector usage of the GPSS, provided this did not impinge upon its primary purpose of supplying the required fuel for defence purposes and did not require capital investment from public funds.\" As a result, the pipeline was extended and developed to allow connection to: all UK-based oil refineries and major fuel processing depots; as well as all major civilian airports - including [[London Heathrow|Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick|Gatwick]], [[Stansted Airport|Stansted]] and [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] - during the period of the [[Cold War]]. As a result of the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|2000 fuel protests]], Defence Secretary [[Geoff Hoon]] instructed the MoD to plan for extension of the GPSS to beat any future fuel blockade.<ref name=GuardUKOil>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/apr/06/uk.oil</ref>\n\n==Operations==\n\nDuring World War Two to protect the pipeline from damage or look for possible leaks, a team of men and women was employed to patrol the pipeline.  Each person was responsible for a section of pipeline eight to ten miles long.<ref>Pathe News - Trans-Britain Pipeline</ref> This was clearly very manpower intensive and later it was possible to use commercial not RAF helicopters to patrol the pipelines on a fortnightly basis and helicopter landing pads were constructed on the depots.  In the 1950s a means of preventing pipeline corrosion known as [[cathodic protection]] became available.  This applies a voltage to the pipeline such that the natural electrical action which takes place between pipe and soil leading to corrosion is reversed.  Cathodic protection was applied to the pipeline system on a rolling programme which started in 1954 and was completed in 1970.<ref>Tim Whittle: Fuelling the Wars - PLUTO and the Secret Pipeline Network 2017 p121. {{ISBN|9780992855468}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war the locations of the pipelines were marked with identification posts with bright yellow roofs with a thick black line.

football]] competition of [[SFR Yugoslavia]], since its establishment in 1946. [[Hajduk Split]] won the league title.\n\nA total of 18 teams competed in the league, with the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League|defending champions]] [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] nearly relegated, finishing the season in the 15th place one point clear of the relegation zone. [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] and [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] both finished the season on 50 points, but Hajduk won the championship having the better goal difference. However, there was a controversy in the first round when [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] defeated Dinamo 2\u20131 at [[Stadion Kantrida|Kantrida]]. Dinamo claimed that [[Edmond Tomi\u0107]], who joined Rijeka that season from [[KF Liria|Lirija]], didn't serve a one-match suspension following two yellow cards received while playing for his former club. They appealed and after two months it has been decided to award the match 3\u20130 to Dinamo. After several appeals from both sides, in spring 1979 [[Football Association of Yugoslavia]] ruled in favour of Rijeka. The case was brought to Employment Appeal Tribunal, which four years later ruled Dinamo as champions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ezadar.hr/clanak/neodigrana-utakmica-rijeka-dinamo-novi-slucaja-tomic |title=Neodigrana utakmica Rijeka \u2013 Dinamo, novi Slu\u010daja Tomi\u0107? |last=ts/eZd |first= |date=2 November 2008 |work=ezadar.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=21 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe season began on 12 August 1978 and concluded on 17 June 1979. This was the third and last national title win for Hajduk under the guidance of manager [[Tomislav Ivi\u0107]], who previously led the club to four consecutive [[Yugoslav Cup]] wins in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1976 (not contested in 1975). Striker [[Du\u0161an Savi\u0107]] of [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] was the top goalscorer with 24 goals. This was the second achievement for Savi\u0107, who previously topped the scoring table in the [[1974\u201375 Yugoslav First League|1974\u201375 season]]. [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] entered the [[1979\u201380 European Cup Winners' Cup]], after defeating [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] in the final of [[Yugoslav Cup]] with an aggregate score 2\u20131.\n\n==Teams==\nA total of eighteen teams contested the league, including sixteen sides from the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League|1977\u201378 season]] and two sides promoted from the 1977\u201378 [[Yugoslav Second League]] (YSL) as winners of the two second level divisions East and West. The league was contested in a [[double round robin]] format, with each club playing every other club twice, for a total of 34 rounds. Two points were awarded for wins and one point for draws.\n\n[[NK \u010celik Zenica|\u010celik Zenica]] and [[FK Trep\u010da|Trep\u010da Kosovska Mitrovica]] were relegated from the [[1977\u201378 Yugoslav First League]] after finishing the season in bottom two places of the league table. The two clubs promoted to top level were [[FK Napredak Kru\u0161evac|Napredak Kru\u0161evac]] and [[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|\u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo]].\n\n{{Location map+ |Yugoslavia

The [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]]/[[Universum Film AG|UFA]] joint production stars [[Jack Palance]], [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]] and [[Martine Carol]].\n\nSet in the aftermath of [[World War II]], the film focuses on a half-dozen German [[POW|POW's]] who return to [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|a devastated Berlin]] and find employment as a [[bomb disposal]] squad, tasked with clearing the city of unexploded [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombs. Their fatalistic duties lead them to form a macabre pact; a [[tontine]] into which they donate a part of their individual paychecks into a pool that those still surviving at the end of three months divide the money. Eventually, only two men are left, and they are both in love with the same woman.\n\nRobert Aldrich's direction is noted for its meticulous attention to the techniques of bomb deactivation and disposal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spout.com/films/75456/default.aspx |title=Ten Seconds to Hell (1959) |accessdate=2008-08-18 |work= |publisher=Spout.com |date= }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn post-war [[Berlin]], British [[Major]] Haven (Richard Wattis) recruits members of a returning German [[bomb disposal]] unit, Hans Globke (James Goodwin), Peter Tillig (Dave Willock), Wolfgang Sulke (Wesley Addy), Franz Loeffler (Robert Cornthwaite), Karl Wirtz (Chandler) and Eric Koertner (Palance), to defuse [[Unexploded ordnance|unexploded]] [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombs scattered throughout the city.\n\nDelighted by the well-paying position, Karl bets Eric that he will outlive him. Although initially taken aback by the wager, the other men soon agree that half of their salaries will go to the survivors of the dangerous mission in three months' time. The British, in the form of Major Haven (Wattis), provide the men new uniforms and equipment, and assign Frau Bauer (Virginia Baker) as their [[Liaison officer|liaison]]. Karl volunteers to lead the unit, but the men vote for the reluctant Eric instead.\n\nLater, Karl and Eric move into an Allied-approved [[boarding house]] run by pretty young [[widow]] Margot Hoefler (Carol), a [[French people|French]] woman whose German husband died during the war.\n\nSeveral weeks go by in which the men successfully and safely defuse numerous bombs; then the men are stunned when young Globke is killed while defusing a British 1000-pound bomb. Suspecting that the bomb has double fuses, Eric asks Haven to request information from British armaments on its design. At the boardinghouse, Karl continually flirts with Margot, to Eric's annoyance. One evening when Margot loudly protests Karl's drunken advances, Eric bursts into Margot's room to help her and Karl retreats, ridiculing Eric for his motives. Deducing that Eric disapproves of her behavior, Margot explains that her uneasy situation as a traitor to the French and an outsider to the Germans has left her jaded and willing to take happiness wherever she can find it. When Eric remains critical, Margot accuses him of denying his own desires.\n\nA few days later, Frau Bauer receives a report that Tillig has been trapped under a live bomb by the partial collapse of a ruined building. With the other men away on assignments, Eric and Karl race to the site, and despite Tillig's protests, inspect the bomb. After Eric defuses the bomb safely, a doctor arrives and upon examining Tillig declares there is no chance for his survival. Refusing to accept the pronouncement, Eric hurries outside to request equipment to lift the bomb, but as Karl expresses his doubts, the building collapses on Tillig and the doctor. Distraught, Eric returns to the boardinghouse where he seeks solace from Margot. The next day, Eric takes Margot to another ruined section of the city and reveals that before the war he was an architect. Eric struggles to conceal his growing feelings for Margot, admitting that he is confused about becoming romantically involved while his life is in danger daily.\n\nBack at headquarters, Haven tells Eric that because of the post-war chaos, they have been unable to gather information on the thousand-pound bombs. When Haven discloses that he knows of Eric's former profession, Karl, unaware that his colleague was an esteemed architect, expresses surprise. Eric tells Haven that he was forced into demolitions when he fell into disfavor for making [[Anti-fascism|anti-Nazi]] political statements. Karl and the other men were all pressed into demolitions as punishment for some indiscretion and all vowed to do everything they could to survive the war. Mocking Eric's growing anxiety, Karl urges him to quit the unit and give up the wager, but Eric refuses.\n\nA month before the wager's deadline, Sulke is killed while defusing a double fused bomb. Eric, Loeffler and the men agree to adhere to the terms of the wager but discuss giving the salaries to Sulke's widow and child. When Eric presents the proposal to Karl, he scoffs at the suggestion, explaining that his motto has always been to look after himself. The next day Loeffler is called to defuse a bomb found in a canal. Later, Eric learns that Loeffler has drowned in the attempt. That afternoon when Margot urges Eric to give up the bet and quit the unit, Eric explains he must know whether he can triumph over Karl's greed and selfishness.\n\nA few days later, Karl is assigned to defuse a thousand-pound bomb and Eric joins him at the site to make an inspection. The men discuss a strategy to avoid the potential second fuse, then Eric departs, but worriedly hovers nearby. After removing the top of the bomb, Karl gently handles the cap then abruptly calls for help, claiming the detonator pin has slipped. Eric rushes in and provides a pencil, which he offers to hold in place of the pin while Karl retrieves his tools from the landing. Moments later, Eric is stunned when the rope Karl used earlier to remove the top pulls tautly across his hand, forcing him to release the pencil. The bomb does not explode, however, and Eric realizes that Karl has tried to kill him. Eric punches Karl in the face. Once Karl gets back on his feet, he says, \"Guess it's still my bomb.\" Eric replies, \"Still your bomb.\" Eric then gets his coat and walks away. Karl resumes defusing the bomb. Once Eric is a safe distance away, the bomb explodes, killing Karl.\n\nThe film closes after saluting the efforts of the ordnance removal teams, which have allowed Berlin to rebuild.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jack Palance]] as Erik Koertner\n*[[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]] as Karl Wirtz\n*[[Martine Carol]] as Margot Hofer\n*[[Robert Cornthwaite (actor)|Robert Cornthwaite]] as Franz Loeffler\n*Virginia Baker as Frau Bauer\n*[[Richard Wattis]] as Major Haven\n*[[Wesley Addy]] as Wolfgang Sulke\n*[[Dave Willock]] as Peter Tillig\n*James Goodwin as Hans Globke\n*Nancy Lee as Ruth Sulke\n*[[Charles Nolte]] as Doctor\n\n==Production==\nRobert Aldrich had just been fired from making ''[[The Garment Jungle]]'':\n<blockquote>I couldn't get a job.
