It is the most significant [[art museum|visual arts museum]] in the [[Australia]]n state of [[South Australia]]. It has a collection of almost 45,000 works of art, making it the second largest state art collection in Australia (after the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]). As part of [[North Terrace]] cultural precinct, the Gallery is flanked by the [[South Australian Museum]] to the west and the [[University of Adelaide]] to the east.\n\nAs well as its permanent collection, which is especially renowned for its collection of [[Australian art]], AGSA hosts the annual Festival of Contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art known as ''[[Tarnanthi]]'', displays a number of visiting exhibitions each year and also contributes travelling exhibitions to regional galleries. [[European art|European]] (including [[British art|British]]), [[Asian art|Asian]] and [[North American]] art are also well represented in its collections.\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\nThe [[South Australian Society of Arts]], established in 1856 and oldest fine arts society still in existence, held Annual exhibitions in [[South Australian Institute]] rooms and advocated for a public art collection. In 1880 Parliament gave \u00a32,000 to the Institute to start acquiring a collection and the National Gallery of South Australia was established in June 1881.<ref>{{cite web|first=Margaret|last= Anderson|others=History Trust of South Australia|title=Art Gallery of South Australia|website=SA History Hub|url=http://sahistoryhub.com.au/places/art-gallery-of-south-australia|accessdate= 10 May 2019}}</ref> It was opened in two rooms of the public library (now the Mortlock Wing of the State Library), by [[Prince Albert Victor]] and [[George V of Great Britain|Prince George]]. Most works on display were acquired through a government grant.

It is the most significant [[art museum|visual arts museum]] in the [[Australia]]n state of [[South Australia]]. It has a collection of almost 45,000 works of art, making it the second largest state art collection in Australia (after the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]). As part of [[North Terrace]] cultural precinct, the Gallery is flanked by the [[South Australian Museum]] to the west and the [[University of Adelaide]] to the east.\n\nAs well as its permanent collection, which is especially renowned for its collection of [[Australian art]], AGSA hosts the annual Festival of Contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art known as ''[[Tarnanthi]]'', displays a number of visiting exhibitions each year and also contributes travelling exhibitions to regional galleries. [[European art|European]] (including [[British art|British]]), [[Asian art|Asian]] and [[North American]] art are also well represented in its collections.\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\nThe [[South Australian Society of Arts]], established in 1856 and oldest fine arts society still in existence, held Annual exhibitions in [[South Australian Institute]] rooms and advocated for a public art collection. In 1880 Parliament gave \u00a32,000 to the Institute to start acquiring a collection and the National Gallery of South Australia was established in June 1881.<ref>{{cite web|first=Margaret|last= Anderson|others=History Trust of South Australia|title=Art Gallery of South Australia|website=SA History Hub|url=http://sahistoryhub.com.au/places/art-gallery-of-south-australia|accessdate= 10 May 2019}}</ref> It was opened in two rooms of the public library (now the Mortlock Wing of the State Library), by [[Prince Albert Victor]] and [[George V of Great Britain|Prince George]].

In general, there are four major challenges in realizing industrial AI.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Data ===\nEngineering systems now generate a lot of data and modern industry is indeed a [[big data]] environment. However, industrial data usually is structured, but may be low-quality.\n\n=== Speed ===\nProduction process happens fast and the equipment and work piece can be expensive, the AI applications need to be applied in real-time to be able to detect anomalies immediately to avoid waste and other consequences. Cloud-based solutions can be powerful and fast, but they still would not fit certain computation efficiency requirements. Edge computing may be a better choice in such scenario.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== High fidelity requirement ===\nUnlike consumer-faced AI recommendations systems which have a high tolerance for false positives and negatives, even a very low rate of false positives or negatives rate may cost the total credibility of AI systems. Industrial AI applications are usually dealing with critical issues related to safety, reliability, and operations. Any failure in predictions could incur a negative economic and/or safety impact on the users and discourage them to rely on AI systems.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Interpretability ===\nBesides prediction accuracy and performance fidelity, the industrial AI systems must also go beyond prediction results and give root cause analysis for anomalies. This requires that during development, data scientists need to work with domain experts and include [[domain know-how]] into the modeling process, and have the model adaptively learn and accumulate such insights as knowledge.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Operational artificial intelligence]]\n*[[Artificial intelligence in heavy industry]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Artificial intelligence]]\n", "text_old": "'''Industrial artificial intelligence''' (Industrial AI) is a systematic discipline to enable engineers to systematically develop and deploy AI algorithms with repeating and consistent successes<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Jay |title=Industrial AI: Applications with Sustainable Performance |date=2020 |publisher=Springer Singapore |isbn=978-981-15-2143-0 |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789811521430?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmpb0BRCBARIsAG7y4za5XZCtTMODWR1WDccxy8OTy0p37ecVM_DnooyKkSxAcQEEiy0IOMYaAnokEALw_wcB |language=en}}</ref>.

{"title_page": "Efficient approximately-fair item allocation", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=March 2020}}\n\nWhen allocating objects among people with different preferences, two major goals are [[Pareto efficiency]] and fairness. Since the objects are indivisible, there may not exist any fair allocation. For example, when there is a single house and two people, every allocation of the house will be unfair to one person. Therefore, several common approximations have been studied, such as ''[[envy-free item allocation|envy-freeness]] up to one item'' (EF1) and ''[[proportionality]] up to one item'' (PROP1) and ''[[Maximin-share]] fairness'' (MMS). The problem of '''efficient approximately-fair item allocation''' is to find an allocation that is both [[Pareto-efficient]] (PE) and satisfies one of these fairness notions. The problem was first presented at 2016<ref name=\"ckmpsw16\">{{cite conference|last1=Caragiannis|first1=Ioannis|last2=Kurokawa|first2=David|last3=Moulin|first3=Herv\u00e9|last4=Procaccia|first4=Ariel D.|last5=Shah|first5=Nisarg|last6=Wang|first6=Junxing|year=2016|title=The Unreasonable Fairness of Maximum Nash Welfare|url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/123283/1/123283.pdf|conference=Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation - EC '16|pages=305|doi=10.1145/2940716.2940726|isbn=9781450339360}}</ref> and has attracted considerable attention since then.\n\n== Background ==\nThere is a finite set of objects, denoted by ''M''. There are ''n'' agents. Each agent ''i'' has a value-function ''V<sub>i</sub>'', that assigns a value to each subset of objects. The goal is to partition ''M'' into ''n'' subsets, ''X''<sub>1</sub>,...,''X<sub>n</sub>'', and give each subset ''X<sub>i</sub>'' to agent ''i'', such that the allocation is both [[Pareto-efficient]] and fair.\n\nThere are various notions of fairness, among them [[envy-freeness]] and [[Proportional division|proportionality]]. In the context of indivisible item allocation, a common fairness notion is '''EF1''' (envy-free up to one good). An allocation of objects is called EF1 if, for every two agents i and j, if at most one item is removed from the bundle of j, then i does not envy j.

Since it is obvious that the maximizing allocation is PE, the existence of PE+EF1 allocation follows.\n\nIf the agents' utilities are not additive, the max-product solution is not necessarily EF1; but if the agents' utilities are at least [[submodular]], the max-product solution satisfies a weaker property called ''Marginal-Envy-Freeness except-1-item'' (MEF1): it means that each agent ''i'' values his budnle at least as much as the ''marignal utility'' of (the bundle of j with the best item removed from it).

presented a [[pseudo-polynomial time]] algorithm for finding PE+EF1 allocations and proved the following results.\n\n* The algorithm finds a PE+EF1 allocation in time O(poly(''m'',''n'',''v''<sub>max</sub>)), where m is the number of objects, n the number of agents, and ''v''<sub>max</sub> the largest value of an item (all the valuations are integers).\n* The same algorithm provides an 1.45 approximation to the maximum Nash welfare.\n* The algorithm also proves the existence of an allocation which is both EF1 and [[fractionally Pareto optimal]].\n\n=== Basic concepts ===\nTheir algorithm is based on the notion of [[competitive equilibrium]] in a [[Fisher market]]. It uses the following concepts.\n\n*'''Approximate EF1 allocation''': Given a constant ''e'' > 0, an allocation is ''e''-EF1 if it satisfies the EF1 condition up to a multiplicative constant of (1+''e''). Formally:\n**<math>\\forall i,j: ~~~ \\exists C\\subseteq X_j: ~~~|C|\\leq 1, ~~~(1+e)\\cdot V_i(X_i) \\geq V_i(X_j\\setminus C)</math>\n*'''Price-vector''': a vector assigning a price (a real number) to each item.\n* '''Bang-for-buck ratio''': for an agent ''i'' and an object ''o'', it is the ratio of the agent's valuation of the item, to the item price:  ''v<sub>ij</sub>'' / ''p<sub>j</sub>''.\n* '''Maximum bang-for-buck (MBB) set''': for an agent ''i'', it is the set of objects maximizing his bang-for-buck ratio (given a price-vector ''p'').\n* '''MBB allocation''': an allocation in which each agent receives only objects from his MBB set. In an MBB allocation, each agent maximizes his utility given his budget (but MBB allocation is a stronger condition).  The [[First Welfare Theorem|first welfare theorem]] implies that an MBB allocation is [[fractionally Pareto optimal]].\n*'''Price-envy-free (pEF) allocation''': an allocation X in which, for every two agents ''i''.''j'', the price of ''X<sub>i</sub>'' (called the \"income\" of i) is at least as large as the price ''X<sub>j</sub>''. This implies that all incomes are identical. Moreover, an allocation that is both MBB and pEF is [[envy-free]], since each agent maximizes his utility given his income, and all other agents have the same income.\n*'''Price-envy-free-except-one (pEF1) allocation''': an allocation in which, for every two agents ''i''.''j'', the price p(''X<sub>i</sub>'') is at least as large as the price of  ''Xj'' without its most expensive item. This does ''not'' imply that the incomes are identical. However, an allocation that is both MBB and pEF1 is also EF1.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|Lem.4.1}}\n*'''''e''-pEF1 allocation''', for some constant ''e'' > 0: an allocation in which, for every two agents ''i''.''j'',  the product (1+''e'')\u00b7p(''X<sub>i</sub>'') is at least as large as p(''Xj'') without its most expensive item. Note that the ''e''-pEF1 condition is weaker when ''e'' is larger.  In particular, a pEF1 allocation is ''e''-pEF1 for every ''e'' > 0, but the opposite is not true.  An allocation that is both MBB and ''e''-pEF1 is also '''''e''-EF1'''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|Lem.4.1}}\n*'''Least-spender''': Given an allocation and a price-vector, it is the agent ''i'' such that p(''X<sub>i</sub>'') is smallest (ties are broken based on some prespecified ordering of the agents). Note that an allocation is ''e''-pEF1 iff the ''e''-pEF1 condition is satisfied for the least spender (as agent ''i'').\n*'''MBB Hierarchy''' of agent ''i'' (given alllocation ''X'' and price-vector ''p''): a tree-structure built in the following way.\n** Put agent ''i'' at the root (this is called level 0).\n** Connect to agent ''i'' all objects in his MBB set (given the price-vector ''p'').\n** Connect to each object ''o'' the agent owning it in ''X'', if it is not yet in the tree (this is called level 1)\n** Connect to each agent at level 1, all objects in his MBB set that are yet in the tree.\n** Continue adding agents and objects alternately in a similar way: for each agent, add his MBB objects; for each item, add its owning agent.\n*'''Violator''' (given alllocation ''X'' and price-vector ''p''): an agent ''h'' that violates the pEF1 condition w.r.t. the least-spender ''i''. So the price of ''X<sub>h</sub>'', even when the most expensive item is removed from it, is higher than ''p''(''X<sub>i</sub>''). Similarly, '''''e''-violator''' is an agent that violates the ''e''-pEF1 condition w.r.t. the least-spender.\n*'''Path-violator''' (given allocation ''X'' and price-vector ''p'', and the MBB hierarchy): an agent ''h'' that appears on the MBB hierarchy of the least-spender ''i'', and partially violates the pEF1 condition w.r.t. ''i''. In more detail: suppose there is a path, along the edges of the MBB hierarchy, from the least-spender ''i'' to object ''o'', and then an edge from object ''o'' to agent ''h'' (this means that ''X<sub>h</sub>'' contains ''o''). If p (''X<sub>h</sub>'' \\ {''o''}) > ''p''(''X<sub>i</sub>''), then ''h'' is a path-violator. Note that every violator is a path-violator, but the opposite is not true. Similarly, If p (''X<sub>h</sub>'' \\ {''o''}) > (1+''e'')\u00b7''p''(''X<sub>i</sub>''), then ''h'' is an '''''e''-path-violator'''.\n\n=== Algorithm ===\nGiven a parameter ''e'', the algorithm aims to find an allocation that is both fPO and 3''e''-pEF1. It proceeds in several phases.\n\n'''Phase 1: Construct an initial MBB allocation+price (X, p)'''.\n\n* One way to do it is to give each object ''o'' to the agent ''i'' who values it the most (breaking ties arbitrarily), and set the price of ''o'' to ''v<sub>i,o</sub>''. This guarantees that, for each agent, the bang-for-buck of all objects in his bundle is exactly 1, and the bang-for-buck of all objects in other bundles is at most 1. Hence the allocation is MBB, hence it is also fPO.\n* If the allocation is 3''e''-pEF1, return it; otherwise proceed to Phase 2.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' '''Remove price-envy within MBB hierarchy''':\n\n* Construct the MBB hierarchy of the least-spender, given the current (''X'', ''p''). \n* For ''L'' = 1,2,...: \n** For each agent ''h'' in level ''L'' of the tree:\n***If ''h'' is an ''e''-path-violator along the path:   ''i'' \u2192 ... \u2192 ''h'<nowiki/>'' \u2192 ''o'' \u2192 h, then transfer object ''o'' from agent ''h'' to agent ''h''' (note that the allocation remains MBB). Restart Phase 2.\n* Once there are no more ''e''-path-violators:\n** If the allocation is 3''e''-pEF1, return it; otherwise proceed to Phase 3.\n***\n\n'''Phase 3:''' '''Increase the prices'''. Increase the prices of all objects in the MBB hierarchy by the same multiplicative factor, until one of the following three things happen:\n\n# The identity of the least-spender changes. This may happen if some agent outside the hierarchy (whose items do not increase in price) becomes the least-spender  In this case we restart at Phase 2.\n#A new object gets added to the MBB hierarchy. This may happen since, when the prices of objects in the hierarchy increase by a factor ''r'', the BB ratio of objects in the hierarchy decrease by ''r'', while the BB ratio of objects outside the hierarchy remain the same. Therefore, when ''r'' is sufficiently large, some outside object will become MBB for some hierarchy agent. In this case, too, we restart at Phase 2.\n#The current allocation ''X'' becomes 3''e''-pEF1. This may happen since, when the prices of objects in the hierarchy increase, the income of the least-spender increases, while the income of agents outside the hierarchy remains constant. Therefore, when ''r'' is sufficiently large, it is possible that the 3''e''-pEF1 condition is satisfied w.r.t. the least-spender.

We run the above algorithm on a ''rounded instance'', where each valuation is rounded upwards to the nearest power of (1+''e''). Note that for each agent ''i'' and object ''o'', the rounded value ''V<sub>i</sub>''<nowiki/>'(''o'') is bounded between ''V<sub>i</sub>''(''o'') and (1+''e'')''V<sub>i</sub>''(''o'').\n\n* By the previous paragraph, the resulting allocation is fPO and 3''e''-EF1 with respect to the rounded instance. \n* For every ''e'' sufficiently small (particularly, less <nowiki/>than 1 / 6 ''m''<sup>3</sup> ''V''<sub>max</sub><sup>4</sup>), an allocation that is fPO for the rounded instance is PO for the original instance.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|29\u201334}}\n*By combining the 3''e''-EF1 guarantee for the rounded i<nowiki/>nstance, with the bound for rounding, we get that the returned allocation satisfies the following approximate-EF1 condition:\n**<math>\\forall i,j: ~~~ \\exists C\\subseteq X_j: ~~~|C|\\leq 1, ~~~(1+e)\\cdot (1+3e)\\cdot V_i(X_i) \\geq V_i(X_j\\setminus C)</math>\n*For sufficiently small ''e'', the product (1+''e'')<nowiki/>(1+3''e'') is at most (1+7''e''). Therefore, an allocation that is 3''e''-EF1 for the rounded instance is 7''e''-EF1 for the original instance.\n*Since the original valuations are integers, when e is sufficiently small, a 7''e''-EF1 allocation is also EF1.\n*Thus, the resulting alllocation is PO+EF1 for the original instance.\n\n#\n\n#\n\n== Algorithms for approximately-proportional allocation ==\nAn allocation of objects is called '''PROP1 ([[Proportional division|proportional]] up to one item)''' if, for every agent ''i'', if at most one item is added to the bundle of ''i'', then the value of ''i'' is at least 1/''n'' of the total.

Since the objects are indivisible, there may not exist any fair allocation. For example, when there is a single house and two people, every allocation of the house will be unfair to one person. Therefore, several common approximations have been studied, such as ''[[envy-free item allocation|envy-freeness]] up to one item'' (EF1) and ''[[proportionality]] up to one item'' (PROP1) and ''[[Maximin-share]] fairness'' (MMS). The problem of '''efficient approximately-fair item allocation''' is to find an allocation that is both [[Pareto-efficient]] (PE) and satisfies one of these fairness notions.

There are ''n'' agents. Each agent ''i'' has a value-function ''V<sub>i</sub>'', that assigns a value to each subset of objects. The goal is to partition ''M'' into ''n'' subsets, ''X''<sub>1</sub>,...,''X<sub>n</sub>'', and give each subset ''X<sub>i</sub>'' to agent ''i'', such that the allocation is both [[Pareto-efficient]] and fair.\n\nThere are various notions of fairness, among them [[envy-freeness]] and [[Proportional division|proportionality]]. In the context of indivisible item allocation, a common fairness notion is '''EF1''' (envy-free up to one good). An allocation of objects is called EF1 if, for every two agents i and j, if at most one item is removed from the bundle of j, then i does not envy j.

algorithm provides an 1.45 approximation to the maximum Nash welfare.\n* The algorithm also proves the existence of an allocation which is both EF1 and [[fractionally Pareto optimal]].\n\n=== Basic concepts ===\nTheir algorithm is based on the notion of [[competitive equilibrium]] in a [[Fisher market]]. It uses the following concepts.\n\n*'''Approximate EF1 allocation''': Given a constant ''e'' > 0, an allocation is ''e''-EF1 if it satisfies the EF1 condition up to a multiplicative constant of (1+''e''). Formally:\n**<math>\\forall i,j: ~~~ \\exists C\\subseteq X_j: ~~~|C|\\leq 1, ~~~(1+e)\\cdot V_i(X_i) \\geq V_i(X_j\\setminus C)</math>\n*'''Price-vector''': a vector assigning a price (a real number) to each item.\n* '''Bang-for-buck ratio''': for an agent ''i'' and an object ''o'', it is the ratio of the agent's valuation of the item, to the item price:  ''v<sub>ij</sub>'' / ''p<sub>j</sub>''.\n* '''Maximum bang-for-buck (MBB) set''': for an agent ''i'', it is the set of objects maximizing his bang-for-buck ratio (given a price-vector ''p'').\n* '''MBB allocation''': an allocation in which each agent receives only objects from his MBB set. In an MBB allocation, each agent maximizes his utility given his budget (but MBB allocation is a stronger condition).  The [[First Welfare Theorem|first welfare theorem]] implies that an MBB allocation is [[fractionally Pareto optimal]].\n*'''Price-envy-free (pEF) allocation''': an allocation X in which, for every two agents ''i''.''j'', the price of ''X<sub>i</sub>'' (called the \"income\" of i) is at least as large as the price ''X<sub>j</sub>''. This implies that all incomes are identical. Moreover, an allocation that is both MBB and pEF is [[envy-free]], since each agent maximizes his utility given his income, and all other agents have the same income.\n*'''Price-envy-free-except-one (pEF1) allocation''': an allocation in which, for every two agents ''i''.''j'', the price p(''X<sub>i</sub>'') is at least as large as the price of  ''Xj'' without its most expensive item. This does ''not'' imply that the incomes are identical. However, an allocation that is both MBB and pEF1 is also EF1.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|Lem.4.1}}\n*'''''e''-pEF1 allocation''', for some constant ''e'' > 0: an allocation in which, for every two agents ''i''.''j'',  the product (1+''e'')\u00b7p(''X<sub>i</sub>'') is at least as large as p(''Xj'') without its most expensive item. Note that the ''e''-pEF1 condition is weaker when ''e'' is larger.  In particular, a pEF1 allocation is ''e''-pEF1 for every ''e'' > 0, but the opposite is not true.  An allocation that is both MBB and ''e''-pEF1 is also '''''e''-EF1'''.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|Lem.4.1}}\n*'''Least-spender''': Given an allocation and a price-vector, it is the agent ''i'' such that p(''X<sub>i</sub>'') is smallest (ties are broken based on some prespecified ordering of the agents). Note that an allocation is ''e''-pEF1 iff the ''e''-pEF1 condition is satisfied for the least spender (as agent ''i'').\n*'''MBB Hierarchy''' of agent ''i'' (given alllocation ''X'' and price-vector ''p''): a tree-structure built in the following way.\n** Put agent ''i'' at the root (this is called level 0).\n** Connect to agent ''i'' all objects in his MBB set (given the price-vector ''p'').\n** Connect to each object ''o'' the agent owning it in ''X'', if it is not yet in the tree (this is called level 1)\n** Connect to each agent at level 1, all objects in his MBB set that are yet in the tree.\n** Continue adding agents and objects alternately in a similar way: for each agent, add his MBB objects; for each item, add its owning agent.\n*'''Violator''' (given alllocation ''X'' and price-vector ''p''): an agent ''h'' that violates the pEF1 condition w.r.t. the least-spender ''i''. So the price of ''X<sub>h</sub>'', even when the most expensive item is removed from it, is higher than ''p''(''X<sub>i</sub>''). Similarly, '''''e''-violator''' is an agent that violates the ''e''-pEF1 condition w.r.t. the least-spender.\n*'''Path-violator''' (given allocation ''X'' and price-vector ''p'', and the MBB hierarchy): an agent ''h'' that appears on the MBB hierarchy of the least-spender ''i'', and partially violates the pEF1 condition w.r.t. ''i''. In more detail: suppose there is a path, along the edges of the MBB hierarchy, from the least-spender ''i'' to object ''o'', and then an edge from object ''o'' to agent ''h'' (this means that ''X<sub>h</sub>'' contains ''o''). If p (''X<sub>h</sub>'' \\ {''o''}) > ''p''(''X<sub>i</sub>''), then ''h'' is a path-violator. Note that every violator is a path-violator, but the opposite is not true. Similarly, If p (''X<sub>h</sub>'' \\ {''o''}) > (1+''e'')\u00b7''p''(''X<sub>i</sub>''), then ''h'' is an '''''e''-path-violator'''.\n\n=== Algorithm ===\nGiven a parameter ''e'', the algorithm aims to find an allocation that is both fPO and 3''e''-pEF1. It proceeds in several phases.\n\n'''Phase 1: Construct an initial MBB allocation+price (X, p)'''.\n\n* One way to do it is to give each object ''o'' to the agent ''i'' who values it the most (breaking ties arbitrarily), and set the price of ''o'' to ''v<sub>i,o</sub>''. This guarantees that, for each agent, the bang-for-buck of all objects in his bundle is exactly 1, and the bang-for-buck of all objects in other bundles is at most 1. Hence the allocation is MBB, hence it is also fPO.\n* If the allocation is 3''e''-pEF1, return it; otherwise proceed to Phase 2.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' '''Remove price-envy within MBB hierarchy''':\n\n* Construct the MBB hierarchy of the least-spender, given the current (''X'', ''p''). \n* For ''L'' = 1,2,...: \n** For each agent ''h'' in level ''L'' of the tree:\n***If ''h'' is an ''e''-path-violator along the path:   ''i'' \u2192 ... \u2192 ''h'<nowiki/>'' \u2192 ''o'' \u2192 h, then transfer object ''o'' from agent ''h'' to agent ''h''' (note that the allocation remains MBB). Restart Phase 2.\n* Once there are no more ''e''-path-violators:\n** If the allocation is 3''e''-pEF1, return it; otherwise proceed to Phase 3.\n***\n\n'''Phase 3:''' '''Increase the prices'''. Increase the prices of all objects in the MBB hierarchy by the same multiplicative factor, until one of the following three things happen:\n\n# The identity of the least-spender changes. This may happen if some agent outside the hierarchy (whose items do not increase in price) becomes the least-spender  In this case we restart at Phase 2.\n#A new object gets added to the MBB hierarchy. This may happen since, when the prices of objects in the hierarchy increase by a factor ''r'', the BB ratio of objects in the hierarchy decrease by ''r'', while the BB ratio of objects outside the hierarchy remain the same. Therefore, when ''r'' is sufficiently large, some outside object will become MBB for some hierarchy agent. In this case, too, we restart at Phase 2.\n#The current allocation ''X'' becomes 3''e''-pEF1. This may happen since, when the prices of objects in the hierarchy increase, the income of the least-spender increases, while the income of agents outside the hierarchy remains constant. Therefore, when ''r'' is sufficiently large, it is possible that the 3''e''-pEF1 condition is satisfied w.r.t. the least-spender. In this case, we return the allocation ''X'' and the new price ''p''.\n\n=== Proof of correctness ===\nFirst, assume that the above algorithm is executed on an instance in which all values are powers of (1+''e''), for some fixed ''e''>0.\n\n* The first challenge is to prove that the algorithm terminates. It can be proved that, when all valuations are powers of (1+''e''), the algorithm terminates in time ''O''(poly(m, n, 1/''e'', ln(''V''<sub>max</sub>)), where ''V''<sub>max</sub> is the largest value of an object to an agent.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Barman|first=Siddharth|last2=Krishnamurthy|first2=Sanath Kumar|last3=Vaish|first3=Rohit|date=2018-05-11|title=Finding Fair and Efficient Allocations|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04731|journal=arXiv:1707.04731 [cs]}}</ref>{{Rp|23\u201329}}\n* The initial allocation is an MBB allocation, and all operations maintain this condition.

We run the above algorithm on a ''rounded instance'', where each valuation is rounded upwards to the nearest power of (1+''e''). Note that for each agent ''i'' and object ''o'', the rounded value ''V<sub>i</sub>''<nowiki/>'(''o'') is bounded between ''V<sub>i</sub>''(''o'') and (1+''e'')''V<sub>i</sub>''(''o'').\n\n* By the previous paragraph, the resulting allocation is fPO and 3''e''-EF1 with respect to the rounded instance. \n* For every ''e'' sufficiently small (particularly, less <nowiki/>than 1 / 6 ''m''<sup>3</sup> ''V''<sub>max</sub><sup>4</sup>), an allocation that is fPO for the rounded instance is PO for the original instance.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|29\u201334}}\n*By combining the 3''e''-EF1 guarantee for the rounded i<nowiki/>nstance, with the bound for rounding, we get that the returned allocation satisfies the following approximate-EF1 condition:\n**<math>\\forall i,j: ~~~ \\exists C\\subseteq X_j: ~~~|C|\\leq 1, ~~~(1+e)\\cdot (1+3e)\\cdot V_i(X_i) \\geq V_i(X_j\\setminus C)</math>\n*For sufficiently small ''e'', the product (1+''e'')<nowiki/>(1+3''e'') is at most (1+7''e''). Therefore, an allocation that is 3''e''-EF1 for the rounded instance is 7''e''-EF1 for the original instance.\n*Since the original valuations are integers, when e is sufficiently small, a 7''e''-EF1 allocation is also EF1.\n*Thus, the resulting alllocation is PO+EF1 for the original instance.\n\n#\n\n#\n\n== Algorithms for approximately-proportional allocation ==\nAn allocation of objects is called '''PROP1 ([[Proportional division|proportional]] up to one item)''' if, for every agent ''i'', if at most one item is added to the bundle of ''i'', then the value of ''i'' is at least 1/''n'' of the total. Formally, for all ''i'' (where ''M'' is the set of all goods):\n\n*<math>\\exists C\\subseteq M \\setminus X_i: ~~~|C|\\leq 1, ~~~V_i(X_i \\cup C) \\geq V_i(M)/n</math>.\n\nThe PROP1 condition was introduced by '''Conitzer, Freeman and Shah'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3033274.3085125|title=Fair Public Decision Making {{!}} Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation|website=dl.acm.org|language=EN|doi=10.1145/3033274.3085125|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> in the context of fair public decision making.

J. |last=Uicker|author2=G. R. Pennock |author3=J. E. Shigley |year=2003|title=Theory of Machines and Mechanisms|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThe transmission of rotation between contacting toothed wheels can be traced back to the [[Antikythera mechanism]] of Greece and the [[south-pointing chariot]] of China. Illustrations by the Renaissance scientist [[Georgius Agricola]] show gear trains with cylindrical teeth. The implementation of the [[involute gear|involute tooth]] yielded a standard gear design that provides a constant speed ratio.\n\nFeatures of gears and gear trains include:\n* The ratio of the pitch circles of mating gears defines the speed ratio and the [[mechanical advantage]] of the gear set.\n*  A [[epicyclic gearing|planetary gear train]] provides high gear reduction in a compact package.\n*  It is possible to design gear teeth for gears that are [[non-circular gear|non-circular]], yet still transmit torque smoothly.\n*  The speed ratios of [[chain drive|chain]] and [[belt (mechanical)|belt drives]] are computed in the same way as gear ratios.  See [[bicycle gearing]].\n\n[[File:Fotothek df tg 0000387 Bergwerk ^ Bergbau ^ Tretrad ^ Entw\u00e4sserung ^ Taschen.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An Agricola illustration from 1580 showing a toothed wheel that engages a slotted cylinder to form a gear train that transmits power from a human-powered treadmill to mining pump.]]\n\n== Mechanical advantage ==\nGear teeth are designed so the number of teeth on a gear is proportional to the radius of its pitch circle, and so the pitch circles of meshing gears roll on each other without slipping. The speed ratio for a pair of meshing gears can be computed from ratio of the radii of the pitch circles and the ratio of the number of teeth on each gear.\n[[File:Gears animation.gif|frame|right|Two meshing gears transmit rotational motion.]]\n\nThe velocity ''v'' of the point of contact on the pitch circles is the same on both gears, and is given by\n:<math> v = r_A \\omega_A = r_B \\omega_B, \\!</math>\nwhere input gear ''A'' with radius ''r<sub>A</sub>'' and angular velocity ''\u03c9<sub>A</sub>'' meshes with output gear ''B'' with radius ''r<sub>B</sub>'' and angular velocity ''\u03c9<sub>B</sub>''. Therefore,\n:<math> \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B} = \\frac{r_B}{r_A} = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\nwhere ''N<sub>A</sub>'' is the number of teeth on the input gear and ''N<sub>B</sub>'' is the number of teeth on the output gear.\n\nThe '''mechanical advantage''' of a pair of meshing gears for which the input gear has  ''N<sub>A</sub>'' teeth  and the output gear has ''N<sub>B</sub>'' teeth is given by\n:<math> \\mathrm{MA}  = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\n\nThis shows that if the output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>'' has more teeth than the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'', then the gear train ''amplifies'' the input torque.  And, if the output gear has fewer teeth than the input gear, then the gear train ''reduces'' the input torque.\n\nIf the output gear of a gear train rotates more slowly than the input gear, then the gear train is called a ''speed reducer''. In this case, because the output gear must have more teeth than the input gear, the speed reducer amplifies the input torque.\n\n==Analysis using virtual work==\nFor this analysis, we consider a gear train that has one degree-of-freedom, which means the angular rotation of all the gears in the gear train are defined by the angle of the input gear.\n\nThe size of the gears and the sequence in which they engage define the ratio of the angular velocity ''\u03c9<sub>A</sub>'' of the input gear to the angular velocity ''\u03c9<sub>B</sub>'' of the output gear, known as the '''speed ratio''', or '''gear ratio''', of the gear train. Let ''R'' be the speed ratio, then\n:<math> \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B} = R.</math>\n\nThe input torque ''T<sub>A</sub>'' acting on the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' is transformed by the gear train into the output torque ''T<sub>B</sub>'' exerted by the output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>''. If we assume the gears are rigid and there are no losses in the engagement of the gear teeth, then the principle of [[virtual work]] can be used to analyze the static equilibrium of the gear train.\n\nLet the angle ''\u03b8'' of the input gear be the generalized coordinate of the gear train, then the speed ratio ''R'' of the gear train defines the angular velocity of the output gear in terms of the input gear:\n:<math> \\omega_A = \\omega, \\quad \\omega_B = \\omega/R.\\!</math>\n\nThe formula for the generalized force obtained from the principle of virtual work with applied torques yields:<ref>{{cite book|first=B. |last=Paul|year=1979|title=Kinematics and Dynamics of Planar Machinery|publisher=Prentice Hall}}</ref>\n:<math> F_\\theta =  T_A  \\frac{\\partial\\omega_A}{\\partial\\omega} - T_B \\frac{\\partial \\omega_B}{\\partial\\omega}= T_A - T_B/R = 0.</math>\n\nThe ''mechanical advantage'' of the gear train is the ratio of the output torque ''T<sub>B</sub>'' to the input torque ''T<sub>A</sub>'', and the above equation yields:\n:<math> \\mathrm{MA} = \\frac{T_B}{T_A} = R.</math>\n\nThe speed ratio of a gear train also defines its mechanical advantage. This shows that if the input gear rotates faster than the output gear, then the gear train amplifies the input torque. And if the input gear rotates slower than the output gear, the gear train reduces the input torque.\n\n==Gear trains with two gears==\nThe simplest example of a gear train has two gears. The \"input gear\" (also known as  drive gear) transmits power to the \"output gear\" (also known as driven gear). The input gear will typically be connected to a power source, such as a motor or engine. In such an example, the output of torque and rotational speed from the output (driven) gear depend on the ratio of the dimensions of the two gears.\n\n===Formula===\nThe teeth on gears are designed so the gears can roll on each other smoothly (without slipping or jamming). In order for two gears to roll on each other smoothly, they must be designed so the velocity at the point of contact of the two pitch circles (represented by ''v'') is the same for each gear.\n\nMathematically, if the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' has the radius ''r<sub>A</sub>'' and angular velocity <math>\\omega_A \\!</math>, and meshes with output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>'' of radius ''r<sub>B</sub>'' and angular velocity <math> \\omega_B \\!</math>, then:\n:<math> v = r_A \\omega_A = r_B \\omega_B, \\!</math>\n\nThe number of teeth on a gear is proportional to the radius of its pitch circle, which means the ratios of the gears' angular velocities, radii, and number of teeth are equal. Where ''N<sub>A</sub>'' is the number of teeth on the input gear and ''N<sub>B</sub>'' is the number of teeth on the output gear, the following equation is formed:\n:<math> \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B} = \\frac{r_B}{r_A} = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\n\nThis shows that a simple gear train with two gears has the gear ratio ''R'' given by:\n:<math> R = \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B}  =  \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\n\nThis equation shows that if the number of teeth on the output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>'' is larger than the number of teeth on the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'', then the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' must rotate faster than the output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>''.\n\n==Double reduction gear==\n[[File:AnimatedGears.gif|thumb|Double reduction gears]]\nA double reduction gear comprises two pairs of gears, as single reductions, in series. In the diagram, the red and blue gears give the first stage of reduction and the orange and green gears give the second stage of reduction. The total reduction is the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of the first stage of reduction and the second stage of reduction.\n\nIt is essential to have two coupled gears, of different sizes, on the intermediate [[layshaft]]. If three gears were used, the overall ratio would be simply that between the first and final gears, the intermediate gear would only act as an [[idler gear]]: it would reverse the direction of rotation, but not change the ratio.\n\n==Speed ratio==\nGear teeth are distributed along the circumference of the pitch circle so the thickness ''t'' of each tooth and the space between neighboring teeth are the same.  The pitch ''p'' of the gear, which is the distance between equivalent points on neighboring teeth along the pitch circle, is equal to twice the thickness of a tooth,\n:<math> p=2t.\\!</math>\n\nThe pitch of a gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' can be computed from the number of teeth ''N<sub>A</sub>'' and the radius ''r<sub>A</sub>'' of its pitch circle\n:<math> p = \\frac{2\\pi r_A}{N_A}.</math>\n\nIn order to mesh smoothly two gears ''G<sub>A</sub>'' and ''G<sub>B</sub>'' must have the same sized teeth and therefore they must have the same pitch ''p'', which means\n:<math> p = \\frac{2\\pi r_A}{N_A} = \\frac{2\\pi r_B}{N_B}.</math>\nThis equation shows that the ratio of the circumference, the diameters and the radii of two meshing gears is equal to the ratio of their number of teeth,\n:<math> \\frac{r_B}{r_A} = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\n\nThe speed ratio of two gears rolling without slipping on their pitch circles is given by,\n\n:<math> R =\\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B}=\\frac{r_B}{r_A},</math>\ntherefore\n:<math> R = \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B} =  \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\n\nIn other words, the gear ratio, or speed ratio, is [[Inversely proportional#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the radius of the pitch circle and the number of teeth of the input gear.\n\n== Torque ratio ==\nA gear train can be analyzed using the principle of [[virtual work]] to show that its [[torque]] ratio, which is the ratio of its output torque to its input torque, is equal to the gear ratio, or speed ratio, of the gear train.\n\nThis means the input torque ''\u03a4<sub>A</sub>'' applied to the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' and the output torque  ''\u03a4<sub>B</sub>''  on the output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>'' are related by the ratio\n:<math> R = \\frac{T_B}{T_A},</math>\nwhere ''R'' is the gear ratio of the gear train.\n\nThe torque ratio of a gear train is also known as its [[mechanical advantage]]\n:<math> \\mathit{MA} = \\frac{T_B}{T_A}.</math>\n\n==Idler gears==\nIn a sequence of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain. However, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.\n\nAn intermediate gear which does not drive a shaft to perform any work is called an [[Wikt:Idler|idler]] gear. Sometimes, a single idler gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may be referred to as a ''reverse idler''. For instance, the typical automobile [[manual transmission]] engages reverse gear by means of inserting a reverse idler between two gears.\n\nIdler gears can also transmit rotation among distant shafts in situations where it would be impractical to simply make the distant gears larger to bring them together. Not only do larger gears occupy more space, the mass and rotational inertia ([[moment of inertia]]) of a gear is proportional to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of its radius. Instead of idler gears, a toothed belt or chain can be used to transmit [[torque]] over distance.\n\n===Formula===\nIf a simple gear train has three gears, such that the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' meshes with an intermediate gear ''G<sub>I</sub>'' which in turn meshes with the output gear  ''G<sub>B</sub>'', then the pitch circle of the intermediate gear rolls without slipping on both the pitch circles of the input and output gears.  This yields the two relations\n:<math> \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_I} = \\frac{N_I}{N_A}, \\quad \\frac{\\omega_I}{\\omega_B} =  \\frac{N_B}{N_I}.</math>\nThe speed ratio of this gear train is obtained by multiplying these two equations to obtain\n:<math> R = \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B} = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\nNotice that this gear ratio is exactly the same as for the case when the gears ''G<sub>A</sub>'' and ''G<sub>B</sub>'' engage directly. The intermediate gear provides spacing but does not affect the gear ratio. For this reason it is called an ''idler'' gear. The same gear ratio is obtained for a sequence of idler gears and hence an idler gear is used to provide the same direction to rotate the driver and driven gear. If the driver gear moves in the clockwise direction, then the driven gear also moves in the clockwise direction with the help of the idler gear.\n\n[[File:10-rouage-affolter-pignons-composant-horloger-horlogerie.png|thumb]]\n[[File:04-rouage-affolter-pignons-composant-horloger-horlogerie.png|thumb]]\n===Example===\n[[Image:gears large.jpg|thumb|300px|2 gears and an [[Idler-wheel#Idler gear|idler gear]] on a piece of farm equipment, with a ratio of 42/13 = 3.23:1]]\nIn the photo, assuming the smallest gear is connected to the motor, it is called the drive gear or input gear. The somewhat larger gear in the middle is called an [[idler-wheel|idler]] gear. It is not connected directly to either the motor or the output shaft and only transmits power between the input and output gears. There is a third gear in the upper-right corner of the photo. Assuming that gear is connected to the machine's output shaft, it is the output or driven gear.\n\nThe input gear in this gear train has 13 teeth and the idler gear has 21 teeth. Considering only these gears, the gear ratio between the idler and the input gear can be calculated as if the idler gear was the output gear. Therefore, the gear ratio is driven/drive = 21/13 \u22481.62 or 1.62:1.\n\nAt this ratio, it means the drive gear must make 1.62 revolutions to turn the driven gear once. It also means that for every one [[revolution]] of the driver, the driven gear has made 1/1.62, or 0.62, revolutions. Essentially, the larger gear turns slower.\n\nThe third gear in the picture has 42 teeth. The gear ratio between the idler and third gear is thus 42/21, or 2:1, and hence the final gear ratio is 1.62x2\u22483.23. For every 3.23 revolutions of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns one revolution, or for every one revolution of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns 0.31 (1/3.23) revolution, a total [[reduction drive|reduction]] of about 1:3.23 (Gear Reduction Ratio (GRR) = 1/Gear Ratio (GR)).\n\nSince the idler gear contacts directly both the smaller and the larger gear, it can be removed from the calculation, also giving a ratio of 42/13\u22483.23. The idler gear serves to make both the drive gear and the driven gear rotate in the same direction, but confers no mechanical advantage.\n\n==Belt drives==\nBelts can have teeth in them also and be coupled to gear-like pulleys. Special gears called sprockets can be coupled together with chains, as on [[bicycle]]s and some [[motorcycle]]s. Again, exact accounting of teeth and revolutions can be applied with these machines.\n\n[[Image:FordtaunusV4front.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Poppet valve|Valve]] timing gears on a [[Ford Taunus V4 engine]] \u2014 the small gear is on the [[crankshaft]], the larger gear is on the [[camshaft]]. The crankshaft gear has 34 teeth, the camshaft gear has 68 teeth and runs at half the crankshaft RPM.<br>(The small gear in the lower left is on the [[balance shaft]].)]]\n\nFor example, a belt with teeth, called the [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]], is used in some internal combustion engines to synchronize the movement of the [[camshaft]] with that of the [[crankshaft]], so that the [[poppet valve|valves]] open and close at the top of each cylinder at exactly the right time relative to the movement of each [[piston]]. A chain, called a [[Ignition timing|timing]] chain, is used on some automobiles for this purpose, while in others, the camshaft and crankshaft are coupled directly together through meshed gears. Regardless of which form of drive is employed, the crankshaft-to-camshaft gear ratio is always 2:1 on [[four-stroke engine]]s, which means that for every two revolutions of the crankshaft the camshaft will rotate once.\n\n==Automotive applications==\n[[File:NonSynchronousGearBoxSF.jpg|thumb|300px|Illustration of gears of an automotive transmission]]\nAutomobile [[Powertrain|drivetrains]] generally have two or more major areas where gearing is used. Gearing is employed in the [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], which contains a number of different sets of gears that can be changed to allow a wide range of vehicle speeds, and also in the [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], which contains the [[final drive]] to provide further speed reduction at the wheels. In addition, the differential contains further gearing that splits torque equally between the two wheels while permitting them to have different speeds when travelling in a curved path. The transmission and final drive might be separate and connected by a [[driveshaft]], or they might be combined into one unit called a [[transaxle]]. The gear ratios in transmission and final drive are important because different gear ratios will change the characteristics of a vehicle's performance.\n\n===Example===\nA 2004 [[Chevrolet Corvette C5 Z06]] with a six-speed [[manual transmission]] has the following gear ratios in the transmission:\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!Gear!!Ratio\n|-\n|1st gear||2.97:1\n|-\n|2nd gear||2.07:1\n|-\n|3rd gear||1.43:1\n|-\n|4th gear||1.00:1\n|-\n|5th gear||0.84:1\n|-\n|6th gear||0.56:1\n|-\n|reverse ||\u22123.38:1\n|}\n\nIn 1st gear, the engine makes 2.97 revolutions for every revolution of the transmission\u2019s output. In 4th gear, the gear ratio of 1:1 means that the engine and the transmission's output rotate at the same speed. 5th and 6th gears are known as [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] gears, in which the output of the transmission is revolving faster than the engine's output.\n\nThe Corvette above has an axle ratio of 3.42:1, meaning that for every 3.42 revolutions of the transmission\u2019s output, the [[wheel]]s make one revolution. The differential ratio multiplies with the transmission ratio, so in 1st gear, the engine makes 10.16 revolutions for every revolution of the wheels.\n\nThe car\u2019s [[tire]]s can almost be thought of as a third type of gearing. This car is equipped with 295/35-18 tires, which have a circumference of 82.1 inches. This means that for every complete revolution of the wheel, the car travels {{convert|82.1|in|cm}}. If the Corvette had larger tires, it would travel farther with each revolution of the wheel, which would be like a higher gear. If the car had smaller tires, it would be like a lower gear.\n\nWith the gear ratios of the transmission and differential and the size of the tires, it becomes possible to calculate the speed of the car for a particular gear at a particular engine [[revolutions per minute|RPM]].\n\nFor example, it is possible to determine the distance the car will travel for one revolution of the engine by dividing the circumference of the tire by the combined gear ratio of the transmission and differential.\n\n<math> d = \\frac{c_t}{gr_t \\times gr_d}</math>\n\nIt is also possible to determine a car's speed from the engine speed by multiplying the circumference of the tire by the engine speed and dividing by the combined gear ratio.\n\n<math> v_c = \\frac{c_t \\times v_e}{gr_t \\times gr_d}</math>\n\nNote that the answer is in inches per minute, which can be converted to [[Miles per hour|mph]] by dividing by 1056.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+in%2Fmin+to+mph&pws=0&gl=us&gws_rd=cr\n| title = Google: convert in/min to mph\n| quote = Formula: divide the speed value by 1056\n| accessdate = 2018-11-24}}</ref> \n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!Gear!!Distance per engine revolution!!Speed per 1000 RPM\n|-\n|1st gear||{{convert|8.1|in|mm|abbr=on}}|| {{convert|7.7|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2nd gear||{{convert|11.6|in|mm|abbr=on}}||{{convert|11.0|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|3rd gear||{{convert|16.8|in|mm|abbr=on}}||{{convert|15.9|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|4th gear||{{convert|24.0|in|mm|abbr=on}}||{{convert|22.7|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|5th gear||{{convert|28.6|in|mm|abbr=on}}||{{convert|27.1|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|6th gear||{{convert|42.9|in|mm|abbr=on}}||{{convert|40.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n===Wide-ratio vs. close-ratio transmission===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2009}}\n{{refimprove|date=April 2011}}\n{{main article|Close-ratio transmission}}\nA close-ratio transmission is a transmission in which there is a relatively little difference between the gear ratios of the gears. For example, a transmission with an engine shaft to drive shaft ratio of 4:1 in first gear and 2:1 in second gear would be considered wide-ratio when compared to another transmission with a ratio of 4:1 in first and 3:1 in second. This is because the close-ratio transmission has less of a progression between gears. For the wide-ratio transmission, the first gear ratio is 4:1 or 4, and in second gear it is 2:1 or 2, so the progression is equal to 4/2 = 2 (or 200%). For the close-ratio transmission, first gear has a 4:1 ratio or 4, and second gear has a ratio of 3:1 or 3, so the progression between gears is 4/3, or 133%. Since 133% is less than 200%, the transmission with the smaller progression between gears is considered close-ratio. However, the difference between a close-ratio and wide-ratio transmission is subjective and relative.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cangialosi|first=Paul|title=TechZone Article: Wide and Close Gear Ratios|url=http://www.5speeds.com/ratios.html|work=5speeds.com|publisher=Medatronics|accessdate=28 October 2012|year=2001|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830130429/http://www.5speeds.com/ratios.html|archivedate=30 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nClose-ratio transmissions are generally offered in [[sports car]]s, [[sport bike]]s, and especially in race vehicles, where the engine is tuned for maximum power in a narrow range of operating speeds, and the driver or rider can be expected to shift often to keep the engine in its [[power band]].\n\nFactory 4-speed or 5-speed transmission ratios generally have a greater difference between gear ratios and tend to be effective for ordinary driving and moderate performance use. Wider gaps between ratios allow a higher 1st gear ratio for better manners in traffic, but cause engine speed to decrease more when shifting. Narrowing the gaps will increase acceleration at speed, and potentially improve top speed under certain conditions, but acceleration from a stopped position and operation in daily driving will suffer.\n\n''Range'' is the torque multiplication difference between 1st and 4th gears; wider-ratio gear-sets have more, typically between 2.8 and 3.2. This is the single most important determinant of low-speed acceleration from stopped.\n\n''Progression'' is the reduction or decay in the percentage drop in engine speed in the next gear, for example after shifting from 1st to 2nd gear. Most transmissions have some degree of progression in that the RPM drop on the 1-2 shift is larger than the RPM drop on the 2-3 shift, which is in turn larger than the RPM drop on the 3-4 shift. The progression may not be linear (continuously reduced) or done in proportionate stages for various reasons, including a special need for a gear to reach a specific speed or RPM for passing, racing and so on, or simply economic necessity that the parts were available.\n\nRange and progression are not mutually exclusive, but each limits the number of options for the other. A wide range, which gives a strong torque multiplication in 1st gear for excellent manners in low-speed traffic, especially with a smaller motor, heavy vehicle, or numerically low axle ratio such as 2.50, means the progression percentages must be high. The amount of engine speed, and therefore power, lost on each up-shift is greater than would be the case in a transmission with less range, but less power in 1st gear. A numerically low 1st gear, such as 2:1, reduces available torque in 1st gear, but allows more choices of progression.\n\nThere is no optimal choice of transmission gear ratios or a final drive ratio for best performance at all speeds, as gear ratios are compromises, and not necessarily better than the original ratios for certain purposes. \n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Machine (mechanical)]]\n* [[Mechanism (engineering)]]\n* [[Powertrain]]\n* [[Wheel train (horology)]]\n* [[Outline of machines]]\n* [[Epicyclic gearing]] - related to [[turboprop]] reduction gear boxes\n* [[Continuously variable transmission]] (CVT)\n* [[Virtual work]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://science.howstuffworks.com/gear-ratio.htm Gear ratio at How Stuff Works]\n* [http://www.gearingcommander.com Online Motorcycle gear train calculator at Gearingcommander.com]\n\n{{Gears}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gear train}}\n[[Category:Mechanisms (engineering)]]\n[[Category:Gears]]\n\n[[de:Zahnrad-Getriebe]]\n[[fr:Engrenage]]\n[[ja:\u6b6f\u8eca]]\n[[ta:\u0baa\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bc1]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Mechanical transmission using multiple gears.}}\n[[Image:Transmission of motion by compund gear train (Army Service Corps Training, Mechanical Transport, 1911).jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration from Army Service Corps Training on Mechanical Transport, (1911), Fig. 112 Transmission of motion and force by gear wheels, compound train.]]\n\nA '''gear train''' is a [[mechanical system]] formed by mounting [[gear]]s on a frame so the teeth of the gears engage.\n\n\nGear teeth are designed to ensure the pitch circles of engaging gears roll on each other without slipping, providing a smooth transmission of rotation from one gear to the next.<ref>{{cite book|first=J.

The speed ratio for a pair of meshing gears can be computed from ratio of the radii of the pitch circles and the ratio of the number of teeth on each gear.\n[[File:Gears animation.gif|frame|right|Two meshing gears transmit rotational motion.]]\n\nThe velocity ''v'' of the point of contact on the pitch circles is the same on both gears, and is given by\n:<math> v = r_A \\omega_A = r_B \\omega_B, \\!</math>\nwhere input gear ''A'' with radius ''r<sub>A</sub>'' and angular velocity ''\u03c9<sub>A</sub>'' meshes with output gear ''B'' with radius ''r<sub>B</sub>'' and angular velocity ''\u03c9<sub>B</sub>''. Therefore,\n:<math> \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B} = \\frac{r_B}{r_A} = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\nwhere ''N<sub>A</sub>'' is the number of teeth on the input gear and ''N<sub>B</sub>'' is the number of teeth on the output gear.\n\nThe '''mechanical advantage''' of a pair of meshing gears for which the input gear has  ''N<sub>A</sub>'' teeth  and the output gear has ''N<sub>B</sub>'' teeth is given by\n:<math> \\mathrm{MA}  = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\n\nThis shows that if the output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>'' has more teeth than the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'', then the gear train ''amplifies'' the input torque.  And, if the output gear has fewer teeth than the input gear, then the gear train ''reduces'' the input torque.\n\nIf the output gear of a gear train rotates more slowly than the input gear, then the gear train is called a ''speed reducer''. In this case, because the output gear must have more teeth than the input gear, the speed reducer amplifies the input torque.\n\n==Analysis using virtual work==\nFor this analysis, we consider a gear train that has one degree-of-freedom, which means the angular rotation of all the gears in the gear train are defined by the angle of the input gear.\n\nThe size of the gears and the sequence in which they engage define the ratio of the angular velocity ''\u03c9<sub>A</sub>'' of the input gear to the angular velocity ''\u03c9<sub>B</sub>'' of the output gear, known as the '''speed ratio''', or '''gear ratio''', of the gear train. Let ''R'' be the speed ratio, then\n:<math> \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B} = R.</math>\n\nThe input torque ''T<sub>A</sub>'' acting on the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' is transformed by the gear train into the output torque ''T<sub>B</sub>'' exerted by the output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>''. If we assume the gears are rigid and there are no losses in the engagement of the gear teeth, then the principle of [[virtual work]] can be used to analyze the static equilibrium of the gear train.\n\nLet the angle ''\u03b8'' of the input gear be the generalized coordinate of the gear train, then the speed ratio ''R'' of the gear train defines the angular velocity of the output gear in terms of the input gear:\n:<math> \\omega_A = \\omega, \\quad \\omega_B = \\omega/R.\\!</math>\n\nThe formula for the generalized force obtained from the principle of virtual work with applied torques yields:<ref>{{cite book|first=B. |last=Paul|year=1979|title=Kinematics and Dynamics of Planar Machinery|publisher=Prentice Hall}}</ref>\n:<math> F_\\theta =  T_A  \\frac{\\partial\\omega_A}{\\partial\\omega} - T_B \\frac{\\partial \\omega_B}{\\partial\\omega}= T_A - T_B/R = 0.</math>\n\nThe ''mechanical advantage'' of the gear train is the ratio of the output torque ''T<sub>B</sub>'' to the input torque ''T<sub>A</sub>'', and the above equation yields:\n:<math> \\mathrm{MA} = \\frac{T_B}{T_A} = R.</math>\n\nThe speed ratio of a gear train also defines its mechanical advantage. This shows that if the input gear rotates faster than the output gear, then the gear train amplifies the input torque. And if the input gear rotates slower than the output gear, the gear train reduces the input torque.\n\n==Gear trains with two gears==\nThe simplest example of a gear train has two gears. The \"input gear\" (also known as  drive gear) transmits power to the \"output gear\" (also known as driven gear). The input gear will typically be connected to a power source, such as a motor or engine. In such an example, the output of torque and rotational speed from the output (driven) gear depend on the ratio of the dimensions of the two gears.\n\n===Formula===\nThe teeth on gears are designed so the gears can roll on each other smoothly (without slipping or jamming). In order for two gears to roll on each other smoothly, they must be designed so the velocity at the point of contact of the two pitch circles (represented by ''v'') is the same for each gear.\n\nMathematically, if the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' has the radius ''r<sub>A</sub>'' and angular velocity <math>\\omega_A \\!</math>, and meshes with output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>'' of radius ''r<sub>B</sub>'' and angular velocity <math> \\omega_B \\!</math>, then:\n:<math> v = r_A \\omega_A = r_B \\omega_B, \\!</math>\n\nThe number of teeth on a gear is proportional to the radius of its pitch circle, which means the ratios of the gears' angular velocities, radii, and number of teeth are equal. Where ''N<sub>A</sub>'' is the number of teeth on the input gear and ''N<sub>B</sub>'' is the number of teeth on the output gear, the following equation is formed:\n:<math> \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B} = \\frac{r_B}{r_A} = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\n\nThis shows that a simple gear train with two gears has the gear ratio ''R'' given by:\n:<math> R = \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B}  =  \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\n\nThis equation shows that if the number of teeth on the output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>'' is larger than the number of teeth on the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'', then the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' must rotate faster than the output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>''.\n\n==Double reduction gear==\n[[File:AnimatedGears.gif|thumb|Double reduction gears]]\nA double reduction gear comprises two pairs of gears, as single reductions, in series. In the diagram, the red and blue gears give the first stage of reduction and the orange and green gears give the second stage of reduction. The total reduction is the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of the first stage of reduction and the second stage of reduction.\n\nIt is essential to have two coupled gears, of different sizes, on the intermediate [[layshaft]]. If three gears were used, the overall ratio would be simply that between the first and final gears, the intermediate gear would only act as an [[idler gear]]: it would reverse the direction of rotation, but not change the ratio.\n\n==Speed ratio==\nGear teeth are distributed along the circumference of the pitch circle so the thickness ''t'' of each tooth and the space between neighboring teeth are the same.  The pitch ''p'' of the gear, which is the distance between equivalent points on neighboring teeth along the pitch circle, is equal to twice the thickness of a tooth,\n:<math> p=2t.\\!</math>\n\nThe pitch of a gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' can be computed from the number of teeth ''N<sub>A</sub>'' and the radius ''r<sub>A</sub>'' of its pitch circle\n:<math> p = \\frac{2\\pi r_A}{N_A}.</math>\n\nIn order to mesh smoothly two gears ''G<sub>A</sub>'' and ''G<sub>B</sub>'' must have the same sized teeth and therefore they must have the same pitch ''p'', which means\n:<math> p = \\frac{2\\pi r_A}{N_A} = \\frac{2\\pi r_B}{N_B}.</math>\nThis equation shows that the ratio of the circumference, the diameters and the radii of two meshing gears is equal to the ratio of their number of teeth,\n:<math> \\frac{r_B}{r_A} = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\n\nThe speed ratio of two gears rolling without slipping on their pitch circles is given by,\n\n:<math> R =\\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B}=\\frac{r_B}{r_A},</math>\ntherefore\n:<math> R = \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B} =  \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\n\nIn other words, the gear ratio, or speed ratio, is [[Inversely proportional#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the radius of the pitch circle and the number of teeth of the input gear.\n\n== Torque ratio ==\nA gear train can be analyzed using the principle of [[virtual work]] to show that its [[torque]] ratio, which is the ratio of its output torque to its input torque, is equal to the gear ratio, or speed ratio, of the gear train.\n\nThis means the input torque ''\u03a4<sub>A</sub>'' applied to the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' and the output torque  ''\u03a4<sub>B</sub>''  on the output gear ''G<sub>B</sub>'' are related by the ratio\n:<math> R = \\frac{T_B}{T_A},</math>\nwhere ''R'' is the gear ratio of the gear train.\n\nThe torque ratio of a gear train is also known as its [[mechanical advantage]]\n:<math> \\mathit{MA} = \\frac{T_B}{T_A}.</math>\n\n==Idler gears==\nIn a sequence of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain. However, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.\n\nAn intermediate gear which does not drive a shaft to perform any work is called an [[Wikt:Idler|idler]] gear. Sometimes, a single idler gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may be referred to as a ''reverse idler''. For instance, the typical automobile [[manual transmission]] engages reverse gear by means of inserting a reverse idler between two gears.\n\nIdler gears can also transmit rotation among distant shafts in situations where it would be impractical to simply make the distant gears larger to bring them together. Not only do larger gears occupy more space, the mass and rotational inertia ([[moment of inertia]]) of a gear is proportional to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of its radius. Instead of idler gears, a toothed belt or chain can be used to transmit [[torque]] over distance.\n\n===Formula===\nIf a simple gear train has three gears, such that the input gear ''G<sub>A</sub>'' meshes with an intermediate gear ''G<sub>I</sub>'' which in turn meshes with the output gear  ''G<sub>B</sub>'', then the pitch circle of the intermediate gear rolls without slipping on both the pitch circles of the input and output gears.  This yields the two relations\n:<math> \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_I} = \\frac{N_I}{N_A}, \\quad \\frac{\\omega_I}{\\omega_B} =  \\frac{N_B}{N_I}.</math>\nThe speed ratio of this gear train is obtained by multiplying these two equations to obtain\n:<math> R = \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B} = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}.</math>\nNotice that this gear ratio is exactly the same as for the case when the gears ''G<sub>A</sub>'' and ''G<sub>B</sub>'' engage directly. The intermediate gear provides spacing but does not affect the gear ratio. For this reason it is called an ''idler'' gear. The same gear ratio is obtained for a sequence of idler gears and hence an idler gear is used to provide the same direction to rotate the driver and driven gear. If the driver gear moves in the clockwise direction, then the driven gear also moves in the clockwise direction with the help of the idler gear.\n\n[[File:10-rouage-affolter-pignons-composant-horloger-horlogerie.png|thumb]]\n[[File:04-rouage-affolter-pignons-composant-horloger-horlogerie.png|thumb]]\n===Example===\n[[Image:gears large.jpg|thumb|300px|2 gears and an [[Idler-wheel#Idler gear|idler gear]] on a piece of farm equipment, with a ratio of 42/13 = 3.23:1]]\nIn the photo, assuming the smallest gear is connected to the motor, it is called the drive gear or input gear. The somewhat larger gear in the middle is called an [[idler-wheel|idler]] gear. It is not connected directly to either the motor or the output shaft and only transmits power between the input and output gears. There is a third gear in the upper-right corner of the photo. Assuming that gear is connected to the machine's output shaft, it is the output or driven gear.\n\nThe input gear in this gear train has 13 teeth and the idler gear has 21 teeth. Considering only these gears, the gear ratio between the idler and the input gear can be calculated as if the idler gear was the output gear. Therefore, the gear ratio is driven/drive = 21/13 \u22481.62 or 1.62:1.\n\nAt this ratio, it means the drive gear must make 1.62 revolutions to turn the driven gear once. It also means that for every one [[revolution]] of the driver, the driven gear has made 1/1.62, or 0.62, revolutions. Essentially, the larger gear turns slower.\n\nThe third gear in the picture has 42 teeth. The gear ratio between the idler and third gear is thus 42/21, or 2:1, and hence the final gear ratio is 1.62x2\u22483.23. For every 3.23 revolutions of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns one revolution, or for every one revolution of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns 0.31 (1/3.23) revolution, a total [[reduction drive|reduction]] of about 1:3.23 (Gear Reduction Ratio (GRR) = 1/Gear Ratio (GR)).\n\nSince the idler gear contacts directly both the smaller and the larger gear, it can be removed from the calculation, also giving a ratio of 42/13\u22483.23. The idler gear serves to make both the drive gear and the driven gear rotate in the same direction, but confers no mechanical advantage.\n\n==Belt drives==\nBelts can have teeth in them also and be coupled to gear-like pulleys. Special gears called sprockets can be coupled together with chains, as on [[bicycle]]s and some [[motorcycle]]s. Again, exact accounting of teeth and revolutions can be applied with these machines.\n\n[[Image:FordtaunusV4front.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Poppet valve|Valve]] timing gears on a [[Ford Taunus V4 engine]] \u2014 the small gear is on the [[crankshaft]], the larger gear is on the [[camshaft]]. The crankshaft gear has 34 teeth, the camshaft gear has 68 teeth and runs at half the crankshaft RPM.<br>(The small gear in the lower left is on the [[balance shaft]].)]]\n\nFor example, a belt with teeth, called the [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]], is used in some internal combustion engines to synchronize the movement of the [[camshaft]] with that of the [[crankshaft]], so that the [[poppet valve|valves]] open and close at the top of each cylinder at exactly the right time relative to the movement of each [[piston]]. A chain, called a [[Ignition timing|timing]] chain, is used on some automobiles for this purpose, while in others, the camshaft and crankshaft are coupled directly together through meshed gears. Regardless of which form of drive is employed, the crankshaft-to-camshaft gear ratio is always 2:1 on [[four-stroke engine]]s, which means that for every two revolutions of the crankshaft the camshaft will rotate once.\n\n==Automotive applications==\n[[File:NonSynchronousGearBoxSF.jpg|thumb|300px|Illustration of gears of an automotive transmission]]\nAutomobile [[Powertrain|drivetrains]] generally have two or more major areas where gearing is used. Gearing is employed in the [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], which contains a number of different sets of gears that can be changed to allow a wide range of vehicle speeds, and also in the [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], which contains the [[final drive]] to provide further speed reduction at the wheels. In addition, the differential contains further gearing that splits torque equally between the two wheels while permitting them to have different speeds when travelling in a curved path. The transmission and final drive might be separate and connected by a [[driveshaft]], or they might be combined into one unit called a [[transaxle]]. The gear ratios in transmission and final drive are important because different gear ratios will change the characteristics of a vehicle's performance.\n\n===Example===\nA 2004 [[Chevrolet Corvette C5 Z06]] with a six-speed [[manual transmission]] has the following gear ratios in the transmission:\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!Gear!!Ratio\n|-\n|1st gear||2.97:1\n|-\n|2nd gear||2.07:1\n|-\n|3rd gear||1.43:1\n|-\n|4th gear||1.00:1\n|-\n|5th gear||0.84:1\n|-\n|6th gear||0.56:1\n|-\n|reverse ||\u22123.38:1\n|}\n\nIn 1st gear, the engine makes 2.97 revolutions for every revolution of the transmission\u2019s output. In 4th gear, the gear ratio of 1:1 means that the engine and the transmission's output rotate at the same speed. 5th and 6th gears are known as [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] gears, in which the output of the transmission is revolving faster than the engine's output.\n\nThe Corvette above has an axle ratio of 3.42:1, meaning that for every 3.42 revolutions of the transmission\u2019s output, the [[wheel]]s make one revolution. The differential ratio multiplies with the transmission ratio, so in 1st gear, the engine makes 10.16 revolutions for every revolution of the wheels.\n\nThe car\u2019s [[tire]]s can almost be thought of as a third type of gearing. This car is equipped with 295/35-18 tires, which have a circumference of 82.1 inches. This means that for every complete revolution of the wheel, the car travels {{convert|82.1|in|cm}}. If the Corvette had larger tires, it would travel farther with each revolution of the wheel, which would be like a higher gear. If the car had smaller tires, it would be like a lower gear.\n\nWith the gear ratios of the transmission and differential and the size of the tires, it becomes possible to calculate the speed of the car for a particular gear at a particular engine [[revolutions per minute|RPM]].\n\nFor example, it is possible to determine the distance the car will travel for one revolution of the engine by dividing the circumference of the tire by the combined gear ratio of the transmission and differential.\n\n<math> d = \\frac{c_t}{gr_t \\times gr_d}</math>\n\nIt is also possible to determine a car's speed from the engine speed by multiplying the circumference of the tire by the engine speed and dividing by the combined gear ratio.\n\n<math> v_c = \\frac{c_t \\times v_e}{gr_t \\times gr_d}</math>\n\nNote that the answer is in inches per minute, which can be converted to [[Miles per hour|mph]] by dividing by 1056.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+in%2Fmin+to+mph&pws=0&gl=us&gws_rd=cr\n| title = Google: convert in/min to mph\n| quote = Formula: divide the speed value by 1056\n| accessdate = 2018-11-24}}</ref> \n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!Gear!!Distance per engine revolution!!Speed per 1000 RPM\n|-\n|1st gear||{{convert|8.1|in|mm|abbr=on}}|| {{convert|7.7|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2nd gear||{{convert|11.6|in|mm|abbr=on}}||{{convert|11.0|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|3rd gear||{{convert|16.8|in|mm|abbr=on}}||{{convert|15.9|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|4th gear||{{convert|24.0|in|mm|abbr=on}}||{{convert|22.7|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|5th gear||{{convert|28.6|in|mm|abbr=on}}||{{convert|27.1|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|6th gear||{{convert|42.9|in|mm|abbr=on}}||{{convert|40.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n===Wide-ratio vs. close-ratio transmission===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2009}}\n{{refimprove|date=April 2011}}\n{{main article|Close-ratio transmission}}\nA close-ratio transmission is a transmission in which there is a relatively little difference between the gear ratios of the gears. For example, a transmission with an engine shaft to drive shaft ratio of 4:1 in first gear and 2:1 in second gear would be considered wide-ratio when compared to another transmission with a ratio of 4:1 in first and 3:1 in second. This is because the close-ratio transmission has less of a progression between gears. For the wide-ratio transmission, the first gear ratio is 4:1 or 4, and in second gear it is 2:1 or 2, so the progression is equal to 4/2 = 2 (or 200%). For the close-ratio transmission, first gear has a 4:1 ratio or 4, and second gear has a ratio of 3:1 or 3, so the progression between gears is 4/3, or 133%. Since 133% is less than 200%, the transmission with the smaller progression between gears is considered close-ratio. However, the difference between a close-ratio and wide-ratio transmission is subjective and relative.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cangialosi|first=Paul|title=TechZone Article: Wide and Close Gear Ratios|url=http://www.5speeds.com/ratios.html|work=5speeds.com|publisher=Medatronics|accessdate=28 October 2012|year=2001|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830130429/http://www.5speeds.com/ratios.html|archivedate=30 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nClose-ratio transmissions are generally offered in [[sports car]]s, [[sport bike]]s, and especially in race vehicles, where the engine is tuned for maximum power in a narrow range of operating speeds, and the driver or rider can be expected to shift often to keep the engine in its [[power band]].\n\nFactory 4-speed or 5-speed transmission ratios generally have a greater difference between gear ratios and tend to be effective for ordinary driving and moderate performance use. Wider gaps between ratios allow a higher 1st gear ratio for better manners in traffic, but cause engine speed to decrease more when shifting. Narrowing the gaps will increase acceleration at speed, and potentially improve top speed under certain conditions, but acceleration from a stopped position and operation in daily driving will suffer.\n\n''Range'' is the torque multiplication difference between 1st and 4th gears; wider-ratio gear-sets have more, typically between 2.8 and 3.2. This is the single most important determinant of low-speed acceleration from stopped.\n\n''Progression'' is the reduction or decay in the percentage drop in engine speed in the next gear, for example after shifting from 1st to 2nd gear. Most transmissions have some degree of progression in that the RPM drop on the 1-2 shift is larger than the RPM drop on the 2-3 shift, which is in turn larger than the RPM drop on the 3-4 shift. The progression may not be linear (continuously reduced) or done in proportionate stages for various reasons, including a special need for a gear to reach a specific speed or RPM for passing, racing and so on, or simply economic necessity that the parts were available.\n\nRange and progression are not mutually exclusive, but each limits the number of options for the other. A wide range, which gives a strong torque multiplication in 1st gear for excellent manners in low-speed traffic, especially with a smaller motor, heavy vehicle, or numerically low axle ratio such as 2.50, means the progression percentages must be high. The amount of engine speed, and therefore power, lost on each up-shift is greater than would be the case in a transmission with less range, but less power in 1st gear. A numerically low 1st gear, such as 2:1, reduces available torque in 1st gear, but allows more choices of progression.\n\nThere is no optimal choice of transmission gear ratios or a final drive ratio for best performance at all speeds, as gear ratios are compromises, and not necessarily better than the original ratios for certain purposes. \n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Machine (mechanical)]]\n* [[Mechanism (engineering)]]\n* [[Powertrain]]\n* [[Wheel train (horology)]]\n* [[Outline of machines]]\n* [[Epicyclic gearing]] - related to [[turboprop]] reduction gear boxes\n* [[Continuously variable transmission]] (CVT)\n* [[Virtual work]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://science.howstuffworks.com/gear-ratio.htm Gear ratio at How Stuff Works]\n* [http://www.gearingcommander.com Online Motorcycle gear train calculator at Gearingcommander.com]\n\n{{Gears}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gear train}}\n[[Category:Mechanisms (engineering)]]\n[[Category:Gears]]\n\n[[de:Zahnrad-Getriebe]]\n[[fr:Engrenage]]\n[[ja:\u6b6f\u8eca]]\n[[ta:\u0baa\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bc1]]\n", "name_user": "Philafrenzy", "label": "safe", "comment": "CE", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_train"}

Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}}\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof.

The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}}\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said Imitation|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825 ca|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

Can provide additional morphosyntactic information, e.g., one part of speech.

Note that a OntoLex-Lemon senses are <i>lexicalized</i>, i.e., they belong to exactly one lexical entry. For elements of meaning that can be expressed by different lexemes, use lexical concept.\n* lexical concept: elements of meaning with different lexicalizations. A typical example are WordNet synsets, where multiple synonymous words are grouped together in a single set.\n\nAside from the core module (namespace http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#), other modules specify designated vocabulary for representing lexicon metadata<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fiorelli|first=Manuel|last2=Stellato|first2=Armando|last3=McCrae|first3=John P.|last4=Cimiano|first4=Philipp|last5=Pazienza|first5=Maria Teresa|date=2015|editor-last=Gandon|editor-first=Fabien|editor2-last=Sabou|editor2-first=Marta|editor3-last=Sack|editor3-first=Harald|editor4-last=d\u2019Amato|editor4-first=Claudia|editor5-last=Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux|editor5-first=Philippe|editor6-last=Zimmermann|editor6-first=Antoine|title=LIME: The Metadata Module for OntoLex|journal=The Semantic Web.

OntoLex-Lemon core model]]\n\nThe core elements of OntoLex-Lemon, shown in Fig. 1, are:\n* lexical entry: unit of analysis of the lexicon, groups together one or more forms and one or more senses, resp. concepts. Can provide additional morphosyntactic information, e.g., one part of speech. Note that every lexical entry can have at most one part of speech, for representing groups of lexical entries with identical forms but different parts of speech, see the lexicography module.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bosque-Gil |first1=Julia |last2=Gracia |first2=Jorge |title=The OntoLex Lemon Lexicography Module |url=https://www.w3.org/2019/09/lexicog/ |publisher=W3C |accessdate=6 December 2019}}</ref>\n* lexical form: surface form of a particular lexical entry, e.g., its written representation\n* lexical sense: word sense of a particular lexical entry. Note that a OntoLex-Lemon senses are <i>lexicalized</i>, i.e., they belong to exactly one lexical entry. For elements of meaning that can be expressed by different lexemes, use lexical concept.\n* lexical concept: elements of meaning with different lexicalizations. A typical example are WordNet synsets, where multiple synonymous words are grouped together in a single set.\n\nAside from the core module (namespace http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#), other modules specify designated vocabulary for representing lexicon metadata<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fiorelli|first=Manuel|last2=Stellato|first2=Armando|last3=McCrae|first3=John P.|last4=Cimiano|first4=Philipp|last5=Pazienza|first5=Maria Teresa|date=2015|editor-last=Gandon|editor-first=Fabien|editor2-last=Sabou|editor2-first=Marta|editor3-last=Sack|editor3-first=Harald|editor4-last=d\u2019Amato|editor4-first=Claudia|editor5-last=Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux|editor5-first=Philippe|editor6-last=Zimmermann|editor6-first=Antoine|title=LIME: The Metadata Module for OntoLex|journal=The Semantic Web.

The innovative element about OntoLex-Lemon is that it provides such a data model as an RDF vocabulary, as this enables novel use cases that are based on web technologies rather than stand-alone dictionaries (e.g., translation inference, see applications below). For the foreseeable future, OntoLex-Lemon will also remain <i>unique</i> in this role, as the (Linguistic) Linked Open Data community strongly encourages to reuse existing vocabularies<ref>{{cite web |title=Linguistic Linked Open Data. Information about the current status of the growing cloud of linguistic linked open data. |url=http://linguistic-lod.org/ |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref> and as of Dec 2019, OntoLex-Lemon is the only established (i.e., published by W3C or another standardization initiative) vocabulary for its purpose.
