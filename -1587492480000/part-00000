They often met at [[the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto]] to discuss their opinions and share their art.<ref name=\"Silcox\"/>\n\nThis group received monetary support from Harris (heir to the Massey-Harris farm machinery fortune) and Dr. [[James MacCallum]]. Harris and MacCallum jointly built the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] in 1914 in the Rosedale ravine to serve as a meeting and working place for the new Canadian art movement. MacCallum owned land on [[Georgian Bay]] and Thomson worked as a guide in nearby [[Algonquin Park]], both places where he and the other artists often travelled for inspiration.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Charles C.|title=Group of Seven|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont0000unse_o5y1|work=The Oxford Companion to Canadian History|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=18 October 2011|isbn=9780195415599|year=2004|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Frederick Varley - Gas Chamber at Seaford.jpg|thumb|left|''Gas Chamber at Seaford'', 1918, by [[Frederick Varley]], [[Canadian War Museum]], Ottawa]]\nThe informal group was temporarily split up during [[World War I]], during which Jackson<ref name=\"brandon46\">Brandon, Laura.

They continued to travel throughout [[Ontario]], especially the [[Muskoka District Municipality, Ontario|Muskoka]] and [[Algoma District, Ontario|Algoma]] regions, sketching the landscape and developing techniques to represent it in art. In 1919, they decided to make themselves into a group devoted to a distinct Canadian form of art which didn't exist yet, and began to call themselves the Group of Seven.<ref name=\"Hill\"/> It is unknown who specifically chose these seven men, but it is believed to have been Harris.<ref name='Silcox Pg 17'>{{cite book | last1 = Silcox | first1 = David P. | title = The Group of Seven and Tom Thomson | chapter = Introduction | publisher = Firefly Books Ltd. | year = 2003 | location = Toronto, Ontario | page = 17 | isbn = 1-55297-605-X | quote = Someone decided whom to invite to that historic meeting, and probably Harris, or Harris after conferring with MacDonald, was responsible.}}</ref> By 1920, they were ready for their first exhibition thanks to the constant support and encouragement of Eric Brown, the director of the National Gallery at that time. Prior to this, many artists{{who?|date=May 2016}} believed the Canadian landscape was not worthy of being painted.  Reviews for the 1920 exhibition were mixed,<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=Varley|first=Christopher|title=Group of Seven|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0003476|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation|accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> but as the decade progressed the Group came to be recognized as pioneers of a new, Canadian, [[Art school|school of art]].\n\nAfter Frank Johnston left the group in 1920 to move to Winnipeg, [[A. J. Casson]] was invited to join in 1926.<ref name=\"Hill\"/> Franklin Carmichael had taken a liking to him and had encouraged Casson to sketch and paint for many years beforehand.\n\n[[File:The Jack Pine, by Tom Thomson.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Jack Pine (painting)|The Jack Pine]]'', 1916\u201317, by [[Tom Thomson]], National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa]]\nThe Group's champions during its early years included [[Barker Fairley]], a co-founder of ''Canadian Forum magazine'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Symington|first=Rodney|title=Fairley, Barker|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002703|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation|accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> and the warden of [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] at the [[University of Toronto]], J.

After [[Samuel Gurney Cresswell]] and other painters on Royal Navy expeditions, these were the first artists of European descent who depicted the Arctic. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Soon, the Group made the decision that to be called a \"national school of painters\" there should be members from outside Toronto. As a result, in 1930 [[Edwin Holgate]] from Montreal, Quebec became a member, followed by [[LeMoine FitzGerald]] from Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1932.<ref name=\"Varley\"/>\n\nThe Group's influence was so widespread by the end of 1931, and after J. E. H. MacDonald's death in 1932, they no longer found it necessary to continue as a group of painters. They announced that the Group had been disbanded and that a new association of painters would be formed, known as the Canadian Group of Painters. The Canadian Group\u2014which eventually consisted of the majority of Canada's leading artists\u2014held its first exhibition in 1933, and continued to hold exhibitions almost every year as a successful society until 1967.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Group of Seven has received criticism for its reinforcement of [[terra nullius]] presenting the region as pristine and untouched by humans when in fact the areas depicted have been lived in for many centuries.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mitchell|first=Thomas W.J.|title=Landscape and Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8E3yVlUUK9AC|publisher=University of Chicago Press, 2002|accessdate=19 October 2011|isbn=9780226532059|date=15 April 2002}}</ref> This sentiment was expressed by Jackson, who in his 1958 autobiography wrote,\n\n{{quote|After painting in Europe where everything was mellowed by time and human associations, I found it a problem to paint a country in outward appearance pretty much as it had been when [[Samuel de Champlain|Champlain]] passed through its thousands of rock islands three hundred years before.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=A.Y.|title=A Painter's Country|date=1958|publisher=Clarke Irwin|location=Toronto|page=25}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1966, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario incorporated the [[McMichael Canadian Art Collection]], an art gallery with an institutional focus on the Group of Seven, along with \"their contemporaries and on the aboriginal peoples of Canada\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/S11016|title=McMichael Canadian Art Collection Amendment Act, 2011|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|website=www.ontario.ca|accessdate=21 February 2020|year=2020}}</ref> In addition to housing a collection of works by the Group of Seven, the museum property is also contains the burial ground for six members of the group, including A.Y.

Although he died before its official formation, Thomson had a significant influence on the group.  In his essay \"The Story of the Group of Seven\", Harris wrote that Thomson was \"a part of the movement before we pinned a label on it\"; Thomson's paintings ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'' and ''[[The Jack Pine]]'' are two of the group's most iconic pieces.<ref name=\"Silcox\">{{Citation|last=Silcox|first=David|title=The Group of Seven and Tom Thomson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rm5yQgAACAAJ&dq=silcox+the+group+of+seven+and+tom+thomson|publisher=Firefly Books, 2003|accessdate=19 October 2011|isbn=9781552976050|year=2003}}</ref> [[Emily Carr]] was also closely associated with the Group of Seven, though never an official member.\n\nBelieving that a distinct Canadian art could be developed through direct contact with nature,<ref name='Housser'>{{Citation | last1 = Housser | first1 = F.

They often met at [[the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto]] to discuss their opinions and share their art.<ref name=\"Silcox\"/>\n\nThis group received monetary support from Harris (heir to the Massey-Harris farm machinery fortune) and Dr. [[James MacCallum]]. Harris and MacCallum jointly built the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] in 1914 in the Rosedale ravine to serve as a meeting and working place for the new Canadian art movement.

They continued to travel throughout [[Ontario]], especially the [[Muskoka District Municipality, Ontario|Muskoka]] and [[Algoma District, Ontario|Algoma]] regions, sketching the landscape and developing techniques to represent it in art. In 1919, they decided to make themselves into a group devoted to a distinct Canadian form of art which didn't exist yet, and began to call themselves the Group of Seven.<ref name=\"Hill\"/> It is unknown who specifically chose these seven men, but it is believed to have been Harris.<ref name='Silcox Pg 17'>{{cite book | last1 = Silcox | first1 = David P. | title = The Group of Seven and Tom Thomson | chapter = Introduction | publisher = Firefly Books Ltd. | year = 2003 | location = Toronto, Ontario | page = 17 | isbn = 1-55297-605-X | quote = Someone decided whom to invite to that historic meeting, and probably Harris, or Harris after conferring with MacDonald, was responsible.}}</ref> By 1920, they were ready for their first exhibition thanks to the constant support and encouragement of Eric Brown, the director of the National Gallery at that time.

Casson]] was invited to join in 1926.<ref name=\"Hill\"/> Franklin Carmichael had taken a liking to him and had encouraged Casson to sketch and paint for many years beforehand.\n\n[[File:The Jack Pine, by Tom Thomson.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Jack Pine (painting)|The Jack Pine]]'', 1916\u201317, by [[Tom Thomson]], National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa]]\nThe Group's champions during its early years included [[Barker Fairley]], a co-founder of ''Canadian Forum magazine'',<ref>{{cite web|last=Symington|first=Rodney|title=Fairley, Barker|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002703|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation|accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> and the warden of [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] at the [[University of Toronto]], J.

After [[Samuel Gurney Cresswell]] and other painters on Royal Navy expeditions, these were the first artists of European descent who depicted the Arctic. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Soon, the Group made the decision that to be called a \"national school of painters\" there should be members from outside Toronto. As a result, in 1930 [[Edwin Holgate]] from Montreal, Quebec became a member, followed by [[LeMoine FitzGerald]] from Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1932.<ref name=\"Varley\"/>\n\nThe Group's influence was so widespread by the end of 1931, and after J.

Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n== Prime Minister (1990\u20131997) ==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n== Final years in Parliament (1997\u20132001) ==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]]. His [[1997 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]] were announced in August 1997.\n\nMajor remained active in Parliament after his resignation, regularly attending and contributing in debates.

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by [[Bill Cash]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of [[Tony Blair]] as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] in July 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990\u20131992.

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n== Prime Minister (1990\u20131997) ==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n== Final years in Parliament (1997\u20132001) ==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]]. His [[1997 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]] were announced in August 1997.\n\nMajor remained active in Parliament after his resignation, regularly attending and contributing in debates.

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by [[Bill Cash]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of [[Tony Blair]] as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] in July 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990\u20131992.

It is a [[remake]] of Ozu's own [[black-and-white]] [[silent film]] ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934). It was Ozu's only film for [[Daiei Film|Daiei]], produced after he completed ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'', which had fulfilled the director's contractual obligation to complete one film per year for [[Shochiku]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Donald|last=Richie|url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/320-stories-of-floating-weeds|title=Stories of ''Floating Weeds''|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|date=April 19, 2004|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place during a hot [[summer]] in 1958 at a seaside town on the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]].  A travelling theatre troupe arrives by ship, headed by the troupe's lead actor and owner, Komajuro ([[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]]).  The rest of the troupe goes around the town to publicise their kabuki play.\n\nKomajuro visits his former mistress, Oyoshi, who runs a small eatery in the town.  They have a grown-up son - Kiyoshi, who works at the [[post office]] as a mail clerk and is saving up to study at the [[university]].  However, he does not know who Komajuro is, having been told he is his uncle.  Komajuro invites Kiyoshi to go fishing by the sea.\n\nWhen Sumiko, the lead actress of the troupe and Komajuro's present girlfriend, learns that Komajuro is visiting his former mistress, she becomes jealous and makes a visit to Oyoshi's eatery, where Kiyoshi and Komajuro are playing a game of [[Go (game)|go]].  Komajuro brusquely chases her away before she can say anything too calamitous, then confronts her in the pouring rain. He tells her to back off from his son, and decides to break up with her.  Sumiko calls Komajuro an ingrate, and reminds him of the times she has helped him out in the past.\n\nBackstage one day, Sumiko offers Kayo, a pretty young actress from the same troupe, some money and asks her to seduce Kiyoshi.  Although Kayo is at first reluctant, she gives in after Sumiko's insistence, without being told why. She goes to Kiyoshi's post office to make him fall for her. However, after knowing Kiyoshi for some time, she falls for him and decides to tell Kiyoshi the truth. Kiyoshi is undaunted and says it does not matter how it started.  The two are then engaged in a relationship which, after a while, is discovered by Komajuro.\n\nKomajuro confronts Kayo, who tells him of Sumiko's setup, but only after asserting she now loves Kiyoshi and is not doing it for money.  Komajuro has a violent confrontation with Sumiko and tells her he does not want to see her again. She pleads for reconciliation, but he is unimpressed.\n\nWhile the personal dramas surrounding Komajuro are taking place, times are hard for his theatre troupe, which has difficulty attracting a modern-day audience with its old-fashioned kabuki style. The problems pile up, as the manager of the troupe has absconded, and business - due to the ever decreasing audience members - is bad. Komajuro has no choice but to disband the troupe, and they meet for a melancholy last night together. Komajuro then goes to Oyoshi's place and tells her of his troupe's break-up.  Oyoshi persuades him to tell Kiyoshi the truth about his parenthood and then stay together with them at her place as a family. After some discussion, Komajuro agrees. When Kiyoshi later comes back with Kayo, Komajuro becomes so enraged to see them together that he beats both of them repeatedly, leading to a physical tussle between Kiyoshi and him, ending with Kiyoshi pushing him towards a table. To stifle the brawl, Oyoshi reveals to him the truth about Komajuro. Kiyoshi first responds that he had suspected it all along, but then refuses to accept Komajuro as his father, saying he has coped well without one so far, and goes to his room upstairs. Taking in Kiyoshi's reaction, Komajuro decides to leave after all. Kayo wants to join him, but Komajuro asks her to stay to help Kiyoshi out and to make a fine man out of him, as was always Komajuro's hope. Kiyoshi later has a change of heart and goes downstairs to look for Komajuro, but his father has already left, and Oyoshi tells Kiyoshi to let him go.\n\nAt the train station in town, Komajuro tries to light a cigarette but has no matches.  Sumiko, who is sitting nearby, comes up and offers him a light. Sumiko asks where Komajuro is going, and asks to go with, since she now has no place to go. The two reconcile and Sumiko decides to join Komajuro to start anew under another [[impresario]] at [[Kuwana]]. The last scene of the film shows Komajuro, tended by Sumiko, in a train heading for Kuwana.\n\n==The troupe's performances==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe title Ozu first intended for the film was ''A Ham Actor'' ({{lang|ja|\u5927\u6839\u5f79\u8005}} ''{{transl|ja|daikon yakusha}}'', \"radish actor\"). This title is said to have been abandoned because it was felt to be insulting to Ganjir\u014d Nakamura - the actor playing Komaj\u016br\u014d - a big star of the kabuki theatre in western Japan at the time. There is a conversation between Komaj\u016br\u014d and Kiyoshi in which he says, when charged with hamming it up, that that's the style of acting that his public pays to see.\n \nWe first see the troupe performing a scene from ''[[Chuji Kunisada]]'' (''[[Kunisada Ch\u016bji]]''). Chuji Kunisada, a historical figure who lived from about 1810 to 1850, was romanticised as the Robin-Hood-like hero of a number of plays and novels. He was a gambler and petty thief who, having returned to his native village to find his family ruined and his sister driven mad by the wicked local magistrate, wreaked his revenge before taking refuge in the forest, where he and his fellow-outlaws robbed the rich to give to the poor. In the scene we see, Kunisada (played by Sumiko) is taking his leave of his faithful companions, Gantetsu and J\u014dhachi, on Mt Akagi. Wild geese flying south for the winter and crows returning to their nests are used as images of parting. Ozu includes a small joke in the staging of the scene to confirm that this is not a very polished troupe of actors. When Gantetsu delivers the line \u2018The wild geese are calling as they fly towards the southern skies\u2019 he points off-stage into the auditorium. So when Sumiko, as Chuji, turns stage left to deliver the line \u2018And the moon is descending behind the western mountains\u2019 she is actually facing east.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]] - Komajuro (troupe leader)\n*[[Machiko Ky\u014d]] - Sumiko (his mistress)\n*[[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (actor)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]] - Kiyoshi (his son)\n*[[Haruko Sugimura]] - Oyoshi (Kiyoshi's mother)\n*[[Ayako Wakao]] - Kayo (younger actress)\n*[[Hitomi Nozoe]] - Aiko\n*[[Chish\u016b Ry\u016b]] - Theatre owner\n*[[K\u014dji Mitsui]] - Kichinosuke\n*[[Haruo Tanaka]] - Yatazo\n*[[Yosuke Irie]] - Sugiyama\n*[[Hikaru Hoshi]] - Kimura\n*[[Mantar\u014d Ushio]] - Sentaro\n*[[Kumeko Urabe]] - Shige\n*[[Tatsuo Hanabu]] - Rokuzaburo\n*[[Tadashi Date]] - Sensh\u014d \n*[[Masahiko Shimazu]] - Masao (Sensh\u014d's grandson)\n*[[Toyoko Takahashi]] - Aiko no haha\n*[[Mutsuko Sakura]] - O-Katsu\n*[[Natsuko Kahara]] - Yae\n*[[Ts\u00fbsai Sugawara]] - Buyer at bankruptcy\n\n''Note:'' [[K\u014dji Mitsui|Hideo \"K\u014dji\" Mitsui]], who plays one of the older members of the troupe in this version of the story, had portrayed the protagonist's son in the earlier (1934) version.

The programme still kept some of its individuality, such as a reworked version of the theme music, again by George Fenton, with the newer version being performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra at Abbey Road studios. [[John Tusa]] and [[Edward Stourton (journalist)|Edward Stourton]] took over as main presenters at this tim. Tusa left the bulletin in 1996, with Stourton taking over as main presenter, and [[Justin Webb]] becoming deputy presenter a year later.

Both studios were unused for a couple of years.\n\nA new look across all of BBC News television output on 10 May 1999 meant that for the first time all the main bulletins on [[BBC One]] had the same look, the only exception being the title of the programme. At this time [[Anna Ford]] took over as the main presenter of the bulletin in 1999, staying until her retirement from news reading in April 2006. [[George Alagiah]] became deputy presenter at the same time, with [[Darren Jordon]] taking over this role in 2003 when Alagiah became main anchor of the Six O'Clock News.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/sep/05/bbc.tvnews</ref> Following Ford's retirement, [[Sophie Raworth]] became lead anchor.\n\nOn 22 January 2007 the programme titles were relaunched, along with the rest of the BBC television output, to give an identical series of titles across news programming on all BBC channels.\n\nOn 4 February 2008, the programme temporarily moved studios, from N6 to N8 (the former BBC News 24 studio), as part of restructuring across BBC News.

The programme still kept some of its individuality, such as a reworked version of the theme music, again by George Fenton, with the newer version being performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra at Abbey Road studios. [[John Tusa]] and [[Edward Stourton (journalist)|Edward Stourton]] took over as main presenters at this tim.

Both studios were unused for a couple of years.\n\nA new look across all of BBC News television output on 10 May 1999 meant that for the first time all the main bulletins on [[BBC One]] had the same look, the only exception being the title of the programme.

She served during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and participated in one action that won for her crew a clasp to the Naval General Service Medal. A French privateer captured and sank ''Wolverine'' on 21 March 1804 whilst she was on convoy duty.\n\n==Armament==\nUnusually for a brig-sloop, she was virtually a two-deck vessel as the waist between forecastle and quarterdeck was filled in to form a continuous flush deck. The upper deck below this flush deck carried six 24-pounder carronades and two 18-pounder long guns, all mounted on centreline pivots. The gun crews could fire their weapons to either side of the vessel by rotating the carriages along grooves set into the deck firing through the eight gunports on either side to accommodate these guns.<ref name=Winfield/> \n\nOn the flush deck above she additionally carried six 12-pounder carronades (two forwards and four on the quarterdeck). The crews could also shift the carronades on her upper deck from side to side as required.<ref name=Winfield>Winfield (2008), p.292.</ref>\n\nCaptain [[John Schank]], who was responsible for several other nautical innovations, devised this method of arming ''Wolverine''.\n\n==French Revolutionary Wars==\nLieutenant Donald M'Dougall commissioned ''Wolverine'' on 28 April 1798. On 16 April 1798 command passed to the newly promoted Commander Lewis Mortlock. The next month ''Wolverine'' was part of the force under Admiral [[Home Popham]] that took part in the [[Ostend Raid (1798)|Ostend Raid]] that landed 1,300 troops under Major General [[Eyre Coote (British Army officer)|Coote]] at Ostend in May. Shore batteries caused extensive damage to her and killed one seaman and one soldier, and wounded 10 seamen and five soldiers; the soldiers on ''Wolverene'' were from the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers|23rd Regiment of Foot]].

''Arrow'' had to lighten ship and the following day they crossed over the Flack abreast of Wieringen and saw the enemy in the passage leading from Vlie Island towards Harlingen. On 12 September ''Wolverine'' anchored within 60 yards of the brig and only had to fire one gun before the brig hauled down her colours. She proved to be the ''Gier'', armed with fourteen 12-pounders. ''Arrow'' exchanged broadsides with the ship, ''Draak'', of 24 guns (six 50-pound brass howitzers, two 32-pounder guns, and sixteen long 18-pounder guns), which surrendered when ''Wolverine'' came up. ''Draak'' turned out to be a sheer hulk so Captain Bolton burnt her. The British also captured two schooners, each of four 8-pounder guns, and four schuyts, each of two 8-pounder guns.

Two hundred and thirty prisoners were put aboard her and the command given to Lieutenant M'Dougall of ''Wolverine''.

Captain Boorder of ''Espiegle'' had discovered that the enemy had 1,000 regular troops to defend the place and to augment the flotilla he had taken two [[schuyt]]s that he had armed with two 6-pounders each from ''Espiegle''. Early on Saturday morning Bolton sent Boorder ashore with the following letter: \"Resistance on your part is in vain. I give you one hour to send away your women and children; if the town is not surrendered to the British arms for the Prince of Orange, your soldiers shall be buried in its ruins.\"\n\nCommandant Van Groutten requested 24 hours delay but Bolton replied that if the Orange colours were not hoisted in half an hour, he was opening fire. Although his Dutch pilot insisted that the water was too shallow, Bolton pushed ''Wolverine'' through the oozy mud for two miles until he was a musket shot from the shore. ''Haughty'' and ''Piercer'' passed ahead until they grounded within a pistol shot of the pier, which had been reinforced with some 18-pounders from Dutch gunboats. Notwithstanding the flag of truce the enemy opened a heavy fire that the British squadron returned. The action continued for an hour until the soldiers fled from the town and a crew from ''Piercer's'' boat planted the British standard on the pier. Later the wind came round to the southward and freshened to a gale. ''Wolverine{{'}}s'' bow was hove around with difficulty and by using a heavy press of sail she was dragged through the mud into 11 feet of water. Flatboats pulled the gunbrigs clear. On the Monday morning the enemy advanced towards the town along the northern causeway and Bolton sent word to warn Boorder. Because the town was nearly surrounded by water, a few men in flat boats were able to defend the place and the enemy were soon in retreat.<ref>{{London Gazette|pages=1021\u20131022 |issue=15191|date=5 October 1799}}</ref>\n\n===1800===\nIn 1800 Lieutenant Jeffery Riegersfield took command, succeeded on 16 July by Lieutenant John Wight.

They were under fire from three field pieces and about 200 men with muskets. The other vessel was completely shot through. The only casualties were three men on ''Wolverine'' who were burnt by an explosion of gunpowder.

She served during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and participated in one action that won for her crew a clasp to the Naval General Service Medal. A French privateer captured and sank ''Wolverine'' on 21 March 1804 whilst she was on convoy duty.\n\n==Armament==\nUnusually for a brig-sloop, she was virtually a two-deck vessel as the waist between forecastle and quarterdeck was filled in to form a continuous flush deck. The upper deck below this flush deck carried six 24-pounder carronades and two 18-pounder long guns, all mounted on centreline pivots. The gun crews could fire their weapons to either side of the vessel by rotating the carriages along grooves set into the deck firing through the eight gunports on either side to accommodate these guns.<ref name=Winfield/> \n\nOn the flush deck above she additionally carried six 12-pounder carronades (two forwards and four on the quarterdeck). The crews could also shift the carronades on her upper deck from side to side as required.<ref name=Winfield>Winfield (2008), p.292.</ref>\n\nCaptain [[John Schank]], who was responsible for several other nautical innovations, devised this method of arming ''Wolverine''.\n\n==French Revolutionary Wars==\nLieutenant Donald M'Dougall commissioned ''Wolverine'' on 28 April 1798. On 16 April 1798 command passed to the newly promoted Commander Lewis Mortlock. The next month ''Wolverine'' was part of the force under Admiral [[Home Popham]] that took part in the [[Ostend Raid (1798)|Ostend Raid]] that landed 1,300 troops under Major General [[Eyre Coote (British Army officer)|Coote]] at Ostend in May. Shore batteries caused extensive damage to her and killed one seaman and one soldier, and wounded 10 seamen and five soldiers; the soldiers on ''Wolverene'' were from the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers|23rd Regiment of Foot]].

''Arrow'' had to lighten ship and the following day they crossed over the Flack abreast of Wieringen and saw the enemy in the passage leading from Vlie Island towards Harlingen. On 12 September ''Wolverine'' anchored within 60 yards of the brig and only had to fire one gun before the brig hauled down her colours. She proved to be the ''Gier'', armed with fourteen 12-pounders. ''Arrow'' exchanged broadsides with the ship, ''Draak'', of 24 guns (six 50-pound brass howitzers, two 32-pounder guns, and sixteen long 18-pounder guns), which surrendered when ''Wolverine'' came up. ''Draak'' turned out to be a sheer hulk so Captain Bolton burnt her. The British also captured two schooners, each of four 8-pounder guns, and four schuyts, each of two 8-pounder guns. The Dutch prisoners numbered 380 men.<ref name=LG15187>{{London Gazette|pages=982\u2013984|issue=15187|date=24 September 1799}}</ref> In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]] with clasps \"Arrow 13 Sept 1799\" and \"Wolverine 13 Sept. 1799\" to any survivors of the two crews that claimed them.\n\n''Arrow'' and ''Wolverine'' weighed on 15 September and ''Wolverine'' went to take possession of a Batavian ship, the 24-gun {{HMS|Dolphin|1799|2}} (''Dolfijn''), near Vlie which hoisted Orange colours as soon as the English came up. Two hundred and thirty prisoners were put aboard her and the command given to Lieutenant M'Dougall of ''Wolverine''.

Captain Boorder of ''Espiegle'' had discovered that the enemy had 1,000 regular troops to defend the place and to augment the flotilla he had taken two [[schuyt]]s that he had armed with two 6-pounders each from ''Espiegle''. Early on Saturday morning Bolton sent Boorder ashore with the following letter: \"Resistance on your part is in vain. I give you one hour to send away your women and children; if the town is not surrendered to the British arms for the Prince of Orange, your soldiers shall be buried in its ruins.\"\n\nCommandant Van Groutten requested 24 hours delay but Bolton replied that if the Orange colours were not hoisted in half an hour, he was opening fire. Although his Dutch pilot insisted that the water was too shallow, Bolton pushed ''Wolverine'' through the oozy mud for two miles until he was a musket shot from the shore. ''Haughty'' and ''Piercer'' passed ahead until they grounded within a pistol shot of the pier, which had been reinforced with some 18-pounders from Dutch gunboats. Notwithstanding the flag of truce the enemy opened a heavy fire that the British squadron returned. The action continued for an hour until the soldiers fled from the town and a crew from ''Piercer's'' boat planted the British standard on the pier. Later the wind came round to the southward and freshened to a gale. ''Wolverine{{'}}s'' bow was hove around with difficulty and by using a heavy press of sail she was dragged through the mud into 11 feet of water. Flatboats pulled the gunbrigs clear. On the Monday morning the enemy advanced towards the town along the northern causeway and Bolton sent word to warn Boorder. Because the town was nearly surrounded by water, a few men in flat boats were able to defend the place and the enemy were soon in retreat.<ref>{{London Gazette|pages=1021\u20131022 |issue=15191|date=5 October 1799}}</ref>\n\n===1800===\nIn 1800 Lieutenant Jeffery Riegersfield took command, succeeded on 16 July by Lieutenant John Wight.

The enemy ran themselves ashore in Grand Camp, the entrance being commanded by batteries on either side, which ''Wolverine'' bombarded for nearly an hour.

The current name was caused by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]], observing the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to [[SN 1054|a bright supernova]] recorded by [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] in 1054, the [[nebula]] was observed later by English astronomer [[John Bevis]] in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.\n\nAt an [[apparent magnitude]] of 8.4, comparable to that of [[Titan (moon)|Saturn's moon Titan]], it is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using [[binoculars]] under favourable conditions. The nebula lies in the  [[Perseus Arm]] of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, at a distance of about {{convert|6500|ly|kpc|lk=on|order=flip}} from Earth. It has a diameter of {{convert|11|ly|pc|order=flip}}, corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7&nbsp;[[arcminute]]s, and is expanding at a rate of about {{convert|1500|km/s|mi/s}}, or 0.5% of the [[speed of light]].\n\nAt the center of the nebula lies the [[Crab Pulsar]], a [[pulsar|neutron star]] {{convert|28|-|30|km|mi}} across with a spin rate of 30.2&nbsp;times per second, which emits pulses of [[radiation]] from [[gamma ray]]s to [[radio wave]]s. At [[X-ray]] and gamma ray [[photon energy|energies]] above 30 [[keV]], the Crab Nebula is generally the brightest persistent source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10 [[electron volt|TeV]]. The nebula's radiation allows detailed study of celestial bodies that [[Occultation|occult]] it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun's [[solar corona|corona]] was mapped from observations of the Crab Nebula's radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.\n\n==Observational history==\n[[File:The Crab Nebula M1 Goran Nilsson & The Liverpool Telescope.jpg|thumb|[[H-alpha|HaRGB]] image of the Crab Nebula from the [[Liverpool Telescope]], exposures totalling 1.4 hours.]]\n{{further|SN 1054}}\nModern understanding that the Crab Nebula was created by a supernova traces back to 1921, when [[Carl Otto Lampland]] announced he had seen changes in its structure.<ref name=lampland/> This eventually led to the conclusion that the creation of the Crab Nebula corresponds to the bright [[SN 1054]] supernova recorded by [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] in AD 1054.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bc.ub.leidenuniv.nl/bc/tentoonstelling/Jan_Oort/object7.htm#7 |title=A short biography of Jan Hendrik Oort: 7.

The current name was caused by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]], who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to [[SN 1054|a bright supernova]] recorded by [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] in 1054, the [[nebula]] was observed later by English astronomer [[John Bevis]] in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.\n\nAt an [[apparent magnitude]] of 8.4, comparable to that of [[Titan (moon)|Saturn's moon Titan]], it is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using [[binoculars]] under favourable conditions. The nebula lies in the  [[Perseus Arm]] of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, at a distance of about {{convert|6500|ly|kpc|lk=on|order=flip}} from Earth. It has a diameter of {{convert|11|ly|pc|order=flip}}, corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7&nbsp;[[arcminute]]s, and is expanding at a rate of about {{convert|1500|km/s|mi/s}}, or 0.5% of the [[speed of light]].\n\nAt the center of the nebula lies the [[Crab Pulsar]], a [[pulsar|neutron star]] {{convert|28|-|30|km|mi}} across with a spin rate of 30.2&nbsp;times per second, which emits pulses of [[radiation]] from [[gamma ray]]s to [[radio wave]]s. At [[X-ray]] and gamma ray [[photon energy|energies]] above 30 [[keV]], the Crab Nebula is generally the brightest persistent source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10 [[electron volt|TeV]]. The nebula's radiation allows detailed study of celestial bodies that [[Occultation|occult]] it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun's [[solar corona|corona]] was mapped from observations of the Crab Nebula's radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.\n\n==Observational history==\n[[File:The Crab Nebula M1 Goran Nilsson & The Liverpool Telescope.jpg|thumb|[[H-alpha|HaRGB]] image of the Crab Nebula from the [[Liverpool Telescope]], exposures totalling 1.4 hours.]]\n{{further|SN 1054}}\nModern understanding that the Crab Nebula was created by a supernova traces back to 1921, when [[Carl Otto Lampland]] announced he had seen changes in its structure.<ref name=lampland/> This eventually led to the conclusion that the creation of the Crab Nebula corresponds to the bright [[SN 1054]] supernova recorded by [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] in AD 1054.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bc.ub.leidenuniv.nl/bc/tentoonstelling/Jan_Oort/object7.htm#7 |title=A short biography of Jan Hendrik Oort: 7.

The search for historical supernovae started at that moment: seven other historical sightings have been found by comparing modern observations of supernova remnants with astronomical documents of past centuries. Given its great distance, the daytime \"[[guest star (astronomy)|guest star]]\" observed by the Chinese could only have been a [[supernova]]\u2014a massive, exploding star, having exhausted its supply of energy from [[nuclear fusion]] and collapsed in on itself.\n\nRecent analysis of historical records have found that the supernova that created the Crab Nebula probably appeared in April or early May, rising to its maximum brightness of between [[apparent magnitude]] \u22127 and \u22124.5 (brighter even than Venus' \u22124.2 and everything in the night sky except the [[Moon]]) by July.

It is the largest indoor Asian shopping mall in North America, and has been reported as the largest Asian shopping mall in the [[Western world]]. The mall is located on the northeast corner of [[Steeles Avenue]] and [[York Regional Road 3|Kennedy Road]], along the city limits with [[Toronto]]. Opened in the mid-1990s amid a period of significant  [[History of Chinese immigration to Canada|Chinese immigration to Canada]], the mall operates as a [[Condominium|condominium corporation]] with 450 individual units. The mall also includes Heritage Town, a Pacific-style market that functions as a notable [[tourism in Canada|tourist destination]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. \n\nAn [[Remington Centre|addition to Pacific Mall]] that would occupy the site formerly held by [[Market Village]], a now-defunct mall adjacent to Pacific Mall, was announced in 2005. The expansion would see the construction of a structure that would bring the combined size of the malls to {{conv|1000000|ft2|m2|sigfig=1}}, though the project has faced numerous delays. Pacific Mall is further noted as a location for the sale of [[counterfeit goods]]; stores in Pacific Mall have been raided multiple times by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], and in 2018 the mall was listed as a [[Notorious markets|notorious market]] by the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Pacific Mall===\nPacific Mall is built on the site formerly occupied by Cullen Country Barns, a farm-themed complex opened in 1983 that housed shops, a theatre, and restaurants.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=143}} The complex was established by Len Cullen, the founder of [[Cullen Gardens and Miniature Village]] in [[Whitby, Ontario]], and consisted of two barn wings with [[gambrel]] roofs and a concrete silo.

[[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is the largest indoor Asian shopping mall in North America, and has been reported as the largest Asian shopping mall in the [[Western world]]. The mall is located on the northeast corner of [[Steeles Avenue]] and [[York Regional Road 3|Kennedy Road]], along the city limits with [[Toronto]]. Opened in the mid-1990s amid a period of significant  [[History of Chinese immigration to Canada|Chinese immigration to Canada]], the mall operates as a [[Condominium|condominium corporation]] with 450 individual units. The mall also includes Heritage Town, a Pacific-style market that functions as a notable [[tourism in Canada|tourist destination]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. \n\nAn [[Remington Centre|addition to Pacific Mall]] that would occupy the site formerly held by [[Market Village]], a now-defunct mall adjacent to Pacific Mall, was announced in 2005. The expansion would see the construction of a structure that would bring the combined size of the malls to {{conv|1000000|ft2|m2|sigfig=1}}, though the project has faced numerous delays. Pacific Mall is noted as a location for the sale of [[counterfeit goods]]; stores in Pacific Mall have been raided multiple times by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], and in 2018 the mall was listed as a [[Notorious markets|notorious market]] by the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]].\n\n==History==\n===Pre-Pacific Mall===\nPacific Mall is built on the site formerly occupied by Cullen Country Barns, a farm-themed complex opened in 1983 that housed shops, a theatre, and restaurants.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=143}} The complex was established by Len Cullen, the founder of [[Cullen Gardens and Miniature Village]] in [[Whitby, Ontario]], and consisted of two barn wings with [[gambrel]] roofs and a concrete silo. None were historic structures dating back to the time when the site was a working farm, but they were acquired by Cullen and moved from [[Pickering, Ontario]] to Markham in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Len Cullen was visionary industry pioneer |url=https://horttrades.com/len-cullen |website=Landscape Ontario Horticultural Trades Association |accessdate=20 October 2019 |date=30 March 2016}}</ref> A fire damaged part of the complex in 1988,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Irish |first1=Paul |title=Frontal attack |url=https://www.gettyimages.ca/detail/news-photo/fire-fighters-struggle-to-break-through-the-west-wall-of-news-photo/499290885?#/frontal-attack-fire-fighters-struggle-to-break-through-the-west-wall-picture-id499290885 |website=[[Getty Images]] |accessdate=20 October 2019 |date=18 October 1998}}</ref> and it was demolished in 1994; some portions of the former [[Market Village]], a shopping complex adjacent to Pacific Mall, mimicked the Cullen complex.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Low |first1=Jeff |title=Then and Now: Cullen Country Barns and Pacific Mall |url=https://urbantoronto.ca/news/2013/02/then-and-now-cullen-country-barns-and-pacific-mall |website=Urban Toronto |accessdate=21 October 2019 |date=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\n[[File:PacificHeritageTown.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to Heritage Town in Pacific Mall]]\n[[File:Egg waffle stand at Pacific Mall.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[egg waffle]] stand at Pacific Mall]]\nPlanning for Pacific Mall began in the late 1980s amid the formation of Chinese immigrant communities in suburban [[Toronto]] and a flourishing of ethnic malls in Markham, [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]], and [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]].{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=14}}{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=112}} The mall was planned and constructed amid the so-called \"Hong Kong Tide\" of the 1980s and 1990s, which saw an increase in immigration to Canada by highly educated, skilled migrants from Hong Kong who were frequently wealthy entrepreneurs and investors.{{sfn|Chan|2013|p=113}} This immigration was influenced by a range of factors, notably the [[handover of Hong Kong]], and new Canadian [[Immigration to Canada|open-door immigration policies]] that recruited based on merit rather than national origin.<ref name=\"GM1\"/>{{sfn|Chan|2013|p=112}} The passage of the [[Investment Canada Act]], which sought to direct business migrants and foreign capital into Canada, is also noted as a factor.{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=113}} Of additional note is the implementation of the [[Canadian Immigrant Investor Program]] (CANIIP), which granted landed immigrant status to individuals with least [[CAD$]]500,000 in wealth who agreed to invest $250,000 in Canadian business ventures.{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=137}} As a result of this immigration, Markham's ethnic Chinese population rose 15 percent in 1995, resulting in nearly 30 percent of Markham's population being of Chinese origin;{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=139}} by 1999, there would be a total of 58 Asian shopping malls in Markham, Richmond Hill, and Scarborough.<ref name=\"GM1\"/> \n\nA large-scale, indoor Asian mall to be built on the former site of Cullen Country Barns was formally proposed in 1993 by Torgan Group, an [[Israeli-Canadian]] development company,{{sfn|Allen-Kim|2017|p=143}}{{sfn|Leung|Lau|2009|p=118}} with the [[Fairchild Group]] as a partner.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ley |first1=David |title=Millionaire Migrants: Trans-Pacific Life Lines |date=2011 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=9781444399530}}</ref> The mall would operate as a [[Condominium|condominium corporation]], where shop units are owned by individuals who determine the store's inventory and business hours, and can sell the unit at will.

It is advertised to be capable of streaming video games up to [[4K resolution]] at 60 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] with support for [[High-dynamic-range video|high-dynamic-range]], to players via the company's numerous data centers across the globe, provided they are using a sufficiently high-speed Internet connection. It is accessible through the [[Google Chrome]] web browser on desktop computers, [[Pixel (smartphone)|Pixel smartphones]], supported smartphones from Samsung, Razer and Asus<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-Community-Blog/This-Week-on-Stadia-Play-games-on-tens-of-millions-of-new-phones/ba-p/15326|title=This Week on Stadia: Play games on tens of millions of new phones|date=2020-02-18|website=community.stadia.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>, as well as [[Chrome OS]] tablets and [[Chromecast]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9338946?hl=en |title=Stadia FAQ |website=Stadia Help |publisher=Google |date=June 20, 2019 |access-date=July 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe service is planned to be integrated with [[YouTube]], and its \"state share\" feature will allow viewers of a Stadia stream to launch a game on the service on the same [[Saved game#Save states|save state]] as the streamer. This has been used as a [[Unique selling proposition|selling point]] for the service. It is compatible with [[USB human interface device class|HID class USB]] controllers, though a proprietary controller manufactured by Google with a direct Wi-Fi link to data centers is available alongside the service. Despite comparisons, Stadia is not similar to [[Netflix]], in that Stadia requires users to purchase games to stream via Stadia rather than pay for access to a library of games. While the base service is free, a [[premium business model|Pro tier]] monthly subscription allows users to stream at higher rates of up to [[4K resolution]], surround sound, and offers 1-3 free games a month that the user has access to while they are subscribed to Pro with or without gaps.\n\nKnown in development as '''Project Stream''', the service was debuted through a [[Software release life cycle#Open and closed beta|closed beta]] running ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'' in October 2018. Stadia was publicly released on November 19, 2019 in selected countries and received a mixed reception from reviewers. The service competes with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Now]] service, [[Nvidia]]'s [[GeForce Now]], and [[Microsoft]]'s [[XCloud|Project xCloud]]. On 8 April, 2020 Google started rolling out Stadia free base service, along with giving new users two months of Pro subscription.\n\n== Features ==\nStadia is a cloud gaming service,<ref name=\"HighlyTechno\" /> and does not require additional computer hardware, only requiring the device to have an Internet connection and support for [[Google Chrome]]. Stadia works atop [[YouTube]]'s functionality in streaming media to the user, as game streaming is seen as an extension of watching [[Video game live streaming|video game live streams]], according to Google's [[Phil Harrison]]; the name \"Stadia\", the Latin plural of \"stadium\", is meant to reflect that it is a collection of entertainment, which the viewer can choose to sit back and watch, or take an active part in.<ref name=\"eu interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-google-stadia-phil-harrison-majd-bakar-interview |title = The big interview: Phil Harrison and Majd Bakar on Google Stadia | first = Richard | last= Leadbetter | date = March 19, 2019 | access-date = March 19, 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> As Google had built out a large number of data centers across the globe, the company believes that Stadia is in a better position for cloud gaming compared to past endeavours like [[OnLive]], [[PlayStation Now]], and [[Gaikai]], as most players would be geographically close to a data center. Stadia supports the streaming of games in [[High-dynamic-range video|HDR]] at 60 frames per second with [[4K resolution]], and anticipates eventually reaching 120 frames per second at [[8K resolution]].<ref name=\"eu interview\" /> Players can start games without having to download new content to their personal device. Players can opt to record or stream their sessions onto YouTube through Stadia. Viewers of such streams can launch the games directly from the stream with the same save state that they were just watching.<ref name=\"eu interview\" />\n\nThe streaming technology enables new features on Stadia. Stream Connect allows Stadia players, cooperatively playing the same game with friends, to have [[picture-in-picture]] inserts on their display of their friends' point-of-view in the game. This feature was first launched with the release of ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2019/12/17/stadia-ghost-recon-breakpoint-first-stream-connect-game/ | title = Stadia\u2019s first Stream Connect game, Ghost Recon Breakpoint, arrives tomorrow | first = Sherif | last = Saed | date = December 17, 2019 | accessdate = December 17, 2019 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> The streaming technology allows for larger number of concurrent players on a game server; for example, servers for ''[[Grid (2019 video game)|Grid]]'' are normally limited to 16 players, while the Stadia version will allow up to 40.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/grid-for-stadia-has-a-40-car-mode-that-isnt-possible-with-other-hardware/ | title = Grid for Stadia has a 40 car mode that 'isn't possible with other hardware' | first= Shaun  |last = Prescott | date=  November 23, 2019 | accessdate = December 17, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nWhile Stadia can use any [[USB human interface device class|HID-class]] [[USB]] controller, Google developed its own controller which connects via Wi-Fi directly to the Google data center in which the game is running, to reduce input latency.<ref name=\"eu interview\" /> Google is also exploring further ways to reduce latency, using an idea called \"negative latency\" which involves prediction of user input through various means so that any apparent network lag between controller and game response is minimized.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/10/google-stadia-negative-latency/ | title = Google wants to reduce Stadia lag with 'negative latency' | first=  Marc | last= DeAngelis | date = October 10, 2019 | accessdate = October 10, 2019  |work = [[Engadget]]}}</ref> During its GDC 2019 keynote reveal, Google confirmed that the controller would also feature [[Google Assistant]], which will automatically search YouTube for relevant, helpful videos related to the game they are currently playing at the touch of a key.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/1hak5/stadias-wi-fi-controller-looks-familiar-but-features-google-assistant|title=Stadia's Wi-Fi Controller Looks Familiar, But Features Google Assistant|first=Quintlyn|last=Bowers|work=GameSkinny|date=March 19, 2019|accessdate=March 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStadia offers two tiers of service, a free Base level and a monthly subscription Pro level. The Pro tier costs approximately {{USD|10}} per month, but allows users to access higher streaming rates, access a library of free games over time, and get discounts on other games offered for Stadia.<ref name=\"verge\" /> Harrison stated they are also looking into offering publisher subscriptions and other models in the future;<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/06/09/google-stadia-publisher-subscriptions/ | title= Google Stadia's getting publisher subscriptions on top of Stadia Pro | first=  Katherine | last =Castle | date = June 9, 2019 | access-date = June 9, 2019 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> for example, [[Ubisoft]] announced its Uplay Plus subscription service will be available to Stadia users.\n\nThe internet speed requirements for the different types of picture quality from Stadia's service is as follows:<ref>{{cite web |title=Stadia Founder's Edition |url=https://store.google.com/product/stadia_founders_edition |website=Google Store |accessdate=26 June 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626230111/https://store.google.com/product/stadia_founders_edition |archivedate=26 June 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Speedtest |url=https://projectstream.google.com/speedtest |website=Google Store |accessdate=26 June 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626214359/https://projectstream.google.com/speedtest |archivedate=26 June 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Bandwidth required\n!Video quality\n!Audio quality\n|-\n|10 MBit/s\n|[[720p]], 60{{nbsp}}[[Frame rate|FPS]]\n|[[Stereophonic sound|Stereo]]\n|-\n|20 MBit/s\n|[[1080p]] [[High-dynamic-range video|HDR Video]], 60{{nbsp}}FPS\n|[[5.1 surround sound|5.1 Surround]]\n|-\n|35 MBit/s\n|[[4K resolution|4K]] HDR Video, 60{{nbsp}}FPS\n|5.1 Surround\n|}\n\n== Hardware ==\nUpon launch, Stadia's cloud hardware initially uses a custom [[Intel]]<ref name=\"extremetech-1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/288237-google-stadia-is-powered-by-intel-cpus-not-amd|title=Google Stadia is powered by Intel, not AMD|first=Joel|last=Hruska|date=March 25, 2019|accessdate=March 26, 2019|work=[[ExtremeTech]]}}</ref> [[x86]] processor clocked at 2.7&nbsp;GHz, with [[Advanced Vector Extensions|AVX2]] and 9.5 megabytes of L2+L3 cache.<ref name=\"pcgamer-1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/google-stadias-specs-and-latency-revealed/|title=Google Stadia's specs and latency revealed|first=Paul|last=Lilly|date=March 19, 2019|accessdate=March 26, 2019|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> It also uses a custom [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[graphics processing unit|GPU]] based on the [[Radeon RX Vega series|Vega]] architecture with [[High Bandwidth Memory|HBM2]] memory, 56 compute units, and 10.7 [[FLOPS|teraFLOPS]].<ref name=\"pcgamer-1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-Stadia-uses-a-custom-AMD-Vega-56-GCN-1-5-GPU.421131.0.html|title=Google Stadia uses a custom AMD Vega 56 GCN 1.5 GPU|last=Subramaniam|first=Vaidyanathan|website=Notebookcheck|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> The service also has [[solid-state drive]] storage, and 16&nbsp;GB of [[random-access memory|RAM]] (supporting up to 484&nbsp;GB/s bandwidth) shared between the GPU and the [[Central processing unit|CPU]].<ref name=\"pcgamer-1\" />\n\nGoogle developed the controller for Stadia.

It is advertised to be capable of streaming video games up to [[4K resolution]] at 60 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] with support for [[High-dynamic-range video|high-dynamic-range]], to players via the company's numerous data centers across the globe, provided they are using a sufficiently high-speed Internet connection.

This has been used as a [[Unique selling proposition|selling point]] for the service. It is compatible with [[USB human interface device class|HID class USB]] controllers, though a proprietary controller manufactured by Google with a direct Wi-Fi link to data centers is available alongside the service. Despite comparisons, Stadia is not similar to [[Netflix]], in that Stadia requires users to purchase games to stream via Stadia rather than pay for access to a library of games. While the base service is free, a [[premium business model|Pro tier]] monthly subscription allows users to stream at higher rates of upto [[4K resolution]], surround sound, and offers 1-3 free games a month that the user has access to while they are subscribed to Pro with or without gaps.\n\nKnown in development as '''Project Stream''', the service was debuted through a [[Software release life cycle#Open and closed beta|closed beta]] running ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'' in October 2018. Stadia was publicly released on November 19, 2019 in selected countries and received a mixed reception from reviewers. The service competes with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Now]] service, [[Nvidia]]'s [[GeForce Now]], and [[Microsoft]]'s [[XCloud|Project xCloud]]. On 8 April, 2020 Google started rolling out Stadia free base service, along with giving new users two months of Pro subscription.\n\n== Features ==\nStadia is a cloud gaming service,<ref name=\"HighlyTechno\" /> and does not require additional computer hardware, only requiring the device to have an Internet connection and support for [[Google Chrome]]. Stadia works atop [[YouTube]]'s functionality in streaming media to the user, as game streaming is seen as an extension of watching [[Video game live streaming|video game live streams]], according to Google's [[Phil Harrison]]; the name \"Stadia\", the Latin plural of \"stadium\", is meant to reflect that it is a collection of entertainment, which the viewer can choose to sit back and watch, or take an active part in.<ref name=\"eu interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-google-stadia-phil-harrison-majd-bakar-interview |title = The big interview: Phil Harrison and Majd Bakar on Google Stadia | first = Richard | last= Leadbetter | date = March 19, 2019 | access-date = March 19, 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> As Google had built out a large number of data centers across the globe, the company believes that Stadia is in a better position for cloud gaming compared to past endeavours like [[OnLive]], [[PlayStation Now]], and [[Gaikai]], as most players would be geographically close to a data center. Stadia supports the streaming of games in [[High-dynamic-range video|HDR]] at 60 frames per second with [[4K resolution]], and anticipates eventually reaching 120 frames per second at [[8K resolution]].<ref name=\"eu interview\" /> Players can start games without having to download new content to their personal device. Players can opt to record or stream their sessions onto YouTube through Stadia.
