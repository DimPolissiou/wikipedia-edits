{"title_page": "Redintegration", "text_new": "{{short description|Reconstruction of the whole of something, from a part}}\n'''Redintegration''' refers to the restoration of the whole of something from a part of it. The everyday phenomenon is that a small part of a memory can remind a person of the entire memory, for example, \u201crecalling an entire song when a few notes are played.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.apa.org/|title=APA Dictionary of Psychology|website=dictionary.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> In [[cognitive psychology]] the word is used in reference to phenomena in the field of [[memory]], where it is defined as \"the use of long-term knowledge to facilitate recall.\"<ref>Allen Baddeley (2007). ''Working Memory, Thought, and Action''. Oxford, Oxford University Press, p. 24</ref> The process is hypothesised to be working as \"pattern completion\", where previous knowledge is used to facilitate the completion of the partially degraded memory trace.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Proust==\nThe great literary example of redintegration is [[Marcel Proust]]'s novel ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''. The [[conceit]] is that the entire seven-volume novel consists of the memories triggered by the taste of a [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] soaked in lime tea. \"I had recognized the taste of the crumb of madeleine soaked in her concoction of lime-flowers which my aunt used to give to me. Immediately the old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up like the scenery of a theatre to attach itself to the little pavilion, opening on to the garden, which had been built out behind it for my parents\", ... for seven volumes. (See [[List of longest novels]].)\n\n==Associationists==\n{{main|Association of Ideas}}\nRedintegration was one of the memory phenomena that the [[Associationism|Associationist school]] of philosophical psychologists sought to explain and used as evidence supporting their theories.\n\n==Contemporary Memory Research==\nIn the study of item [[Recall (memory)|recall]] in [[working memory]], memories that have partially decayed can be recalled in their entirety. It is hypothesized that this is accomplished by a redintegration process, which allows the entire memory to be reconstructed from the temporary memory trace by using the subject's previous knowledge.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Thorn|first=Annabel S.

The outcome of the cognitive effort is dependent on which terminal node is reached.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn Schweickert model of recall, the trace of memory can be either intact or partially degraded. If the trace is intact, memory can be restored promptly and accurately. The node for correct recall is reached, and the recall process is terminated. If the memory has partially degraded, the item must be reconstructed through trace redintegration. If the process of redintegration was successful, the memory is recalled correctly.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThus, the probability of correct recall (<math>P_C</math>) is:<math display=\"block\" id=\"where \">P_C = I + R*(1-I)</math>Where: <blockquote><math id=\"where\">I</math> is the probability of trace being intact, and <math>R</math> is the probability of correct redintegration.</blockquote>If the trace is neither intact nor successfully completely redintegrated, person fails to accurately recall the memory.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Trace Redintegration ====\nSchweickert proposed that the redintegration of memory trace happens through two independent processes. In the [[lexical]] process, the memory trace is attempted to be converted into a word. In the phonemic process, the memory trace is attempted to be converted into a string of [[phenome]]s. Consequently, the probability of correct redintegration (<math>R</math>), becomes a function of <math id=\"where \">L</math> (lexical process) and/or <math>P</math> (phonemic process). These processes are autonomous, and their effect on <math>R</math> depends on whether they take place sequentially or non-sequentially.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSchweickert\u2019s explanation of trace redintegration is analogous to the processes hypothesized to be responsible for repairs of [[Speech error|errors in speech]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Roodenrys|first=Steven|last2=Miller|first2=Leonie M.|date=April 2008|title=A constrained Rasch model of trace redintegration in serial recall|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/mc.36.3.578|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=36|issue=3|pages=578\u2013587|doi=10.3758/mc.36.3.578|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>\n\nThough Schweickert indicates that the process of trace redintegration may be facilitated by the context of the situation in which recall takes place (e.g. [[syntax]], [[semantics]]), his model does not provide details on the potential influences of such factors.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Extensions ====\n\nSchweickert\u2019s model was extended by Gathercole and colleagues (1999), who added a concept of degraded trace.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Gathercole|first=Susan|last2=Frankish|first2=Clive|last3=Pickering|first3=Susan|last4=Peaker|first4=Sarah|date=1999-02-01|title=Phonotactic Influences on Short-Term Memory|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13338998_Phonotactic_Influences_on_Short-Term_Memory|journal=Journal of experimental psychology.

It does not explain the factors underlying the intactness, and cannot account for the differences in the number of incorrect attempts of recall of different items.<ref name=\":0\" /> Moreover, the model does not incorporate the concept of the degree of memory degradation, implying that the level of trace\u2019s decay does not affect the probability of redintegration.<ref name=\":2\" /> This issue was approached by Roodenrys and Miller (2008), whose alternative account of redintegration uses constrained [[Rasch model]] to portray trace degradation as a continuous process.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Influencing Factors ==\n\n=== Lexicality ===\nIn immediate recall, trace reconstruction is more accurate for [[word]]s than for non-words.<ref name=\":0\" /> This has been labelled as the lexicality effect.

When words are presented in semantically homogenous lists, other items may guide the trace reconstruction, providing a cue for item search. This increases the availability of certain memories and facilitates the redintegration process.<ref name=\":0\" /> An example would be a redintegration attempt for a word from a list of animal names. The semantic consistency of words evokes the memories associated with this matter, making the animal names more accessible in the memory. \n\nContrarily, redintegration has been shown to be hindered for items sharing phonological features. This has been attributed to the \u201ctrace competition\u201d, where errors in redintegration are caused by mistaking the items on the lists.<ref name=\":4\" /> This effect could arise for example for the words ''auction'' (/\u02c8\u0254\u02d0k\u0283(\u0259)n/) and ''audience'' (/\u02c8\u0254\u02d0di\u0259ns/).

The outcome of the cognitive effort is dependent on which terminal node is reached.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn Schweickert model of recall, the trace of memory can be either intact or partially degraded. If the trace is intact, memory can be restored promptly and accurately. The node for correct recall is reached, and the recall process is terminated. If the memory has partially degraded, the item must be reconstructed through trace redintegration. If the process of redintegration was successful, the memory is recalled correctly.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThus, the probability of correct recall (<math>P_C</math>) is:<math display=\"block\" id=\"where \">P_C = I + R*(1-I)</math>Where: <blockquote><math id=\"where\">I</math> is the probability of trace being intact, and <math>R</math> is the probability of correct redintegration.</blockquote>If the trace is neither intact nor successfully completely redintegrated, person fails to accurately recall the memory.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Trace Redintegration ====\nSchweickert proposed that the redintegration of memory trace happens through two independent processes. In the [[lexical]] process, the memory trace is attempted to be converted into a word. In the phonemic process, the memory trace is attempted to be converted into a string of [[phenome]]s. Consequently, the probability of correct redintegration (<math>R</math>), becomes a function of <math id=\"where \">L</math> (lexical process) and/or <math>P</math> (phonemic process). These processes are autonomous, and their effect on <math>R</math> depends on whether they take place sequentially or non-sequentially.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSchweickert\u2019s explanation of trace redintegration is analogous to the processes hypothesized to be responsible for repairs of [[Speech error|errors in speech]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Roodenrys|first=Steven|last2=Miller|first2=Leonie M.|date=April 2008|title=A constrained Rasch model of trace redintegration in serial recall|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/mc.36.3.578|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=36|issue=3|pages=578\u2013587|doi=10.3758/mc.36.3.578|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>\n\nThough Schweickert indicates that the process of trace redintegration may be facilitated by the context of the situation in which recall takes place (e.g. [[syntax]], [[semantics]]), his model does not provide details on the potential influences of such factors.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Extensions ====\n\nSchweickert\u2019s model was extended by Gathercole and colleagues (1999), who added a concept of degraded trace.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Gathercole|first=Susan|last2=Frankish|first2=Clive|last3=Pickering|first3=Susan|last4=Peaker|first4=Sarah|date=1999-02-01|title=Phonotactic Influences on Short-Term Memory|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13338998_Phonotactic_Influences_on_Short-Term_Memory|journal=Journal of experimental psychology.

Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] opened its new railway station in 2003, on the [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] that had closed to passengers in 1969.\n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023. Freight services ceased in 1981 (unrelated to Beeching) and resumed on part of the line in 2002.\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n* North of [[Sleaford railway station|Sleaford]], [[Ruskington railway station|Ruskington station]] reopened on 5 May 1975 and [[Metheringham railway station|Metheringham Station]] reopened on 6 October 1975.\n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009, with a direct train to London that terminates at Corby, with a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}. The [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line|line towards Kidderminster and Worcester]] was reopened to Snow Hill in 1995. \n* The line from [[Birmingham Snow Hill \u2013 Wolverhampton Low Level Line|Snow Hill to Wolverhampton]] reopened as the [[Midland Metro]] [[tram]] system.  Despite the successful and potential reopening of many rail routes as light-rail and metro lines, the concept is still under threat due to the varying popularity of these schemes with successive governments.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968\n* The line from [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line|Coventry to Nuneaton]] reopened to passengers in 1988. \n* The line from [[Coventry to Leamington line]] reopened to passengers in 1977 and the station at [[Kenilworth railway station|Kenilworth]] reopened on 30 April 2018.\n* The [[Chase Line|Walsall\u2013Hednesford line]] reopened to passengers in 1989, and was extended to [[Rugeley Town railway station|Rugeley]] in 1997. Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds.

cuts]]''' were a reduction of route network and restructuring of [[British Rail]] in the 1960s. Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] opened its new railway station in 2003, on the [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] that had closed to passengers in 1969.\n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023. Freight services ceased in 1981 (unrelated to Beeching) and resumed on part of the line in 2002.\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n* North of [[Sleaford railway station|Sleaford]], [[Ruskington railway station|Ruskington station]] reopened on 5 May 1975 and [[Metheringham railway station|Metheringham Station]] reopened on 6 October 1975.\n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009, with a direct train to London that terminates at Corby, with a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}. The [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line|line towards Kidderminster and Worcester]] was reopened to Snow Hill in 1995. \n* The line from [[Birmingham Snow Hill \u2013 Wolverhampton Low Level Line|Snow Hill to Wolverhampton]] reopened as the [[Midland Metro]] [[tram]] system.  Despite the successful and potential reopening of many rail routes as light-rail and metro lines, the concept is still under threat due to the varying popularity of these schemes with successive governments.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968\n* The line from [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line|Coventry to Nuneaton]] reopened to passengers in 1988. \n* The line from [[Coventry to Leamington line]] reopened in 1977 and the station at [[Kenilworth railway station|Kenilworth]] reopened on 30 April 2018.\n* The [[Chase Line|Walsall\u2013Hednesford line]] reopened to passengers in 1989, and was extended to [[Rugeley Town railway station|Rugeley]] in 1997. Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[South Staffordshire Line]] between Stourbridge and Walsall is set to reopen as a part of the Midland Metro expansion scheme. The line will be shared between trams and freight trains.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan, Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.

It was developed by the [[Interactive Software Federation of Europe]] (ISFE) and came into use in April 2003; it replaced many national age rating systems with a single European system. The PEGI system is now used in 39 countries and is based on a code of conduct, a set of rules to which every publisher using the PEGI system is contractually committed. PEGI self-regulation is composed by five age categories and eight content descriptors that advise the suitability and content of a game for a certain age range based on the games content. The age rating is not intended to indicate the difficulty of the game or the skill required to play it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/33 |title=PEGI Pan European Game Information \u2013 What do the labels mean? |publisher=Pegi.info |accessdate=29 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807040750/http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/33 |archive-date=7 August 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n== Age ratings ==\nPEGI has five age categories.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Rating\n! Description\n|-\n| [[File:PEGI 3.svg|60px]]\n| The content of games with a PEGI 3 rating is considered suitable for all age groups. The game should not contain any sounds or pictures that are likely to frighten young children. A very mild form of violence (in a comical context or a childlike setting) is acceptable. No bad language should be heard.<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| [[File:PEGI 7.svg|60px]]\n| Game content with scenes or sounds that can possibly be frightening to younger children should fall in this category. Very mild forms of violence (implied, non-detailed, or non-realistic violence) and profanity are acceptable for a game with a PEGI 7 rating.<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| [[File:PEGI 12.svg|60px]]\n| Video games that show violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters or non-realistic violence towards human-like characters would fall in this age category. Sexual innuendo or sexual posturing can be present, while any bad language in this category must be mild. Gambling as it is normally carried out in real life in casinos or gambling halls can also be present (e.g. card games that in real life would be played for money).<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| [[File:PEGI 16.svg|60px]]\n| This rating is applied once the depiction of violence (or sexual activity) reaches a stage that looks the same as would be expected in real life. The use of bad language in games with a PEGI 16 rating can be more extreme, while games of chance, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs can also be present.<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| [[File:PEGI 18.svg|60px]]\n| The adult classification is applied when the level of violence reaches a stage where it becomes a depiction of gross violence, apparently motiveless killing, or violence towards defenseless characters. The glamorization of the use of illegal drugs, explicit sexual activity and strong language should also fall into this age category.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean|title=What do the labels mean?|publisher=PEGI|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n|}\n\nThe current design was introduced at the end of 2009. Black and white icons were used until June 2009, when the colour-coded PEGI icons were announced, with green for 3 and 7, orange for 12 and 16, and red for 18. Plus signs were removed from the icons, and the background text changed from 'ISFE' from the old, black-and-white icons to 'PEGI' from the new, colour-coded PEGI icons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/pegi-unveils-new-ratings-symbols|date=17 June 2009|work=Edge|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|title=PEGI Unveils New Ratings Symbols|author=Tom Ivan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219192008/http://www.next-gen.biz/news/pegi-unveils-new-ratings-symbols|archivedate=19 December 2011}}</ref> That design was slightly altered at the end of 2009, by removing the watermark and locking the URL bar underneath the age rating icon.

If the applicant disagrees with the rating, they can ask for an explanation or make a complaint to the complaints board. Consumers may also make complaints to this board.\n\nAlthough PEGI was established by an industry body (ISFE) the ratings are given by a body independent of the industry and the whole system is overseen by a number of different Boards and Committees. There is the '''PEGI Council''', composed mainly by national representatives for PEGI, that recommends adjustments to the code in light of social, legal and technological developments. Members of the PEGI Council are recruited for their skill and experience from among parent/consumer body representatives, child psychologists, media specialists, civil servants, academics and legal advisers versed in the protection of minors in Europe.<ref name=\"pegi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/41/ |title=Website PEGI |publisher=Pegi.info |date= |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a '''Complaints Board''' with experts from various European countries. They deal with complaints related to breaches of requirements of the code of conduct or to age rating recommendations. Should a complaint be received from a consumer or publisher regarding a rating given to a game and no satisfactory settlement can be reached by the PEGI administrator through discussion, explanation or negotiation the complainant may formally request the Complaints Board to mediate. Three board members will then convene, hear the complaint and decide on a ruling. Publishers using the PEGI system are bound by the decision of the Complaints Board. Consequently, they are obliged to carry out any corrective actions required and, in cases of non-compliance, are subject to sanctions as laid out by the code.\n\n== Global cooperation in IARC ==\nIn 2013, PEGI co-founded the [[International Age Rating Coalition]] with [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]] and the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]]. IARC aims to streamline the rating of digitally distributed games and apps by providing a single online system that produces age ratings for all participating regions. By filling out one questionnaire, a publisher instantaneously receives ratings from PEGI, [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]], [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]], [[Australian Classification Board|ACB]] and others.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/09/01/getting-digitally-distributed-games-classified-in-australia-to-be-cost-free|title=Getting Digitally-Distributed Games Classified in Australia to Be Cost-Free - IGN|publisher=au.ign.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"dealspwn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dealspwn.com/international-age-ratings-system-160904|title=New International Age Ratings System Launching Worldwide Next Year &#124; Video Game Deals &amp; UK News &#124; Dealspwn.com|publisher=dealspwn.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== PEGI committees ==\nThere are a number of committees to ensure the system keeps functioning properly.\n\n* '''Experts Group''': The PEGI Experts Group is made up of academics working in the fields of psychology and sociology, and representatives from NICAM, VSC, and the games industry. It works on adapting and modifying the PEGI questionnaire and the underlying criteria to take account of technological and content developments and recommendations made by the PEGI Council or circumstances brought to light by the complaints procedure.\n* '''Legal Committee''': Since PEGI is a voluntary system it runs in conjunction with, and is subordinate to, existing national laws, whether they prohibit certain content or establish mandatory rating systems. The Legal Committee's role is to advise PEGI s.a. of any changes to national legislation within participating countries that could affect the voluntary age rating system.\n* '''Enforcement Committee''': The Enforcement Committee is charged with implementing the recommendations of the PEGI Council and, more generally, of ensuring the enforcement of the provisions of the PEGI Code of Conduct, including conclusion of the Complaints Board.\n\n== PEGI Online ==\nIn 2007, the PEGI Online division of PEGI was formed as an addition to the PEGI system for online games. Goals include giving young people in Europe improved protection against unsuitable online gaming content and educating parents on how to ensure safe online play.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pegi.info/page/pegi-online |title=PEGI Online Website |publisher=Pegionline.info |date= |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> This project is supported directly by the European Commission:\n\n{{Quote|PEGI On-line, which was launched in June 2007 and co-funded by the Safer Internet Programme, is the logical development of the PEGI system, designed to better protect young people against unsuitable gaming content and to help parents to understand the risks and potential for harm within this environment.<ref>Communication from the commission of the European parliament, the council, the European economic and social committee and the committee of the regions, on the protection of consumers, in particular minors, in respect of the use of video games, Brussels, 2008, p.3.</ref>}}\n\nPEGI Online is based on four principles:\n* The PEGI Online Safety Code and Framework Contract which is signed by all participants\n* The PEGI Online Logo which will be displayed by holders of a licence\n* The website for applicants and for the general public\n* An independent administration, advice, and dispute settlement process\n\nThe licence to display the PEGI Online Logo is granted by the PEGI Online Administrator to any online gameplay service provider that meets the requirements set out in the PEGI Online Safety Code (POSC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pegi.info/page/pegi-online-safety-code |title=PEGI Online Safety Code |publisher=Pegionline.info }}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\nPEGI is the standard age rating system for video games in 38 European countries and Israel, but products with PEGI labels can be found across the globe alongside other rating systems as a result of import for linguistic reasons (e.g.: English versions in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, Spanish or Portuguese versions in Latin America). The official status of PEGI ratings varies from country to country, depending on the way national legislation deals with age classification and the protection of minors. In some countries, PEGI is the [[de facto]] standard without specific regulation, other countries have officially acknowledged PEGI as the sole system for age ratings, while yet another number of countries have incorporated the PEGI rating system into laws governing the age classification of media, making the labels enforceable in retail.\n\nAsterisks denote [[European Union]] membership.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 155px;\" | Country\n!

It was developed by the [[Interactive Software Federation of Europe]] (ISFE) and came into use in April 2003; it replaced many national age rating systems with a single European system. The PEGI system is now used in 39 countries and is based on a code of conduct, a set of rules to which every publisher using the PEGI system is contractually committed. PEGI self-regulation is composed by five age categories and eight content descriptors that advise the suitability and content of a game for a certain age range based on the games content. The age rating is not intended to indicate the difficulty of the game or the skill required to play it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/33 |title=PEGI Pan European Game Information \u2013 What do the labels mean? |publisher=Pegi.info |accessdate=29 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807040750/http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/33 |archive-date=7 August 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n== Age ratings ==\nPEGI has five age categories.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

No bad language should be heard.<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| [[File:PEGI 7.svg|60px]]\n| Game content with scenes or sounds that can possibly be frightening to younger children should fall in this category.

Sexual innuendo or sexual posturing can be present, while any bad language in this category must be mild. Gambling as it is normally carried out in real life in casinos or gambling halls can also be present (e.g. card games that in real life would be played for money).<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| [[File:PEGI 16.svg|60px]]\n| This rating is applied once the depiction of violence (or sexual activity) reaches a stage that looks the same as would be expected in real life. The use of bad language in games with a PEGI 16 rating can be more extreme, while games of chance, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, or illegal drugs can also be present.<ref name=\":0\" />\n|-\n| [[File:PEGI 18.svg|60px]]\n| The adult classification is applied when the level of violence reaches a stage where it becomes a depiction of gross violence, apparently motiveless killing, or violence towards defenseless characters. The glamorization of the use of illegal drugs, explicit sexual activity and strong language should also fall into this age category.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean|title=What do the labels mean?|publisher=PEGI|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n|}\n\nThe current design was introduced at the end of 2009.

If the applicant disagrees with the rating, they can ask for an explanation or make a complaint to the complaints board. Consumers may also make complaints to this board.\n\nAlthough PEGI was established by an industry body (ISFE) the ratings are given by a body independent of the industry and the whole system is overseen by a number of different Boards and Committees. There is the '''PEGI Council''', composed mainly by national representatives for PEGI, that recommends adjustments to the code in light of social, legal and technological developments. Members of the PEGI Council are recruited for their skill and experience from among parent/consumer body representatives, child psychologists, media specialists, civil servants, academics and legal advisers versed in the protection of minors in Europe.<ref name=\"pegi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pegi.info/en/index/id/41/ |title=Website PEGI |publisher=Pegi.info |date= |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a '''Complaints Board''' with experts from various European countries. They deal with complaints related to breaches of requirements of the code of conduct or to age rating recommendations. Should a complaint be received from a consumer or publisher regarding a rating given to a game and no satisfactory settlement can be reached by the PEGI administrator through discussion, explanation or negotiation the complainant may formally request the Complaints Board to mediate. Three board members will then convene, hear the complaint and decide on a ruling. Publishers using the PEGI system are bound by the decision of the Complaints Board. Consequently, they are obliged to carry out any corrective actions required and, in cases of non-compliance, are subject to sanctions as laid out by the code.\n\n== Global cooperation in IARC ==\nIn 2013, PEGI co-founded the [[International Age Rating Coalition]] with [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]] and the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]]. IARC aims to streamline the rating of digitally distributed games and apps by providing a single online system that produces age ratings for all participating regions. By filling out one questionnaire, a publisher instantaneously receives ratings from PEGI, [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]], [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]], [[Australian Classification Board|ACB]] and others.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/09/01/getting-digitally-distributed-games-classified-in-australia-to-be-cost-free|title=Getting Digitally-Distributed Games Classified in Australia to Be Cost-Free - IGN|publisher=au.ign.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"dealspwn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dealspwn.com/international-age-ratings-system-160904|title=New International Age Ratings System Launching Worldwide Next Year &#124; Video Game Deals &amp; UK News &#124; Dealspwn.com|publisher=dealspwn.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== PEGI committees ==\nThere are a number of committees to ensure the system keeps functioning properly.\n\n* '''Experts Group''': The PEGI Experts Group is made up of academics working in the fields of psychology and sociology, and representatives from NICAM, VSC, and the games industry. It works on adapting and modifying the PEGI questionnaire and the underlying criteria to take account of technological and content developments and recommendations made by the PEGI Council or circumstances brought to light by the complaints procedure.\n* '''Legal Committee''': Since PEGI is a voluntary system it runs in conjunction with, and is subordinate to, existing national laws, whether they prohibit certain content or establish mandatory rating systems. The Legal Committee's role is to advise PEGI s.a. of any changes to national legislation within participating countries that could affect the voluntary age rating system.\n* '''Enforcement Committee''': The Enforcement Committee is charged with implementing the recommendations of the PEGI Council and, more generally, of ensuring the enforcement of the provisions of the PEGI Code of Conduct, including conclusion of the Complaints Board.\n\n== PEGI Online ==\nIn 2007, the PEGI Online division of PEGI was formed as an addition to the PEGI system for online games. Goals include giving young people in Europe improved protection against unsuitable online gaming content and educating parents on how to ensure safe online play.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pegi.info/page/pegi-online |title=PEGI Online Website |publisher=Pegionline.info |date= |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> This project is supported directly by the European Commission:\n\n{{Quote|PEGI On-line, which was launched in June 2007 and co-funded by the Safer Internet Programme, is the logical development of the PEGI system, designed to better protect young people against unsuitable gaming content and to help parents to understand the risks and potential for harm within this environment.<ref>Communication from the commission of the European parliament, the council, the European economic and social committee and the committee of the regions, on the protection of consumers, in particular minors, in respect of the use of video games, Brussels, 2008, p.3.</ref>}}\n\nPEGI Online is based on four principles:\n* The PEGI Online Safety Code and Framework Contract which is signed by all participants\n* The PEGI Online Logo which will be displayed by holders of a licence\n* The website for applicants and for the general public\n* An independent administration, advice, and dispute settlement process\n\nThe licence to display the PEGI Online Logo is granted by the PEGI Online Administrator to any online gameplay service provider that meets the requirements set out in the PEGI Online Safety Code (POSC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pegi.info/page/pegi-online-safety-code |title=PEGI Online Safety Code |publisher=Pegionline.info }}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\nPEGI is the standard age rating system for video games in 38 European countries and Israel, but products with PEGI labels can be found across the globe alongside other rating systems as a result of import for linguistic reasons (e.g.: English versions in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, Spanish or Portuguese versions in Latin America). The official status of PEGI ratings varies from country to country, depending on the way national legislation deals with age classification and the protection of minors. In some countries, PEGI is the [[de facto]] standard without specific regulation, other countries have officially acknowledged PEGI as the sole system for age ratings, while yet another number of countries have incorporated the PEGI rating system into laws governing the age classification of media, making the labels enforceable in retail.\n\nAsterisks denote [[European Union]] membership.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 155px;\" | Country\n!

Carolyn's mother is [[Carrie Lucas]], for whom Watley sang backing vocals.  Shalamar reached the grand finale of ''Hit Me, Baby, One More Time'' in May 2005, ultimately losing out to [[Shakin' Stevens]].

Following her husband's death in 1816, she remarried in 1818.<ref name=Rossel /> Andersen was sent to a local school for poor children where he received a basic education and had to support himself, working as an [[apprentice]] to a weaver and, later, to a tailor. At fourteen, he moved to [[Copenhagen]] to seek employment as an actor. Having an excellent soprano voice, he was accepted into the [[Royal Danish Theatre]], but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet. Taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.\n\n[[File:H.C. Andersens Barndomshjemmet2.JPG|thumb|left|Andersen's childhood home in Odense]]\nJonas Collin, director of the Royal Danish Theatre, held great affection for Andersen and sent him to a [[grammar school]] in [[Slagelse]], persuading [[Frederick VI of Denmark|King Frederick VI]] to pay part of the youth's education.<ref>[http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/cultural/hans-christian-andersen-281.html Hans Christian Andersen - Childhood and Education].

At one school, he lived at his schoolmaster's home, where he was abused, being told that it was \"to improve his character\".

The story, written in the 1820s, was about a candle that did not feel appreciated. It was written while Andersen was still in school and dedicated to a benefactor in whose family's possession it remained until it turned up among other family papers in a local archive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Local historian finds Hans Christian Andersen's first fairy tale|url=http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/ECE1841147/local-historian-finds-hans-christian-andersens-first-fairy-tale/|publisher=Politiken.dk|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1829, Andersen enjoyed considerable success with the short story \"A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager\". Its protagonist meets characters ranging from [[Saint Peter]] to a talking cat. Andersen followed this success with a theatrical piece, ''Love on St. Nicholas Church Tower'', and a short volume of poems. Although he made little progress writing and publishing immediately thereafter, in 1833 he received a small travel grant from the king, thus enabling him to set out on the first of many journeys through Europe. At [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], near [[Le Locle]], Switzerland, Andersen wrote the story \"Agnete and the Merman\". He spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of [[Sestri Levante]] the same year, inspiring the title of \"The Bay of Fables\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andersenfestival.it |title=Andersen Festival, Sestri Levante|publisher=Andersen Festival|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> In October 1834, he arrived in [[Rome]].

Initially his original fairy tales were not met with recognition, due partly to the difficulty of translating them. In 1835, Andersen published the first two installments of his ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.|Fairy Tales]]'' ({{lang-da|Eventyr}}; lit. \"fantastic tales\"). More stories, completing the first volume, were published in 1837. The collection comprises nine tales, including \"[[The Tinderbox]]\", \"[[The Princess and the Pea]]\", \"[[Thumbelina]]\", \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" and \"[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]\". The quality of these stories was not immediately recognized, and they sold poorly. At the same time, Andersen enjoyed more success with two novels, ''O.T.'' (1836) and ''Only a Fiddler'' (1837);<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/onlyfiddlerdanis00andeiala#page/n3/mode/2up ''Only a Fiddler''] from Archive.org</ref> the latter work was reviewed by a young [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://andersen.sdu.dk/forskning/anmeldelser/kritik_e.html|title=Criticism of Hans Christian Andersen|website=andersen.sdu.dk|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Much of his work was influenced by the Bible as when he was growing up Christianity was very important in the Danish culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/hans-christian-andersens-fairy-tales/0/steps/14184|title=Biblical themes in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales - Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy Tales - Hans Christian Andersen Centre|last=FutureLearn|website=FutureLearn|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-07}}</ref>\n\n[[File:C.A. Jensen 1836 - HC Andersen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Painting of Andersen, 1836, by [[Christian Albrecht Jensen]]]]\nAfter a visit to [[Sweden]] in 1837, Andersen became inspired by [[Scandinavism]] and committed himself to writing a poem that would convey the relatedness of [[Swedes]], [[Danes]] and [[Norwegians]].<ref name=\"Scandinavian\">{{cite web|work=Hans Christian Andersen and Music|url=http://www.kb.dk/elib/noder/hcamusik/skandinav/index_en.htm|title=I am a Scandinavian|accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> In July 1839, during a visit to the island of [[Funen]],  Andersen wrote the text of his poem ''Jeg er en Skandinav'' (\"I am a Scandinavian\")<ref name=\"Scandinavian\"/> to capture \"the beauty of the Nordic spirit, the way the three sister nations have gradually grown together\" as part of a Scandinavian national anthem.<ref name=\"Scandinavian\"/> Composer [[Otto Lindblad]] set the poem to music, and the composition was published in January 1840. Its popularity peaked in 1845, after which it was seldom sung.<ref name=\"Scandinavian\"/>\n\nAndersen returned to the fairy tale genre in 1838 with another collection, ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children (1838)|Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. First Booklet]]'' ({{lang|da|Eventyr, fortalte for B\u00f8rn. Ny Samling}}), which consists of \"The Daisy\", \"[[The Steadfast Tin Soldier]]\", and \"[[The Wild Swans]]\".  He went on to publish \"New Fairy Tales (1844). First Volume. First Collection\", which contained \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\" and \"[[The Ugly Duckling]]\".  After that came \"New Fairy Tales (1845). First Volume. Second Collection\" in which was found \"[[The Snow Queen]]\".  \"[[The Little Match Girl]]\" appeared in December 1845 in the \"Dansk Folkekalender (1846)\" and also in \"New Fairy Tales (1848). Second Volume. Second Collection\".\n\n1845 saw a breakthrough for Andersen with the publication of four translations of his fairy tales. \"The Little Mermaid\" appeared in the periodical ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]'', followed by a second volume, ''Wonderful Stories for Children''. Two other volumes enthusiastically received were ''A Danish Story Book'' and ''Danish Fairy Tales and Legends''. A review that appeared in the London journal ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athen\u00e6um]]'' (February 1846) said of ''Wonderful Stories'', \"This is a book full of life and fancy; a book for grandfathers no less than grandchildren, not a word of which will be skipped by those who have it once in hand.\"<ref name=\"Wullschl\u00e4ger 2002\"/>\n\nAndersen would continue to write fairy tales and published them in installments until 1872.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/who-was-hans-christian-andersen|title=Who Was Hans Christian Andersen?|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Travelogues===\nIn 1851, he published to wide acclaim ''In Sweden'', a volume of travel sketches. A keen traveller, Andersen published several other long [[travel literature|travelogues]]: ''Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc. etc. in the Summer of 1831'', ''A Poet's Bazaar'', ''In Spain'' and ''A Visit to Portugal in 1866''. (The last describes his visit with his [[Portugal|Portuguese]] friends Jorge and Jose O'Neill, who were his fellows in the mid-1820s while living in Copenhagen.) In his travelogues, Andersen took heed of some of the contemporary conventions about travel writing, but always developed the genre to suit his own purposes. Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of the sights he saw with more philosophical passages on topics such as being an author, immortality, and the nature of fiction in the literary travel report. Some of the travelogues, such as ''In Sweden'', even contain fairy-tales.\n\nIn the 1840s, Andersen's attention returned to the stage, but with little success. He had better fortune with the publication of the ''Picture-Book without Pictures'' (1840). A second series of fairy tales began in 1838 and a third in 1845. Andersen was now celebrated throughout Europe, although his native [[Denmark]] still showed some resistance to his pretensions.\n\nBetween 1845 and 1864, H. C. Andersen lived at [[Nyhavn 67]], Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque now stands.<ref name=\"Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen\">{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725103354/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 July 2008 |title=Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen |publisher=Visitcopenhagen.com |accessdate=2 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Kierkegaard===\nIn \u2018Andersen as a Novelist\u2019, Kierkegaard remarks that Andersen is characterized as, \u201c...a possibility of a personality, wrapped up in such a web of arbitrary moods and moving through an elegiac duo-decimal scale [i.e., a chromatic scale. Proceeding by semitones, and therefore including sharps as well as flats, such a scale is associated more with lament or elegy than is an ordinary diatonic scale] of almost echoless, dying tones just as easily roused as subdued, who, in order to become a personality, needs a strong life-development.\u201d\n\n===Meetings with Dickens===\nIn June 1847, Andersen paid his first visit to England and enjoyed a triumphal social success during the summer. The [[Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington|Countess of Blessington]] invited him to her parties where intellectual people could meet, and it was at one such party that he met [[Charles Dickens]] for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda, about which Andersen wrote in his diary: \"We had come to the veranda, I was so happy to see and speak to England's now-living writer whom I love the most.\"<ref name=\"dickens\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=3704 |title=H.C.

In the [[Victorian era]] there was a growing sympathy for children and an idealisation of the innocence of childhood.\n\nTen years later, Andersen visited England again, primarily to meet Dickens. He extended a brief visit to Dickens' home at [[Gads Hill Place]] into a five-week stay, to the distress of Dickens' family. After Andersen was told to leave, Dickens gradually stopped all correspondence between them, to the great disappointment and confusion of Andersen, who had quite enjoyed the visit and never understood why his letters went unanswered.<ref name=\"dickens\"/>\n\n===Love life===\n[[File:Hans Christian Andersen 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz Hanfstaengl|Hanfstaengl]] portrait of Andersen dated July 1860]]\nIn Andersen's early life, his private journal records his [[Celibacy|refusal to have sexual relations]].<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Lepage | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1689053,00.html | title = Bedtime stories | newspaper = The Guardian | date =18 January 2006| accessdate = 19 July 2006 }}</ref><ref name=Garfield>Recorded using \"special Greek symbols\".{{cite web|url=http://www.patriciagarfield.com/publications/anderson_2004IASD.pdf |title=The Dreams of Hans Christian Andersen |date=21 June 2004 |accessdate=20 July 2006 |last=Garfield |first=Patricia |page=29 }}</ref>\n\nAndersen often fell in love with unattainable women, and many of his stories are interpreted as references.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hastings|first=Waller|title=Hans Christian Andersen|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|publisher=Northern State University|accessdate=15 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123053333/http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|archivedate=23 November 2007|date=4 April 2003}}</ref>  At one point, he wrote in his diary: \"Almighty God, thee only have I; thou steerest my fate, I must give myself up to thee!

A small pouch containing a long letter from Voigt was found on Andersen's chest when he died, several decades after he first fell in love with her, and after he presumably fell in love with others. Other disappointments in love included Sophie \u00d8rsted, the daughter of the physicist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]], and Louise Collin, the youngest daughter of his benefactor Jonas Collin. One of his stories, \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\", was written as an expression of his passion for [[Jenny Lind]] and became the inspiration for her nickname, the \"Swedish Nightingale\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://altomhistorie.dk/artikler/h-c-andersen-og-jenny-lind/|title=H.C.

When Lind was boarding a train to go to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal.

At fourteen, he moved to [[Copenhagen]] to seek employment as an actor. Having an excellent soprano voice, he was accepted into the [[Royal Danish Theatre]], but his voice soon changed. A colleague at the theatre told him that he considered Andersen a poet. Taking the suggestion seriously, Andersen began to focus on writing.\n\n[[File:H.C. Andersens Barndomshjemmet2.JPG|thumb|left|Andersen's childhood home in Odense]]\nJonas Collin, director of the Royal Danish Theatre, held great affection for Andersen and sent him to a [[grammar school]] in [[Slagelse]], persuading [[Frederick VI of Denmark|King Frederick VI]] to pay part of the youth's education.<ref>[http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/cultural/hans-christian-andersen-281.html Hans Christian Andersen - Childhood and Education].

Its protagonist meets characters ranging from [[Saint Peter]] to a talking cat. Andersen followed this success with a theatrical piece, ''Love on St. Nicholas Church Tower'', and a short volume of poems. Although he made little progress writing and publishing immediately thereafter, in 1833 he received a small travel grant from the king, thus enabling him to set out on the first of many journeys through Europe. At [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], near [[Le Locle]], Switzerland, Andersen wrote the story \"Agnete and the Merman\". He spent an evening in the Italian seaside village of [[Sestri Levante]] the same year, inspiring the title of \"The Bay of Fables\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andersenfestival.it |title=Andersen Festival, Sestri Levante|publisher=Andersen Festival|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> In October 1834, he arrived in [[Rome]].

Initially his original fairy tales were not met with recognition, due partly to the difficulty of translating them. In 1835, Andersen published the first two installments of his ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.|Fairy Tales]]'' ({{lang-da|Eventyr}}; lit. \"fantastic tales\"). More stories, completing the first volume, were published in 1837. The collection comprises nine tales, including \"[[The Tinderbox]]\", \"[[The Princess and the Pea]]\", \"[[Thumbelina]]\", \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" and \"[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]\". The quality of these stories was not immediately recognized, and they sold poorly. At the same time, Andersen enjoyed more success with two novels, ''O.T.''

Its popularity peaked in 1845, after which it was seldom sung.<ref name=\"Scandinavian\"/>\n\nAndersen returned to the fairy tale genre in 1838 with another collection, ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children (1838)|Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. First Booklet]]'' ({{lang|da|Eventyr, fortalte for B\u00f8rn. Ny Samling}}), which consists of \"The Daisy\", \"[[The Steadfast Tin Soldier]]\", and \"[[The Wild Swans]]\".  He went on to publish \"New Fairy Tales (1844). First Volume. First Collection\", which contained \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\" and \"[[The Ugly Duckling]]\".  After that came \"New Fairy Tales (1845). First Volume. Second Collection\" in which was found \"[[The Snow Queen]]\".  \"[[The Little Match Girl]]\" appeared in December 1845 in the \"Dansk Folkekalender (1846)\" and also in \"New Fairy Tales (1848). Second Volume. Second Collection\".\n\n1845 saw a breakthrough for Andersen with the publication of four translations of his fairy tales. \"The Little Mermaid\" appeared in the periodical ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]'', followed by a second volume, ''Wonderful Stories for Children''. Two other volumes enthusiastically received were ''A Danish Story Book'' and ''Danish Fairy Tales and Legends''. A review that appeared in the London journal ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athen\u00e6um]]'' (February 1846) said of ''Wonderful Stories'', \"This is a book full of life and fancy; a book for grandfathers no less than grandchildren, not a word of which will be skipped by those who have it once in hand.\"<ref name=\"Wullschl\u00e4ger 2002\"/>\n\nAndersen would continue to write fairy tales and published them in installments until 1872.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/who-was-hans-christian-andersen|title=Who Was Hans Christian Andersen?|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Travelogues===\nIn 1851, he published to wide acclaim ''In Sweden'', a volume of travel sketches. A keen traveller, Andersen published several other long [[travel literature|travelogues]]: ''Shadow Pictures of a Journey to the Harz, Swiss Saxony, etc. etc. in the Summer of 1831'', ''A Poet's Bazaar'', ''In Spain'' and ''A Visit to Portugal in 1866''. (The last describes his visit with his [[Portugal|Portuguese]] friends Jorge and Jose O'Neill, who were his fellows in the mid-1820s while living in Copenhagen.) In his travelogues, Andersen took heed of some of the contemporary conventions about travel writing, but always developed the genre to suit his own purposes. Each of his travelogues combines documentary and descriptive accounts of the sights he saw with more philosophical passages on topics such as being an author, immortality, and the nature of fiction in the literary travel report. Some of the travelogues, such as ''In Sweden'', even contain fairy-tales.\n\nIn the 1840s, Andersen's attention returned to the stage, but with little success. He had better fortune with the publication of the ''Picture-Book without Pictures'' (1840). A second series of fairy tales began in 1838 and a third in 1845. Andersen was now celebrated throughout Europe, although his native [[Denmark]] still showed some resistance to his pretensions.\n\nBetween 1845 and 1864, H. C. Andersen lived at [[Nyhavn 67]], Copenhagen, where a memorial plaque now stands.<ref name=\"Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen\">{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725103354/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/content/press/press_information/hans_christian_andersen/in_the_footsteps_of_andersen |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 July 2008 |title=Official Tourism Site of Copenhagen |publisher=Visitcopenhagen.com |accessdate=2 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Kierkegaard===\nIn \u2018Andersen as a Novelist\u2019, Kierkegaard remarks that Andersen is characterized as, \u201c...a possibility of a personality, wrapped up in such a web of arbitrary moods and moving through an elegiac duo-decimal scale [i.e., a chromatic scale. Proceeding by semitones, and therefore including sharps as well as flats, such a scale is associated more with lament or elegy than is an ordinary diatonic scale] of almost echoless, dying tones just as easily roused as subdued, who, in order to become a personality, needs a strong life-development.\u201d\n\n===Meetings with Dickens===\nIn June 1847, Andersen paid his first visit to England and enjoyed a triumphal social success during the summer. The [[Marguerite Gardiner, Countess of Blessington|Countess of Blessington]] invited him to her parties where intellectual people could meet, and it was at one such party that he met [[Charles Dickens]] for the first time. They shook hands and walked to the veranda, about which Andersen wrote in his diary: \"We had come to the veranda, I was so happy to see and speak to England's now-living writer whom I love the most.\"<ref name=\"dickens\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hcandersen-homepage.dk/?page_id=3704 |title=H.C.

In the [[Victorian era]] there was a growing sympathy for children and an idealisation of the innocence of childhood.\n\nTen years later, Andersen visited England again, primarily to meet Dickens. He extended a brief visit to Dickens' home at [[Gads Hill Place]] into a five-week stay, to the distress of Dickens' family. After Andersen was told to leave, Dickens gradually stopped all correspondence between them, to the great disappointment and confusion of Andersen, who had quite enjoyed the visit and never understood why his letters went unanswered.<ref name=\"dickens\"/>\n\n===Love life===\n[[File:Hans Christian Andersen 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz Hanfstaengl|Hanfstaengl]] portrait of Andersen dated July 1860]]\nIn Andersen's early life, his private journal records his [[Celibacy|refusal to have sexual relations]].<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Lepage | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/classics/story/0,6000,1689053,00.html | title = Bedtime stories | newspaper = The Guardian | date =18 January 2006| accessdate = 19 July 2006 }}</ref><ref name=Garfield>Recorded using \"special Greek symbols\".{{cite web|url=http://www.patriciagarfield.com/publications/anderson_2004IASD.pdf |title=The Dreams of Hans Christian Andersen |date=21 June 2004 |accessdate=20 July 2006 |last=Garfield |first=Patricia |page=29 }}</ref>\n\nAndersen often fell in love with unattainable women, and many of his stories are interpreted as references.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hastings|first=Waller|title=Hans Christian Andersen|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|publisher=Northern State University|accessdate=15 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123053333/http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/hcandersen.htm|archivedate=23 November 2007|date=4 April 2003}}</ref>  At one point, he wrote in his diary: \"Almighty God, thee only have I; thou steerest my fate, I must give myself up to thee!

A small pouch containing a long letter from Voigt was found on Andersen's chest when he died, several decades after he first fell in love with her, and after he presumably fell in love with others. Other disappointments in love included Sophie \u00d8rsted, the daughter of the physicist [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]], and Louise Collin, the youngest daughter of his benefactor Jonas Collin. One of his stories, \"[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]\", was written as an expression of his passion for [[Jenny Lind]] and became the inspiration for her nickname, the \"Swedish Nightingale\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://altomhistorie.dk/artikler/h-c-andersen-og-jenny-lind/|title=H.C.

When Lind was boarding a train to go to an opera concert, Andersen gave Lind a letter of proposal.
