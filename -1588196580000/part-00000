Your change WILL be reverted if you change it without discussion. ---> written and directed by [[Wes Anderson]], which explores tragedy, war, fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty. [[Ralph Fiennes]] leads a seventeen-actor [[ensemble cast]] as Monsieur Gustave H, famed [[concierge]] of a mountainside resort in the Republic of Zubrowka. When Gustave is framed for the murder of a wealthy [[dowager]] ([[Tilda Swinton]]), he and his recently befriended prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zero ([[Tony Revolori]]) embark on a quest for fortune and a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting against the backdrop of encroaching pandemonium. Anderson's American Empirical Pictures produced the film in association with [[Studio Babelsberg]] and [[Indian Paintbrush (production company)|Indian Paintbrush]]'s [[Scott Rudin]] and [[Steven Rales]], and [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] handled its commercial distribution. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' was financed by Indian Paintbrush and a German government-funded rebate program.\n\nAnderson and longtime collaborator [[Hugo Guinness]] conceived ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as a fragmented tale following a character inspired by a mutual friend. They initially struggled to develop their idea further, but the experience touring Europe and researching the literature of Austrian novelist [[Stefan Zweig]] shaped their ambitions for the film. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' draws visually from Europe-set mid-century Hollywood films and the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[photocrom]] print collection of alpine resorts. [[Principal photography]] took place in eastern [[Germany]] over a ten-week period from January to March 2013. French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]] crafted the symphonic, [[Russian folk music|Russian folk]]-inspired score, which expanded on his early work with Anderson.\n\n''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' premiered in competition at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 6, 2014. The French theatrical release preceded the film's global rollout on February 26, followed by releases in Germany, North America and the United Kingdom on March 6\u20137. It received critical acclaim from critics and it was well received by the media, though the film's approach to the subject matter, fragmented storytelling, and characterization drew occasional criticism. [[BBC]] chose ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|one of the greatest films of the twenty-first century]]. The film earned $172.9&nbsp;million in box office revenue worldwide, making it Anderson's highest grossing film to date. It led the [[87th Academy Awards]] season with nine nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning four, and earned several other honors chiefly for writing and technical achievement.\n\n== Plot ==\nA young girl visits the shrine of a renowned writer, known simply as \"Author\", carrying a copy of his most-cherished novel: ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''. The author begins narrating as the film explores his history, prefacing with a 1985 excerpt reading before flashing back to his 1968 stay at the once-grand, now-drab hotel. There he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who invites him to dinner to hear his [[rags to riches]] story.\n\nIn 1932, Zero is the newly-hired lobby boy at the prestigious Grand Budapest Hotel. Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's fastidious concierge, seduces old, wealthy clients\u2014among them the 84-year-old [[dowager]] Madame D., with whom he has had a nearly-two-decade affair.\n\nShortly after her last visit, Gustave learns from Zero that Madame has mysteriously died. He and Zero visit Schloss Lutz, her estate, to pay their respects and encounter her surviving relatives hearing the reading of her will by her attorney, Kovacs. Kovacs announces a recent [[codicil (will)|codicil]] to the will which bequeathes ''[[Boy with Apple]]'', a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting, to Gustave. Madame's son, Dmitri, is outraged and demands Gustave's arrest. Gustave and Zero leave, absconding with the painting for safekeeping.\n\nAt the Grand Budapest, Gustave is arrested for Madame's murder. He befriends a gang during his imprisonment, and the men plot their escape. Gustave has Zero place digging tools inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice baker at Mendl's and Zero's girlfriend. Gustave and the others dig their way out and disperse. When they are reunited, Zero and Gustave set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges: the Society of the Crossed Keys. They learn that Madame had a missing second will which would only take effect if she was murdered.\n\nGustave, Zero, and Agatha arrive back at the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a military headquarters. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve ''Boy with Apple'' to sell; as she tries to leave, Dmitri enters the hotel and spots her with the painting. Gustave and Zero rush to save Agatha from harm as she escapes from Dmitri. He opens fire on them, initiating an intense (but confusing) shootout with Zubrowkan troops. Agatha's attempt to escape leaves her and Zero hanging from a balcony before they fall, safely, into a van of pastries.\n\nMadame's second will, with Gustave the beneficiary of her fortune, is found attached to the back of ''Boy with Apple''; he succeeds her as owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, and becomes one of the wealthiest men in Zubrowka. While traveling by train, he, Zero, and Agatha encounter soldiers who destroy Zero's refugee documents. Gustave tries to fend off the soldiers, and is later shot dead. Zero, Gustave's sole heir, inherits his fortune; he retains the now-decrepit Grand Budapest in memory of Agatha, who died of illness with their infant son. The experiences are incorporated into the author's celebrated book, and the film ends with the young girl reading ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' next to his memorial.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as M.

He and the producers referred to the work of [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and other directors of the period to acclimate to the compositions produced from said format.<ref name=asc /> Filmmakers formatted modern scenes in standard 1.85:1 ratio, and the 1968 scenes were captured in widescreen 2.40:1 ratio with [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]]'s Technovision series of [[zoom lens|zoom]] and [[prime lens|prime anamorphic lenses]]. The Cooke lenses produced a soft, but diffuse composition, one that lacked the sharpness of [[Panavision]] lenses.<ref name=asc />\n\nYeoman lit interior shots with tungsten incandescent fixtures and [[DMX512|DMX]]-dimmer-controlled lighting. The crew made the Warenhaus ceiling from stretched [[muslin]] rigged with twenty 4K [[hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp|HMI]] lamps, an arrangement wherein the reflected light penetrated the [[skylight]], accentuating the set's daylighting.

As Look Effects opened their Stuttgart headquarters after ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' filming wrapped, Sanchez was only able to reference his prior experience with Anderson, and the California-based artist became homesick working his first international assignment.<ref name=cgs /> Only four artists from the newly-assembled team had the expertise working on a multi-million dollar studio set, but their eagerness to master the nuance of said task resulted in constructive problem solving and camaraderie.<ref name=cgs />\n\nCreation of the effects was daunting because of their technical demands. The filmmakers camouflaged some of the [[stop motion animation|stop-motion]] and matte effects in the forest set chase scene to convey the desired intensity, and enhancing the snowscape with particle effects posed another challenge.<ref name=cgs /> Sanchez cites the observatory and hotel shots as work that best demonstrate his special effects team's ingenuity. To achieve the aging brutalist design of the 1968 Grand Budapest, they generated computer models supplemented with detailed lighting, matte effects and shadowy expanses.<ref name=cgs /> The crew used a similar technique in developing digital shots of the observatory; unlike the hotel, however, the observatory's base miniature was presented in pieces.

Your change WILL be reverted if you change it without discussion. ---> written and directed by [[Wes Anderson]], which explores tragedy, war, fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty. [[Ralph Fiennes]] leads a seventeen-actor [[ensemble cast]] as Monsieur Gustave H, famed [[concierge]] of a mountainside resort in the Republic of Zubrowka. When Gustave is framed for the murder of a wealthy [[dowager]] ([[Tilda Swinton]]), he and his recently befriended prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zero ([[Tony Revolori]]) embark on a quest for fortune and a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting against the backdrop of encroaching pandemonium. Anderson's American Empirical Pictures produced the film in association with [[Studio Babelsberg]] and [[Indian Paintbrush (production company)|Indian Paintbrush]]'s [[Scott Rudin]] and [[Steven Rales]], and [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] handled its commercial distribution. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' was financed by Indian Paintbrush and a German government-funded rebate program.\n\nAnderson and longtime collaborator [[Hugo Guinness]] conceived ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as a fragmented tale following a character inspired by a mutual friend. They initially struggled to develop their idea further, but the experience touring Europe and researching the literature of Austrian novelist [[Stefan Zweig]] shaped their ambitions for the film. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' draws visually from Europe-set mid-century Hollywood films and the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[photocrom]] print collection of alpine resorts. [[Principal photography]] took place in eastern [[Germany]] over a ten-week period from January to March 2013. French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]] crafted the symphonic, [[Russian folk music|Russian folk]]-inspired score, which expanded on his early work with Anderson.\n\n''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' premiered in competition at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 6, 2014. The French theatrical release preceded the film's global rollout on February 26, followed by releases in Germany, North America and the United Kingdom on March 6\u20137. It received critical acclaim from critics and it was well received by the media, though the film's approach to the subject matter, fragmented storytelling, and characterization drew occasional criticism. [[BBC]] chose ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|one of the greatest films of the twenty-first century]]. The film earned $172.9&nbsp;million in box office revenue worldwide, making it Anderson's highest grossing film to date. It led the [[87th Academy Awards]] season with nine nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won several other honors chiefly for writing and technical achievement.\n\n== Plot ==\nA young girl visits the shrine of a renowned writer, known simply as \"Author\", carrying a copy of his most-cherished novel: ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''. The author begins narrating as the film explores his history, prefacing with a 1985 excerpt reading before flashing back to his 1968 stay at the once-grand, now-drab hotel. There he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who invites him to dinner to hear his [[rags to riches]] story.\n\nIn 1932, Zero is the newly-hired lobby boy at the prestigious Grand Budapest Hotel. Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's fastidious concierge, seduces old, wealthy clients\u2014among them the 84-year-old [[dowager]] Madame D., with whom he has had a nearly-two-decade affair.\n\nShortly after her last visit, Gustave learns from Zero that Madame has mysteriously died. He and Zero visit Schloss Lutz, her estate, to pay their respects and encounter her surviving relatives hearing the reading of her will by her attorney, Kovacs. Kovacs announces a recent [[codicil (will)|codicil]] to the will which bequeathes ''[[Boy with Apple]]'', a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting, to Gustave. Madame's son, Dmitri, is outraged and demands Gustave's arrest. Gustave and Zero leave, absconding with the painting for safekeeping.\n\nAt the Grand Budapest, Gustave is arrested for Madame's murder. He befriends a gang during his imprisonment, and the men plot their escape. Gustave has Zero place digging tools inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice baker at Mendl's and Zero's girlfriend. Gustave and the others dig their way out and disperse. When they are reunited, Zero and Gustave set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges: the Society of the Crossed Keys. They learn that Madame had a missing second will which would only take effect if she was murdered.\n\nGustave, Zero, and Agatha arrive back at the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a military headquarters. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve ''Boy with Apple'' to sell; as she tries to leave, Dmitri enters the hotel and spots her with the painting. Gustave and Zero rush to save Agatha from harm as she escapes from Dmitri. He opens fire on them, initiating an intense (but confusing) shootout with Zubrowkan troops. Agatha's attempt to escape leaves her and Zero hanging from a balcony before they fall, safely, into a van of pastries.\n\nMadame's second will, with Gustave the beneficiary of her fortune, is found attached to the back of ''Boy with Apple''; he succeeds her as owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, and becomes one of the wealthiest men in Zubrowka. While traveling by train, he, Zero, and Agatha encounter soldiers who destroy Zero's refugee documents. Gustave tries to fend off the soldiers, and is later shot dead. Zero, Gustave's sole heir, inherits his fortune; he retains the now-decrepit Grand Budapest in memory of Agatha, who died of illness with their infant son. The experiences are incorporated into the author's celebrated book, and the film ends with the young girl reading ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' next to his memorial.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as M.

For whip pans greater than 90 degrees, the filmmakers installed a fluid head from [[Mitchell Camera|Mitchell]]'s OConnor Ultimate product line for greater fidelity.<ref name=asc /> Anderson requested Yeoman and project [[key grip]] Sanjay Sami focus on fresh methods for shooting the scenes. Thus they used a towercam, a telescoping camera platform, to traverse between floors, sometimes in lieu of a [[crane shot|camera crane]].

He and the producers referred to the work of [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and other directors of the period to acclimate to the compositions produced from said format.<ref name=asc /> Filmmakers formatted modern scenes in standard 1.85:1 ratio, and the 1968 scenes were captured in widescreen 2.40:1 ratio with [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]]'s Technovision series of [[zoom lens|zoom]] and [[prime lens|prime anamorphic lenses]]. The Cooke lenses produced a soft, but diffuse composition, one that lacked the sharpness of [[Panavision]] lenses.<ref name=asc />\n\nYeoman lit interior shots with tungsten incandescent fixtures and [[DMX512|DMX]]-dimmer-controlled lighting. The crew made the Warenhaus ceiling from stretched [[muslin]] rigged with twenty 4K [[hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp|HMI]] lamps, an arrangement wherein the reflected light penetrated the [[skylight]], accentuating the set's daylighting. Yeoman was pleased with the lighting choice because the warm tungsten fixtures contrasted with the coolish daylight.<ref name=asc /> When shooting deliberately less inviting hotel sets, such as Zero and Gustave's small bedrooms and the Grand Budapest's [[servants' quarters]], the filmmakers combined [[fluorescent lighting]], [[paper lantern]]s and bare [[incandescent lights]] for historical accuracy.<ref name=asc />\n\nThe [[Stuttgart]]-based LUXX Studios and [[Look Effects]]' German branch (also in Stuttgart) managed most of ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''{{'s}} visual effects, under the supervision of Gabriel Sanchez.<ref name=asc /><ref name=cgs /> Their work for the film comprised 300 shots, created by a small cadre of specialized artists.<ref name=\"cgs\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/grand_budapest_hotel3 |title=The Grand Budapest Hotel |last=CGSociety staff |date=March 13, 2014 |website=CGSociety |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509113357/http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/grand_budapest_hotel3 |archive-date=May 9, 2017 |access-date=November 24, 2019}}</ref> The development of the film's effects team was swift, yet at times difficult. As Look Effects opened their Stuttgart headquarters after ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' filming wrapped, Sanchez was only able to reference his prior experience with Anderson, and the California-based artist became homesick working his first international assignment.<ref name=cgs /> Only four artists from the newly-assembled team had the expertise working on a multi-million dollar studio set, but their eagerness to master the nuance of said task resulted in constructive problem solving and camaraderie.<ref name=cgs />\n\nCreation of the effects was daunting because of their technical demands. The filmmakers camouflaged some of the [[stop motion animation|stop-motion]] and matte effects in the forest set chase scene to convey the desired intensity, and enhancing the snowscape with particle effects posed another challenge.<ref name=cgs /> Sanchez cites the observatory and hotel shots as work that best demonstrate his special effects team's ingenuity. To achieve the aging brutalist design of the 1968 Grand Budapest, they generated computer models supplemented with detailed lighting, matte effects and shadowy expanses.<ref name=cgs /> The crew used a similar technique in developing digital shots of the observatory; unlike the hotel, however, the observatory's base miniature was presented in pieces. They rendered the observatory with 20 different elements, data furthermore enhanced at Anderson's request.

Their purpose in moving to America was to gain advanced knowledge and experience to develop the modern society at home. Both students and laborers were attracted by the image of the United States as a country that welcomed foreigners. When they first arrived in the U.S., they had not intended to live there permanently, but rather to learn from Americans and to take that knowledge back home.

In the 1930s, the term ''Issei'' came into common use, replacing the term \"immigrant\" (''ijusha'').  This new term illustrated a changed way of looking at themselves.  The term ''Issei'' represented the idea of beginning, a psychological transformation relating to being settled, having a distinctive community, and the idea of belonging to the new country.<ref name=\"mclellan36\"/>\n\n''Issei'' settled in close ethnic communities, and therefore did not learn English.  They endured great economic and social losses during the early years of World War II, and they were not able to rebuild their lost businesses and savings.  The external circumstances tended to reinforce the pattern of ''Issei'' being predominantly friends with other ''Issei.''<ref name=\"mclellan36\"/>\n\nUnlike their children, they tend to rely primarily on Japanese-language media (newspapers, television, movies), and in some senses, they tend to think of themselves as more Japanese than Canadian or American.<ref name=\"mclellan36\"/>\n\n=====''Issei'' women=====\n''Issei'' women's lives were somewhat similar, despite differences in context, because they were structured within interlocking webs of patriarchal relationships, and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and as a source of happiness.<ref>Kobayashi, Audrey Lynn. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&pg=PA70&dq=issei+japanese+canadians&lr=&sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPR33,M1  ''Women, Work and Place,'' p. xxxiii.]</ref> The ''Issei'' women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors: the dominant ideology of late ''Meiji'' Japan, which advanced the economic objectives of the Japanese state; the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village, which arose partly as a form of adjustment to national objectives and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization; and the constraints which arose within a Canadian or American society dominated by racist ideology.<ref>Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&pg=PA70&dq=issei+japanese+canadians&lr=&sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA45,M1  p. 45.]</ref> Substantive evidence of the working lives of ''Issei'' women is very difficult to find, partly for lack of data and partly because the data that do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women.<ref>Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&pg=PA70&dq=issei+japanese+canadians&lr=&sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA58,M1  p. 58.]</ref>\n\nWithin the framework of environmental contradictions, the narratives of these women revealed a surprisingly shared sense of inevitability, a perception that the events of life are beyond the control of the individual, which accounts for the consistency in the way in which Issei women, different and individual in many ways, seem to have structured their emotions<ref>Kobayashi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NzwjB4j0iZQC&pg=PA70&dq=issei+japanese+canadians&lr=&sig=ACfU3U12E1f-Weid_02p0XlAWdutI6eGEg#PPA56,M1  p. 56.]</ref>\u2014and this quality of emotional control was passed to their ''Nisei'' children.\n\n=====Aging=====\nThe ''[[kanreki]]'' (\u9084\u66a6), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese [[rite of passage]] to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the ''Issei'' and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of ''Nisei.'' Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.<ref>Doi, Mary L.

As immigrants, the conflicts between the old country and the new played out in unique ways for each individual, and yet common elements do begin to appear in the history of the Japanese Canadian and Japanese American communities.\n\n===Emigrants from Japan===\nJapan was a closed country for more than two centuries, 1636 to 1853, since military rulers from the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] family wanted to keep foreigners away from Japanese society.<ref>Spickard, Paul R. (1997). ''Japanese Americans: The Formation and Transformations of an Ethnic Group,'' p. 7.</ref> The only exceptions were Chinese and some [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]], but even they were discouraged from associating with Japanese [[Citizenship|citizens]]. Also, it was strictly prohibited by law for ordinary Japanese citizens to go abroad. Change came around the early 19th century when the visit of an American fleet commanded by [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]] caused the new Japanese government to replace the Tokugawa system of economics and politics during the [[Meiji era]] to open its door to trade and contact with the outside world.\n\nAfter 1866, the new Japanese government decided to send students and laborers to the U.S. to bring back the knowledge and experience necessary for the nation to grow strong.<ref name=\"tamuraxxxvii\">Tamura, Linda.

For example, in 1890, only 25 Issei lived in Oregon.  By 1891, 1,000 Japanese lived in Oregon. In 1900, 2,051 Japanese had come to live in Oregon.<ref name=\"tamuraxxxvii\"/> By 1915, Japanese men with savings of $800 were considered eligible to summon wives from Japan.<ref>Tamura, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju-xQV-gGIMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=issei&client=firefox-a&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPR38,M1  p. xxxviii.]</ref>\n\n===Immigrants in America===\n{{main|History of Japanese Americans|Japanese-American life before World War II|Japanese-American life after World War II}}\nFew Japanese workers came to North America intending to become immigrants. Initially, most of them came with vague plans for gaining new experiences and for making some money before returning to homes in Japan.  This group of workers was overwhelmingly male. Many ''Issei'' arrived as laborers.  They worked in employment sectors such as agriculture, mining, and railroad construction.\n\nThe Issei were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in America by choice.  Despite a certain nostalgia for the old country, they had created homes in a country far from Japan.  If they had not been prohibited from becoming citizens, many would have become citizens of the United States.<ref>Yenne, Bill. (2007).

This included the ''Issei'', Japanese residents born in Japan, but not their children, the Nisei, who were born in United States or Hawaii, and who therefore were American citizens by birth.  Many of the Issei responded to the law by transferring title to their land to their ''Nisei'' children.<ref>Yenne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ok3JZw28xhEC&pg=PA12&dq=issei&lr=&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U2JXjxtiwBCtH0UYVFMwH-8lWGkFA#PPA12,M1  p. 12.]</ref>\n\n===Americans' first impression of Issei===\nAmericans generally viewed the ''Issei'' as a crude, ill-educated lot.<ref>Spickard, p. 15.</ref> Possible reasons for this may be the fact that most Japanese were forced to work in menial jobs in the U.S., such as farming. Many Issei were in fact better educated than either the Japanese or American public. Sixty percent had completed middle school, and 21 percent were high school graduates. {{citation needed|reason=No citation is given for Issei being well-educated, the numbers on their education.|date=August 2018}}\n\nWhether Christian, Buddhists, or nonbelievers, the ''Issei'' almost never caused trouble in the civil authority. The arrest rate for the ''Issei'' from 1902 to the 1960s was relatively lower than for any other major ethnic group in California.<ref>Spickard, p. 57.</ref> The only exceptions were that some young ''Issei'' committed crimes relating to gambling and prostitution{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}, which stemmed from different cultural morals in Japan.\n\n===Racial segregation and immigration law===\n{{main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States}}\nThe post-1900 cause to renew the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] became generalized protests against all [[Asian people|Asian]] immigrants, including the Issei.<ref>Mercier, Laurie ''et al.''

American labor organizations took an initiative in spreading [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]. [[White American]]s wanted to exclude them since they did not want any Asians to take their jobs away. As a result, they formed the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] that viewed Japanese and Chinese as a threat of American workers. The protest of the league involved picketing and beatings of the Issei. In October 1906, amid this anti-Japanese milieu, the San Francisco School Board, carrying out a campaign promise of the mayor, ordered all Japanese and Korean pupils to join the Chinese students at a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] school.<ref name=densho>{{citation| last=Densho and The Board of Trustees of The Leland Stanford Junior University| title=Reading: The Issei immigrants and Civil Rights| url=http://www.densho.org/learning/spice/lesson2/2reading2.asp| accessdate=25 April 2008| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417110939/http://www.densho.org/learning/spice/lesson2/2reading2.asp| archivedate=17 April 2008}}</ref> The ''Issei'' were displeased with the situation and some reported to Japanese newspapers. This caused the Japanese government to protest against the former President, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and as a result, they signed the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]]. This agreement led the period of settling and family building to come.\n\nBy 1911, almost half of the Japanese immigrants were women who landed in the U.S. to reunite with their husbands. After the Gentleman's agreement, a number of ''Nisei'', the second-generation Japanese, were born in California. Yet, it did not stop some white Americans from segregating Japanese immigrants. The ''Issei'' were a role model of American citizens by being hardworking, law-abiding, devoted to family and the community. However, some Americans did not want to admit the virtues of the ''Issei.''\n\nThe [[Immigration Act of 1924]] represented the Issei's failed struggle against the segregation. The experiences of the Issei extend from well before the period before 1 July 1924, when the Japanese Exclusion Act came into effect.<ref>Kirmura, Yukiko. (1988).

Japanese Californian farmers made rice a major crop of the state.

In the 1930s, the term ''Issei'' came into common use, replacing the term \"immigrant\" (''ijusha'').  This new term illustrated a changed way of looking at themselves.  The term ''Issei'' represented the idea of beginning, a psychological transformation relating to being settled, having a distinctive community, and the idea of belonging to the new country.<ref name=\"mclellan36\"/>\n\n''Issei'' settled in close ethnic communities, and therefore did not learn English.  They endured great economic and social losses during the early years of World War II, and they were not able to rebuild their lost businesses and savings.  The external circumstances tended to reinforce the pattern of ''Issei'' being predominantly friends with other ''Issei.''<ref name=\"mclellan36\"/>\n\nUnlike their children, they tend to rely primarily on Japanese-language media (newspapers, television, movies), and in some senses, they tend to think of themselves as more Japanese than Canadian or American.<ref name=\"mclellan36\"/>\n\n=====''Issei'' women=====\n''Issei'' women's lives were somewhat similar, despite differences in context, because they were structured within interlocking webs of patriarchal relationships, and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and as a source of happiness.<ref>Kobayashi, Audrey Lynn.

As immigrants, the conflicts between the old country and the new played out in unique ways for each individual, and yet common elements do begin to appear in the history of the Japanese Canadian and Japanese American communities.\n\n===Emigrants from Japan===\nJapan was a closed country for more than two centuries, 1636 to 1853, since military rulers from the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] family wanted to keep foreigners away from Japanese society.<ref>Spickard, Paul R. (1997). ''Japanese Americans: The Formation and Transformations of an Ethnic Group,'' p. 7.</ref> The only exceptions were Chinese and some [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]], but even they were discouraged from associating with Japanese [[Citizenship|citizens]]. Also, it was strictly prohibited by law for ordinary Japanese citizens to go abroad. Change came around the early 19th century when the visit of an American fleet commanded by [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]] caused the new Japanese government to replace the Tokugawa system of economics and politics during the [[Meiji era]] to open its door to trade and contact with the outside world.\n\nAfter 1866, the new Japanese government decided to send students and laborers to the U.S. to bring back the knowledge and experience necessary for the nation to grow strong.<ref name=\"tamuraxxxvii\">Tamura, Linda.

Initially, most of them came with vague plans for gaining new experiences and for making some money before returning to homes in Japan.  This group of workers was overwhelmingly male. Many ''Issei'' arrived as laborers.  They worked in employment sectors such as agriculture, mining, and railroad construction.\n\nThe Issei were born in Japan, and their cultural perspective was primarily Japanese; but they were in America by choice.  Despite a certain nostalgia for the old country, they had created homes in a country far from Japan.

This caused the Japanese government to protest against the former President, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and as a result, they signed the [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]]. This agreement led the period of settling and family building to come.\n\nBy 1911, almost half of the Japanese immigrants were women who landed in the U.S. to reunite with their husbands. After the Gentleman's agreement, a number of ''Nisei'', the second-generation Japanese, were born in California. Yet, it did not stop some white Americans from segregating Japanese immigrants. The ''Issei'' were a role model of American citizens by being hardworking, law-abiding, devoted to family and the community. However, some Americans did not want to admit the virtues of the ''Issei.''\n\nThe [[Immigration Act of 1924]] represented the Issei's failed struggle against the segregation. The experiences of the Issei extend from well before the period before 1 July 1924, when the Japanese Exclusion Act came into effect.<ref>Kirmura, Yukiko. (1988).

Japanese Californian farmers made rice a major crop of the state. The largest ''Issei'' community settled around [[Vacaville, California]], near San Francisco.\n\n===Internment===\n{{main|Japanese Canadian internment|Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Peruvian#World War II}}\nWhen the Canadian and American governments interned West Coast Japanese in 1942, neither distinguished between those who were citizens (''Nisei'') and their non-citizen parents (''Issei'').<ref>Dinnerstein, Leonard ''et al.''

The 5\u20134 decision overturned [[precedent]] set in a 1979 Supreme Court case, ''[[Nevada v. Hall]].''  This was the third time that the [[litigant]]s had presented their case to the Court, as the Court had already ruled on the issue in 2003 and 2016.\n\nThe ruling ended a long tax dispute between Hyatt and California regarding alleged tax fraud by Hyatt. Hyatt had been challenging the tax fraud penalties that the [[California Franchise Tax Board]] (\"FTB\") had ordered him to pay since 1993, both in court and through administrative proceedings. Because of the Supreme Court ruling, Hyatt was required to pay for all legal costs he incurred, without receiving a judgement against the FTB. On this matter, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote: \"The consequences for the inventor are that he'll suffer the loss of two decades of litigation expenses and a final judgment against the Board for its egregious conduct. ... Those case-specific costs are not among the reliance interests that would persuade us to adhere to an incorrect resolution of an important constitutional question\".\n\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]], in the dissenting opinion, warned of the willingness of the majority to overrule precedent, saying, \"To overrule a sound decision like ''Hall'' ... is to cause the public to become increasingly uncertain about which cases the court will overrule and which cases are here to stay\", referencing as an example ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]],'' a 1992 case that affirmed the landmark [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]] case ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. As a result of this ruling, Gilbert Hyatt did not receive $100,000 in [[damages]] from [[California]]. Although he was originally granted $389 million in damages by a [[Nevada]] jury, rulings by the [[Nevada Supreme Court]] and the U.S. Supreme Court reduced the amount to $100,000.\n\n== Legal background ==\nThe doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] is the right of a government not to be sued in its own courts.<ref name=\"Baude p. 4\">{{bluebook journal|last=Baude|first=William|title=Sovereign immunity and the constitutional text|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26400233|year=2017|journal=Va. L. Rev.|volume=103|page=1|pin=4}}.</ref> The doctrine stems from the English [[common law]] principle that \"the King can do no wrong\". More recently, the principle has been defended for a variety of reasons: the idea that the entire community, i.e. the state, cannot commit wrongdoing; that the state's actions are lawful ''per se''; that an agent of the state, when acting unlawfully, necessarily does so outside of their legal authority;{{refn|group=n|Government officers have long been amenable to suit without the government's immunity.{{r|Baude p. 4}}}} opposition to the use of public funds to compensate private injuries; and that being amenable to suits interferes with the state's operation.<ref name=\"Olenick p.1493\">{{bluebook journal|last=Olenick|first=Donald|title=Sovereign immunity in sister-state courts: Full Faith and Credit and federal common law solutions|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1122173|year=1980|journal=Colum.

Congress could only appoint courts dealing with [[piracy]], felonies on [[international waters]] and appeals in cases of [[Rule of capture|capture]]. They could also establish ''[[ad hoc]]'' tribunals for dealing with disputes between two or more states and disputes with individuals claiming certain land based on different grants of two or more states.<ref name=\"Jacobs p. 9\">Jacobs, at 9.</ref> However, various states had accumulated large debts with domestic and foreign creditors, largely due to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Confederate government's and some states' failure to pay its creditors was seen as an obstacle to harmony and peace. Some feared that the failure to repay foreign governments and its subjects posed an international threat. In addition, because the domestic creditors were largely concentrated in a few states, people feared that states [[default (finance)|defaulting]] on their debt would cause interstate tension.

Hall'' ===\nThe issue of interstate sovereign immunity remained unaddressed by the U.S. Supreme Court until ''[[Nevada v. Hall]]'' (1979). Prior to ''Nevada v. Hall'', courts had generally ruled that the Constitution, at least implicitely, prevented states from being sued in the courts of other states, pursuant to the principle of sovereign immunity.{{refn|group=n|For example, {{cite court|litigants=Paulus v.

Hall'', the U.S. Supreme Court considered a case where two [[California]] residents were severely injured after their car collided with a car that was the property of the [[Nevada|State of Nevada]] on a highway in California. The car was being operated by a [[University of Nevada]] employee on official business. The California residents brought suit against the University, the State of Nevada, and the car's administrator in a [[California Superior Court]]. The Superior Court rejected Nevada's argument that they were immune from suits against them in sister-state courts without their consent and held that it did have [[jurisdiction]] over the case. The Superior Court also rejected Nevada's argument that the Court, in keeping with the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], should apply the Nevada statute limiting damages in suits against the state to $25,000 per tort.{{Refn|In 1979, this was raised to $50,000 per tort.{{r|Olenick p. 1495}}|group=n}} Instead, the Superior Court awarded the plaintiffs $1,150,000 in damages.

The opinion of the Court was authored by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], in which the Court held that the Constitution, specifically Article III and the Eleventh Amendment, did not prevent states from being sued in the courts of sister-states. It also held that California was not required to apply the Nevada statute limiting damages in suits against its state, because California had a substantial interest in allowing persons injured while driving on their highways to receive full compensation when they sued the responsible person(s) in their courts. In addition, Stevens noted that this interest was also furthered by the fact that California had waived its own immunity and allowed for full compensation in cases where the State of California was the defendant. Thus, applying the Nevada tort limit \"would be obnoxious to its statutorily based policies of jurisdiction over nonresident motorists and full recovery.\"<ref name=\"Olenick p. 1495-96\">Olenick, at 1495-96.</ref><ref name=\"Decision Nev. v.

The [[California Franchise Tax Board]] completed an audit in 1993 of Hyatt's tax returns, and determined that Hyatt's primary residence was actually California in 1991 and 1992; the FTB assessed Hyatt $13.3 million in back taxes and [[fraud]] penalties.<ref name=\"Sacramento Bee\">{{Bluebook website|first=Emily|last=Cadei|title=California wins last round of $25 million, 26-year tax fight with wealthy inventor|publisher=Sacramento Bee|url=https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article230338079.html|date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHyatt filed a protest but after 11 years of administrative proceedings, it was upheld. {{As of|2019|May|13|df=US}}, an appeal is still pending.<ref name=\"2019 SCOTUS\" /> Hyatt also sued the FTB in Nevada, alleging that he was harassed by the FTB and became subject to unconstitutional invasions of [[privacy]]. California's lawyers argued that in accordance with the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], Nevada state courts could not hold California tax collectors liable because California law immunizes tax collectors from [[Legal liability|liability]]. The Nevada Supreme Court rejected this argument, citing ''[[Nevada v.

The dispute\u2014''[[Franchise Tax Board of California v Hyatt (2016)|Hyatt II]]''\u2014came before the U.S. Supreme Court a second time in 2016. The Court split 4\u20134 on the question of whether ''Nevada v.

The 5\u20134 decision overturned [[precedent]] set in a 1979 Supreme Court case, ''[[Nevada v. Hall]].''  This was the third time that the [[litigant]]s had presented their case to the Court, as the Court had already ruled on the issue in 2003 and 2016.\n\nThe ruling ended a long tax dispute between Hyatt and California regarding alleged tax fraud by Hyatt. Hyatt had been challenging the tax fraud penalties that the [[California Franchise Tax Board]] (\"FTB\") had ordered him to pay since 1993, both in court and through administrative proceedings. Because of the Supreme Court ruling, Hyatt was required to pay for all legal costs he incurred, without receiving a judgement against the FTB. On this matter, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote: \"The consequences for the inventor are that he'll suffer the loss of two decades of litigation expenses and a final judgment against the Board for its egregious conduct. ... Those case-specific costs are not among the reliance interests that would persuade us to adhere to an incorrect resolution of an important constitutional question\".\n\nJustice [[Stephen Breyer]], in the dissenting opinion, warned of the willingness of the majority to overrule precedent, saying, \"To overrule a sound decision like ''Hall'' ... is to cause the public to become increasingly uncertain about which cases the court will overrule and which cases are here to stay\", referencing as an example ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]],'' a 1992 case that affirmed the landmark [[Abortion in the United States|abortion rights]] case ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. As a result of this ruling, Gilbert Hyatt did not receive $100,000 in [[damages]] from [[California]]. Although he was originally granted $389 million in damages by a [[Nevada]] jury, rulings by the [[Nevada Supreme Court]] and the U.S. Supreme Court reduced the amount to $100,000.\n\n== Legal background ==\nThe doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] is the right of a government not to be sued in its own courts.<ref name=\"Baude p. 4\">{{bluebook journal|last=Baude|first=William|title=Sovereign immunity and the constitutional text|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26400233|year=2017|journal=Va.

More recently, the principle has been defended for a variety of reasons: the idea that the entire community, i.e. the state, cannot commit wrongdoing; that the state's actions are lawful ''per se''; that an agent of the state, when acting unlawfully, necessarily does so outside of their legal authority;{{refn|group=n|Government officers have long been amenable to suit without the government's immunity.{{r|Baude p. 4}}}} opposition to the use of public funds to compensate private injuries; and that being amenable to suits interferes with the state's operation.<ref name=\"Olenick p.1493\">{{bluebook journal|last=Olenick|first=Donald|title=Sovereign immunity in sister-state courts: Full Faith and Credit and federal common law solutions|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1122173|year=1980|journal=Colum.

Congress could only appoint courts dealing with [[piracy]], felonies on [[international waters]] and appeals in cases of [[Rule of capture|capture]]. They could also establish ''[[ad hoc]]'' tribunals for dealing with disputes between two or more states and disputes with individuals claiming certain land based on different grants of two or more states.<ref name=\"Jacobs p. 9\">Jacobs, at 9.</ref> However, various states had accumulated large debts with domestic and foreign creditors, largely due to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Confederate government's and some states' failure to pay its creditors was seen as an obstacle to harmony and peace. Some feared that the failure to repay foreign governments and its subjects posed an international threat. In addition, because the domestic creditors were largely concentrated in a few states, people feared that states [[default (finance)|defaulting]] on their debt would cause interstate tension.

Hall'' ===\nThe issue of interstate sovereign immunity remained unaddressed by the U.S. Supreme Court until ''[[Nevada v. Hall]]'' (1979). Prior to ''Nevada v. Hall'', courts had generally ruled that the Constitution, at least implicitely, prevented states from being sued in the courts of other states, pursuant to the principle of sovereign immunity.{{refn|group=n|For example, {{cite court|litigants=Paulus v.

Hall'', the U.S. Supreme Court considered a case where two [[California]] residents were severly injured after their car collided with a car that was the property of the [[Nevada|State of Nevada]] on a highway in California. The car was being operated by a [[University of Nevada]] employee on official business. The California residents brought suit against the University, the State of Nevada, and the car's administrator in a [[California Superior Court]]. The Superior Court rejected Nevada's argument that they were immune from suits against them in sister-state courts without their consent and held that it did have [[jurisdiction]] over the case. The Superior Court also rejected Nevada's argument that the Court, in keeping with the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], should apply the Nevada statute limiting damages in suits against the state to $25,000 per tort.{{Refn|In 1979, this was raised to $50,000 per tort.{{r|Olenick p. 1495}}|group=n}} Instead, the Superior Court awarded the plaintiffs $1,150,000 in damages. The judgement was affirmed by a [[California Courts of Appeal|California Court of Appeal]] and the [[Supreme Court of California]] declined to hear the case.<ref name=\"Olenick p. 1495\">Olenick, at 1495.</ref>\n\nNevada petitioned to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted ''[[certiorari]]''. The opinion of the Court was authored by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], in which the Court held that the Constitution, specifically Article III and the Eleventh Amendment, did not prevent states from being sued in the courts of sister-states. It also held that California was not required to apply the Nevada statute limiting damages in suits against its state, because California had a substantial interest in allowing persons injured while driving on their highways to receive full compensation when they sued the responsible person(s) in their courts. In addition, Stevens noted that this interest was also furthered by the fact that California had waived its own immunity and allowed for full compensation in cases where the State of California was the defendant. Thus, applying the Nevada tort limit \"would be obnoxious to its statutorily based policies of jurisdiction over nonresident motorists and full recovery.\"<ref name=\"Olenick p. 1495-96\">Olenick, at 1495-96.</ref><ref name=\"Decision Nev. v.

The [[California Franchise Tax Board]] completed an audit in 1993 of Hyatt's tax returns, and determined that Hyatt's primary residence was actually California in 1991 and 1992; the FTB assessed Hyatt $13.3 million in back taxes and [[fraud]] penalties.<ref name=\"Sacramento Bee\">{{Bluebook website|first=Emily|last=Cadei|title=California wins last round of $25 million, 26-year tax fight with wealthy inventor|publisher=Sacramento Bee|url=https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article230338079.html|date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHyatt filed a protest but after 11 years of administrative proceedings, it was upheld. {{As of|2019|May|13|df=US}}, an appeal is still pending.<ref name=\"2019 SCOTUS\" /> Hyatt also sued the FTB in Nevada, alleging that he was harassed by the FTB and became subject to unconstitutional invasions of [[privacy]]. California's lawyers argued that in accordance with the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]], Nevada state courts could not hold California tax collectors liable because California law immunizes tax collectors from [[Legal liability|liability]]. The Nevada Supreme Court rejected this argument, citing ''[[Nevada v. Hall]]''; the judgement was affirmed in 2003 by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Franchise Tax Board of California v Hyatt (2003)|Hyatt I]]''.<ref name=\"2003 SCOTUS\" /><ref name=\"Sacramento Bee\" /><ref name=\"NYTimes\" />\n\nHyatt was then awarded $389 million in damages by a Nevada jury for fraud, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of [[Distress (medicine)|emotional distress]], and in [[punitive damages]]. The Nevada trial court added more than $104.5 million in costs and prejudgement interest, for a total judgement exceeding $490 million,<ref name=\"Sacramento Bee\" /><ref name=\"ABAJ\" /><ref name=\"Petition\" /> which was reduced over the course of several appeals. The dispute\u2014''[[Franchise Tax Board of California v Hyatt (2016)|Hyatt II]]''\u2014came before the U.S. Supreme Court a second time in 2016. The Court split 4\u20134 on the question of whether ''Nevada v. Hall'' should be overturned, effectively upholding it, but a majority did rule that because Nevada law limits the liability of its state agencies to $50,000 per [[tort]], Nevada state courts could not award Hyatt more than that amount per tort, in keeping with the Full Faith and Credit Clause.<ref name=\"2016 SCOTUS\" /> Consequently, the Nevada Supreme Court deemed a new trial unnecessary, and simply reduced the damages granted to Hyatt to the permitted maximum.

Later, an important phase in the development of Sikhism came with the third successor, Guru Amar Das. Guru Nanak's teachings emphasised the pursuit of salvation; Guru Amar Das began building a cohesive community of followers with initiatives such as sanctioning distinctive ceremonies for birth, marriage, and death. Amar Das also established the ''manji'' (comparable to a [[diocese]]) system of clerical supervision.<ref name=\"p254\" />\n\n[[Guru Amar Das]]'s successor and son-in-law [[Guru Ram Das]] founded the city of [[Amritsar]], which is home of the [[Harimandir Sahib]] and regarded widely as the holiest city for all Sikhs.

The sixth Guru, [[Guru Har Gobind|Guru Hargobind]], was responsible for the creation of the concept of [[Akal Takht]] (''throne of the timeless one''), which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhism and sits opposite the [[Harmandir Sahib]]. The Akal Takht is located in the city of Amritsar. The leader is appointed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Pabandhak Committee (SPGC).

Interestingly, even the atheistic Buddhist Nirvana is not omitted: \"Itself Nirvana, It itself relishes pleasures\" (GGS: 97). \"God\" or \"gods\" or \"no god\" alike are recognized as part of the infinite One! \"Always, always you alone are the One Reality\u2014sada sada tun eku hai\" (GGS: 139).

There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the [[partition of India|land was partitioned]] into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\">{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=86\u201393}}</ref> The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"[[Radcliffe Line]]\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the [[Muslim League]] demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of [[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru in Canada]] proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} These leaders, however, were largely ignored.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia's Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TBscBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62446-2|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nWhen partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of [[jhatka]] versus [[halal]] meat, the disputed ownership of [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque|Gurdwara Sahidganj]] in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian [[Gurmukhi]] script to Arabic-Persian [[Nastaliq]] script in schools.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} During and after the [[Simla Conference]] in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\".

Interestingly, even the atheistic Buddhist Nirvana is not omitted: \"Itself Nirvana, It itself relishes pleasures\" (GGS: 97). \"God\" or \"gods\" or \"no god\" alike are recognized as part of the infinite One! \"Always, always you alone are the One Reality\u2014sada sada tun eku hai\" (GGS: 139).

The daily recitation of the divine name of God VaheGuru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''Gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs.

Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the [[partition of India|land was partitioned]] into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\">{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=86\u201393}}</ref> The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"[[Radcliffe Line]]\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the [[Muslim League]] demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of [[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru in Canada]] proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} These leaders, however, were largely ignored.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia's Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TBscBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62446-2|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nWhen partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of [[jhatka]] versus [[halal]] meat, the disputed ownership of [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque|Gurdwara Sahidganj]] in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian [[Gurmukhi]] script to Arabic-Persian [[Nastaliq]] script in schools.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} During and after the [[Simla Conference]] in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\". The riots had triggered the early waves of migration in April, with some 20,000 people leaving northwest Punjab and moving to Patiala.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> In Rawalpindi, 40,000 people became homeless. The Sikh leaders made desperate petitions, but all religious communities were suffering in the political turmoil.

Although decried by Sikhism, Sikhs have practiced a caste system. The system, along with untouchability, has been more common in rural parts of Punjab.The landowning dominant Sikh castes, states Jodhka, \"have not shed all their prejudices against the lower castes or [[dalits]]; while dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurdwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar.\" The Sikh dalits of Punjab have tried to build their own gurdwara, other local level institutions and sought better material circumstances and dignity. According to Jodhka, due to economic mobility in contemporary Punjab, castes no longer mean an inherited occupation nor are work relations tied to a single location.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jodhka|first1=Surinder S|title=Caste and Untouchability in Rural Punjab|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=11\u201317 May 2002|volume= 37|issue=19|pages=1813\u20131823|jstor=4412102}}</ref>\nIn 1953, the government of India acceded to the demands of the Sikh leader, [[Tara Singh (activist)|Master Tara Singh]], to include Sikh dalit castes in the list of scheduled castes.<ref name=\"Harish K.

Despite being very small in numbers, the Kshatriya [[Khatri]] and [[Arora]] castes wield considerable influence within the Sikh community. Other common Sikh castes include [[Saini]]s, [[Ramgarhia]]s (artisans), [[Ahluwalia (caste)|Ahluwalias]] (formerly brewers), [[Kamboj]]s (rural caste), [[Labana]]s, [[Kumhar]]s and the two Dalit castes, known in Sikh terminology as the [[Mazhabi]]s (the Chuhras) and the [[Ravidasia]]s (the Chamars).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Encyclopedia|first1=Britannica|title=Sikhism (religion)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/543916/Sikhism/253170/The-rejection-of-caste|website=britannica.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Sikh diaspora===\n{{Further|Sikhism in India|Sikh diaspora|Sikhism by country}}\n[[File:Sikhs on the move!.jpg|thumb|Sikhs celebrating [[Vaisakhi]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]\nSikhism is [[Major religious groups#Religious demographics|the fifth-largest amongst the major world religions]], and one of the youngest.<ref name=\"Partridge2013\">{{cite book|author=Christopher Partridge|title=Introduction to World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3AjAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA429|date=1 November 2013|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-9970-3|pages=429\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"McDowellBrown2009\">{{cite book|author1=Michael McDowell|author2=Nathan Robert Brown|title=World Religions at Your Fingertips|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0_dHrRY3gIC&pg=PA232|year=2009|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-1-59257-846-7|pages=232\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Teece2005\">{{cite book|author=Geoff Teece|title=Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJO1WIABhPQC&pg=PA4|year=2005|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|isbn=978-1-58340-469-0|pages=4\u2013}}</ref> Worldwide, there are 25.8&nbsp;million Sikhs, which makes up 0.39% of the world's population.

Today temples, newspapers, radio stations, and markets cater to these large, multi-generational [[Indo-Canadians|Indo-Canadian]] groups. Sikh festivals such as Vaisakhi and [[Bandi Chhor Divas|Bandi Chhor]] are celebrated in those Canadian cities by the largest groups of followers in the world outside the Punjab.\n\nSikhs also migrated to East Africa, West Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. These communities developed as Sikhs migrated out of Punjab to fill in gaps in imperial labour markets.<ref>{{cite book | last=Ballantyne|first=Tony|year=2006|title=Between Colonialism and Diaspora: Sikh Cultural Formations in an Imperial World|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn = 978-0-8223-3824-6|pages=69\u201374}}</ref> In the early twentieth century a significant community began to take shape on the west coast of the United States.

Their job was to maintain a low profile and inhabit their residence, so that other Soviet agents could periodically use it as a safe house for various espionage related activities. To accomplish this mission, Cy and Nerma had to avoid any appearance of being interested in Communist politics; they had to avoid even reading Communist newspapers. Friend [[Sidney Hook]] spotted Oggins in the [[Gendarmenmarkt]], as described in his autobiography ''Out of Step'' (1984). Oggins had to resist the temptation to have meetings with his old friend, although he did not always resist this temptation fully.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  | last = Hook\n  | first = Sidney\n  | title = Out of Step:  An Unquiet Life in the 20th Century\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/outofstepunquiet00hook/page/94\n  | publisher = Harper and Row\n  | year = 1984\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/outofstepunquiet00hook/page/94 94\u2013101, Chapter 8, \"Encounter with Espionage'']\n  | isbn = 0-06-015632-5\n  }}</ref><ref>See Meier's book about their time in Berlin</ref>\n\nThe Ogginses moved from Berlin to Paris in the Spring of 1930.

On April 15, 1942, the US Department of State indicated to the US embassy in Moscow \"It is possible that he [Oggins] has been acting for years as an agent of a foreign power or of an international revolutionary organization.

Your 538, June 16, 1 p.m. Please take up this case informally with the Soviet authorities and since Oggins is an American citizen request permission for an American Foreign Service Officer to visit him as provided for in the 1933 agreement, or that Oggins be allowed to appear at the Embassy. <br> Without at this time giving emphasis to the failure of the Soviet authorities, from the standpoint of commitments of the Soviet Government, to notify the Embassy of Oggins\u2019 arrest, you may, however, express some surprise at such failure and may mention that your Government hopes that steps will be taken to prevent failures of a similar nature from taking place in the future. <br> The Department is concerned as to the disposition made of Oggins\u2019 passport.<ref name=Hull/> </small> </blockquote>     On December 8, 1942, Oggins received visits from American diplomats at the [[Butyrka]] prison in Moscow.
