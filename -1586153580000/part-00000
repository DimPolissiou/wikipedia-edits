Microfinance includes [[microcredit]], the provision of small loans to poor clients; [[savings account|savings]] and [[checking account]]s; [[microinsurance]]; and [[payment system]]s, among other branches.<ref name=\"biznewsdaily\">{{cite web|url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4286-microfinance.html|title=Microfinance: What It Is and Why It Matters|last=Caramela|first=Sammi|date=23 April 2018|website=Business News Daily|accessdate=16 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"investopedia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microfinance.asp|last=Kagan|first=Julia|date=7 June 2018|website=Investopedia|accessdate=16 February 2019|title=Microfinance}}</ref> Microfinance services are designed to reach excluded customers, usually poorer population segments, possibly socially marginalized, or geographically more isolated, and to help them become self-sufficient.<ref name=\"investopedia\"/><ref name=\"christen-rosenberg-jayadeva\">Robert Peck Christen, Richard Rosenberg & Veena Jayadeva.  ''[[Financial institutions]] with a [[Double bottom line|double-bottom line]]:  implications for the future of microfinance''.  [[Partnership|CGAP]] Occasional Paper, July 2004, pp. 2-3.</ref>\n\nMicrofinance initially had a limited definition - the provision of microloans to poor entrepreneurs and small businesses lacking access to [[credit]]. The two main mechanisms for the delivery of financial services to such clients were: (1) relationship-based banking for individual entrepreneurs and small businesses; and (2) group-based models, where several entrepreneurs come together to apply for loans and other services as a group. Over time, microfinance has emerged as a larger [[social movement|movement]] whose object is \"a world in which as everyone, especially the poor and socially marginalized people and households have access to a wide range of affordable, high quality financial products and services, including not just credit but also savings, insurance, payment services, and [[Electronic funds transfer|fund transfers]].\"<ref name=\"christen-rosenberg-jayadeva\"/>\n\nProponents of microfinance often claim that such access will help poor people out of [[poverty]], including participants in the [[Microcredit Summit Campaign]]. For many, microfinance is a way to promote economic development, employment and growth through the support of micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses; for others it is a way for the poor to manage their finances more effectively and take advantage of economic opportunities while managing the risks. Critics often point to some of the ills of micro-credit that can create indebtedness. Due to diverse contexts in which microfinance operates, and the broad range of microfinance services, it is neither possible nor wise to have a generalized view of impacts microfinance may create. Many studies have tried to assess its impacts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feigenberg|first=Benjamin|author2=Erica M.

This is often the case when people need the services money can provide but do not have dispensable funds required for those services, forcing them to revert to other means of acquiring them.\nIn their book ''The Poor and Their Money'', Stuart Rutherford and Sukhwinder Arora cite several types of needs:\n* ''Lifecycle Needs'':  such as weddings, funerals, childbirth, education, home building, widowhood and old age.\n* ''Personal Emergencies'':  such as sickness, injury, unemployment, theft, harassment or death.\n* ''Disasters'':  such as wildfires, floods, cyclones and man-made events like war or bulldozing of dwellings.\n* ''Investment Opportunities'':  expanding a business, buying land or equipment, improving housing, securing a job, etc.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Rutherford | first1 = Stuart | last2 = Arora | first2 = Sukhwinder | title = The poor and their money: micro finance from a twenty-first century consumer's perspective | page = 4 | publisher = Practical Action | location = Warwickshire, UK | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781853396885 }}</ref>\nPeople find creative and often collaborative ways to meet these needs, primarily through creating and exchanging different forms of non-cash value. Common substitutes for cash vary from country to country but typically include livestock, grains, jewelry and precious metals.\nAs Marguerite S. Robinson describes in his book 'The Micro finance Revolution - Sustainable Finance for the Poor', the 1980s demonstrated that \"micro finance could provide large-scale outreach profitably,\" and in the 1990s, \"micro finance began to develop as an industry\" (2001, p.&nbsp;54).\nIn the 2000s, the micro finance industry's objective is to satisfy the unmet [[demand]] on a much larger scale, and to play a role in reducing poverty. While much progress has been made in developing a viable, commercial micro finance sector in the last few decades, several issues remain that need to be addressed before the industry will be able to satisfy massive worldwide demand.\nThe obstacles or challenges in building a sound commercial micro finance industry include:\n* Inappropriate donor [[subsidies]]\n* Poor regulation and supervision of deposit-taking micro finance institutions (MFIs)\n* Few MFIs that meet the needs for savings, remittances or insurance\n* Limited management capacity in MFIs\n* Institutional inefficiencies\n* Need for more dissemination and adoption of rural, agricultural micro finance methodologies\n* Members lack of collateral to secure a loan\n\nMicrofinance is the proper tool to reduce income inequality, allowing citizens from lower socio-economical classes to participate in the economy. Moreover, its involvement has shown to lead to a downward trend in income inequality (Hermes, 2014).<ref>Hermes, N. (2014). Does microfinance affect income inequality? Applied Economics, 46(9), 1021-1034. doi:10.1080/00036846.2013.864039</ref>\n\n===Ways in which poor people manage their money===\n\n[[File:Saving up.jpg|thumb|Saving up]]\nRutherford argues that the basic problem that poor people face as money managers is to gather a 'usefully large' amount of money. Building a new home may involve saving and protecting diverse building materials for years until enough are available to proceed with construction. Children's schooling may be funded by buying chickens and raising them for sale as needed for expenses, uniforms, bribes, etc. Because all the value is accumulated before it is needed, this money management strategy is referred to as 'saving up'.(Hermes, 2014).<ref>Rutherford, Stuart. The poor and their money. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nOften, people don't have enough money when they face a need, so they borrow. A poor family might borrow from relatives to buy land, from a moneylender to buy rice, or from a microfinance institution to buy a sewing machine. Since these loans must be repaid by saving after the cost is incurred, Rutherford calls this 'saving down'. Rutherford's point is that microcredit is addressing only half the problem, and arguably the less important half: poor people borrow to help them save and accumulate assets. Microcredit institutions should fund their loans through savings accounts that help poor people manage their myriad risks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n[[File:Saving down.jpg|left|thumb|Saving down]]\nMost needs are met through a mix of saving and credit. A benchmark impact assessment of [[Grameen Bank]] and two other large microfinance institutions in Bangladesh found that for every $1 they were lending to clients to finance rural non-farm [[micro-enterprise]], about $2.50 came from other sources, mostly their clients' savings.<ref>{{cite book | last = Khandker | first = Shahidur R. | title = Fighting poverty with microcredit: experience in Bangladesh | page = 78 | publisher = The University Press Ltd. | location = Dhaka, Bangladesh | year = 1999 | isbn = 9789840514687 }}</ref>  This parallels the experience in the West, in which family businesses are funded mostly from savings, especially during start-up.\n\nRecent studies have also shown that informal methods of saving are unsafe. For example, a study by Wright and Mutesasira in [[Uganda]] concluded that \"those with no option but to save in the informal sector are almost bound to lose some money\u2014probably around one quarter of what they save there.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Graham A.

The new paradigm places more attention on the efforts of poor people to reduce their many vulnerabilities by keeping more of what they earn and building up their assets. While they need loans, they may find it as useful to borrow for consumption as for microenterprise. A safe, flexible place to save money and withdraw it when needed is also essential for managing household and family risk.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n===Examples===\nThe microfinance project of \"saving up\" is exemplified in the slums of the south-eastern city of Vijayawada, India. This microfinance project functions as an unofficial banking system where Jyothi, a \"deposit collector\", collects money from slum dwellers, mostly women, in order for them to accumulate savings. Jyothi does her rounds throughout the city, collecting Rs5 a day from people in the slums for 220 days, however not always 220 days in a row since these women do not always have the funds available to put them into savings. They ultimately end up with Rs1000 at the end of the process. However, there are some issues with this microfinance saving program. One of the issues is that while saving, clients are actually losing part of their savings. Jyothi takes interest from each client\u2014about 20 out of every 220 payments, or Rs100 out of 1,100 or 8%. When these slum dwellers find someone they trust, they are willing to pay up to 30% to someone to safely collect and keep their savings. There is also the risk of entrusting their savings to unlicensed, informal, peripatetic collectors. However, the slum dwellers are willing to accept this risk because they are unable to save at home, and unable to use the remote and unfriendly banks in their country. This microfinance project also has many benefits, such as empowering women and giving parents the ability to save money for their children's education. This specific microfinance project is an example of the benefits and limitations of the \"saving up\" project (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nThe microfinance project of \"saving through\" is shown in Nairobi, Kenya which includes a Rotating Savings and Credit Associations or ROSCAs initiative. This is a small scale example, however Rutherford (2009) describes a woman he met in Nairobi and studied her ROSCA. Everyday 15 women would save 100 shillings so there would be a lump sum of 1,500 shillings and everyday 1 of the 15 women would receive that lump sum. This would continue for 15 days and another woman within this group would receive the lump sum. At the end of the 15 days a new cycle would start. This ROSCA initiative is different from the \"saving up\" example above because there are no interest rates affiliated with the ROSCA, additionally everyone receives back what they put forth. This initiative requires trust and social capital networks in order to work, so often these ROSCAs include people who know each other and have reciprocity. The ROSCA allows for marginalized groups to receive a lump sum at one time in order to pay or save for specific needs they have.\n\n==Microfinance debates and challenges==\n\nThere are several key debates at the boundaries of microfinance.\n\n===Loan Pricing===\n[[File:A business in South Sudan benefiting from microfinance (6189731244).jpg|thumb|This shop in [[South Sudan]] was opened using money borrowed from the Finance Sudan Limited (FSL) Program. This program was established in 2006 as one of the only microfinance lenders in the country.]]\n\nBefore determining loan price one should take these two costs; Administrative costs by the bank(MFI) and transaction cost by the client/customer. Customers, on the other hand, may have expenses for travelling to the bank branch, acquiring official documents for the loan application, and loss of time when dealing with the MFI (\u201copportunity costs\u201d). Hence, from a customer's point of view the cost of a loan is not only the interest and fees she/he has to pay, but also all other transaction costs that she/he has to cover.\n\nOne of the principal challenges of microfinance is providing small loans at an affordable cost. The global average interest and fee rate is estimated at 37%, with rates reaching as high as 70% in some markets.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/world/14microfinance.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Neil | last=MacFarquhar | title=Banks Making Big Profits From Tiny Loans | date=2010-04-13}}</ref>  The reason for the high interest rates is not primarily cost of capital.  Indeed, the local microfinance organizations that receive zero-interest loan capital from the online microlending platform [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] charge average interest and fee rates of 35.21%.<ref name=\"HighRates\">{{cite web|url = http://www.kiva.org/help/interestRateComparison|title = Kiva Help - Interest Rate Comparison|publisher = Kiva.org|accessdate = October 10, 2009}}</ref>  Rather, the main reason for the high cost of microfinance loans is the high [[transaction cost]] of traditional microfinance operations relative to loan size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/microfinance#interestRatesAreHigh |title=About Microfinance |publisher=Kiva |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance practitioners have long argued that such high interest rates are simply unavoidable, because the cost of making each loan cannot be reduced below a certain level while still allowing the lender to cover costs such as offices and staff salaries. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa credit risk for microfinance institutes is very high, because customers need years to improve their livelihood and  face many challenges during this time. Financial institutes often do not even have a system to check the person's identity. Additionally they are unable to design new products and enlarge their business to reduce the risk.<ref>{{cite web |title=Moving forward |author1=Geoffrey Muzigiti |author2=Oliver Schmidt |publisher=D+C Development and Cooperation/ dandc.eu |date=January 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/financial-inclusion-poor-sub-saharan-africa-improving-thanks-formal-sector-banks-and}}</ref> The result is that the traditional approach to microfinance has made only limited progress in resolving the problem it purports to address: that the world's poorest people pay the world's highest cost for small business growth capital.  The high costs of traditional microfinance loans limit their effectiveness as a poverty-fighting tool. Offering loans at interest and fee rates of 37% mean that borrowers who do not manage to earn at least a 37% rate of return may actually end up poorer as a result of accepting the loans.\n\n[[File:Example of Flat Rate Loan Contract Chambak, Cambodia.JPG|thumb|Example of a loan contract, using flat rate calculation, from rural Cambodia.

Some resorted to measures such as reducing their food intake or taking children out of school in order to repay microfinance debts that had not proven sufficiently profitable. {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nIn recent years, the microfinance industry has shifted its focus from the objective of increasing the volume of lending capital available, to address the challenge of providing microfinance loans more affordably. Microfinance analyst David Roodman contends that, in mature markets, the average interest and fee rates charged by microfinance institutions tend to fall over time.<ref>Roodman, David. \"Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry Into Microfinance.\" Center for Global Development, 2011.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Istazk|first1=Lennon|title=Alles over een Klein Bedrag Lenen.|url=https://kleinbedraglenen.nl/|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Klein bedrag lenen|date=4 July 2014}}</ref> However, global average interest rates for microfinance loans are still well above 30%.\n\nThe answer to providing microfinance services at an affordable cost may lie in rethinking one of the fundamental assumptions underlying microfinance: that microfinance borrowers need extensive monitoring and interaction with loan officers in order to benefit from and repay their loans. The P2P microlending service [[Zidisha]] is based on this premise, facilitating direct interaction between individual lenders and borrowers via an internet community rather than physical offices. Zidisha has managed to bring the cost of microloans to below 10% for borrowers, including interest which is paid out to lenders. However, it remains to be seen whether such radical alternative models can reach the scale necessary to compete with traditional microfinance programs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Katic |first=Gordon |url=http://www.terry.ubc.ca/2013/02/20/terry-project-podcast-21-micro-finance-lending-a-hand-to-the-poor/ |title=Micro-finance, Lending a Hand to the Poor? |publisher=Terry.ubc.ca |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===Use of loans===\nPractitioners and donors from the charitable side of microfinance frequently argue for restricting microcredit to loans for productive purposes\u2014such as to start or expand a [[microenterprise]].

Although it is generally agreed that microfinance practitioners should seek to balance these goals to some extent, there are a wide variety of strategies, ranging from the minimalist profit-orientation of [[BancoSol]] in [[Bolivia]] to the highly integrated not-for-profit orientation of [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] in [[Bangladesh]].

Evidence shows that they are less likely to default on their loans than men. Industry data from 2006 for 704 MFIs reaching 52 million borrowers includes MFIs using the [[solidarity lending]] methodology (99.3% female clients) and MFIs using individual lending (51% female clients). The delinquency rate for solidarity lending was 0.9% after 30 days (individual lending\u20143.1%), while 0.3% of loans were written off (individual lending\u20140.9%).<ref>{{cite web| last = Microfinance Information Exchange, Inc.| title = MicroBanking Bulletin Issue #15, Autumn, 2007, pp. 46,49| publisher = Microfinance Information Exchange, Inc.| date = 2007-08-01| url = http://www.themix.org/microbanking-bulletin/mbb-issue-no-15-autumn-2007| accessdate = 2010-01-15| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100105152122/http://www.themix.org/microbanking-bulletin/mbb-issue-no-15-autumn-2007| archivedate = 2010-01-05}}</ref>  Because operating margins become tighter the smaller the loans delivered, many MFIs consider the risk of lending to men to be too high. This focus on women is questioned sometimes, however a recent study of microentrepreneurs from Sri Lanka published by the [[World Bank]] found that the return on capital for male-owned businesses (half of the sample) averaged 11%, whereas the return for women-owned businesses was 0% or slightly negative.<ref>{{cite web| last = McKenzie| first = David| title = Comments Made at IPA/FAI Microfinance Conference Oct. 17 2008 | publisher = Philanthropy Action | date = 2008-10-17| url = http://www.philanthropyaction.com/nc/what_is_it_about_women/| accessdate = 2008-10-17}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance's emphasis on female-oriented lending is the subject of controversy, as it is claimed that microfinance improves the status of women through an alleviation of poverty. It is argued that by providing women with initial capital, they will be able to support themselves independent of men, in a manner which would encourage sustainable growth of enterprise and eventual self-sufficiency.  This claim has yet to be proven in any substantial form. Moreover, the attraction of women as a potential investment base is precisely because they are constrained by socio-cultural norms regarding such concepts of obedience, familial duty, household maintenance and passivity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bruton, Chavez & Khavul|first1=G.D., H. & S.|title=Microlending in emerging economies:building a new line of inquiry from the ground up|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=2011|volume=42|issue=5|pages=718\u2013739|doi=10.1057/jibs.2010.58}}</ref> The result of these norms is that while micro-lending may enable women to improve their daily subsistence to a more steady pace, they will not be able to engage in market-oriented business practice beyond a limited scope of low-skilled, low-earning, informal work.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bee|first1=Beth|title=Gender, solidarity and the paradox of microfinance: Reflections from Bolivia|journal=Gender, Place & Culture|date=2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=23\u201343|doi=10.1080/0966369X.2011.535298}}</ref> Part of this is a lack of permissivity in the society; part a reflection of the added burdens of household maintenance that women shoulder alone as a result of microfinancial empowerment; and part a lack of training and education surrounding gendered conceptions of economics. In particular, the shift in norms such that women continue to be responsible for all the domestic private sphere labour as well as undertaking public economic support for their families, independent of male aid increases rather than decreases burdens on already limited persons.\n[[Image:Microfinance in Malawi.jpg|thumb|Women of Malawi posing with their savings box]]\nIf there were to be an exchange of labour, or if women's income were supplemental rather than essential to household maintenance, there might be some truth to claims of establishing long-term businesses; however when so constrained it is impossible for women to do more than pay off a current loan only to take on another in a cyclic pattern which is beneficial to the financier but hardly to the borrower.  This gender essentializing crosses over from institutionalized lenders such as the Grameen Bank into interpersonal direct lending through charitable crowd-funding operations, such as Kiva. More recently, the popularity of non-profit global online lending has grown, suggesting that a redress of gender norms might be instituted through individual selection fomented by the processes of such programs, but the reality is as yet uncertain. Studies have noted that the likelihood of lending to women, individually or in groups, is 38% higher than rates of lending to men.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ly & Mason|first1=P. & G.|title=Individual preference over development projects:evidence from microlending on Kiva|journal=Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations|date=2012|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1036\u20131055|doi=10.1007/s11266-011-9255-8}}</ref>\n\nThis is also due to a general trend for interpersonal microfinance relations to be conducted on grounds of similarity and internal/external recognition: lenders want to see something familiar, something supportable in potential borrowers, so an emphasis on family, goals of education and health, and a commitment to community all achieve positive results from prospective financiers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Allison, Davis, Short & Webb|first1=T.H., B.C., J.C., & J.W.|title=Crowdfunding in a prosocial microlending environment: examining the role of intrinsic versus extrinsic cues|journal=Entrepreneurship|date=2015|volume=39|issue=1|pages=53\u201373}}</ref> Unfortunately, these labels disproportionately align with women rather than men, particularly in the developing world. The result is that microfinance continues to rely on restrictive gender norms rather than seek to subvert them through economic redress in terms of foundation change: training, business management and financial education are all elements which might be included in parameters of female-aimed loans and until they are the fundamental reality of women as a disadvantaged section of societies in developing states will go untested.\n\n====Organizations supporting this work====\n* [[FINCA International|FINCA]] <ref name=\"4Ways\" />\n*[https://nwtf.org.ph/ NWTF]\n*[https://akhuwat.org.pk/ akhuwat Foundation Pakistan]\n*[https://alkhidmat.org/mawakhat/ Alkhidmat Foundation Pakistan]\n*[https://www.wholeplanetfoundation.org/ Whole Planet Foundation]\n*[[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kiva.org/|title=Kiva - Loans that change lives|website=Kiva|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n*[https://microfinancecouncil.org/ MCPI]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://microfinancecouncil.org/|title=Microfinance Council of the Philippines - Link Against Poverty|website=Microfinance Council of the Philippines|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n*[[Women's World Banking|Women's World Banking]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womensworldbanking.org/|title=Women's World Banking {{!}} Women's Financial Inclusion|website=Women's World Banking|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n===Benefits and limitations===\nMicrofinancing produces many benefits for poverty stricken and low-income households. One of the benefits is that it is very accessible. Banks today simply won't extend loans to those with little to no assets, and generally don't engage in small size loans typically associated with microfinancing. Through microfinancing small loans are produced and accessible.  Microfinancing is based on the philosophy that even small amounts of credit can help end the cycle of poverty. Another benefit produced from the microfinancing initiative is that it presents opportunities, such as extending education and jobs. Families receiving microfinancing are less likely to pull their children out of school for economic reasons. As well, in relation to employment, people are more likely to open small businesses that will aid the creation of new jobs. Overall, the benefits outline that the microfinancing initiative is set out to improve the standard of living amongst impoverished communities (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nThere are also many social and financial challenges for microfinance initiatives. For example, more articulate and better-off community members may cheat poorer or less-educated neighbours. This may occur intentionally or inadvertently through loosely run organizations. As a result, many microfinance initiatives require a large amount of social capital or trust in order to work effectively. The ability of poorer people to save may also fluctuate over time as unexpected costs may take priority which could result in them being able to save little or nothing some weeks. Rates of inflation may cause funds to lose their value, thus financially harming the saver and not benefiting the collector (Rutherford, 2009).\n\n==History of microfinance==\n\nOver the past centuries, practical visionaries, from the [[Franciscan]] friars who founded the community-oriented [[pawnbroker|pawnshops]] of the 15th century to the founders of the [[Europe]]an [[credit union]] movement in the 19th century (such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen]]) and the founders of the [[microcredit]] movement in the 1970s (such as [[Muhammad Yunus]] and [[Al Whittaker]]), have tested practices and built institutions designed to bring the kinds of opportunities and risk-management tools that financial services can provide to the doorsteps of poor people.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book| last =Helms| first =Brigit| title =Access for All: Building Inclusive Financial Systems| publisher =[[The World Bank]]| year =2006| location =[[Washington, D.C.]]| isbn =978-0-8213-6360-7}}</ref> While the success of the [[Grameen Bank]] (which now serves over 7 million poor Bangladeshi women) has inspired the world,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} it has proved difficult to replicate this success. In nations with lower population densities, meeting the operating costs of a retail branch by serving nearby customers has proven considerably more challenging. Hans Dieter Seibel, board member of the European Microfinance Platform, is in favour of the group model. This particular model (used by many Microfinance institutions) makes financial sense, he says, because it reduces transaction costs. Microfinance programmes also need to be based on local funds.<ref>[http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/166482/index.en.shtml]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214075542/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/166482/index.en.shtml|date=December 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe history of microfinancing can be traced back as far as the middle of the 1800s, when the theorist [[Lysander Spooner]] was writing about the benefits of small credits to entrepreneurs and farmers as a way of getting the people out of poverty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Independently of Spooner, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen]] founded the first cooperative lending banks to support farmers in rural [[Germany]].<ref>[http://www.raiffeisen.de/genossenschaften/genossenschaften/pdf/Raiffeisen-Organisation-englisch.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810074631/http://www.raiffeisen.de/genossenschaften/genossenschaften/pdf/Raiffeisen-Organisation-englisch.pdf|date=August 10, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe modern use of the expression \"microfinancing\" has roots in the 1970s when [[Grameen Bank]] of [[Bangladesh]], founded by microfinance pioneer [[Muhammad Yunus]], was starting and shaping the modern industry of microfinancing.

They receive loans and [[grants]] from [[charities]]. They buy insurance from state-owned companies. They receive funds transfers through formal or informal [[remittance]] networks. It is not easy to distinguish microfinance from similar activities. It could be claimed that a government that orders state banks to open deposit accounts for poor consumers, or a moneylender that engages in [[usury]], or a charity that runs a [[Heifer International|heifer pool]] are engaged in microfinance. Ensuring financial services to poor people is best done by expanding the number of financial institutions available to them, as well as by strengthening the capacity of those institutions. In recent years there has also been increasing emphasis on expanding the diversity of institutions, since different institutions serve different needs.\n\nSome principles that summarize a century and a half of development practice were encapsulated in 2004 by CGAP and endorsed by the [[Group of Eight]] leaders at the G8 Summit on June 10, 2004:<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n#Poor people need not just loans but also savings, [[insurance]] and [[Electronic funds transfer|money transfer]] services.\n#Microfinance must be useful to poor households: helping them raise income, build up assets and/or cushion themselves against external shocks.\n#\"Microfinance can pay for itself.\"<ref>Helms (2006), p. xi</ref>  Subsidies from donors and government are scarce and uncertain and so, to reach large numbers of poor people, microfinance must pay for itself.\n#Microfinance means building permanent local institutions.\n#Microfinance also means integrating the financial needs of poor people into a country's mainstream financial system.\n#\"The job of government is to enable financial services, not to provide them.\"<ref name=autogenerated3>Helms (2006), p. xii</ref>\n#\"Donor funds should complement private [[Financial capital|capital]], not compete with it.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n#\"The key [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] is the shortage of strong institutions and managers.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />  Donors should focus on capacity building.\n#[[Interest rate ceiling]]s hurt poor people by preventing microfinance institutions from covering their costs, which chokes off the supply of credit.\n#Microfinance institutions should measure and disclose their performance\u2014both financially and socially.\n\nMicrofinance is considered a tool for socio-economic development, and can be clearly distinguished from charity.  Families who are destitute, or so poor they are unlikely to be able to generate the cash flow required to repay a loan, should be recipients of charity. Others are best served by financial institutions.\n\n==Scale of microfinance operations==\n[[File:Small Enterprise Foundation - loan officer.jpg|thumb|Two women talk about financial matters.

A benchmark was established by an analysis of 'alternative financial institutions' in the developing world in 2004.<ref>Robert Peck Christen, Richard Rosenberg & Veena Jayadeva.  ''Financial institutions with a double-bottom line:  implications for the future of microfinance''.  CGAP Occasional Paper, July 2004.</ref>  The authors counted approximately 665 million client accounts at over 3,000 institutions that are serving people who are poorer than those served by the commercial banks. Of these accounts, 120 million were with institutions normally understood to practice microfinance. Reflecting the diverse historical roots of the movement, however, they also included postal [[savings bank]]s (318 million accounts), state agricultural and [[Community development bank|development bank]]s (172 million accounts), financial [[cooperatives]] and [[credit unions]] (35 million accounts) and specialized rural banks (19 million accounts).\n\nRegionally, the highest concentration of these accounts was in [[India]] (188 million accounts representing 18% of the total national population). The lowest concentrations were in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] (14 million accounts representing 3% of the total population) and [[Africa]] (27 million accounts representing 4% of the total population, with the highest rate of penetration in West Africa, and the highest growth rate in Eastern and Southern Africa <ref>{{cite web| last = MFW4A - Microfinance | title = MFW4A - Microfinance | date = 2010-11-05 | url = http://www.mfw4a.org/access-to-finance/microfinance.html}}</ref> ). Considering that most bank clients in the developed world need several active accounts to keep their affairs in order, these figures indicate that the task the microfinance movement has set for itself is still very far from finished.\n\nBy type of service, \"savings accounts in alternative finance institutions outnumber loans by about four to one.

They served low-income and marginalized [[minority group|minority communities]]. By 2007, there were 500 microfinance organizations operating in the US with 200 lending capital.<ref name=micro />\n\nThere were three key factors that triggered the growth in domestic microfinance:\n# Change in social welfare policies and focus on economic development and job creation at the macro level.\n# Encouragement of employment, including [[self-employment]], as a strategy for improving the lives of the poor.\n# The increase in the proportion of [[Latin American]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] immigrants who came from societies where microenterprises are prevalent.\nThese factors incentivized the public and private supports to have microlending activity in the United States.<ref name=micro />\n\n===Canada===\nMicrofinance in Canada took shape through the development of credit unions. These credit unions provided financial services to the Canadians who could not get access to traditional financial means. Two separate branches of credit unions developed in Canada to serve the financially marginalized segment of the population. [[Alphonse Desjardins (co-operator)|Alphonse Desjardins]] introduced the establishment of savings and credit services in late 1900 to the [[Quebec]]ois who did not have financial access. Approximately 30 years later [[Moses Coady|Father Moses Coady]] introduced credit unions to [[Nova Scotia]]. These were the models of the modern institutions still present in Canada today.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Chantelle|author2=Christian Novak|title=Low Income Entrepreneurs and their Access to Financing in Canada, Especially in the Province of Quebec/City of Montreal|date=May 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nEfforts to transfer specific microfinance innovations such as [[solidarity lending]] from developing countries to Canada have met with little success.<ref>See for example Cheryl Frankiewicz ''Calmeadow Metrofund:  a Canadian experiment in sustainable microfinance'', Calmeadow Foundation, 2001.</ref>\n\nSelected microfinance institutions in Canada are:\n*'''[[Rise Asset Development]]'''\nFounded by Sandra Rotman in 2009, Rise is a Rotman and CAMH initiative that provides small business loans, leases, and lines of credit to entrepreneurs with mental health and/or addiction challenges.\n*'''[[Alterna Savings]]'''\nFormed in 2005 through the merging of the Civil Service Savings and Loan Society and the Metro Credit Union, Alterna is a financial alternative to Canadians.

Momentum provides individuals and families who want to better their financial situation take control of finances, become computer literate, secure employment, borrow and repay loans for business, and purchase homes.\n*'''[[Vancity]]'''\nFounded in 1946, Vancity is now the largest English speaking credit union in Canada.\n\n'''Limitations'''\n\nComplications specific to Canada include the need for loans of a substantial size in comparison to the ones typically seen in many international microfinance initiatives. Microfinance is also limited by the rules and limitations surrounding money-lending. For example, Canada Revenue Agency limits the loans made in these sort of transactions to a maximum of $25,000. As a result, many people look to banks to provide these loans. Also, microfinance in Canada is driven by profit which, as a result, fails to advance the social development of community members. Within marginalized or impoverished Canadian communities, banks may not be readily accessible to deposit or take out funds. These banks which would have charged little or no interest on small amounts of cash are replaced by lending companies. Here, these companies may charge extremely large interest rates to marginalized community members thus increasing the cycle of poverty and profiting off of another's loss (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nIn Canada, microfinancing competes with pay-day loans institutions which take advantage of marginalized and low-income individuals by charging extremely high, predatory interest rates. Communities with low social capital often don't have the networks to implement and support microfinance initiatives, leading  to the proliferation of pay day loan institutions. Pay day loan companies are unlike traditional microfinance in that they don't encourage collectivism and social capital building in low income communities, however exist solely for profit.\n\n==Microfinance in Pakistan==\nIn Pakistan \nAkhuwat is the world\u2019s largest Islamic micro-finance organization. Since 2001, Akhuwat has been working for poverty alleviation by empowering socially and economically marginalized segments of the society through its various poverty alleviation projects.\n\nAkhuwat aims to alleviate poverty by creating a bond of solidarity between the affluent and the marginalized. Our goal is to develop and sustain a social system based on mutual support. Akhuwat not only helps and support the poor to become self-reliant but combined with their own hard work enable them to escape the clutches of poverty.\n\n'''Philosophy of Akhuwat'''\n\nAkhuwat derives its name from \u2018mawakhaat\u2019 or brotherhood, the earliest example of which was seen in the community formed by the Ansars, citizens of Medina and the Muhajireen, who had migrated to Medina to escape religious persecution. Inspired by the spirit which induced the Medinites to share half of their wealth with the migrants, Akhuwat seeks to invoke this very concept of brotherhood through its operations. For Akhuwat, the metaphor of brotherhood entails the creation of a system based on mutual support in the society.\n\n'''Akhuwat\u2019s Values'''\n\nAkhuwat is running on the following principles:\n\nInterest-free Loans \u2013 The loan provided will be interest free since providing loans with interest is business and poverty cannot be alleviated and eradicated by doing business with the deprived.\nUse of Religious Places \u2013 Akhuwat wants to climb up the ladder of social and economic development through making Mosques, churches and religious places, the foundation. This is because in Islamic history Mosques used to be the seat of governance. In the time of Muhammad, mosques were used for worship, training and providing services. With this, comes the Transparency, Good Governance, participation and accountability.\nVolunteerism \u2013 To think beyond the confines of oneself and to think about others. Akhuwat\u2019s operations and activities rely upon the passion, energy, zeal and enthusiasm of its volunteers.\nTransforming Borrowers into Donors \u2013 Akhuwat strives to empower its borrowers, so they are in a position to be givers one day.\nNon-Discrimination on Caste, Color, Creed, Political Affiliation & Faith \u2013 Since Akhuwat strongly believes in solidarity and brotherhood. Therefore, it gives a message to cut down all the discriminatory and differential barriers in the society such as caste, color creed, political affiliation and religion.\n\n'''Core Principles'''\n\n'''INTEREST-FREE LOANS'''\n\nAkhuwat provides interest free loans to the economically poor so that they may acquire a sustainable livelihood. The organization sees interest as a barrier to widespread proliferation of capital, and a violation of all moral and ethical codes. In keeping with the principles of equity and social justice, burdening the poor with exorbitant interest rates is also viewed as undermining the overarching goal of poverty alleviation.\n\n\n==Microfinance on the Indian subcontinent==\n\nLoans to poor people by banks have many limitations including lack of security and high operating costs. As a result, microfinance was developed as an alternative to provide loans to poor people with the goal of creating financial inclusion and equality.\n\n'''[[Ela Bhatt]]''' had initiated women's own [[Self Employed Women's Association#Economic tools|SEWA Cooperative Bank]] in 1974 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, perhaps one of the first modern day microfinance institution of its kind. '''[[Muhammad Yunus]]''', a Nobel Prize winner, had introduced the concept of Micro-credit in Bangladesh in the form of the \"Grameen Bank\". The [[National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development]] (NABARD) looked at several models for offering financial services to the unbanked, especially women, and decided to experiment with a very different model, now popularly known as Self-help Groups (SHGs). In this approach, a small group of women (and men) are able to form their own little mini bank, self-governed and managed, and create links with banks [[Self-help group (finance)|SHGs]] (Self-help groups), [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and banks. SHGs are often formed and nurtured by NGOs and only after accomplishing a certain level of maturity in terms of their internal thrift and credit operations, they are able to save, and also seek credit from the banks. There is often an involvement of an NGO, or a government agency during initial training and even after the SHG-Bank linkage. The SHG-Bank linkage programme, which has been in place since 1992 in India, has savings accounts with 7.9 million SHGs, with 4.6 million SHGs having outstanding loans, with approximately $2 billion in saving with banks, and $8.9 Billion is outstanding loans, making it one of the largest microfinance program of its kind in the world (March 2016). It involves commercial banks, regional rural banks (RRBs) and cooperative banks in its operations.\n\nIn 2013, Grameen Capital India was able to loan $144 million to microfinance groups. In addition to Grameen Bank, [[Equitas Small Finance Bank|Equitas]] has been another microfinance organization in Tamil Nadu. The South and Western states are the ones attracting the greatest number of microfinance loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21569447-industry-starting-revive-road-redemption|title=Road to redemption|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance is defined as, financial services such as savings accounts, insurance funds and credit provided to poor and low income clients so as to help them increase their income, thereby improving their standard of living.\n\nIn this context the main features of microfinance are:\n\n* Loan given without security\n* Loans to those people who live below the poverty line\n* Members of SHGs may benefit from micro finance\n* Maximum limit of loan under micro finance Rs.25,000/-\n* Terms and conditions offered to poor people are decided by NGOs\n* Microfinance is different from Microcredit- under the latter, small loans are given to the borrower but under microfinance alongside many other financial services including savings accounts and insurance. Therefore, microfinance has a wider concept than microcredit.\n\nIn June 2014, CRISIL released its latest report on the Indian Microfinance Sector titled \"India's 25 Leading MFI's\".<ref>[http://indiamicrofinance.com/microfinance-companies-in-india-2014-2015-2.html Top Microfinance Institutions in India for 2014] CRISIL Report, June 2014.</ref> This list is the most comprehensive and up to date overview of the microfinance sector in India and the different microfinance institutions operating in the sub-continent.\n\nMany loan officers in India create an emotional connection with the borrowers before the loan reaches maturity by mentioning details about borrowers\u2019 personal life and family and also demonstrating affection in different ways as a strategy to generate pressure during recovery.<ref>Kar, S.

Established in 1993, the Microfinance Network provided support to members that helped steer many industry leaders to sustainability, and profitability in many of their largest markets. Today as the sector enters a new period of transition, with the rise of digital [[financial technology]] that increasingly competes with traditional microfinance institutions, the Microfinance Network provides a space to discuss opportunities and challenges that arise from emerging technological innovations in inclusive finance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://microfinancenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Future-of-Financial-Inclusion_MFN_London2017_Summary5825.pdf|title=The Future of Financial Inclusion: A Leadership Challenge|last=Velarde|display-authors=etal|first=Raul|date=April 2017|website=microfinancenetwork.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320044143/http://microfinancenetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/The-Future-of-Financial-Inclusion_MFN_London2017_Summary5825.pdf|archive-date=20 March 2018|url-status=|access-date=19 March 2018}}</ref> The Microfinance Network convenes once a year. Members include Al Majmoua, BRAC, BancoSol, Gentera, Kamurj, LAPO, and SOGESOL.\n\n=== Partnership for Responsible Financial Inclusion ===\nThe [https://responsiblefinancialinclusion.org/ Partnership for Responsible Financial], previously known as the Microfinance CEO Working Group, is a collaborative effort of leading international organizations and their CEOs active in the microfinance and inclusive finance space, including direct microfinance practitioners, and microfinance funders. It consists of 10 members, including Accion, Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance, BRAC, CARE USA, FINCA Impact Finance, Grameen Foundation, Opportunity International, Pro Mujer, Vision Fund International and Women's World Banking.  Harnessing the power of the CEOs and their senior managers, the PRFI advocates for responsible financial services and seeks catalytic opportunities to accelerate financial access to the unserved. As part of this focus, PRFI is responsible for setting up the Smart Campaign, in response to negative microfinance practices that indicated the mistreatment of clients in certain markets. The network is made up of the CEO working group, that meet quarterly and several subcommittee working groups dedicated to communications, social performance, digital financial services, and legal and human resources issues.....\n\n=== European Microfinance Network ===\nThe [https://www.european-microfinance.org/ European Microfinance Network] was established in response to many legal and political obstacles affecting the microfinance sector in Europe. The Network is involved in advocacy on a wide range of issues related to microfinance, micro-enterprises, social and financial exclusion, self-employment and employment creation. Its main activity is the organisation of its annual conference, which has taken place each year since 2004. The EMN has a wide network of over 100 members.\n\n=== Africa Microfinance Network (AFMIN) ===\nThe [http://www.afminetwork.org/ Africa Microfinance Network (AFMIN)] is an association of microfinance networks in Africa resulting from an initiative led by African microfinance practitioners to create and/or strengthen country-level microfinance networks for the purpose of establishing shared performance standards, institutional capacity and policy change. \nAFMIN was formally launched in November 2000 and has established its secretariat in Abidjan (Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire), where AFMIN is legally recognized as an international Non-Governmental Organisation pursuant to Ivorian laws. Because of the political unrest in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, AFMIN temporarily relocated its office to Cotonou in Benin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afminetwork.org/about.html|title=AFMIN Website - About}}</ref>\n\n==Inclusive financial systems==\nThe [[microcredit]] movement that began in the 1970s has emerged and morphed into a 'financial systems' approach for creating universal financial inclusion.  While Grameen model of delivering small credit achieved a great deal, especially in urban and near-urban areas and with [[entrepreneurial]] families, its progress in delivering financial services in less densely populated rural areas was slow; creating the need for many and multiple models to emerge across the globe. The terms have evolved from Microcredit, to Microfinance, and now Financial Inclusion. Specialized microfinance institutions (MFIs) continue to expand their services, collaborating and competing with banks, credit unions, mobile money, and other informal and formal member owned institutions.\n\nThe new financial systems approach pragmatically acknowledges the richness of centuries of microfinance history and the immense diversity of institutions serving poor people in developing and developed economies today.  It is also rooted in an increasing awareness of diversity of the financial service needs of the world's poorest people, and the diverse settings in which they live and work. It also acknowledges that quality and rage of financial services are also important for the banking system to achieve fuller and deeper financial inclusion, for all. Central banks and mainstream banks are now more intimately engaging in the financial inclusion agenda than ever before, though it is a long road, with over 35-40% of worlds adults remaining outside formal banking system, and many more remaining 'under-banked'. Advent of mobile phone based money management and digital finance is changing the scenario fast; though 'social-distance' between economically poor/ social marginalized and the banking system remain large, unfortunately.\n\n;Informal financial service providers: These include moneylenders, [[pawnbrokers]], savings collectors, [[money-guards]], ROSCAs, [[ASCAs]] and input supply shops.  These continue their services because they know each other well and live in the same community, they understand each other's financial circumstances and can offer very flexible, convenient and fast services.  These services can also be costly and the choice of financial products limited and very short-term.  Informal services that involve savings are also risky; many people lose their money.\n\n;Member-owned organizations: These include [[Self-help group (finance)|self-help group]]s, [[Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs)]], [[Credit union]]s, [[CVECA]]s and a variety of other members owned and governed informal or formal financial institutions.  Informal groups, like their more traditional cousins, are generally small and local, which means they have access to good knowledge about each other's financial circumstances and can offer convenience and flexibility.  Since they are managed by poor people, their costs of operation are low.  Often, they do not need regulation and supervision, unless they grow in scale and formalize themselves by coming together to form II or III tier federations. If not prepared well, they can be 'captured' by a few influential leaders, and run the risk of members losing their savings. Experience suggests though that these informal but highly disciplined groups are very sustainable, and continue to exist even after 20\u201325 years. Formalization, as a Cooperative of Credit Union, can help create links with the banking system for more sophisticated financial products and additional capital for loans; but requires strong leadership and systems. These models are highly popular in many rural regions of countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America; and a platform for creating deeper financial inclusion.\n\n;NGOs: The [[Microcredit Summit Campaign]] counted 3,316 of these MFIs and [[NGO]]s lending to about 133 million clients by the end of 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microcreditsummit.org/pubs/reports/socr/2007.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222154645/http://www.microcreditsummit.org/pubs/reports/socr/2007.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-12-22 |title=''State of the Microcredit Summit Campaign Report 2007'', Microcredit Summit Campaign, Washington, 2007. |publisher=Microcreditsummit.org |date=2006-12-31 |accessdate=2011-03-25 }}</ref>  Led by [[Grameen Bank]] and [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] in [[Bangladesh]], [[Prodem]] in [[Bolivia]], [[Opportunity International]], and [[FINCA International]], headquartered in Washington, DC, these NGOs have spread around the developing world in the past three decades; others, like the [[Gamelan Council]], address larger regions.  They have proven very innovative, pioneering banking techniques like [[solidarity lending]], [[village banking]] and [[mobile banking]] that have overcome barriers to serving poor populations.  However, with boards that don't necessarily represent either their capital or their customers, their governance structures can be fragile, and they can become overly dependent on external donors.\n\n;Formal financial institutions: In addition to commercial banks, these include state banks, agricultural development banks, savings banks, rural banks and non-bank financial institutions.  They are regulated and supervised, offer a wider range of financial services, and control a branch network that can extend across the country and internationally.  However, they have proved reluctant to adopt social missions, and due to their high costs of operation, often can't deliver services to poor or remote populations. The increasing use of [[alternative data]] in credit scoring, such as [[trade credit]] is increasing commercial banks' interest in microfinance.<ref>[http://www.infopolicy.org/_working/files/downloads/South-Africa-compressed-web.pdf Turner, Michael, Robin Varghese, et al. ''Information Sharing and SMME Financing in South Africa'', [[Political and Economic Research Council]] (PERC), p58.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001222753/http://www.infopolicy.org/_working/files/downloads/South-Africa-compressed-web.pdf |date=2008-10-01 }}</ref>\n\nWith appropriate regulation and supervision, each of these institutional types can bring leverage to solving the microfinance problem.  For example, efforts are being made to link self-help groups to commercial banks, to network member-owned organizations together to achieve [[economies of scale]] and scope, and to support efforts by commercial banks to 'down-scale' by integrating mobile banking and e-payment technologies into their extensive branch networks.\n\nBrigit Helms in her book 'Access for All: Building Inclusive Financial Systems', distinguishes between four general categories of microfinance providers, and argues for a pro-active strategy of engagement with all of them to help them achieve the goals of the microfinance movement.<ref>Brigit Helms.  ''Access for All:  Building Inclusive Financial Systems.''  CGAP/World Bank, Washington, 2006, pp. 35-57.</ref>\n\n==Microcredit and the Web==\n\nDue to the unbalanced emphasis on credit at the expense of microsavings, as well as a desire to link Western investors to the sector, [[peer-to-peer lending|peer-to-peer]] platforms have developed to expand the availability of microcredit through individual lenders in the developed world. New platforms that connect lenders to micro-entrepreneurs are emerging on the Web (''[[list of microfinance sponsors|peer-to-peer sponsors]]''), for example [[MYC4]], [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]], [[Zidisha]], myELEN, [[Opportunity International]] and the [[Microloan Foundation]]. Another Web-based microlender [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]] uses a variation on the usual microlending model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] became the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.<ref>[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ \"Zidisha Set to \"Expand\" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance\", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008230104/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ |date=October 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe volume channeled through [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]]'s peer-to-peer platform is about $100 million as of November 2009 (Kiva facilitates approximately $5M in loans each month).

Criticism focuses on the impact on poverty, the level of interest rates, high profits, overindebtedness and suicides. Other criticism include the role of foreign donors and working conditions in companies affiliated to microfinance institutions, particularly in Bangladesh.\n\n===Impact===\n{{Details|Impact of microcredit}}\nThe impact of microcredit is a subject of much controversy. Proponents state that it reduces poverty through higher employment and higher incomes. This is expected to lead to improved nutrition and improved education of the borrowers' children. Some argue that microcredit empowers women. In the US and Canada, it is argued that microcredit helps recipients to graduate from welfare programs.\n\nCritics say that microcredit has not increased incomes, but has driven poor households into a debt trap, in some cases even leading to suicide. They add that the money from loans is often used for durable consumer goods or consumption instead of being used for productive investments, that it fails to empower women, and that it has not improved health or education. Moreover, as the access to micro-loans is widespread, borrowers tend to acquire several loans from different companies, making it nearly impossible to pay the debt back.<ref>Biswas, Soutik (December 16, 2010). \"India's micro-finance suicide epidemic\". [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11997571], BBC News. Retrieved July 15, 2015.</ref> As a result of such tragic events, microfinance institutions in India have agreed on setting an interest rate ceiling of 15 percent.<ref>\nSundaresan, S. (2008). Microfinance emerging trends and challenges (pp. 15-16). Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar.\n978-1847209207</ref> This is important because microfinance loan recipients have a higher level of security  in repaying the loans and a lower level of risk in failing to repay them.\n\nUnintended consequences of microfinance include informal intermediaton: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to even poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|doi = 10.18356/10695889-en|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103\u2013117|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}</ref>\n\n=== Competition and market saturation ===\nMicrocredit has also received criticism for inducing market saturation and fueling problematically competitive, rather than collaborative business communities<ref name=\"Crises\">{{Cite journal|last=Gu\u00e9rin|first=Isabelle|last2=Labie|first2=Marc|last3=Servet|first3=Jean-Michel|date=2015|title=The Crises of Microcredit|url=https://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/ucpbkecon/9781783603756.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"Challenges\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.findevgateway.org/library/microfinance-challenges-empowerment-or-disempowerment-poor|title=Microfinance Challenges: Empowerment or Disempowerment of the Poor?|date=2014-04-11|website=FinDev Gateway - CGAP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>. The influx of supply generated by the creation of new microcredit-fueled-businesses can be difficult for small economies to absorb. The owners of micro-enterprises within such communities often have limited skill sets and resources available. This can cause a \u201ccopycat\u201d phenomenon among small business due to the limited variation in products and services offerings.<ref name=\"Crises\" /> The high number of individuals selling similar products and services can cause new entrepreneurs to be subject to cutthroat competition over a demand that has not expanded proportionally with the supply.<ref name=\"Challenges\" />\n\n===Mission drift in microfinance===\n\nMission drift refers to the phenomena through which the MFIs or the micro finance institutions increasingly try to cater to customers who are better off than their original customers, primarily the poor families. Roy Mersland and R. \u00d8ystein Str\u00f8m in their research on mission drift suggest that this selection bias can come not only through an increase in the average loan size, which allows for financially stronger individuals to get the loans, but also through the MFI's particular lending methodology, main market of operation, or even the gender bias as further mission drift measures.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Mersland | first1 = Roy | last2 = Str\u00f8m | first2 = R. \u00d8ystein | title = Microfinance mission drift? | journal = [[World Development (journal)|World Development]] | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 28\u201336 | doi = 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.05.006 | date = January 2010 | ref = harv | hdl = 11250/2428249 | url = https://oda.hioa.no/en/item/asset/dspace:1298/523226post.pdf }}</ref> And as it may follow, this selective funding would lead to lower risks and lower costs for the firm.\n\nHowever, economists Beatriz Armend\u00e1riz and Ariane Szafarz suggests that  this phenomenon is not driven by cost minimization alone. She suggests that it happens because of the interplay between the company's mission, the cost differential between poor and unbanked wealthier clients and region specific characteristics pertaining the heterogeneity of their clientele.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Armend\u00e1riz | first1 = Beatriz | last2 = Szafarz | first2 =Ariane | contribution = On mission drift in microfinance institutions | editor-last1 = Armend\u00e1riz | editor-first1 = Beatriz | editor-last2 = Labie | editor-first2 = Marc | title = The handbook of microfinance | pages = 341\u2013366 | publisher = [[World Scientific]] | location = Singapore Hackensack, New Jersey | year = 2011 | isbn = 9789814295659 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> But in either way, this problem of selective funding leads to an ethical tradeoff where on one hand there is an economic reason for the company to restrict its loans to only the individuals who qualify the standards, and on the other hand there is an ethical responsibility to help the poor people get out of poverty through the provision of capital.\n\n===Role of foreign donors===\nThe role of donors has also been questioned.  CGAP recently commented that \"a large proportion of the money they spend is not effective, either because it gets hung up in unsuccessful and often complicated funding mechanisms (for example, a government apex facility), or it goes to partners that are not held accountable for performance. In some cases, poorly conceived programs have retarded the development of inclusive financial systems by distorting markets and displacing domestic commercial initiatives with cheap or free money.\"<ref>Brigit Helms.  ''Access for All:  Building Inclusive Financial Systems.''  CGAP/World Bank, Washington, 2006, p. 97.</ref>\n\n===Working conditions in enterprises affiliated to MFIs===\nThere has also been criticism of microlenders for not taking more responsibility for the working conditions of poor households, particularly when borrowers become quasi-wage labourers, selling crafts or agricultural produce through an organization controlled by the MFI. The desire of MFIs to help their borrower diversify and increase their incomes has sparked this type of relationship in several countries, most notably [[Bangladesh]], where hundreds of thousands of borrowers effectively work as wage labourers for the marketing subsidiaries of [[Grameen Bank]] or [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]]. Critics maintain that there are few if any rules or standards in these cases governing working hours, holidays, working conditions, safety or child labour, and few inspection regimes to correct abuses.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Farooque |date=June 24, 2007 |title=The metamorphosis of the micro-credit debtor |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2007/jun/24/oped.html |location=Dhaka |newspaper=New Age |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410121959/http://www.newagebd.com/2007/jun/24/oped.html |archive-date=April 10, 2008}}</ref>  Some of these concerns have been taken up by [[trade union|union]]s and [[socially responsible investing|socially responsible investment]] advocates.\n\n===Abuse===\nIn Nigeria cases of fraud have been reported.

''[[Financial institutions]] with a [[Double bottom line|double-bottom line]]:  implications for the future of microfinance''.  [[Partnership|CGAP]] Occasional Paper, July 2004, pp. 2-3.</ref>\n\nMicrofinance initially had a limited definition - the provision of microloans to poor entrepreneurs and small businesses lacking access to [[credit]]. The two main mechanisms for the delivery of financial services to such clients were: (1) relationship-based banking for individual entrepreneurs and small businesses; and (2) group-based models, where several entrepreneurs come together to apply for loans and other services as a group. Over time, microfinance has emerged as a larger [[social movement|movement]] whose object is \"a world in which as everyone, especially the poor and socially marginalized people and households have access to a wide range of affordable, high quality financial products and services, including not just credit but also savings, insurance, payment services, and [[Electronic funds transfer|fund transfers]].\"<ref name=\"christen-rosenberg-jayadeva\"/>\n\nProponents of microfinance often claim that such access will help poor people out of [[poverty]], including participants in the [[Microcredit Summit Campaign]]. For many, microfinance is a way to promote economic development, employment and growth through the support of micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses; for others it is a way for the poor to manage their finances more effectively and take advantage of economic opportunities while managing the risks. Critics often point to some of the ills of micro-credit that can create indebtedness. Due to diverse contexts in which microfinance operates, and the broad range of microfinance services, it is neither possible nor wise to have a generalized view of impacts microfinance may create. Many studies have tried to assess its impacts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feigenberg|first=Benjamin|author2=Erica M.

This is often the case when people need the services money can provide but do not have dispensable funds required for those services, forcing them to revert to other means of acquiring them.\nIn their book ''The Poor and Their Money'', Stuart Rutherford and Sukhwinder Arora cite several types of needs:\n* ''Lifecycle Needs'':  such as weddings, funerals, childbirth, education, home building, widowhood and old age.\n* ''Personal Emergencies'':  such as sickness, injury, unemployment, theft, harassment or death.\n* ''Disasters'':  such as wildfires, floods, cyclones and man-made events like war or bulldozing of dwellings.\n* ''Investment Opportunities'':  expanding a business, buying land or equipment, improving housing, securing a job, etc.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Rutherford | first1 = Stuart | last2 = Arora | first2 = Sukhwinder | title = The poor and their money: micro finance from a twenty-first century consumer's perspective | page = 4 | publisher = Practical Action | location = Warwickshire, UK | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781853396885 }}</ref>\nPeople find creative and often collaborative ways to meet these needs, primarily through creating and exchanging different forms of non-cash value. Common substitutes for cash vary from country to country but typically include livestock, grains, jewelry and precious metals.\nAs Marguerite S. Robinson describes in his book 'The Micro finance Revolution - Sustainable Finance for the Poor', the 1980s demonstrated that \"micro finance could provide large-scale outreach profitably,\" and in the 1990s, \"micro finance began to develop as an industry\" (2001, p.&nbsp;54).\nIn the 2000s, the micro finance industry's objective is to satisfy the unmet [[demand]] on a much larger scale, and to play a role in reducing poverty. While much progress has been made in developing a viable, commercial micro finance sector in the last few decades, several issues remain that need to be addressed before the industry will be able to satisfy massive worldwide demand.\nThe obstacles or challenges in building a sound commercial micro finance industry include:\n* Inappropriate donor [[subsidies]]\n* Poor regulation and supervision of deposit-taking micro finance institutions (MFIs)\n* Few MFIs that meet the needs for savings, remittances or insurance\n* Limited management capacity in MFIs\n* Institutional inefficiencies\n* Need for more dissemination and adoption of rural, agricultural micro finance methodologies\n* Members lack of collateral to secure a loan\n\nMicrofinance is the proper tool to reduce income inequality, allowing citizens from lower socio-economical classes to participate in the economy. Moreover, its involvement has shown to lead to a downward trend in income inequality (Hermes, 2014).<ref>Hermes, N. (2014). Does microfinance affect income inequality? Applied Economics, 46(9), 1021-1034. doi:10.1080/00036846.2013.864039</ref>\n\n===Ways in which poor people manage their money===\n\n[[File:Saving up.jpg|thumb|Saving up]]\nRutherford argues that the basic problem that poor people face as money managers is to gather a 'usefully large' amount of money. Building a new home may involve saving and protecting diverse building materials for years until enough are available to proceed with construction. Children's schooling may be funded by buying chickens and raising them for sale as needed for expenses, uniforms, bribes, etc. Because all the value is accumulated before it is needed, this money management strategy is referred to as 'saving up'.(Hermes, 2014).<ref>Rutherford, Stuart. The poor and their money. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nOften, people don't have enough money when they face a need, so they borrow. A poor family might borrow from relatives to buy land, from a moneylender to buy rice, or from a microfinance institution to buy a sewing machine. Since these loans must be repaid by saving after the cost is incurred, Rutherford calls this 'saving down'. Rutherford's point is that microcredit is addressing only half the problem, and arguably the less important half: poor people borrow to help them save and accumulate assets. Microcredit institutions should fund their loans through savings accounts that help poor people manage their myriad risks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n[[File:Saving down.jpg|left|thumb|Saving down]]\nMost needs are met through a mix of saving and credit. A benchmark impact assessment of [[Grameen Bank]] and two other large microfinance institutions in Bangladesh found that for every $1 they were lending to clients to finance rural non-farm [[micro-enterprise]], about $2.50 came from other sources, mostly their clients' savings.<ref>{{cite book | last = Khandker | first = Shahidur R. | title = Fighting poverty with microcredit: experience in Bangladesh | page = 78 | publisher = The University Press Ltd. | location = Dhaka, Bangladesh | year = 1999 | isbn = 9789840514687 }}</ref>  This parallels the experience in the West, in which family businesses are funded mostly from savings, especially during start-up.\n\nRecent studies have also shown that informal methods of saving are unsafe. For example, a study by Wright and Mutesasira in [[Uganda]] concluded that \"those with no option but to save in the informal sector are almost bound to lose some money\u2014probably around one quarter of what they save there.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Graham A.

The new paradigm places more attention on the efforts of poor people to reduce their many vulnerabilities by keeping more of what they earn and building up their assets. While they need loans, they may find it as useful to borrow for consumption as for microenterprise. A safe, flexible place to save money and withdraw it when needed is also essential for managing household and family risk.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n===Examples===\nThe microfinance project of \"saving up\" is exemplified in the slums of the south-eastern city of Vijayawada, India. This microfinance project functions as an unofficial banking system where Jyothi, a \"deposit collector\", collects money from slum dwellers, mostly women, in order for them to accumulate savings. Jyothi does her rounds throughout the city, collecting Rs5 a day from people in the slums for 220 days, however not always 220 days in a row since these women do not always have the funds available to put them into savings. They ultimately end up with Rs1000 at the end of the process. However, there are some issues with this microfinance saving program. One of the issues is that while saving, clients are actually losing part of their savings. Jyothi takes interest from each client\u2014about 20 out of every 220 payments, or Rs100 out of 1,100 or 8%. When these slum dwellers find someone they trust, they are willing to pay up to 30% to someone to safely collect and keep their savings. There is also the risk of entrusting their savings to unlicensed, informal, peripatetic collectors. However, the slum dwellers are willing to accept this risk because they are unable to save at home, and unable to use the remote and unfriendly banks in their country. This microfinance project also has many benefits, such as empowering women and giving parents the ability to save money for their children's education. This specific microfinance project is an example of the benefits and limitations of the \"saving up\" project (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nThe microfinance project of \"saving through\" is shown in Nairobi, Kenya which includes a Rotating Savings and Credit Associations or ROSCAs initiative. This is a small scale example, however Rutherford (2009) describes a woman he met in Nairobi and studied her ROSCA. Everyday 15 women would save 100 shillings so there would be a lump sum of 1,500 shillings and everyday 1 of the 15 women would receive that lump sum. This would continue for 15 days and another woman within this group would receive the lump sum. At the end of the 15 days a new cycle would start. This ROSCA initiative is different from the \"saving up\" example above because there are no interest rates affiliated with the ROSCA, additionally everyone receives back what they put forth. This initiative requires trust and social capital networks in order to work, so often these ROSCAs include people who know each other and have reciprocity. The ROSCA allows for marginalized groups to receive a lump sum at one time in order to pay or save for specific needs they have.\n\n==Microfinance debates and challenges==\n\nThere are several key debates at the boundaries of microfinance.\n\n===Loan Pricing===\n[[File:A business in South Sudan benefiting from microfinance (6189731244).jpg|thumb|This shop in [[South Sudan]] was opened using money borrowed from the Finance Sudan Limited (FSL) Program. This program was established in 2006 as one of the only microfinance lenders in the country.]]\n\nBefore determining loan price one should take these two costs; Administrative costs by the bank(MFI) and transaction cost by the client/customer. Customers, on the other hand, may have expenses for travelling to the bank branch, acquiring official documents for the loan application, and loss of time when dealing with the MFI (\u201copportunity costs\u201d). Hence, from a customer's point of view the cost of a loan is not only the interest and fees she/he has to pay, but also all other transaction costs that she/he has to cover.\n\nOne of the principal challenges of microfinance is providing small loans at an affordable cost. The global average interest and fee rate is estimated at 37%, with rates reaching as high as 70% in some markets.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/world/14microfinance.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Neil | last=MacFarquhar | title=Banks Making Big Profits From Tiny Loans | date=2010-04-13}}</ref>  The reason for the high interest rates is not primarily cost of capital.  Indeed, the local microfinance organizations that receive zero-interest loan capital from the online microlending platform [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] charge average interest and fee rates of 35.21%.<ref name=\"HighRates\">{{cite web|url = http://www.kiva.org/help/interestRateComparison|title = Kiva Help - Interest Rate Comparison|publisher = Kiva.org|accessdate = October 10, 2009}}</ref>  Rather, the main reason for the high cost of microfinance loans is the high [[transaction cost]] of traditional microfinance operations relative to loan size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiva.org/about/microfinance#interestRatesAreHigh |title=About Microfinance |publisher=Kiva |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance practitioners have long argued that such high interest rates are simply unavoidable, because the cost of making each loan cannot be reduced below a certain level while still allowing the lender to cover costs such as offices and staff salaries. For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa credit risk for microfinance institutes is very high, because customers need years to improve their livelihood and  face many challenges during this time. Financial institutes often do not even have a system to check the person's identity. Additionally they are unable to design new products and enlarge their business to reduce the risk.<ref>{{cite web |title=Moving forward |author1=Geoffrey Muzigiti |author2=Oliver Schmidt |publisher=D+C Development and Cooperation/ dandc.eu |date=January 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/financial-inclusion-poor-sub-saharan-africa-improving-thanks-formal-sector-banks-and}}</ref> The result is that the traditional approach to microfinance has made only limited progress in resolving the problem it purports to address: that the world's poorest people pay the world's highest cost for small business growth capital.  The high costs of traditional microfinance loans limit their effectiveness as a poverty-fighting tool. Offering loans at interest and fee rates of 37% mean that borrowers who do not manage to earn at least a 37% rate of return may actually end up poorer as a result of accepting the loans.\n\n[[File:Example of Flat Rate Loan Contract Chambak, Cambodia.JPG|thumb|Example of a loan contract, using flat rate calculation, from rural Cambodia. Loan is for 400,000 riels at 4% flat (16,000 riels) interest per month.]]\nAccording to a recent survey of microfinance borrowers in Ghana published by the Center for Financial Inclusion, more than one-third of borrowers surveyed reported struggling to repay their loans. Some resorted to measures such as reducing their food intake or taking children out of school in order to repay microfinance debts that had not proven sufficiently profitable. {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nIn recent years, the microfinance industry has shifted its focus from the objective of increasing the volume of lending capital available, to address the challenge of providing microfinance loans more affordably. Microfinance analyst David Roodman contends that, in mature markets, the average interest and fee rates charged by microfinance institutions tend to fall over time.<ref>Roodman, David. \"Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry Into Microfinance.\" Center for Global Development, 2011.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Istazk|first1=Lennon|title=Alles over een Klein Bedrag Lenen.|url=https://kleinbedraglenen.nl/|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Klein bedrag lenen|date=4 July 2014}}</ref> However, global average interest rates for microfinance loans are still well above 30%.\n\nThe answer to providing microfinance services at an affordable cost may lie in rethinking one of the fundamental assumptions underlying microfinance: that microfinance borrowers need extensive monitoring and interaction with loan officers in order to benefit from and repay their loans. The P2P microlending service [[Zidisha]] is based on this premise, facilitating direct interaction between individual lenders and borrowers via an internet community rather than physical offices. Zidisha has managed to bring the cost of microloans to below 10% for borrowers, including interest which is paid out to lenders. However, it remains to be seen whether such radical alternative models can reach the scale necessary to compete with traditional microfinance programs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Katic |first=Gordon |url=http://www.terry.ubc.ca/2013/02/20/terry-project-podcast-21-micro-finance-lending-a-hand-to-the-poor/ |title=Micro-finance, Lending a Hand to the Poor? |publisher=Terry.ubc.ca |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===Use of loans===\nPractitioners and donors from the charitable side of microfinance frequently argue for restricting microcredit to loans for productive purposes\u2014such as to start or expand a [[microenterprise]]. Those from the private-sector side respond that, because money is [[Fungibility|fungible]], such a restriction is impossible to enforce, and that in any case it should not be up to rich people to determine how poor people use their money{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}.\n\n===Reach versus depth of impact===\n[[File:Rwandan farm cooperative goats.jpg|thumb|These goats are being raised by Rwandan women as part of a farm cooperative funded by microfinance.]]\nThere has been a long-standing debate over the sharpness of the trade-off between 'outreach' (the ability of a microfinance institution to reach poorer and more remote people) and its '[[sustainability]]' (its ability to cover its operating costs\u2014and possibly also its costs of serving new clients\u2014from its operating revenues). Although it is generally agreed that microfinance practitioners should seek to balance these goals to some extent, there are a wide variety of strategies, ranging from the minimalist profit-orientation of [[BancoSol]] in [[Bolivia]] to the highly integrated not-for-profit orientation of [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] in [[Bangladesh]]. This is true not only for individual institutions, but also for governments engaged in developing national microfinance systems.

Evidence shows that they are less likely to default on their loans than men. Industry data from 2006 for 704 MFIs reaching 52 million borrowers includes MFIs using the [[solidarity lending]] methodology (99.3% female clients) and MFIs using individual lending (51% female clients). The delinquency rate for solidarity lending was 0.9% after 30 days (individual lending\u20143.1%), while 0.3% of loans were written off (individual lending\u20140.9%).<ref>{{cite web| last = Microfinance Information Exchange, Inc.| title = MicroBanking Bulletin Issue #15, Autumn, 2007, pp. 46,49| publisher = Microfinance Information Exchange, Inc.| date = 2007-08-01| url = http://www.themix.org/microbanking-bulletin/mbb-issue-no-15-autumn-2007| accessdate = 2010-01-15| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100105152122/http://www.themix.org/microbanking-bulletin/mbb-issue-no-15-autumn-2007| archivedate = 2010-01-05}}</ref>  Because operating margins become tighter the smaller the loans delivered, many MFIs consider the risk of lending to men to be too high. This focus on women is questioned sometimes, however a recent study of microentrepreneurs from Sri Lanka published by the [[World Bank]] found that the return on capital for male-owned businesses (half of the sample) averaged 11%, whereas the return for women-owned businesses was 0% or slightly negative.<ref>{{cite web| last = McKenzie| first = David| title = Comments Made at IPA/FAI Microfinance Conference Oct. 17 2008 | publisher = Philanthropy Action | date = 2008-10-17| url = http://www.philanthropyaction.com/nc/what_is_it_about_women/| accessdate = 2008-10-17}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance's emphasis on female-oriented lending is the subject of controversy, as it is claimed that microfinance improves the status of women through an alleviation of poverty. It is argued that by providing women with initial capital, they will be able to support themselves independent of men, in a manner which would encourage sustainable growth of enterprise and eventual self-sufficiency.  This claim has yet to be proven in any substantial form. Moreover, the attraction of women as a potential investment base is precisely because they are constrained by socio-cultural norms regarding such concepts of obedience, familial duty, household maintenance and passivity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bruton, Chavez & Khavul|first1=G.D., H. & S.|title=Microlending in emerging economies:building a new line of inquiry from the ground up|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=2011|volume=42|issue=5|pages=718\u2013739|doi=10.1057/jibs.2010.58}}</ref> The result of these norms is that while micro-lending may enable women to improve their daily subsistence to a more steady pace, they will not be able to engage in market-oriented business practice beyond a limited scope of low-skilled, low-earning, informal work.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bee|first1=Beth|title=Gender, solidarity and the paradox of microfinance: Reflections from Bolivia|journal=Gender, Place & Culture|date=2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=23\u201343|doi=10.1080/0966369X.2011.535298}}</ref> Part of this is a lack of permissivity in the society; part a reflection of the added burdens of household maintenance that women shoulder alone as a result of microfinancial empowerment; and part a lack of training and education surrounding gendered conceptions of economics. In particular, the shift in norms such that women continue to be responsible for all the domestic private sphere labour as well as undertaking public economic support for their families, independent of male aid increases rather than decreases burdens on already limited persons.\n[[Image:Microfinance in Malawi.jpg|thumb|Women of Malawi posing with their savings box]]\nIf there were to be an exchange of labour, or if women's income were supplemental rather than essential to household maintenance, there might be some truth to claims of establishing long-term businesses; however when so constrained it is impossible for women to do more than pay off a current loan only to take on another in a cyclic pattern which is beneficial to the financier but hardly to the borrower.  This gender essentializing crosses over from institutionalized lenders such as the Grameen Bank into interpersonal direct lending through charitable crowd-funding operations, such as Kiva. More recently, the popularity of non-profit global online lending has grown, suggesting that a redress of gender norms might be instituted through individual selection fomented by the processes of such programs, but the reality is as yet uncertain. Studies have noted that the likelihood of lending to women, individually or in groups, is 38% higher than rates of lending to men.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ly & Mason|first1=P. & G.|title=Individual preference over development projects:evidence from microlending on Kiva|journal=Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations|date=2012|volume=23|issue=4|pages=1036\u20131055|doi=10.1007/s11266-011-9255-8}}</ref>\n\nThis is also due to a general trend for interpersonal microfinance relations to be conducted on grounds of similarity and internal/external recognition: lenders want to see something familiar, something supportable in potential borrowers, so an emphasis on family, goals of education and health, and a commitment to community all achieve positive results from prospective financiers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Allison, Davis, Short & Webb|first1=T.H., B.C., J.C., & J.W.|title=Crowdfunding in a prosocial microlending environment: examining the role of intrinsic versus extrinsic cues|journal=Entrepreneurship|date=2015|volume=39|issue=1|pages=53\u201373}}</ref> Unfortunately, these labels disproportionately align with women rather than men, particularly in the developing world. The result is that microfinance continues to rely on restrictive gender norms rather than seek to subvert them through economic redress in terms of foundation change: training, business management and financial education are all elements which might be included in parameters of female-aimed loans and until they are the fundamental reality of women as a disadvantaged section of societies in developing states will go untested.\n\n====Organizations supporting this work====\n* [[FINCA International|FINCA]] <ref name=\"4Ways\" />\n*[https://nwtf.org.ph/ NWTF]\n*[https://akhuwat.org.pk/ akhuwat Foundation Pakistan]\n*[https://alkhidmat.org/mawakhat/ Alkhidmat Foundation Pakistan]\n*[https://www.wholeplanetfoundation.org/ Whole Planet Foundation]\n*[[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kiva.org/|title=Kiva - Loans that change lives|website=Kiva|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n*[https://microfinancecouncil.org/ MCPI]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://microfinancecouncil.org/|title=Microfinance Council of the Philippines - Link Against Poverty|website=Microfinance Council of the Philippines|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n*[[Women's World Banking|Women's World Banking]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.womensworldbanking.org/|title=Women's World Banking {{!}} Women's Financial Inclusion|website=Women's World Banking|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n===Benefits and limitations===\nMicrofinancing produces many benefits for poverty stricken and low-income households. One of the benefits is that it is very accessible. Banks today simply won't extend loans to those with little to no assets, and generally don't engage in small size loans typically associated with microfinancing. Through microfinancing small loans are produced and accessible.  Microfinancing is based on the philosophy that even small amounts of credit can help end the cycle of poverty. Another benefit produced from the microfinancing initiative is that it presents opportunities, such as extending education and jobs. Families receiving microfinancing are less likely to pull their children out of school for economic reasons. As well, in relation to employment, people are more likely to open small businesses that will aid the creation of new jobs. Overall, the benefits outline that the microfinancing initiative is set out to improve the standard of living amongst impoverished communities (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nThere are also many social and financial challenges for microfinance initiatives. For example, more articulate and better-off community members may cheat poorer or less-educated neighbours. This may occur intentionally or inadvertently through loosely run organizations. As a result, many microfinance initiatives require a large amount of social capital or trust in order to work effectively. The ability of poorer people to save may also fluctuate over time as unexpected costs may take priority which could result in them being able to save little or nothing some weeks. Rates of inflation may cause funds to lose their value, thus financially harming the saver and not benefiting the collector (Rutherford, 2009).\n\n==History of microfinance==\n\nOver the past centuries, practical visionaries, from the [[Franciscan]] friars who founded the community-oriented [[pawnbroker|pawnshops]] of the 15th century to the founders of the [[Europe]]an [[credit union]] movement in the 19th century (such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen]]) and the founders of the [[microcredit]] movement in the 1970s (such as [[Muhammad Yunus]] and [[Al Whittaker]]), have tested practices and built institutions designed to bring the kinds of opportunities and risk-management tools that financial services can provide to the doorsteps of poor people.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book| last =Helms| first =Brigit| title =Access for All: Building Inclusive Financial Systems| publisher =[[The World Bank]]| year =2006| location =[[Washington, D.C.]]| isbn =978-0-8213-6360-7}}</ref> While the success of the [[Grameen Bank]] (which now serves over 7 million poor Bangladeshi women) has inspired the world,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} it has proved difficult to replicate this success. In nations with lower population densities, meeting the operating costs of a retail branch by serving nearby customers has proven considerably more challenging. Hans Dieter Seibel, board member of the European Microfinance Platform, is in favour of the group model. This particular model (used by many Microfinance institutions) makes financial sense, he says, because it reduces transaction costs. Microfinance programmes also need to be based on local funds.<ref>[http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/166482/index.en.shtml]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214075542/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/166482/index.en.shtml|date=December 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe history of microfinancing can be traced back as far as the middle of the 1800s, when the theorist [[Lysander Spooner]] was writing about the benefits of small credits to entrepreneurs and farmers as a way of getting the people out of poverty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Independently of Spooner, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen]] founded the first cooperative lending banks to support farmers in rural [[Germany]].<ref>[http://www.raiffeisen.de/genossenschaften/genossenschaften/pdf/Raiffeisen-Organisation-englisch.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810074631/http://www.raiffeisen.de/genossenschaften/genossenschaften/pdf/Raiffeisen-Organisation-englisch.pdf|date=August 10, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe modern use of the expression \"microfinancing\" has roots in the 1970s when [[Grameen Bank]] of [[Bangladesh]], founded by microfinance pioneer [[Muhammad Yunus]], was starting and shaping the modern industry of microfinancing.

They receive loans and [[grants]] from [[charities]]. They buy insurance from state-owned companies. They receive funds transfers through formal or informal [[remittance]] networks. It is not easy to distinguish microfinance from similar activities. It could be claimed that a government that orders state banks to open deposit accounts for poor consumers, or a moneylender that engages in [[usury]], or a charity that runs a [[Heifer International|heifer pool]] are engaged in microfinance. Ensuring financial services to poor people is best done by expanding the number of financial institutions available to them, as well as by strengthening the capacity of those institutions. In recent years there has also been increasing emphasis on expanding the diversity of institutions, since different institutions serve different needs.\n\nSome principles that summarize a century and a half of development practice were encapsulated in 2004 by CGAP and endorsed by the [[Group of Eight]] leaders at the G8 Summit on June 10, 2004:<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n#Poor people need not just loans but also savings, [[insurance]] and [[Electronic funds transfer|money transfer]] services.\n#Microfinance must be useful to poor households: helping them raise income, build up assets and/or cushion themselves against external shocks.\n#\"Microfinance can pay for itself.\"<ref>Helms (2006), p. xi</ref>  Subsidies from donors and government are scarce and uncertain and so, to reach large numbers of poor people, microfinance must pay for itself.\n#Microfinance means building permanent local institutions.\n#Microfinance also means integrating the financial needs of poor people into a country's mainstream financial system.\n#\"The job of government is to enable financial services, not to provide them.\"<ref name=autogenerated3>Helms (2006), p. xii</ref>\n#\"Donor funds should complement private [[Financial capital|capital]], not compete with it.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n#\"The key [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] is the shortage of strong institutions and managers.\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />  Donors should focus on capacity building.\n#[[Interest rate ceiling]]s hurt poor people by preventing microfinance institutions from covering their costs, which chokes off the supply of credit.\n#Microfinance institutions should measure and disclose their performance\u2014both financially and socially.\n\nMicrofinance is considered a tool for socio-economic development, and can be clearly distinguished from charity.  Families who are destitute, or so poor they are unlikely to be able to generate the cash flow required to repay a loan, should be recipients of charity. Others are best served by financial institutions.\n\n==Scale of microfinance operations==\n[[File:Small Enterprise Foundation - loan officer.jpg|thumb|Two women talk about financial matters. The woman on the right is a loan officer for the [[Small Enterprise Foundation]] (SEF).  The conversation shown is taking place in [[Tzaneen]], [[South Africa]] in February 2010.]]\n\nNo systematic effort to map the distribution of microfinance has yet been undertaken. A benchmark was established by an analysis of 'alternative financial institutions' in the developing world in 2004.<ref>Robert Peck Christen, Richard Rosenberg & Veena Jayadeva.  ''Financial institutions with a double-bottom line:  implications for the future of microfinance''.  CGAP Occasional Paper, July 2004.</ref>  The authors counted approximately 665 million client accounts at over 3,000 institutions that are serving people who are poorer than those served by the commercial banks. Of these accounts, 120 million were with institutions normally understood to practice microfinance. Reflecting the diverse historical roots of the movement, however, they also included postal [[savings bank]]s (318 million accounts), state agricultural and [[Community development bank|development bank]]s (172 million accounts), financial [[cooperatives]] and [[credit unions]] (35 million accounts) and specialized rural banks (19 million accounts).\n\nRegionally, the highest concentration of these accounts was in [[India]] (188 million accounts representing 18% of the total national population). The lowest concentrations were in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] (14 million accounts representing 3% of the total population) and [[Africa]] (27 million accounts representing 4% of the total population, with the highest rate of penetration in West Africa, and the highest growth rate in Eastern and Southern Africa <ref>{{cite web| last = MFW4A - Microfinance | title = MFW4A - Microfinance | date = 2010-11-05 | url = http://www.mfw4a.org/access-to-finance/microfinance.html}}</ref> ). Considering that most bank clients in the developed world need several active accounts to keep their affairs in order, these figures indicate that the task the microfinance movement has set for itself is still very far from finished.\n\nBy type of service, \"savings accounts in alternative finance institutions outnumber loans by about four to one.  This is a worldwide pattern that does not vary much by region.\"<ref>Christen, Rosenberg & Jayadeva.

They served low-income and marginalized [[minority group|minority communities]]. By 2007, there were 500 microfinance organizations operating in the US with 200 lending capital.<ref name=micro />\n\nThere were three key factors that triggered the growth in domestic microfinance:\n# Change in social welfare policies and focus on economic development and job creation at the macro level.\n# Encouragement of employment, including [[self-employment]], as a strategy for improving the lives of the poor.\n# The increase in the proportion of [[Latin American]] and [[Asian people|Asian]] immigrants who came from societies where microenterprises are prevalent.\nThese factors incentivized the public and private supports to have microlending activity in the United States.<ref name=micro />\n\n===Canada===\nMicrofinance in Canada took shape through the development of credit unions. These credit unions provided financial services to the Canadians who could not get access to traditional financial means. Two separate branches of credit unions developed in Canada to serve the financially marginalized segment of the population. [[Alphonse Desjardins (co-operator)|Alphonse Desjardins]] introduced the establishment of savings and credit services in late 1900 to the [[Quebec]]ois who did not have financial access. Approximately 30 years later [[Moses Coady|Father Moses Coady]] introduced credit unions to [[Nova Scotia]]. These were the models of the modern institutions still present in Canada today.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Chantelle|author2=Christian Novak|title=Low Income Entrepreneurs and their Access to Financing in Canada, Especially in the Province of Quebec/City of Montreal|date=May 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nEfforts to transfer specific microfinance innovations such as [[solidarity lending]] from developing countries to Canada have met with little success.<ref>See for example Cheryl Frankiewicz ''Calmeadow Metrofund:  a Canadian experiment in sustainable microfinance'', Calmeadow Foundation, 2001.</ref>\n\nSelected microfinance institutions in Canada are:\n*'''[[Rise Asset Development]]'''\nFounded by Sandra Rotman in 2009, Rise is a Rotman and CAMH initiative that provides small business loans, leases, and lines of credit to entrepreneurs with mental health and/or addiction challenges.\n*'''[[Alterna Savings]]'''\nFormed in 2005 through the merging of the Civil Service Savings and Loan Society and the Metro Credit Union, Alterna is a financial alternative to Canadians.

Momentum provides individuals and families who want to better their financial situation take control of finances, become computer literate, secure employment, borrow and repay loans for business, and purchase homes.\n*'''[[Vancity]]'''\nFounded in 1946, Vancity is now the largest English speaking credit union in Canada.\n\n'''Limitations'''\n\nComplications specific to Canada include the need for loans of a substantial size in comparison to the ones typically seen in many international microfinance initiatives. Microfinance is also limited by the rules and limitations surrounding money-lending. For example, Canada Revenue Agency limits the loans made in these sort of transactions to a maximum of $25,000. As a result, many people look to banks to provide these loans. Also, microfinance in Canada is driven by profit which, as a result, fails to advance the social development of community members. Within marginalized or impoverished Canadian communities, banks may not be readily accessible to deposit or take out funds. These banks which would have charged little or no interest on small amounts of cash are replaced by lending companies. Here, these companies may charge extremely large interest rates to marginalized community members thus increasing the cycle of poverty and profiting off of another's loss (Rutherford, 2009).\n\nIn Canada, microfinancing competes with pay-day loans institutions which take advantage of marginalized and low-income individuals by charging extremely high, predatory interest rates. Communities with low social capital often don't have the networks to implement and support microfinance initiatives, leading  to the proliferation of pay day loan institutions. Pay day loan companies are unlike traditional microfinance in that they don't encourage collectivism and social capital building in low income communities, however exist solely for profit.\n\n==Microfinance in Pakistan==\nIn Pakistan \nAkhuwat is the world\u2019s largest Islamic micro-finance organization. Since 2001, Akhuwat has been working for poverty alleviation by empowering socially and economically marginalized segments of the society through its various poverty alleviation projects.\n\nAkhuwat aims to alleviate poverty by creating a bond of solidarity between the affluent and the marginalized. Our goal is to develop and sustain a social system based on mutual support. Akhuwat not only helps and support the poor to become self-reliant but combined with their own hard work enable them to escape the clutches of poverty.\n\n'''Philosophy of Akhuwat'''\n\nAkhuwat derives its name from \u2018mawakhaat\u2019 or brotherhood, the earliest example of which was seen in the community formed by the Ansars, citizens of Medina and the Muhajireen, who had migrated to Medina to escape religious persecution. Inspired by the spirit which induced the Medinites to share half of their wealth with the migrants, Akhuwat seeks to invoke this very concept of brotherhood through its operations. For Akhuwat, the metaphor of brotherhood entails the creation of a system based on mutual support in the society.\n\n'''Akhuwat\u2019s Values'''\n\nAkhuwat is running on the following principles:\n\nInterest-free Loans \u2013 The loan provided will be interest free since providing loans with interest is business and poverty cannot be alleviated and eradicated by doing business with the deprived.\nUse of Religious Places \u2013 Akhuwat wants to climb up the ladder of social and economic development through making Mosques, churches and religious places, the foundation. This is because in Islamic history Mosques used to be the seat of governance. In the time of Muhammad, mosques were used for worship, training and providing services. With this, comes the Transparency, Good Governance, participation and accountability.\nVolunteerism \u2013 To think beyond the confines of oneself and to think about others. Akhuwat\u2019s operations and activities rely upon the passion, energy, zeal and enthusiasm of its volunteers.\nTransforming Borrowers into Donors \u2013 Akhuwat strives to empower its borrowers, so they are in a position to be givers one day.\nNon-Discrimination on Caste, Color, Creed, Political Affiliation & Faith \u2013 Since Akhuwat strongly believes in solidarity and brotherhood. Therefore, it gives a message to cut down all the discriminatory and differential barriers in the society such as caste, color creed, political affiliation and religion.\n\n'''Core Principles'''\n\n'''INTEREST-FREE LOANS'''\n\nAkhuwat provides interest free loans to the economically poor so that they may acquire a sustainable livelihood. The organization sees interest as a barrier to widespread proliferation of capital, and a violation of all moral and ethical codes. In keeping with the principles of equity and social justice, burdening the poor with exorbitant interest rates is also viewed as undermining the overarching goal of poverty alleviation.\n\n\n==Microfinance on the Indian subcontinent==\n\nLoans to poor people by banks have many limitations including lack of security and high operating costs. As a result, microfinance was developed as an alternative to provide loans to poor people with the goal of creating financial inclusion and equality.\n\n'''[[Ela Bhatt]]''' had initiated women's own [[Self Employed Women's Association#Economic tools|SEWA Cooperative Bank]] in 1974 in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, perhaps one of the first modern day microfinance institution of its kind. '''[[Muhammad Yunus]]''', a Nobel Prize winner, had introduced the concept of Micro-credit in Bangladesh in the form of the \"Grameen Bank\". The [[National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development]] (NABARD) looked at several models for offering financial services to the unbanked, especially women, and decided to experiment with a very different model, now popularly known as Self-help Groups (SHGs). In this approach, a small group of women (and men) are able to form their own little mini bank, self-governed and managed, and create links with banks [[Self-help group (finance)|SHGs]] (Self-help groups), [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and banks. SHGs are often formed and nurtured by NGOs and only after accomplishing a certain level of maturity in terms of their internal thrift and credit operations, they are able to save, and also seek credit from the banks. There is often an involvement of an NGO, or a government agency during initial training and even after the SHG-Bank linkage. The SHG-Bank linkage programme, which has been in place since 1992 in India, has savings accounts with 7.9 million SHGs, with 4.6 million SHGs having outstanding loans, with approximately $2 billion in saving with banks, and $8.9 Billion is outstanding loans, making it one of the largest microfinance program of its kind in the world (March 2016). It involves commercial banks, regional rural banks (RRBs) and cooperative banks in its operations.\n\nIn 2013, Grameen Capital India was able to loan $144 million to microfinance groups. In addition to Grameen Bank, [[Equitas Small Finance Bank|Equitas]] has been another microfinance organization in Tamil Nadu. The South and Western states are the ones attracting the greatest number of microfinance loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21569447-industry-starting-revive-road-redemption|title=Road to redemption|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref>\n\nMicrofinance is defined as, financial services such as savings accounts, insurance funds and credit provided to poor and low income clients so as to help them increase their income, thereby improving their standard of living.\n\nIn this context the main features of microfinance are:\n\n* Loan given without security\n* Loans to those people who live below the poverty line\n* Members of SHGs may benefit from micro finance\n* Maximum limit of loan under micro finance Rs.25,000/-\n* Terms and conditions offered to poor people are decided by NGOs\n* Microfinance is different from Microcredit- under the latter, small loans are given to the borrower but under microfinance alongside many other financial services including savings accounts and insurance.

It consists of 10 members, including Accion, Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance, BRAC, CARE USA, FINCA Impact Finance, Grameen Foundation, Opportunity International, Pro Mujer, Vision Fund International and Women's World Banking.  Harnessing the power of the CEOs and their senior managers, the PRFI advocates for responsible financial services and seeks catalytic opportunities to accelerate financial access to the unserved.

While Grameen model of delivering small credit achieved a great deal, especially in urban and near-urban areas and with [[entrepreneurial]] families, its progress in delivering financial services in less densely populated rural areas was slow; creating the need for many and multiple models to emerge across the globe. The terms have evolved from Microcredit, to Microfinance, and now Financial Inclusion. Specialized microfinance institutions (MFIs) continue to expand their services, collaborating and competing with banks, credit unions, mobile money, and other informal and formal member owned institutions.\n\nThe new financial systems approach pragmatically acknowledges the richness of centuries of microfinance history and the immense diversity of institutions serving poor people in developing and developed economies today.  It is also rooted in an increasing awareness of diversity of the financial service needs of the world's poorest people, and the diverse settings in which they live and work. It also acknowledges that quality and rage of financial services are also important for the banking system to achieve fuller and deeper financial inclusion, for all. Central banks and mainstream banks are now more intimately engaging in the financial inclusion agenda than ever before, though it is a long road, with over 35-40% of worlds adults remaining outside formal banking system, and many more remaining 'under-banked'. Advent of mobile phone based money management and digital finance is changing the scenario fast; though 'social-distance' between economically poor/ social marginalized and the banking system remain large, unfortunately.\n\n;Informal financial service providers: These include moneylenders, [[pawnbrokers]], savings collectors, [[money-guards]], ROSCAs, [[ASCAs]] and input supply shops.  These continue their services because they know each other well and live in the same community, they understand each other's financial circumstances and can offer very flexible, convenient and fast services.  These services can also be costly and the choice of financial products limited and very short-term.  Informal services that involve savings are also risky; many people lose their money.\n\n;Member-owned organizations: These include [[Self-help group (finance)|self-help group]]s, [[Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs)]], [[Credit union]]s, [[CVECA]]s and a variety of other members owned and governed informal or formal financial institutions.  Informal groups, like their more traditional cousins, are generally small and local, which means they have access to good knowledge about each other's financial circumstances and can offer convenience and flexibility.  Since they are managed by poor people, their costs of operation are low.  Often, they do not need regulation and supervision, unless they grow in scale and formalize themselves by coming together to form II or III tier federations. If not prepared well, they can be 'captured' by a few influential leaders, and run the risk of members losing their savings. Experience suggests though that these informal but highly disciplined groups are very sustainable, and continue to exist even after 20\u201325 years. Formalization, as a Cooperative of Credit Union, can help create links with the banking system for more sophisticated financial products and additional capital for loans; but requires strong leadership and systems. These models are highly popular in many rural regions of countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America; and a platform for creating deeper financial inclusion.\n\n;NGOs: The [[Microcredit Summit Campaign]] counted 3,316 of these MFIs and [[NGO]]s lending to about 133 million clients by the end of 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microcreditsummit.org/pubs/reports/socr/2007.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222154645/http://www.microcreditsummit.org/pubs/reports/socr/2007.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-12-22 |title=''State of the Microcredit Summit Campaign Report 2007'', Microcredit Summit Campaign, Washington, 2007. |publisher=Microcreditsummit.org |date=2006-12-31 |accessdate=2011-03-25 }}</ref>  Led by [[Grameen Bank]] and [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] in [[Bangladesh]], [[Prodem]] in [[Bolivia]], [[Opportunity International]], and [[FINCA International]], headquartered in Washington, DC, these NGOs have spread around the developing world in the past three decades; others, like the [[Gamelan Council]], address larger regions.  They have proven very innovative, pioneering banking techniques like [[solidarity lending]], [[village banking]] and [[mobile banking]] that have overcome barriers to serving poor populations.  However, with boards that don't necessarily represent either their capital or their customers, their governance structures can be fragile, and they can become overly dependent on external donors.\n\n;Formal financial institutions: In addition to commercial banks, these include state banks, agricultural development banks, savings banks, rural banks and non-bank financial institutions.  They are regulated and supervised, offer a wider range of financial services, and control a branch network that can extend across the country and internationally.  However, they have proved reluctant to adopt social missions, and due to their high costs of operation, often can't deliver services to poor or remote populations. The increasing use of [[alternative data]] in credit scoring, such as [[trade credit]] is increasing commercial banks' interest in microfinance.<ref>[http://www.infopolicy.org/_working/files/downloads/South-Africa-compressed-web.pdf Turner, Michael, Robin Varghese, et al.

For example, efforts are being made to link self-help groups to commercial banks, to network member-owned organizations together to achieve [[economies of scale]] and scope, and to support efforts by commercial banks to 'down-scale' by integrating mobile banking and e-payment technologies into their extensive branch networks.\n\nBrigit Helms in her book 'Access for All: Building Inclusive Financial Systems', distinguishes between four general categories of microfinance providers, and argues for a pro-active strategy of engagement with all of them to help them achieve the goals of the microfinance movement.<ref>Brigit Helms.  ''Access for All:  Building Inclusive Financial Systems.''  CGAP/World Bank, Washington, 2006, pp. 35-57.</ref>\n\n==Microcredit and the Web==\n\nDue to the unbalanced emphasis on credit at the expense of microsavings, as well as a desire to link Western investors to the sector, [[peer-to-peer lending|peer-to-peer]] platforms have developed to expand the availability of microcredit through individual lenders in the developed world. New platforms that connect lenders to micro-entrepreneurs are emerging on the Web (''[[list of microfinance sponsors|peer-to-peer sponsors]]''), for example [[MYC4]], [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]], [[Zidisha]], myELEN, [[Opportunity International]] and the [[Microloan Foundation]]. Another Web-based microlender [[United Prosperity (organisation)|United Prosperity]] uses a variation on the usual microlending model; with United Prosperity the micro-lender provides a guarantee to a local bank which then lends back double that amount to the micro-entrepreneur. In 2009, the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] became the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers directly across international borders without local intermediaries.<ref>[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ \"Zidisha Set to \"Expand\" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance\", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008230104/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ |date=October 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe volume channeled through [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]]'s peer-to-peer platform is about $100 million as of November 2009 (Kiva facilitates approximately $5M in loans each month).

Criticism focuses on the impact on poverty, the level of interest rates, high profits, overindebtedness and suicides. Other criticism include the role of foreign donors and working conditions in companies affiliated to microfinance institutions, particularly in Bangladesh.\n\n===Impact===\n{{Details|Impact of microcredit}}\nThe impact of microcredit is a subject of much controversy. Proponents state that it reduces poverty through higher employment and higher incomes. This is expected to lead to improved nutrition and improved education of the borrowers' children. Some argue that microcredit empowers women. In the US and Canada, it is argued that microcredit helps recipients to graduate from welfare programs.\n\nCritics say that microcredit has not increased incomes, but has driven poor households into a debt trap, in some cases even leading to suicide. They add that the money from loans is often used for durable consumer goods or consumption instead of being used for productive investments, that it fails to empower women, and that it has not improved health or education. Moreover, as the access to micro-loans is widespread, borrowers tend to acquire several loans from different companies, making it nearly impossible to pay the debt back.<ref>Biswas, Soutik (December 16, 2010). \"India's micro-finance suicide epidemic\". [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11997571], BBC News. Retrieved July 15, 2015.</ref> As a result of such tragic events, microfinance institutions in India have agreed on setting an interest rate ceiling of 15 percent.<ref>\nSundaresan, S. (2008). Microfinance emerging trends and challenges (pp. 15-16). Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar.\n978-1847209207</ref> This is important because microfinance loan recipients have a higher level of security  in repaying the loans and a lower level of risk in failing to repay them.\n\nUnintended consequences of microfinance include informal intermediaton: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to even poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|doi = 10.18356/10695889-en|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103\u2013117|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}</ref>\n\n=== Competition and market saturation ===\nMicrocredit has also received criticism for inducing market saturation and fueling problematically competitive, rather than collaborative business communities<ref name=\"Crises\">{{Cite journal|last=Gu\u00e9rin|first=Isabelle|last2=Labie|first2=Marc|last3=Servet|first3=Jean-Michel|date=2015|title=The Crises of Microcredit|url=https://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/ucpbkecon/9781783603756.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"Challenges\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.findevgateway.org/library/microfinance-challenges-empowerment-or-disempowerment-poor|title=Microfinance Challenges: Empowerment or Disempowerment of the Poor?|date=2014-04-11|website=FinDev Gateway - CGAP|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>. The influx of supply generated by the creation of new microcredit-fueled-businesses can be difficult for small economies to absorb. The owners of micro-enterprises within such communities often have limited skill sets and resources available. This can cause a \u201ccopycat\u201d phenomenon among small business due to the limited variation in products and services offerings.<ref name=\"Crises\" /> The high number of individuals selling similar products and services can cause new entrepreneurs to be subject to cutthroat competition over a demand that has not expanded proportionally with the supply.<ref name=\"Challenges\" />\n\n===Mission drift in microfinance===\n\nMission drift refers to the phenomena through which the MFIs or the micro finance institutions increasingly try to cater to customers who are better off than their original customers, primarily the poor families. Roy Mersland and R. \u00d8ystein Str\u00f8m in their research on mission drift suggest that this selection bias can come not only through an increase in the average loan size, which allows for financially stronger individuals to get the loans, but also through the MFI's particular lending methodology, main market of operation, or even the gender bias as further mission drift measures.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Mersland | first1 = Roy | last2 = Str\u00f8m | first2 = R. \u00d8ystein | title = Microfinance mission drift? | journal = [[World Development (journal)|World Development]] | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 28\u201336 | doi = 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.05.006 | date = January 2010 | ref = harv | hdl = 11250/2428249 | url = https://oda.hioa.no/en/item/asset/dspace:1298/523226post.pdf }}</ref> And as it may follow, this selective funding would lead to lower risks and lower costs for the firm.\n\nHowever, economists Beatriz Armend\u00e1riz and Ariane Szafarz suggests that  this phenomenon is not driven by cost minimization alone. She suggests that it happens because of the interplay between the company's mission, the cost differential between poor and unbanked wealthier clients and region specific characteristics pertaining the heterogeneity of their clientele.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Armend\u00e1riz | first1 = Beatriz | last2 = Szafarz | first2 =Ariane | contribution = On mission drift in microfinance institutions | editor-last1 = Armend\u00e1riz | editor-first1 = Beatriz | editor-last2 = Labie | editor-first2 = Marc | title = The handbook of microfinance | pages = 341\u2013366 | publisher = [[World Scientific]] | location = Singapore Hackensack, New Jersey | year = 2011 | isbn = 9789814295659 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> But in either way, this problem of selective funding leads to an ethical tradeoff where on one hand there is an economic reason for the company to restrict its loans to only the individuals who qualify the standards, and on the other hand there is an ethical responsibility to help the poor people get out of poverty through the provision of capital.\n\n===Role of foreign donors===\nThe role of donors has also been questioned.  CGAP recently commented that \"a large proportion of the money they spend is not effective, either because it gets hung up in unsuccessful and often complicated funding mechanisms (for example, a government apex facility), or it goes to partners that are not held accountable for performance. In some cases, poorly conceived programs have retarded the development of inclusive financial systems by distorting markets and displacing domestic commercial initiatives with cheap or free money.\"<ref>Brigit Helms.  ''Access for All:  Building Inclusive Financial Systems.''  CGAP/World Bank, Washington, 2006, p. 97.</ref>\n\n===Working conditions in enterprises affiliated to MFIs===\nThere has also been criticism of microlenders for not taking more responsibility for the working conditions of poor households, particularly when borrowers become quasi-wage labourers, selling crafts or agricultural produce through an organization controlled by the MFI. The desire of MFIs to help their borrower diversify and increase their incomes has sparked this type of relationship in several countries, most notably [[Bangladesh]], where hundreds of thousands of borrowers effectively work as wage labourers for the marketing subsidiaries of [[Grameen Bank]] or [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]]. Critics maintain that there are few if any rules or standards in these cases governing working hours, holidays, working conditions, safety or child labour, and few inspection regimes to correct abuses.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Farooque |date=June 24, 2007 |title=The metamorphosis of the micro-credit debtor |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2007/jun/24/oped.html |location=Dhaka |newspaper=New Age |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410121959/http://www.newagebd.com/2007/jun/24/oped.html |archive-date=April 10, 2008}}</ref>  Some of these concerns have been taken up by [[trade union|union]]s and [[socially responsible investing|socially responsible investment]] advocates.\n\n===Abuse===\nIn Nigeria cases of fraud have been reported.
