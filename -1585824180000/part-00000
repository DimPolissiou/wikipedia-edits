Today, computer graphics is a core technology in digital photography, film, video games, cell phone and computer displays, and many specialized applications. A great deal of specialized hardware and software has been developed, with the displays of most devices being driven by [[graphics hardware|computer graphics hardware]]. It is a vast and recently developed area of computer science. The phrase was coined in 1960 by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. It is often abbreviated as CG, or typically in the context of film as [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].\n\nSome topics in computer graphics include [[user interface design]], [[sprite (graphics)|sprite graphics]], [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], [[geometry processing]], [[computer animation]], [[vector graphics]], [[3D modeling]], [[shader]]s, [[GPU]] design, [[implicit surface]] visualization, [[image processing]], [[computational photography]], [[scientific visualization]], [[computational geometry]] and [[computer vision]], among others. The overall methodology depends heavily on the underlying sciences of [[geometry]], [[optics]], [[physics]], and [[perception]].\n\nComputer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the consumer. It is also used for processing image data received from the physical world. Computer graphics development has had a significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized [[animation]], [[movies]], [[advertising]], [[video game]]s, and [[graphic design]] in general.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe term computer graphics has been used in a broad sense to describe \"almost everything on computers that is not text or sound\".<ref>[http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/tutorial/ What is Computer Graphics?], Cornell University Program of Computer Graphics. Last updated 04/15/98. Accessed November 17, 2009.</ref> Typically, the term ''computer graphics'' refers to several different things:\n* the representation and manipulation of image data by a computer\n* the various [[technologies]] used to create and manipulate images\n* the sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content, see [[Computer graphics (computer science)|study of computer graphics]]\n\nToday, computer graphics is widespread. Such imagery is found in and on television, newspapers, weather reports, and in a variety of medical investigations and surgical procedures. A well-constructed [[Chart|graph]] can present complex statistics in a form that is easier to understand and interpret. In the media \"such graphs are used to illustrate papers, reports, theses\", and other presentation material.<ref>University of Leeds ISS (2002). [http://iss.leeds.ac.uk/info/306/giraphics/215/overview_of_computer_graphics/2 \"What are computer graphics?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106160420/http://iss.leeds.ac.uk/info/306/giraphics/215/overview_of_computer_graphics/2 |date=2015-01-06 }}. Last updated: 22 September 2008</ref>\n\nMany tools have been developed to visualize data. Computer generated imagery can be categorized into several different types: two dimensional (2D), three dimensional (3D), and animated graphics. As technology has improved, [[3D computer graphics]] have become more common, but [[2D computer graphics]] are still widely used. Computer graphics has emerged as a sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Over the past decade, other specialized fields have been developed like [[information visualization]], and [[scientific visualization]] more concerned with \"the visualization of [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, [[Biological Data Visualization|biological]], etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component\".<ref name = \"MF08\">[[Michael Friendly]] (2008). [http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf \"Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization\"].</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of computer animation}}\n\n===Introduction===\nThe precursor sciences to the development of modern computer graphics were the advances in [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], and [[television]] that took place during the first half of the twentieth century. Screens could display art since the [[Lumiere brothers]]' use of [[matte (filmmaking)|mattes]] to create special effects for the earliest films dating from 1895, but such displays were limited and not interactive. The first [[cathode ray tube]], the [[Braun tube]], was invented in 1897 \u2013 it in turn would permit the [[oscilloscope]] and the military [[control panel (engineering)|control panel]] \u2013 the more direct precursors of the field, as they provided the first two-dimensional electronic displays that responded to programmatic or user input. Nevertheless, computer graphics remained relatively unknown as a discipline until the 1950s and the post-[[World War II]] period \u2013 during which time the discipline emerged from a combination of both pure [[university]] and [[laboratory]] academic research into more advanced computers and the [[United States military]]'s further development of technologies like [[radar]], advanced [[aviation]], and [[rocket]]ry developed during the war. New kinds of displays were needed to process the wealth of information resulting from such projects, leading to the development of computer graphics as a discipline.\n\n=== 1950s ===\n[[File:SAGE control room.png|thumb|right|[[SAGE Project|SAGE]] Sector Control Room.]]\nEarly projects like the [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] and [[SAGE Project]]s introduced the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] as a viable [[visual display unit|display]] and interaction interface and introduced the [[light pen]] as an [[input device]]. [[Douglas T. Ross]] of the Whirlwind SAGE system performed a personal experiment in  which a small program he wrote captured the movement of his finger and displayed its vector (his traced name) on a display scope. One of the first interactive video games to feature recognizable, interactive graphics \u2013 ''[[Tennis for Two]]'' \u2013 was created for an oscilloscope by [[William Higinbotham]] to entertain visitors in 1958 at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and simulated a tennis match. In 1959, [[APT (programming language)|Douglas T. Ross]] innovated again while working at MIT on transforming mathematic statements into computer generated 3D machine tool vectors by taking the opportunity to create a display scope image of a [[Disney]] [[cartoon]] character.<ref>Ross on MIT TECH TV 1959 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob9NV8mmm20</ref>\n\nElectronics pioneer [[Hewlett-Packard]] went public in 1957 after incorporating the decade prior, and established strong ties with [[Stanford University]] through its founders, who were [[alumnus|alumni]]. This began the decades-long transformation of the southern [[San Francisco Bay Area]] into the world's leading computer technology hub \u2013 now known as [[Silicon Valley]]. The field of computer graphics developed with the emergence of computer graphics hardware.\n\nFurther advances in computing led to greater advancements in [[interactive computer graphics]]. In 1959, the [[TX-2]] computer was developed at [[Lincoln Laboratory|MIT's Lincoln Laboratory]]. The TX-2 integrated a number of new man-machine interfaces. A [[light pen]] could be used to draw sketches on the computer using [[Ivan Sutherland]]'s revolutionary [[Sketchpad|Sketchpad software]].<ref name=\"WC03\"/> Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small [[photoelectric cell]] in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed in front of a computer screen and the screen's [[electron gun]] fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects \u2013 not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.\n\n=== 1960s ===\n[[File:Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg|thumb|''[[Spacewar!]]'' running on the [[Computer History Museum]]'s [[PDP-1]]]]\n\nThe phrase \"computer graphics\" itself was coined in 1960 by [[William Fetter]], a graphic designer for [[Boeing]].<ref name=\"WC03\">Wayne Carlson (2003) [http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405172134/http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html |date=April 5, 2007 }}. [[Ohio State University]]</ref> This old quote in many secondary sources comes complete with the following sentence:\n:''Fetter has said that the terms were actually given to him by Verne Hudson of the Wichita Division of Boeing''.<ref>Jon Peddie: The History of Visual Magic in Computers: How Beautiful Images are Made in CAD, 3D, VR and AR, Springer, 2013, p. 101, {{ISBN|978-1447149316}}</ref>\nIn 1961 another student at MIT, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], created another important title in the history of [[video game]]s, ''[[Spacewar!]]''. Written for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-1]], Spacewar! was an instant success and copies started flowing to other PDP-1 owners and eventually DEC got a copy.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The engineers at DEC used it as a diagnostic program on every new PDP-1 before shipping it. The sales force picked up on this quickly enough and when installing new units, would run the \"world's first video game\" for their new customers. (Higginbotham's ''[[Tennis For Two]]'' had beaten ''Spacewar'' by almost three years; but it was almost unknown outside of a research or academic setting.)\n\nAt around the same time (1961-1962) in the University of Cambridge, Elizabeth Waldram wrote code to display radio-astronomy maps on a cathode ray tube.<ref>[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/EDSAC99/reminiscences/#EDSAC%201%20people EDSAC 1 and after - a compilation of personal reminiscences], Retrieved 11 July 2019.</ref>\n\nE. E. Zajac, a scientist at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratory]] (BTL), created a film called \"Simulation of a two-giro gravity attitude control system\" in 1963.<ref>David Salomon (1999). ''Computer graphics and geometric modeling''. p. ix</ref> In this computer-generated film, Zajac showed how the attitude of a satellite could be altered as it orbits the Earth. He created the animation on an [[IBM 7090]] mainframe computer. Also at BTL, [[Ken Knowlton]], Frank Sinden, [[Ruth A. Weiss]] and [[Michael Noll]] started working in the computer graphics field. Sinden created a film called [http://techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2012/8/20/AT&T-Archives-Force-Mass-Motion ''Force, Mass and Motion''] illustrating [[Newton's laws of motion]] in operation. Around the same time, other scientists were creating computer graphics to illustrate their research. At [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory]], Nelson Max created the films ''Flow of a Viscous Fluid'' and ''Propagation of Shock Waves in a Solid Form''. [[Boeing Aircraft]] created a film called ''Vibration of an Aircraft''.\n\nAlso sometime in the early 1960s, [[automobile]]s would also provide a boost through the early work of [[Pierre B\u00e9zier]] at [[Renault]], who used [[Paul de Casteljau]]'s curves \u2013 now called [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s after B\u00e9zier's work in the field \u2013 to develop 3d modeling techniques for [[Renault]] car bodies. These curves would form the foundation for much curve-modeling work in the field, as curves \u2013 unlike polygons \u2013 are mathematically complex entities to draw and model well.\n\n[[File:Pong.png|thumb|right|170px|''[[Pong]]'' arcade version]]\nIt was not long before major corporations started taking an interest in computer graphics. [[TRW Inc.|TRW]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed-Georgia]], [[General Electric]] and [[Sperry Rand]] are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid-1960s. IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the [[IBM 2250]] graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer. [[Ralph Baer]], a supervising engineer at [[Sanders Associates]], came up with a home [[video game]] in 1966 that was later licensed to [[Magnavox]] and called the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts, it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen. It was the first consumer computer graphics product. [[David C. Evans]] was director of engineering at [[Bendix Corporation]]'s computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked for the next five years as a visiting professor at Berkeley. There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people. In 1966, the [[University of Utah]] recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest. This new department would become the world's primary research center for computer graphics through the 1970s.\n\nAlso in 1966, [[Ivan Sutherland]] continued to innovate at MIT when he invented the first computer controlled [[head-mounted display]] (HMD). It displayed two separate wireframe images, one for each eye. This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in [[stereoscopic 3D]]. The heavy hardware required for supporting the display and tracker was called the Sword of Damocles because of the potential danger if it were to fall upon the wearer. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, Sutherland became Director of Information Processing at [[DARPA|ARPA]] (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and later became a professor at Harvard. In 1967 Sutherland was recruited by Evans to join the computer science program at the [[University of Utah]] \u2013 a development which would turn that department into one of the most important research centers in graphics for nearly a decade thereafter, eventually producing some of the most important pioneers in the field. There Sutherland perfected his HMD; twenty years later, NASA would re-discover his techniques in their [[virtual reality]] research. At Utah, Sutherland and Evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies, but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company.\n\nIn 1968, Dave Evans and Ivan Sutherland founded the first computer graphics hardware company, [[Evans & Sutherland]]. While Sutherland originally wanted the company to be located in Cambridge, Massachussettes, Salt Lake City was instead chosen due to its proximity to the professors' research group at the University of Utah.\n\nAlso in 1968 Arthur Appel described the first [[ray casting]] algorithm, the first of a class of [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]]-based rendering algorithms that have since become fundamental in achieving [[photorealism]] in graphics by modeling the paths that rays of light take from a light source, to surfaces in a scene, and into the camera.\n\nIn 1969, the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] initiated A Special Interest Group on Graphics ([[SIGGRAPH]]) which organizes [[List of computer science conferences#Computer graphics|conferences]], [[graphics standards]], and publications within the field of computer graphics. By 1973, the first annual SIGGRAPH conference was held, which has become one of the focuses of the organization. SIGGRAPH has grown in size and importance as the field of computer graphics has expanded over time.hello\n\n=== 1970s ===\nAn important technological advance that enabled practical computer graphics technology was the emergence of [[metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (MOS) [[large-scale integration]] (LSI) technology in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Parslow\">{{cite book |last=Parslow |first = R. |title=Computer Graphics: Techniques and Applications |date=March 1975 |publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]] |isbn=9781475713206 |page=96 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=I6mgBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 }}</ref><ref name=\"Cherry1973\">{{cite journal |last=Cherry |first = Robert William |title=A calculator option for the Tektronix 4010 computer graphics terminal |date=June 1973 |url=https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/16514 |journal=Compilation of Abstracts of Dissertations, Theses and Research Papers Submitted by Candidates for Degrees |publisher=[[Naval Postgraduate School]]}}</ref> MOS LSI technology made possible large amounts of [[computational]] capability in small [[MOS integrated circuit]] chips, which led to the development of the [[Tektronix 4010]] computer graphics terminal in 1972,<ref name=\"Cherry1973\" /> as well as the [[microprocessor]] in 1971.<ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite journal |last1=Shirriff |first1=Ken |title=The Surprising Story of the First Microprocessors |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |date=30 August 2016 |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-surprising-story-of-the-first-microprocessors |access-date=13 October 2019}}</ref> [[MOS memory]], particularly the dynamic [[random-access memory]] ([[DRAM]]) chip introduced in 1970,<ref name=\"computerhistory1970\">{{cite web |title=1970: MOS Dynamic RAM Competes with Magnetic Core Memory on Price |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/mos-dynamic-ram-competes-with-magnetic-core-memory-on-price/ |website=[[Computer History Museum]] |access-date=29 July 2019 }}</ref> was also capable of holding [[kilobits]] of data on a single high-density [[memory chip]],<ref name=\"Shoup_SuperPaint\">{{cite web |url=http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/PDFs/Annals_final.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040612215245/http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/PDFs/Annals_final.pdf |archive-date=2004-06-12 |title=SuperPaint: An Early Frame Buffer Graphics System |author=Richard Shoup |publisher=IEEE |work=Annals of the History of Computing |year=2001 |format=PDF |url-status=dead }}</ref> making it possible to hold an entire [[standard-definition]] (SD) [[raster graphics]] image in a digital [[frame buffer]], which was used by [[Xerox PARC]] to develop [[SuperPaint]], the first video-compatible, raster-based computer graphics system, in 1972.<ref name=\"Shoup_SuperPaint\" />\n\n[[File:utah teapot.png|250px|thumb|right|The [[Utah teapot]] by [[Martin Newell (computer scientist)|Martin Newell]] and its static renders became emblematic of CGI development during the 1970s.]]\n\nSubsequently, a number of breakthroughs in the field \u2013 particularly important early breakthroughs in the transformation of graphics from utilitarian to realistic \u2013 occurred at the [[University of Utah]] in the 1970s, which had hired [[Ivan Sutherland]]. He was paired with [[David C. Evans]] to teach an advanced computer graphics class, which contributed a great deal of founding research to the field and taught several students who would grow to found several of the industry's most important companies \u2013 namely [[Pixar]], [[Silicon Graphics]], and [[Adobe Systems]].  Tom Stockham led the image processing group at UU which worked closely with the computer graphics lab. \n\nOne of these students was [[Edwin Catmull]]. Catmull had just come from [[The Boeing Company]] and had been working on his degree in physics. Growing up on [[Disney]], Catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that he did not have the talent for drawing. Now Catmull (along with many others) saw computers as the natural progression of animation and they wanted to be part of the revolution. The first computer animation that Catmull saw was his own. He created an animation of his hand opening and closing. He also pioneered [[texture mapping]] to paint textures on three-dimensional models in 1974, now considered one of the fundamental techniques in [[3D modeling]]. It became one of his goals to produce a feature-length motion picture using computer graphics \u2013 a goal he would achieve two decades later after his founding role in [[Pixar]]. In the same class, [[Fred Parke]] created an animation of his wife's face. The two animations were included in the 1976 feature film [[Futureworld]].\n\nAs the UU computer graphics laboratory was attracting people from all over, [[John Warnock]] was another of those early pioneers; he would later found [[Adobe Systems]] and create a revolution in the publishing world with his [[PostScript]] page description language, and Adobe would go on later to create the industry standard [[Image editing|photo editing]] software in [[Adobe Photoshop]] and a prominent movie industry [[special effects]] program in [[Adobe After Effects]]. \n\n[[James H. Clark|James Clark]] was also there; he would later found [[Silicon Graphics]], a maker of advanced rendering systems that would dominate the field of high-end graphics until the early 1990's.\n\nA major advance in 3D computer graphics was created at UU by these early pioneers \u2013 [[hidden surface determination]]. In order to draw a representation of a 3D object on the screen, the computer must determine which surfaces are \"behind\" the object from the viewer's perspective, and thus should be \"hidden\" when the computer creates (or renders) the image. The [[3D Core Graphics System]] (or '''Core''') was the first graphical standard to be developed. A group of 25 experts of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Special Interest Group]] [[SIGGRAPH]] developed this \"conceptual framework\". The specifications were published in 1977, and it became a foundation for many future developments in the field.\n\nAlso in the 1970s, [[Henri Gouraud (computer scientist)|Henri Gouraud]], [[Jim Blinn]] and [[Bui Tuong Phong]] contributed to the foundations of [[shading]] in CGI via the development of the [[Gouraud shading]] and [[Blinn-Phong shading]] models, allowing graphics to move beyond a \"flat\" look to a look more accurately portraying depth. [[Jim Blinn]] also innovated further in 1978 by introducing [[bump mapping]], a technique for simulating uneven surfaces, and the predecessor to many more advanced kinds of mapping used today.\n\nThe modern [[videogame]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] as is known today was birthed in the 1970s, with the first arcade games using [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] graphics. ''[[Pong]]'' in 1972 was one of the first hit arcade cabinet games. ''[[Speed Race]]'' in 1974 featured sprites moving along a vertically [[scrolling]] road. ''[[Gun Fight]]'' in 1975 featured human-looking animated characters, while ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in 1978 featured a large number of animated figures on screen; both used a specialized [[barrel shifter]] circuit made from discrete chips to help their [[Intel 8080]] [[microprocessor]] animate their [[framebuffer]] graphics.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:Donkey Kong arcade.png|thumb|upright|''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was one of the [[video games]] that helped to popularize computer graphics to a mass audience in the 1980s.]]\n\nThe 1980s began to see the modernization and commercialization of computer graphics. As the [[home computer]] proliferated, a subject which had previously been an academics-only discipline was adopted by a much larger audience, and the number of computer graphics developers increased significantly.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (MOS) [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) technology led to the availability of [[16-bit]] [[central processing unit]] (CPU) [[microprocessors]] and the first [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) chips, which began to revolutionize computer graphics, enabling [[high-resolution]] graphics for computer graphics terminals as well as [[personal computer]] (PC) systems. [[NEC]]'s [[\u00b5PD7220]] was the first GPU, [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] on a fully integrated [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] VLSI [[integrated circuit|chip]]. It supported up to [[XGA|1024x1024 resolution]], and laid the foundations for the emerging PC graphics market.

Graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation, rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and [[mini-computers]]. Typical of the early move to high-resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the computer-aided engineering market were the Orca 1000, 2000 and 3000 workstations, developed by Orcatech of Ottawa, a spin-off from [[Bell-Northern Research]], and led by [[David Pearson, Computer Scientist|David Pearson]], an early workstation pioneer. The Orca 3000 was based on the 16-bit [[Motorola 68000]] microprocessor and [[AMD]] [[bit-slice]] processors, and had Unix as its operating system. It was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector. Artists and graphic designers began to see the personal computer, particularly the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], as a serious design tool, one that could save time and draw more accurately than other methods.  The Macintosh remains a highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and businesses. Modern computers, dating from the 1980s, often use [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons and pictures, rather than text. Graphics are one of the five key elements of [[multimedia]] technology.\n\nIn the field of realistic rendering, [[Japan]]'s [[Osaka University]] developed the [[Supercomputing in Japan|LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System]], a [[supercomputer]] that used up to 257 [[Zilog Z8000|Zilog Z8001]] [[microprocessor]]s, in 1982, for the purpose of rendering realistic [[3D computer graphics]]. According to the Information Processing Society of Japan: \"The core of 3D image rendering is calculating the luminance of each pixel making up a rendered surface from the given viewpoint, [[Computer graphics lighting|light source]], and object position. The LINKS-1 system was developed to realize an image rendering methodology in which each pixel could be parallel processed independently using [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]]. By developing a new software methodology specifically for high-speed image rendering, LINKS-1 was able to rapidly render highly realistic images. It was used to create the world's first 3D [[planetarium]]-like video of the entire [[Universe|heavens]] that was made completely with computer graphics. The video was presented at the [[Fujitsu]] pavilion at the 1985 International Exposition in [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/other/0013.html|title=LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System-Computer Museum|author=Information Processing Society of Japan|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref> The LINKS-1 was the world's most powerful [[computer]], as of 1984.<ref>http://www.vasulka.org/archive/Writings/VideogameImpact.pdf#page=29</ref> Also in the field of realistic rendering, the general [[rendering equation]] of David Immel and [[James Kajiya]] was developed in 1986 \u2013 an important step towards implementing [[global illumination]], which is necessary to pursue [[photorealism]] in computer graphics.\n\nThe continuing popularity of ''[[Star Wars]]'' and other science fiction franchises were relevant in cinematic CGI at this time, as [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Industrial Light & Magic]] became known as the \"go-to\" house by many other studios for topnotch computer graphics in film. Important advances in [[chroma key]]ing (\"bluescreening\", etc.) were made for the later films of the original trilogy. Two other pieces of video would also outlast the era as historically relevant: [[Dire Straits]]' iconic, near-fully-CGI video for their song \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\" in 1985, which popularized CGI among music fans of that era, and a scene from [[Young Sherlock Holmes]] the same year featuring the first fully CGI character in a feature movie (an animated stained-glass [[knight]]). In 1988, the first [[shader]]s \u2013 small programs designed specifically to do [[shading]] as a separate algorithm \u2013 were developed by [[Pixar]], which had already spun off from Industrial Light & Magic as a separate entity \u2013 though the public would not see the results of such technological progress until the next decade. In the late 1980s, [[Silicon Graphics]] (SGI) computers were used to create some of the first fully computer-generated [[short film]]s at [[Pixar]], and Silicon Graphics machines were considered a high-water mark for the field during the decade.\n\nThe 1980s is also called the [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden era]] of [[videogames]]; millions-selling systems from [[Atari]], [[Nintendo]] and [[Sega]], among other companies, exposed computer graphics for the first time to a new, young, and impressionable audience \u2013 as did [[MS-DOS]]-based personal computers, [[Apple II]]s, [[Macintosh computers|Macs]], and [[Amiga]]s, all of which also allowed users to program their own games if skilled enough. For the [[Arcade game|arcades]], advances were made in commercial, [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] 3D graphics. In 1988, the first dedicated real-time 3D [[Graphics card|graphics boards]] were introduced for arcades, with the [[Namco System 21]]<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=536 |title = System 16 \u2013 Namco System 21 Hardware (Namco) |access-date=15 June 2015 }}</ref> and [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] Air System.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=656 |title=System 16 \u2013 Taito Air System Hardware (Taito)  |access-date = 15 June 2015 }}</ref> On the professional side, [[Evans & Sutherland]] and SGI developed 3D raster graphics hardware that directly influenced the later single-chip [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU), a technology where a separate and very powerful chip is used in [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]] with a [[CPU]] to optimize graphics.\n\nThe decade also saw computer graphics applied to many additional professional markets, including location-based entertainment and education with the E&S Digistar, vehicle design, vehicle simulation, and chemistry.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n{{original research|section|date=July 2017}}\n\n[[File:Quarxs-Affiche.jpg|thumb|175px|''Quarxs'', series poster, [[Maurice Benayoun]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Schuiten]], 1992]]\n\nThe 1990s' overwhelming note was the emergence of [[3D modeling]] on a mass scale and an impressive rise in the quality of CGI generally. Home computers became able to take on rendering tasks that previously had been limited to workstations costing thousands of dollars; as [[list of 3D modeling software|3D modelers]] became available for home systems, the popularity of [[Silicon Graphics]] workstations declined and powerful [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] machines running [[Autodesk]] products like [[3ds max|3D Studio]] or other home rendering software ascended in importance. By the end of the decade, the [[GPU]] would begin its rise to the prominence it still enjoys today.\n\nThe field began to see the first rendered graphics that could truly pass as [[photorealistic]] to the untrained eye (though they could not yet do so with a trained CGI artist) and [[3D graphics]] became far more popular in [[Video game|gaming]], [[multimedia]], and [[animation]]. At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the nineties were created, in France, the very first computer graphics TV series: ''La Vie des b\u00eates'' by studio Mac Guff Ligne (1988), ''Les Fables G\u00e9om\u00e9triques'' (1989\u20131991) by studio Fant\u00f4me, and ''[[Quarxs]]'', the first HDTV computer graphics series by [[Maurice Benayoun]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Schuiten]] (studio Z-A production, 1990\u20131993).\n\nIn film, [[Pixar]] began its serious commercial rise in this era under [[Edwin Catmull]], with its first major film release, in 1995 \u2013 [[Toy Story]] \u2013 a critical and commercial success of nine-figure magnitude. The studio to invent the programmable [[shader]] would go on to have many animated hits, and its work on prerendered video animation is still considered an industry leader and research trail breaker.\n\nIn video games, in 1992, ''[[Virtua Racing]]'', running on the [[Sega Model 1]] [[arcade system board]], laid the foundations for fully 3D [[racing game]]s and popularized real-time [[3D computer graphics|3D polygonal graphics]] among a wider audience in the [[video game industry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Virtua Racing \u2013 Arcade (1992) |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p13_01.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412225953/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p13_01.html |archivedate=2010-04-12 |work=15 Most Influential Games of All Time |publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=19 January 2014 |date=14 March 2001}}</ref> The [[Sega Model 2]] in 1993 and [[Sega Model 3]] in 1996 subsequently pushed the boundaries of commercial, real-time 3D graphics. Back on the PC, ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', three of the first massively popular 3D [[first-person shooter]] games, were released by [[id Software]] to critical and popular acclaim during this decade using a rendering engine innovated{{vague|date=July 2017}} primarily by [[John Carmack]]. The [[Sony Playstation]], [[Sega Saturn]], and [[Nintendo 64]], among other consoles, sold in the millions and popularized 3D graphics for home gamers. Certain late-90's first-generation 3D titles became seen as influential in popularizing 3D graphics among console users, such as [[platform game]]s ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time]]'', and early 3D [[fighting game]]s like ''[[Virtua Fighter]]'', ''[[Battle Arena Toshinden]]'', and ''[[Tekken]]''.\n\nTechnology and algorithms for rendering continued to improve greatly. In 1996, Krishnamurty and Levoy invented [[normal mapping]] \u2013 an improvement on Jim Blinn's [[bump mapping]]. 1999 saw [[Nvidia]] release the seminal [[GeForce 256]], the first home [[video card]] billed as a [[graphics processing unit]] or GPU, which in its own words contained \"integrated [[linear transformation|transform]], [[lighting]], [[triangle setup]]/[[clipping (computer graphics)|clipping]], and [[3d rendering|rendering]] engines\". By the end of the decade, computers adopted common frameworks for graphics processing such as [[DirectX]] and [[OpenGL]]. Since then, computer graphics have only become more detailed and realistic, due to more powerful [[graphics hardware]] and [[3D modeling software]].   [[AMD]] also became a leading developer of graphics boards in this decade, creating a \"duopoly\" in the field which exists this day.\n\n=== 2000s ===\n[[File:Killing Floor Biohazard1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|A screenshot from the [[videogame]] ''[[Killing Floor (video game)|Killing Floor]]'', built in [[Unreal Engine 2]]. [[Personal computer]]s and [[console video game]]s took a great graphical leap forward in the 2000s, becoming able to display graphics in [[real time computing]] that had previously only been possible pre-rendered and/or on business-level hardware.]]\n\nCGI became ubiquitous in earnest during this era. [[Video games]] and CGI [[film|cinema]] had spread the reach of computer graphics to the mainstream by the late 1990s and continued to do so at an accelerated pace in the 2000s. CGI was also adopted ''en masse'' for [[television advertisement]]s widely in the late 1990s and 2000s, and so became familiar to a massive audience.\n\nThe continued rise and increasing sophistication of the [[graphics processing unit]] were crucial to this decade, and 3D rendering capabilities became a standard feature as 3D-graphics GPUs became considered a necessity for [[desktop computer]] makers to offer. The [[Nvidia GeForce]] line of graphics cards dominated the market in the early decade with occasional significant competing presence from [[ATI Technologies|ATI]].<ref>[http://www.danielsevo.com/hocg/hocg_2000.htm ''The Future Of Computer Graphics''] Daniel Sevo, 2005 (retrieved 26 February 2015)</ref> As the decade progressed, even low-end machines usually contained a 3D-capable GPU of some kind as [[Nvidia]] and [[AMD]] both introduced low-priced chipsets and continued to dominate the market. [[Shader]]s which had been introduced in the 1980s to perform specialized processing on the GPU would by the end of the decade become supported on most consumer hardware, speeding up graphics considerably and allowing for greatly improved [[Texture (visual arts)|texture]] and [[shading]] in computer graphics via the widespread adoption of [[normal mapping]], [[bump mapping]], and a variety of other techniques allowing the simulation of a great amount of detail.\n\nComputer graphics used in films and [[video games]] gradually began to be realistic to the point of entering the [[uncanny valley]]. [[Computer animation|CGI]] movies proliferated, with traditional animated [[cartoon]] films like [[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]] and [[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]] as well as numerous [[Pixar]] offerings like [[Finding Nemo]] dominating the box office in this field. The ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', released in 2001, was the first fully computer-generated feature film to use photorealistic CGI characters and be fully made with motion capture.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997597,00.html ''Cinema: A Painstaking Fantasy''] Chris Taylor, Time, 31 July 2000 (retrieved 8 August 2012).</ref> The film was not a box-office success, however.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=finalfantasy.htm ''Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within''] at Box Office Mojo (retrieved 12 August 2012).</ref> Some commentators have suggested this may be partly because the lead CGI characters had facial features which fell into the \"[[uncanny valley]]\".{{NoteTag|The [[uncanny valley]] is a hypothesis in the field of robotics and 3D computer animation, which holds that when human replicas look and act almost, but not perfectly, like actual human beings, it causes a response of revulsion among human observers. The concept \"valley\" refers to the dip in a graph of the comfort level of humans as a function of a robot's human likeness.}} Other animated films like ''[[The Polar Express]]'' drew attention at this time as well. [[Star Wars]] also resurfaced with its prequel trilogy and the effects continued to set a bar for CGI in film.\n\nIn [[videogames]], the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation 3|3]], the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]] line of consoles, and offerings from [[Nintendo]] such as the [[GameCube]] maintained a large following, as did the [[Windows PC]]. Marquee CGI-heavy titles like the series of [[Grand Theft Auto]], [[Assassin's Creed]], [[Final Fantasy]], [[BioShock]], [[Kingdom Hearts]], [[Mirror's Edge]] and dozens of others continued to approach [[photorealism]], grow the video game industry and impress, until that industry's revenues became comparable to those of movies. [[Microsoft]] made a decision to expose [[DirectX]] more easily to the independent developer world with the [[Microsoft XNA|XNA]] program, but it was not a success. DirectX itself remained a commercial success, however. [[OpenGL]] continued to mature as well, and it and [[DirectX]] improved greatly; the second-generation shader languages [[HLSL]] and [[GLSL]] began to be popular in this decade.\n\nIn [[scientific computing]], the [[GPGPU]] technique to pass large amounts of data bidirectionally between a GPU and CPU was invented; speeding up analysis on many kinds of [[bioinformatics]] and [[molecular biology]] experiments. The technique has also been used for [[Bitcoin]] mining and has applications in [[computer vision]].\n\n=== 2010s ===\n{{Expand section|date=October 2014}}\n\n[[File:Physically Based Rendering Sample 2.png|thumb|right|A [[diamond plate]] texture rendered close-up using [[physically based rendering]] principles \u2013 increasingly an active area of research for computer graphics in the 2010s.]]\n\nIn the 2010s, CGI has been nearly ubiquitous in video, pre-rendered graphics are nearly scientifically [[photorealistic]], and real-time graphics on a suitably high-end system may simulate photorealism to the untrained eye.\n\n[[Texture mapping]] has matured into a multistage process with many layers; generally, it is not uncommon to implement texture mapping, [[bump mapping]] or [[isosurface]]s or [[normal mapping]], lighting maps including [[specular highlight]]s and [[reflection (computer graphics)|reflection]] techniques, and [[shadow volume]]s into one rendering engine using [[shader]]s, which are maturing considerably. Shaders are now very nearly a necessity for advanced work in the field, providing considerable complexity in manipulating [[pixels]], [[Vertex (computer graphics)|vertices]], and [[Texture (visual arts)|textures]] on a per-element basis, and countless possible effects. Their shader languages [[HLSL]] and [[GLSL]] are active fields of research and development. [[Physically based rendering]] or PBR, which implements many maps and performs advanced calculation to simulate real [[optics|optic]] light flow, is an active research area as well, along with advanced areas like  [[ambient occlusion]], [[subsurface scattering]], [[Rayleigh scattering]], [[photon mapping]], and many others. Experiments into the processing power required to provide graphics in [[real time (media)|real time]] at ultra-high-resolution modes like [[Ultra HD|4K Ultra HD]] are beginning, though beyond reach of all but the highest-end hardware.\n\nIn cinema, most [[animation|animated movies]] are CGI now; [[List of animated feature films of the 2010s|a great many animated CGI films are made per year]], but few, if any, attempt photorealism due to continuing fears of the [[uncanny valley]]. Most are 3D [[cartoons]].\n\nIn videogames, the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox One]], [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] currently dominate the home space and are all capable of highly advanced 3D graphics; the [[Windows PC]] is still one of the most active gaming platforms as well.\n\n== Image types ==\n\n=== Two-dimensional ===\n{{Main|2D computer graphics}}\n{{See also|Video display controller}}\n[[File:Blit dot.gif|thumb|[[Raster graphics|Raster graphic]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s (left) and masks (right)]]\n[[2D computer graphics]] are the computer-based generation of [[digital image]]s\u2014mostly from models, such as digital image, and by techniques specific to them.\n\n2D computer graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional [[printing]] and [[drawing]] technologies such as typography. In those applications, the two-dimensional [[image]] is not just a representation of a real-world object, but an independent artifact with added semantic value; two-dimensional models are therefore preferred because they give more direct control of the image than [[3D computer graphics]], whose approach is more akin to [[photography]] than to [[typography]].\n\n==== Pixel art ====\n{{See also|Pixel art}}\n\nA large form of digital art, pixel art is created through the use of [[raster graphics]] software, where images are edited on the [[pixel]] level. Graphics in most old (or relatively limited) computer and video games, [[graphing calculator]] games, and many [[mobile phone]] games are mostly pixel art.\n\n==== Sprite graphics ====\n{{See also|Sprite (computer graphics)}}\n\nA [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] is a two-dimensional [[image]] or [[animation]] that is integrated into a larger scene. Initially including just graphical objects handled separately from the memory [[bitmap]] of a video display, this now includes various manners of graphical overlays.\n\nOriginally, sprites were a method of integrating unrelated bitmaps so that they appeared to be part of the normal bitmap on a [[Computer monitor|screen]], such as creating an animated character that can be moved on a screen without altering the [[data]] defining the overall screen. Such sprites can be created by either electronic [[Electrical circuit|circuit]]ry or [[software]]. In circuitry, a hardware sprite is a [[Computer hardware|hardware]] construct that employs custom [[Direct memory access|DMA]] channels to integrate visual elements with the main screen in that it super-imposes two discrete video sources. Software can simulate this through specialized rendering methods.\n\n==== Vector graphics ====\n{{See also|Vector graphics}}\n\n[[File:VectorBitmapExample.svg|thumb|Example showing effect of vector graphics versus raster (bitmap) graphics.]]\n\n[[Vector graphics]] formats are complementary to [[raster graphics]]. Raster graphics is the representation of images as an array of [[pixel]]s and is typically used for the representation of photographic images.<ref>{{cite book | title = Processing: Creative Coding and Computational Art | first = Ira| last = Greenberg | publisher = Apress | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-59059-617-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WTl_7H5HUZAC&pg=PA115 }}</ref> Vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering. There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice. There are times when both formats come together. An understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology and the relationship between them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools.\n\n=== Three-dimensional ===\n{{Main|3D computer graphics}}\n{{See also|Graphics processing unit}}\n\n3D graphics, compared to 2D graphics, are graphics that use a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|three-dimensional]] representation of geometric data. For the purpose of performance, this is stored in the computer. This includes images that may be for later display or for real-time viewing.\n\nDespite these differences, 3D computer graphics rely on similar [[algorithm]]s as 2D computer graphics do in the frame and raster graphics (like in 2D) in the final rendered display. In computer graphics software, the distinction between 2D and 3D is occasionally blurred; 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and primarily 3D may use 2D rendering techniques.\n\n3D computer graphics are the same as 3D models. The model is contained within the graphical data file, apart from the rendering. However, there are differences that include the 3D model is the representation of any 3D object. Until visually displayed a model is not graphic. Due to printing, 3D models are not only confined to virtual space. 3D rendering is how a model can be displayed. Also can be used in non-graphical [[computer simulation]]s and calculations.\n\n=== Computer animation ===\n{{See also|Computer animation}}\n[[File:Activemarker2.PNG|right|thumb|Example of [[Computer animation]] produced using [[Motion capture]]]]\n[[File:FractalLandscape.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fractal landscape]], an example of [[computer-generated imagery]].]]\n[[Computer animation]] is the art of creating moving images via the use of [[computer]]s. It is a subfield of computer graphics and [[animation]]. Increasingly it is created by means of [[3D computer graphics]], though [[2D computer graphics]] are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster [[real-time rendering]] needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another [[Recording medium|medium]], such as [[film]]. It is also referred to as CGI ([[Computer-generated imagery]] or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films.\n\nVirtual entities may contain and be controlled by assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object's [[transformation matrix]]. Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form is based on the creation and editing of [[keyframe]]s, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D graphics software will change with each keyframe, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation. Other methods of animation include [[procedural animation|procedural]] and [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating [[particle system|particle]] effects and [[crowd simulation]]s; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a [[hierarchy]] offers in [[skeletal animation|skeletal system]] set up).\n\nTo create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer [[computer display|screen]] then quickly replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image, but shifted slightly. This technique is identical to the illusion of movement in [[television]] and [[film|motion pictures]].\n\n== Concepts and principles ==\nImages are typically created by devices such as [[camera]]s, [[mirror]]s, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, etc.\n\nDigital images include both [[vector graphics|vector]] images and [[raster graphics|raster]] images, but raster images are more commonly used.\n\n=== Pixel ===\n[[File:Pixel-example.png|thumb|right|In the enlarged portion of the image individual pixels are rendered as squares and can be easily seen.]]\n\nIn digital imaging, a [[pixel]] (or picture element<ref>{{cite book\n  | first = Rudolf F. |last = Graf |year = 1999 | publisher=Newnes\n  | title = Modern Dictionary of Electronics | location=Oxford, England\n  | ISBN = 0-7506-4331-5 |page = 569 |url = https://books.google.com/<!--\n  -->books?id=o2I1JWPpdusC&pg=PA569&dq=pixel+intitle:<!--\n  -->%22Modern+Dictionary+of+Electronics%22+inauthor:graf&<!--\n  -->lr=&as_brr=0&<!--\n  -->sig=7tg-LuGdu6Njypaawi2bbkeq8pw }}</ref>) is a single point in a [[raster image]]. Pixels are placed on a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots or squares. Each pixel is a [[sample (signal)|sample]] of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original. The [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three\ncomponents such as [[RGB color model|red, green, and blue]].\n\n[[Graphics]] are [[visual]] presentations on a surface, such as a computer screen. Examples are photographs, drawing, graphics designs, [[map]]s, [[engineering drawings]], or other images. Graphics often combine text and illustration. Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.\n\n=== Primitives ===\nPrimitives are basic units which a graphics system may combine to create more complex images or models.Examples would be [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and [[character maps]] in 2d video games, [[geometric primitive]]s in CAD, or [[Triangle mesh|polygons]] or [[triangle]]s in 3d rendering. Primitives may be supported in [[Hardware acceleration|hardware for efficient rendering]], or the building blocks provided by a [[graphics application]].\n\n=== Rendering ===\n[[Rendering (computer graphics)|Rendering]] is the generation of a 2D image from a 3D model by means of computer programs. A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, [[texture mapping|texture]], [[lighting]], and [[shading]] information as a description of the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a [[digital image]] or [[raster graphics]] image file. The rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software, though others are available as plug-ins or entirely separate programs. The term \"rendering\" may be by analogy with an \"artist's rendering\" of a scene. Although the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the [[graphics pipeline]] along a rendering device, such as a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. A GPU is a device able to assist the CPU in calculations. If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the [[rendering equation]]. The rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-generated imagery. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output.\n\n; 3D projection\n: [[3D projection]] is a method of mapping three dimensional points to a two dimensional plane. As most current methods for displaying graphical data are based on planar two dimensional media, the use of this type of projection is widespread, especially in computer graphics, engineering and drafting.\n\n; Ray tracing\n: [[Ray tracing (graphics)|Ray tracing]] is a technique for generating an [[digital image|image]] by tracing the path of [[light]] through [[pixel]]s in an [[image plane]]. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of [[photorealism]]; usually higher than that of typical [[scanline rendering]] methods, but at a greater [[computation time|computational cost]].\n\n; Shading\n[[File:Shading1.jpg|thumb|right|Example of shading.]]\n: [[Shading]] refers to [[wikt:depicting|depicting]] depth in [[3D model]]s or illustrations by varying levels of [[darkness]]. It is a process used in drawing for depicting levels of darkness on paper by applying media more densely or with a darker shade for darker areas, and less densely or with a lighter shade for lighter areas. There are various techniques of shading including [[Hatching|cross hatching]] where perpendicular lines of varying closeness are drawn in a grid pattern to shade an area. The closer the lines are together, the darker the area appears. Likewise, the farther apart the lines are, the lighter the area appears. The term has been recently generalized to mean that [[shader]]s are applied.\n\n; Texture mapping\n: [[Texture mapping]] is a method for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated graphic]] or [[3D model]]. Its application to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr [[Edwin Catmull]] in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) to the surface of a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon.<ref>Blythe, David. ''[http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/sig99/advanced99/notes/notes.html Advanced Graphics Programming Techniques Using OpenGL].'' Siggraph 1999. (see: [http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/sig99/advanced99/notes/node60.html Multitexture])</ref> [[Procedural texture]]s (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and [[bitmap|bitmap textures]] (created in an [[image editing]] application or imported from a [[digital camera]]) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as [[UV mapping]] (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for [[polygon mesh|polygon surfaces]], while [[non-uniform rational B-spline]] (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic [[parameterization]] used as texture coordinates. Texture mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating [[normal mapping|normal maps]] and [[bump map]]s that correspond to a texture to simulate height and [[specular highlight|specular map]]s to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as [[environment mapping]] to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss.\n\n; Anti-aliasing\n: Rendering resolution-independent entities (such as 3D models) for viewing on a raster (pixel-based) device such as a [[liquid-crystal display]] or [[Cathode ray tube|CRT television]] inevitably causes [[aliasing|aliasing artifacts]] mostly along geometric edges and the boundaries of texture details; these artifacts are informally called \"[[jaggies]]\". Anti-aliasing methods rectify such problems, resulting in imagery more pleasing to the viewer, but can be somewhat computationally expensive. Various anti-aliasing algorithms (such as [[supersampling]]) are able to be employed, then customized for the most efficient rendering performance versus quality of the resultant imagery; a graphics artist should consider this trade-off if anti-aliasing methods are to be used. A pre-anti-aliased [[bitmap|bitmap texture]] being displayed on a screen (or screen location) at a resolution different than the resolution of the texture itself (such as a textured model in the distance from the virtual camera) will exhibit aliasing artifacts, while any [[Procedural texture|procedurally defined texture]] will always show aliasing artifacts as they are resolution-independent; techniques such as [[mipmapping]] and [[texture filtering]] help to solve texture-related aliasing problems.\n\n=== Volume rendering ===\n[[File:CTWristImage.png|thumb|Volume rendered [[Computed tomography|CT]] scan of a forearm with different colour schemes for muscle, fat, bone, and blood.]]\n\n[[Volume rendering]] is a technique used to display a [[3D projection|2D projection]] of a 3D discretely [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] [[data set]]. A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired by a [[computed axial tomography|CT]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scanner.\n\nUsually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image [[pixel]]s in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or [[voxel]] represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.\n\n=== 3D modeling ===\n{{Main|3D modeling}}\n\n3D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical, [[wire frame model|wireframe]] representation of any three-dimensional object, called a \"3D model\", via specialized software. Models may be created automatically or manually; the manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to [[plastic arts]] such as [[sculpting]]. 3D models may be created using multiple approaches: use of NURBs to generate accurate and smooth surface patches, [[Polygonal modeling|polygonal mesh modeling]] (manipulation of faceted geometry), or polygonal mesh [[Subdivision surface|subdivision]] (advanced tessellation of polygons, resulting in smooth surfaces similar to NURB models). A 3D model can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called ''[[3D rendering]]'', used in a [[computer]] [[simulation]] of physical phenomena, or animated directly for other purposes. The model can also be physically created using [[3D Printing]] devices.\n\n== Pioneers in computer graphics ==\n<!-- this is just a first selection. -->\n; Charles Csuri\n: [[Charles Csuri]] is a pioneer in computer animation and digital fine art and created the first computer art in 1964. Csuri was recognized by ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' as the father of digital art and computer animation, and as a pioneer of computer animation by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and [[Association for Computing Machinery]]-[[SIGGRAPH]].\n\n; Donald P. Greenberg\n: [[Donald P. Greenberg]] is a leading innovator in computer graphics. Greenberg has authored hundreds of articles and served as a teacher and mentor to many prominent computer graphic artists, animators, and researchers such as [[Robert L. Cook]], [[Marc Levoy]], [[Brian A. Barsky]], and [[Wayne Lytle]]. Many of his former students have won Academy Awards for technical achievements and several have won the [[SIGGRAPH]] Achievement Award. Greenberg was the founding director of the NSF Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization.\n\n; A. Michael Noll\n: [[A. Michael Noll|Noll]] was one of the first researchers to use a [[Digital data|digital]] [[computer]] to create artistic patterns and to formalize the use of random processes in the creation of [[visual arts]]. He began creating digital art in 1962, making him one of the earliest digital artists. In 1965, Noll along with [[Frieder Nake]] and [[Georg Nees]] were the first to publicly exhibit their computer art. During April 1965, the Howard Wise Gallery exhibited Noll's computer art along with random-dot patterns by [[Bela Julesz]].\n\n===Other pioneers ===\n[[File:utah teapot simple 2.png|thumb|A modern render of the [[Utah teapot]], an iconic model in 3D computer graphics created by [[Martin Newell (computer scientist)|Martin Newell]], 1975]]\n\n* [[Pierre B\u00e9zier]]\n* [[Jim Blinn]]\n* [[Jack Elton Bresenham|Jack Bresenham]]\n* [[John Carmack]]\n* [[Paul de Casteljau]]\n* [[Ed Catmull]]\n* [[Franklin C.

Today, computer graphics is a core technology in digital photography, film, video games, cell phone and computer displays, and many specialized applications. A great deal of specialized hardware and software has been developed, with the displays of most devices being driven by [[graphics hardware|computer graphics hardware]]. It is a vast and recently developed area of computer science. The phrase was coined in 1960 by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. It is often abbreviated as CG, or typically in the context of film as [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].\n\nSome topics in computer graphics include [[user interface design]], [[sprite (graphics)|sprite graphics]], [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], [[geometry processing]], [[computer animation]], [[vector graphics]], [[3D modeling]], [[shader]]s, [[GPU]] design, [[implicit surface]] visualization, [[image processing]], [[computational photography]], [[scientific visualization]], [[computational geometry]] and [[computer vision]], among others. The overall methodology depends heavily on the underlying sciences of [[geometry]], [[optics]], [[physics]], and [[perception]].\n\nComputer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the consumer. It is also used for processing image data received from the physical world. Computer graphics development has had a significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized [[animation]], [[movies]], [[advertising]], [[video game]]s, and [[graphic design]] in general.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe term computer graphics has been used in a broad sense to describe \"almost everything on computers that is not text or sound\".<ref>[http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/tutorial/ What is Computer Graphics?], Cornell University Program of Computer Graphics. Last updated 04/15/98. Accessed November 17, 2009.</ref> Typically, the term ''computer graphics'' refers to several different things:\n* the representation and manipulation of image data by a computer\n* the various [[technologies]] used to create and manipulate images\n* the sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content, see [[Computer graphics (computer science)|study of computer graphics]]\n\nToday, computer graphics is widespread. Such imagery is found in and on television, newspapers, weather reports, and in a variety of medical investigations and surgical procedures. A well-constructed [[Chart|graph]] can present complex statistics in a form that is easier to understand and interpret. In the media \"such graphs are used to illustrate papers, reports, theses\", and other presentation material.<ref>University of Leeds ISS (2002). [http://iss.leeds.ac.uk/info/306/giraphics/215/overview_of_computer_graphics/2 \"What are computer graphics?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106160420/http://iss.leeds.ac.uk/info/306/giraphics/215/overview_of_computer_graphics/2 |date=2015-01-06 }}. Last updated: 22 September 2008</ref>\n\nMany tools have been developed to visualize data. Computer generated imagery can be categorized into several different types: two dimensional (2D), three dimensional (3D), and animated graphics. As technology has improved, [[3D computer graphics]] have become more common, but [[2D computer graphics]] are still widely used. Computer graphics has emerged as a sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Over the past decade, other specialized fields have been developed like [[information visualization]], and [[scientific visualization]] more concerned with \"the visualization of [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, [[Biological Data Visualization|biological]], etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component\".<ref name = \"MF08\">[[Michael Friendly]] (2008). [http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf \"Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization\"].</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of computer animation}}\n\n===Introduction===\nThe precursor sciences to the development of modern computer graphics were the advances in [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], and [[television]] that took place during the first half of the twentieth century. Screens could display art since the [[Lumiere brothers]]' use of [[matte (filmmaking)|mattes]] to create special effects for the earliest films dating from 1895, but such displays were limited and not interactive. The first [[cathode ray tube]], the [[Braun tube]], was invented in 1897 \u2013 it in turn would permit the [[oscilloscope]] and the military [[control panel (engineering)|control panel]] \u2013 the more direct precursors of the field, as they provided the first two-dimensional electronic displays that responded to programmatic or user input. Nevertheless, computer graphics remained relatively unknown as a discipline until the 1950s and the post-[[World War II]] period \u2013 during which time the discipline emerged from a combination of both pure [[university]] and [[laboratory]] academic research into more advanced computers and the [[United States military]]'s further development of technologies like [[radar]], advanced [[aviation]], and [[rocket]]ry developed during the war. New kinds of displays were needed to process the wealth of information resulting from such projects, leading to the development of computer graphics as a discipline.\n\n=== 1950s ===\n[[File:SAGE control room.png|thumb|right|[[SAGE Project|SAGE]] Sector Control Room.]]\nEarly projects like the [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] and [[SAGE Project]]s introduced the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] as a viable [[visual display unit|display]] and interaction interface and introduced the [[light pen]] as an [[input device]]. [[Douglas T. Ross]] of the Whirlwind SAGE system performed a personal experiment in  which a small program he wrote captured the movement of his finger and displayed its vector (his traced name) on a display scope. One of the first interactive video games to feature recognizable, interactive graphics \u2013 ''[[Tennis for Two]]'' \u2013 was created for an oscilloscope by [[William Higinbotham]] to entertain visitors in 1958 at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and simulated a tennis match. In 1959, [[APT (programming language)|Douglas T. Ross]] innovated again while working at MIT on transforming mathematic statements into computer generated 3D machine tool vectors by taking the opportunity to create a display scope image of a [[Disney]] [[cartoon]] character.<ref>Ross on MIT TECH TV 1959 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob9NV8mmm20</ref>\n\nElectronics pioneer [[Hewlett-Packard]] went public in 1957 after incorporating the decade prior, and established strong ties with [[Stanford University]] through its founders, who were [[alumnus|alumni]]. This began the decades-long transformation of the southern [[San Francisco Bay Area]] into the world's leading computer technology hub \u2013 now known as [[Silicon Valley]]. The field of computer graphics developed with the emergence of computer graphics hardware.\n\nFurther advances in computing led to greater advancements in [[interactive computer graphics]]. In 1959, the [[TX-2]] computer was developed at [[Lincoln Laboratory|MIT's Lincoln Laboratory]]. The TX-2 integrated a number of new man-machine interfaces. A [[light pen]] could be used to draw sketches on the computer using [[Ivan Sutherland]]'s revolutionary [[Sketchpad|Sketchpad software]].<ref name=\"WC03\"/> Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small [[photoelectric cell]] in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed in front of a computer screen and the screen's [[electron gun]] fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects \u2013 not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.\n\n=== 1960s ===\n[[File:Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg|thumb|''[[Spacewar!]]'' running on the [[Computer History Museum]]'s [[PDP-1]]]]\n\nThe phrase \"computer graphics\" itself was coined in 1960 by [[William Fetter]], a graphic designer for [[Boeing]].<ref name=\"WC03\">Wayne Carlson (2003) [http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405172134/http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html |date=April 5, 2007 }}. [[Ohio State University]]</ref> This old quote in many secondary sources comes complete with the following sentence:\n:''Fetter has said that the terms were actually given to him by Verne Hudson of the Wichita Division of Boeing''.<ref>Jon Peddie: The History of Visual Magic in Computers: How Beautiful Images are Made in CAD, 3D, VR and AR, Springer, 2013, p. 101, {{ISBN|978-1447149316}}</ref>\nIn 1961 another student at MIT, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], created another important title in the history of [[video game]]s, ''[[Spacewar!]]''. Written for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-1]], Spacewar! was an instant success and copies started flowing to other PDP-1 owners and eventually DEC got a copy.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The engineers at DEC used it as a diagnostic program on every new PDP-1 before shipping it. The sales force picked up on this quickly enough and when installing new units, would run the \"world's first video game\" for their new customers. (Higginbotham's ''[[Tennis For Two]]'' had beaten ''Spacewar'' by almost three years; but it was almost unknown outside of a research or academic setting.)\n\nAt around the same time (1961-1962) in the University of Cambridge, Elizabeth Waldram wrote code to display radio-astronomy maps on a cathode ray tube.<ref>[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/EDSAC99/reminiscences/#EDSAC%201%20people EDSAC 1 and after - a compilation of personal reminiscences], Retrieved 11 July 2019.</ref>\n\nE. E. Zajac, a scientist at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratory]] (BTL), created a film called \"Simulation of a two-giro gravity attitude control system\" in 1963.<ref>David Salomon (1999). ''Computer graphics and geometric modeling''. p. ix</ref> In this computer-generated film, Zajac showed how the attitude of a satellite could be altered as it orbits the Earth. He created the animation on an [[IBM 7090]] mainframe computer. Also at BTL, [[Ken Knowlton]], Frank Sinden, [[Ruth A. Weiss]] and [[Michael Noll]] started working in the computer graphics field. Sinden created a film called [http://techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2012/8/20/AT&T-Archives-Force-Mass-Motion ''Force, Mass and Motion''] illustrating [[Newton's laws of motion]] in operation. Around the same time, other scientists were creating computer graphics to illustrate their research. At [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory]], Nelson Max created the films ''Flow of a Viscous Fluid'' and ''Propagation of Shock Waves in a Solid Form''. [[Boeing Aircraft]] created a film called ''Vibration of an Aircraft''.\n\nAlso sometime in the early 1960s, [[automobile]]s would also provide a boost through the early work of [[Pierre B\u00e9zier]] at [[Renault]], who used [[Paul de Casteljau]]'s curves \u2013 now called [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s after B\u00e9zier's work in the field \u2013 to develop 3d modeling techniques for [[Renault]] car bodies. These curves would form the foundation for much curve-modeling work in the field, as curves \u2013 unlike polygons \u2013 are mathematically complex entities to draw and model well.\n\n[[File:Pong.png|thumb|right|170px|''[[Pong]]'' arcade version]]\nIt was not long before major corporations started taking an interest in computer graphics. [[TRW Inc.|TRW]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed-Georgia]], [[General Electric]] and [[Sperry Rand]] are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid-1960s. IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the [[IBM 2250]] graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer. [[Ralph Baer]], a supervising engineer at [[Sanders Associates]], came up with a home [[video game]] in 1966 that was later licensed to [[Magnavox]] and called the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts, it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen. It was the first consumer computer graphics product. [[David C. Evans]] was director of engineering at [[Bendix Corporation]]'s computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked for the next five years as a visiting professor at Berkeley. There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people. In 1966, the [[University of Utah]] recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest. This new department would become the world's primary research center for computer graphics through the 1970s.\n\nAlso in 1966, [[Ivan Sutherland]] continued to innovate at MIT when he invented the first computer controlled [[head-mounted display]] (HMD). It displayed two separate wireframe images, one for each eye. This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in [[stereoscopic 3D]]. The heavy hardware required for supporting the display and tracker was called the Sword of Damocles because of the potential danger if it were to fall upon the wearer. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, Sutherland became Director of Information Processing at [[DARPA|ARPA]] (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and later became a professor at Harvard. In 1967 Sutherland was recruited by Evans to join the computer science program at the [[University of Utah]] \u2013 a development which would turn that department into one of the most important research centers in graphics for nearly a decade thereafter, eventually producing some of the most important pioneers in the field. There Sutherland perfected his HMD; twenty years later, NASA would re-discover his techniques in their [[virtual reality]] research. At Utah, Sutherland and Evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies, but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company.\n\nIn 1968, Dave Evans and Ivan Sutherland founded the first computer graphics hardware company, [[Evans & Sutherland]]. While Sutherland originally wanted the company to be located in Cambridge, Massachussettes, Salt Lake City was instead chosen due to its proximity to the professors' research group at the University of Utah.\n\nAlso in 1968 Arthur Appel described the first [[ray casting]] algorithm, the first of a class of [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]]-based rendering algorithms that have since become fundamental in achieving [[photorealism]] in graphics by modeling the paths that rays of light take from a light source, to surfaces in a scene, and into the camera.\n\nIn 1969, the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] initiated A Special Interest Group on Graphics ([[SIGGRAPH]]) which organizes [[List of computer science conferences#Computer graphics|conferences]], [[graphics standards]], and publications within the field of computer graphics. By 1973, the first annual SIGGRAPH conference was held, which has become one of the focuses of the organization. SIGGRAPH has grown in size and importance as the field of computer graphics has expanded over time.\n\n=== 1970s ===\nAn important technological advance that enabled practical computer graphics technology was the emergence of [[metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (MOS) [[large-scale integration]] (LSI) technology in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Parslow\">{{cite book |last=Parslow |first = R. |title=Computer Graphics: Techniques and Applications |date=March 1975 |publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]] |isbn=9781475713206 |page=96 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=I6mgBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 }}</ref><ref name=\"Cherry1973\">{{cite journal |last=Cherry |first = Robert William |title=A calculator option for the Tektronix 4010 computer graphics terminal |date=June 1973 |url=https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/16514 |journal=Compilation of Abstracts of Dissertations, Theses and Research Papers Submitted by Candidates for Degrees |publisher=[[Naval Postgraduate School]]}}</ref> MOS LSI technology made possible large amounts of [[computational]] capability in small [[MOS integrated circuit]] chips, which led to the development of the [[Tektronix 4010]] computer graphics terminal in 1972,<ref name=\"Cherry1973\" /> as well as the [[microprocessor]] in 1971.<ref name=\"ieee\">{{cite journal |last1=Shirriff |first1=Ken |title=The Surprising Story of the First Microprocessors |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |date=30 August 2016 |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/silicon-revolution/the-surprising-story-of-the-first-microprocessors |access-date=13 October 2019}}</ref> [[MOS memory]], particularly the dynamic [[random-access memory]] ([[DRAM]]) chip introduced in 1970,<ref name=\"computerhistory1970\">{{cite web |title=1970: MOS Dynamic RAM Competes with Magnetic Core Memory on Price |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/mos-dynamic-ram-competes-with-magnetic-core-memory-on-price/ |website=[[Computer History Museum]] |access-date=29 July 2019 }}</ref> was also capable of holding [[kilobits]] of data on a single high-density [[memory chip]],<ref name=\"Shoup_SuperPaint\">{{cite web |url=http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/PDFs/Annals_final.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040612215245/http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/PDFs/Annals_final.pdf |archive-date=2004-06-12 |title=SuperPaint: An Early Frame Buffer Graphics System |author=Richard Shoup |publisher=IEEE |work=Annals of the History of Computing |year=2001 |format=PDF |url-status=dead }}</ref> making it possible to hold an entire [[standard-definition]] (SD) [[raster graphics]] image in a digital [[frame buffer]], which was used by [[Xerox PARC]] to develop [[SuperPaint]], the first video-compatible, raster-based computer graphics system, in 1972.<ref name=\"Shoup_SuperPaint\" />\n\n[[File:utah teapot.png|250px|thumb|right|The [[Utah teapot]] by [[Martin Newell (computer scientist)|Martin Newell]] and its static renders became emblematic of CGI development during the 1970s.]]\n\nSubsequently, a number of breakthroughs in the field \u2013 particularly important early breakthroughs in the transformation of graphics from utilitarian to realistic \u2013 occurred at the [[University of Utah]] in the 1970s, which had hired [[Ivan Sutherland]]. He was paired with [[David C. Evans]] to teach an advanced computer graphics class, which contributed a great deal of founding research to the field and taught several students who would grow to found several of the industry's most important companies \u2013 namely [[Pixar]], [[Silicon Graphics]], and [[Adobe Systems]].  Tom Stockham led the image processing group at UU which worked closely with the computer graphics lab. \n\nOne of these students was [[Edwin Catmull]]. Catmull had just come from [[The Boeing Company]] and had been working on his degree in physics. Growing up on [[Disney]], Catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that he did not have the talent for drawing. Now Catmull (along with many others) saw computers as the natural progression of animation and they wanted to be part of the revolution. The first computer animation that Catmull saw was his own. He created an animation of his hand opening and closing. He also pioneered [[texture mapping]] to paint textures on three-dimensional models in 1974, now considered one of the fundamental techniques in [[3D modeling]]. It became one of his goals to produce a feature-length motion picture using computer graphics \u2013 a goal he would achieve two decades later after his founding role in [[Pixar]]. In the same class, [[Fred Parke]] created an animation of his wife's face. The two animations were included in the 1976 feature film [[Futureworld]].\n\nAs the UU computer graphics laboratory was attracting people from all over, [[John Warnock]] was another of those early pioneers; he would later found [[Adobe Systems]] and create a revolution in the publishing world with his [[PostScript]] page description language, and Adobe would go on later to create the industry standard [[Image editing|photo editing]] software in [[Adobe Photoshop]] and a prominent movie industry [[special effects]] program in [[Adobe After Effects]]. \n\n[[James H. Clark|James Clark]] was also there; he would later found [[Silicon Graphics]], a maker of advanced rendering systems that would dominate the field of high-end graphics until the early 1990's.\n\nA major advance in 3D computer graphics was created at UU by these early pioneers \u2013 [[hidden surface determination]]. In order to draw a representation of a 3D object on the screen, the computer must determine which surfaces are \"behind\" the object from the viewer's perspective, and thus should be \"hidden\" when the computer creates (or renders) the image. The [[3D Core Graphics System]] (or '''Core''') was the first graphical standard to be developed. A group of 25 experts of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Special Interest Group]] [[SIGGRAPH]] developed this \"conceptual framework\". The specifications were published in 1977, and it became a foundation for many future developments in the field.\n\nAlso in the 1970s, [[Henri Gouraud (computer scientist)|Henri Gouraud]], [[Jim Blinn]] and [[Bui Tuong Phong]] contributed to the foundations of [[shading]] in CGI via the development of the [[Gouraud shading]] and [[Blinn-Phong shading]] models, allowing graphics to move beyond a \"flat\" look to a look more accurately portraying depth. [[Jim Blinn]] also innovated further in 1978 by introducing [[bump mapping]], a technique for simulating uneven surfaces, and the predecessor to many more advanced kinds of mapping used today.\n\nThe modern [[videogame]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] as is known today was birthed in the 1970s, with the first arcade games using [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] graphics. ''[[Pong]]'' in 1972 was one of the first hit arcade cabinet games. ''[[Speed Race]]'' in 1974 featured sprites moving along a vertically [[scrolling]] road. ''[[Gun Fight]]'' in 1975 featured human-looking animated characters, while ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in 1978 featured a large number of animated figures on screen; both used a specialized [[barrel shifter]] circuit made from discrete chips to help their [[Intel 8080]] [[microprocessor]] animate their [[framebuffer]] graphics.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:Donkey Kong arcade.png|thumb|upright|''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was one of the [[video games]] that helped to popularize computer graphics to a mass audience in the 1980s.]]\n\nThe 1980s began to see the modernization and commercialization of computer graphics. As the [[home computer]] proliferated, a subject which had previously been an academics-only discipline was adopted by a much larger audience, and the number of computer graphics developers increased significantly.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (MOS) [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) technology led to the availability of [[16-bit]] [[central processing unit]] (CPU) [[microprocessors]] and the first [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) chips, which began to revolutionize computer graphics, enabling [[high-resolution]] graphics for computer graphics terminals as well as [[personal computer]] (PC) systems. [[NEC]]'s [[\u00b5PD7220]] was the first GPU, [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] on a fully integrated [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] VLSI [[integrated circuit|chip]]. It supported up to [[XGA|1024x1024 resolution]], and laid the foundations for the emerging PC graphics market. It was used in a number of [[graphics cards]], and was licensed for clones such as the [[Intel]] 82720, the first of [[List of Intel graphics processing units|Intel's graphics processing units]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peddie |first1=Jon |title=Famous Graphics Chips: NEC \u00b5PD7220 Graphics Display Controller {{ndash}} The first graphics processor chip |url=https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/chasing-pixels/famous-graphics-chips |website=[[IEEE Computer Society]] |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref> [[MOS memory]] also became cheaper in the early 1980s, enabling the development of affordable [[framebuffer]] memory,<ref>{{cite conference |last=Goldwasser |first=S.M. |title=Computer Architecture For Interactive Display Of Segmented Imagery |conference=Computer Architectures for Spatially Distributed Data |date=June 1983 |publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]] |isbn=9783642821509 |pages = 75-94 (81) |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8MuoCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA81}}</ref> notably [[video RAM]] (VRAM) introduced by [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) in the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"TI\">{{cite web |last=Peddie |first=Jon |title = Famous Graphics Chips: TI TMS34010 and VRAM |url=https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/chasing-pixels/Famous-Graphics-Chips-IBMs-professional-graphics-the-PGC-and-8514A/Famous-Graphics-Chips-TI-TMS34010-and-VRAM |website=[[IEEE Computer Society]] |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref> In 1984, [[Hitachi]] released the ARTC HD63484, the first [[complementary MOS]] (CMOS) GPU.

Graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation, rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and [[mini-computers]]. Typical of the early move to high-resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the computer-aided engineering market were the Orca 1000, 2000 and 3000 workstations, developed by Orcatech of Ottawa, a spin-off from [[Bell-Northern Research]], and led by [[David Pearson, Computer Scientist|David Pearson]], an early workstation pioneer. The Orca 3000 was based on the 16-bit [[Motorola 68000]] microprocessor and [[AMD]] [[bit-slice]] processors, and had Unix as its operating system. It was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector. Artists and graphic designers began to see the personal computer, particularly the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], as a serious design tool, one that could save time and draw more accurately than other methods.  The Macintosh remains a highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and businesses. Modern computers, dating from the 1980s, often use [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons and pictures, rather than text. Graphics are one of the five key elements of [[multimedia]] technology.\n\nIn the field of realistic rendering, [[Japan]]'s [[Osaka University]] developed the [[Supercomputing in Japan|LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System]], a [[supercomputer]] that used up to 257 [[Zilog Z8000|Zilog Z8001]] [[microprocessor]]s, in 1982, for the purpose of rendering realistic [[3D computer graphics]]. According to the Information Processing Society of Japan: \"The core of 3D image rendering is calculating the luminance of each pixel making up a rendered surface from the given viewpoint, [[Computer graphics lighting|light source]], and object position. The LINKS-1 system was developed to realize an image rendering methodology in which each pixel could be parallel processed independently using [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]]. By developing a new software methodology specifically for high-speed image rendering, LINKS-1 was able to rapidly render highly realistic images. It was used to create the world's first 3D [[planetarium]]-like video of the entire [[Universe|heavens]] that was made completely with computer graphics. The video was presented at the [[Fujitsu]] pavilion at the 1985 International Exposition in [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/other/0013.html|title=LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System-Computer Museum|author=Information Processing Society of Japan|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref> The LINKS-1 was the world's most powerful [[computer]], as of 1984.<ref>http://www.vasulka.org/archive/Writings/VideogameImpact.pdf#page=29</ref> Also in the field of realistic rendering, the general [[rendering equation]] of David Immel and [[James Kajiya]] was developed in 1986 \u2013 an important step towards implementing [[global illumination]], which is necessary to pursue [[photorealism]] in computer graphics.\n\nThe continuing popularity of ''[[Star Wars]]'' and other science fiction franchises were relevant in cinematic CGI at this time, as [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Industrial Light & Magic]] became known as the \"go-to\" house by many other studios for topnotch computer graphics in film. Important advances in [[chroma key]]ing (\"bluescreening\", etc.) were made for the later films of the original trilogy. Two other pieces of video would also outlast the era as historically relevant: [[Dire Straits]]' iconic, near-fully-CGI video for their song \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\" in 1985, which popularized CGI among music fans of that era, and a scene from [[Young Sherlock Holmes]] the same year featuring the first fully CGI character in a feature movie (an animated stained-glass [[knight]]). In 1988, the first [[shader]]s \u2013 small programs designed specifically to do [[shading]] as a separate algorithm \u2013 were developed by [[Pixar]], which had already spun off from Industrial Light & Magic as a separate entity \u2013 though the public would not see the results of such technological progress until the next decade. In the late 1980s, [[Silicon Graphics]] (SGI) computers were used to create some of the first fully computer-generated [[short film]]s at [[Pixar]], and Silicon Graphics machines were considered a high-water mark for the field during the decade.\n\nThe 1980s is also called the [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden era]] of [[videogames]]; millions-selling systems from [[Atari]], [[Nintendo]] and [[Sega]], among other companies, exposed computer graphics for the first time to a new, young, and impressionable audience \u2013 as did [[MS-DOS]]-based personal computers, [[Apple II]]s, [[Macintosh computers|Macs]], and [[Amiga]]s, all of which also allowed users to program their own games if skilled enough. For the [[Arcade game|arcades]], advances were made in commercial, [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] 3D graphics. In 1988, the first dedicated real-time 3D [[Graphics card|graphics boards]] were introduced for arcades, with the [[Namco System 21]]<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=536 |title = System 16 \u2013 Namco System 21 Hardware (Namco) |access-date=15 June 2015 }}</ref> and [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] Air System.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=656 |title=System 16 \u2013 Taito Air System Hardware (Taito)  |access-date = 15 June 2015 }}</ref> On the professional side, [[Evans & Sutherland]] and SGI developed 3D raster graphics hardware that directly influenced the later single-chip [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU), a technology where a separate and very powerful chip is used in [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]] with a [[CPU]] to optimize graphics.\n\nThe decade also saw computer graphics applied to many additional professional markets, including location-based entertainment and education with the E&S Digistar, vehicle design, vehicle simulation, and chemistry.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n{{original research|section|date=July 2017}}\n\n[[File:Quarxs-Affiche.jpg|thumb|175px|''Quarxs'', series poster, [[Maurice Benayoun]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Schuiten]], 1992]]\n\nThe 1990s' overwhelming note was the emergence of [[3D modeling]] on a mass scale and an impressive rise in the quality of CGI generally. Home computers became able to take on rendering tasks that previously had been limited to workstations costing thousands of dollars; as [[list of 3D modeling software|3D modelers]] became available for home systems, the popularity of [[Silicon Graphics]] workstations declined and powerful [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] machines running [[Autodesk]] products like [[3ds max|3D Studio]] or other home rendering software ascended in importance. By the end of the decade, the [[GPU]] would begin its rise to the prominence it still enjoys today.\n\nThe field began to see the first rendered graphics that could truly pass as [[photorealistic]] to the untrained eye (though they could not yet do so with a trained CGI artist) and [[3D graphics]] became far more popular in [[Video game|gaming]], [[multimedia]], and [[animation]]. At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the nineties were created, in France, the very first computer graphics TV series: ''La Vie des b\u00eates'' by studio Mac Guff Ligne (1988), ''Les Fables G\u00e9om\u00e9triques'' (1989\u20131991) by studio Fant\u00f4me, and ''[[Quarxs]]'', the first HDTV computer graphics series by [[Maurice Benayoun]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Schuiten]] (studio Z-A production, 1990\u20131993).\n\nIn film, [[Pixar]] began its serious commercial rise in this era under [[Edwin Catmull]], with its first major film release, in 1995 \u2013 [[Toy Story]] \u2013 a critical and commercial success of nine-figure magnitude. The studio to invent the programmable [[shader]] would go on to have many animated hits, and its work on prerendered video animation is still considered an industry leader and research trail breaker.\n\nIn video games, in 1992, ''[[Virtua Racing]]'', running on the [[Sega Model 1]] [[arcade system board]], laid the foundations for fully 3D [[racing game]]s and popularized real-time [[3D computer graphics|3D polygonal graphics]] among a wider audience in the [[video game industry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Virtua Racing \u2013 Arcade (1992) |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p13_01.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412225953/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p13_01.html |archivedate=2010-04-12 |work=15 Most Influential Games of All Time |publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=19 January 2014 |date=14 March 2001}}</ref> The [[Sega Model 2]] in 1993 and [[Sega Model 3]] in 1996 subsequently pushed the boundaries of commercial, real-time 3D graphics. Back on the PC, ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', three of the first massively popular 3D [[first-person shooter]] games, were released by [[id Software]] to critical and popular acclaim during this decade using a rendering engine innovated{{vague|date=July 2017}} primarily by [[John Carmack]]. The [[Sony Playstation]], [[Sega Saturn]], and [[Nintendo 64]], among other consoles, sold in the millions and popularized 3D graphics for home gamers. Certain late-90's first-generation 3D titles became seen as influential in popularizing 3D graphics among console users, such as [[platform game]]s ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time]]'', and early 3D [[fighting game]]s like ''[[Virtua Fighter]]'', ''[[Battle Arena Toshinden]]'', and ''[[Tekken]]''.\n\nTechnology and algorithms for rendering continued to improve greatly. In 1996, Krishnamurty and Levoy invented [[normal mapping]] \u2013 an improvement on Jim Blinn's [[bump mapping]]. 1999 saw [[Nvidia]] release the seminal [[GeForce 256]], the first home [[video card]] billed as a [[graphics processing unit]] or GPU, which in its own words contained \"integrated [[linear transformation|transform]], [[lighting]], [[triangle setup]]/[[clipping (computer graphics)|clipping]], and [[3d rendering|rendering]] engines\". By the end of the decade, computers adopted common frameworks for graphics processing such as [[DirectX]] and [[OpenGL]]. Since then, computer graphics have only become more detailed and realistic, due to more powerful [[graphics hardware]] and [[3D modeling software]].   [[AMD]] also became a leading developer of graphics boards in this decade, creating a \"duopoly\" in the field which exists this day.\n\n=== 2000s ===\n[[File:Killing Floor Biohazard1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|A screenshot from the [[videogame]] ''[[Killing Floor (video game)|Killing Floor]]'', built in [[Unreal Engine 2]]. [[Personal computer]]s and [[console video game]]s took a great graphical leap forward in the 2000s, becoming able to display graphics in [[real time computing]] that had previously only been possible pre-rendered and/or on business-level hardware.]]\n\nCGI became ubiquitous in earnest during this era. [[Video games]] and CGI [[film|cinema]] had spread the reach of computer graphics to the mainstream by the late 1990s and continued to do so at an accelerated pace in the 2000s. CGI was also adopted ''en masse'' for [[television advertisement]]s widely in the late 1990s and 2000s, and so became familiar to a massive audience.\n\nThe continued rise and increasing sophistication of the [[graphics processing unit]] were crucial to this decade, and 3D rendering capabilities became a standard feature as 3D-graphics GPUs became considered a necessity for [[desktop computer]] makers to offer. The [[Nvidia GeForce]] line of graphics cards dominated the market in the early decade with occasional significant competing presence from [[ATI Technologies|ATI]].<ref>[http://www.danielsevo.com/hocg/hocg_2000.htm ''The Future Of Computer Graphics''] Daniel Sevo, 2005 (retrieved 26 February 2015)</ref> As the decade progressed, even low-end machines usually contained a 3D-capable GPU of some kind as [[Nvidia]] and [[AMD]] both introduced low-priced chipsets and continued to dominate the market. [[Shader]]s which had been introduced in the 1980s to perform specialized processing on the GPU would by the end of the decade become supported on most consumer hardware, speeding up graphics considerably and allowing for greatly improved [[Texture (visual arts)|texture]] and [[shading]] in computer graphics via the widespread adoption of [[normal mapping]], [[bump mapping]], and a variety of other techniques allowing the simulation of a great amount of detail.\n\nComputer graphics used in films and [[video games]] gradually began to be realistic to the point of entering the [[uncanny valley]]. [[Computer animation|CGI]] movies proliferated, with traditional animated [[cartoon]] films like [[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]] and [[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]] as well as numerous [[Pixar]] offerings like [[Finding Nemo]] dominating the box office in this field. The ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', released in 2001, was the first fully computer-generated feature film to use photorealistic CGI characters and be fully made with motion capture.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997597,00.html ''Cinema: A Painstaking Fantasy''] Chris Taylor, Time, 31 July 2000 (retrieved 8 August 2012).</ref> The film was not a box-office success, however.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=finalfantasy.htm ''Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within''] at Box Office Mojo (retrieved 12 August 2012).</ref> Some commentators have suggested this may be partly because the lead CGI characters had facial features which fell into the \"[[uncanny valley]]\".{{NoteTag|The [[uncanny valley]] is a hypothesis in the field of robotics and 3D computer animation, which holds that when human replicas look and act almost, but not perfectly, like actual human beings, it causes a response of revulsion among human observers. The concept \"valley\" refers to the dip in a graph of the comfort level of humans as a function of a robot's human likeness.}} Other animated films like ''[[The Polar Express]]'' drew attention at this time as well. [[Star Wars]] also resurfaced with its prequel trilogy and the effects continued to set a bar for CGI in film.\n\nIn [[videogames]], the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation 3|3]], the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]] line of consoles, and offerings from [[Nintendo]] such as the [[GameCube]] maintained a large following, as did the [[Windows PC]]. Marquee CGI-heavy titles like the series of [[Grand Theft Auto]], [[Assassin's Creed]], [[Final Fantasy]], [[BioShock]], [[Kingdom Hearts]], [[Mirror's Edge]] and dozens of others continued to approach [[photorealism]], grow the video game industry and impress, until that industry's revenues became comparable to those of movies. [[Microsoft]] made a decision to expose [[DirectX]] more easily to the independent developer world with the [[Microsoft XNA|XNA]] program, but it was not a success. DirectX itself remained a commercial success, however. [[OpenGL]] continued to mature as well, and it and [[DirectX]] improved greatly; the second-generation shader languages [[HLSL]] and [[GLSL]] began to be popular in this decade.\n\nIn [[scientific computing]], the [[GPGPU]] technique to pass large amounts of data bidirectionally between a GPU and CPU was invented; speeding up analysis on many kinds of [[bioinformatics]] and [[molecular biology]] experiments. The technique has also been used for [[Bitcoin]] mining and has applications in [[computer vision]].\n\n=== 2010s ===\n{{Expand section|date=October 2014}}\n\n[[File:Physically Based Rendering Sample 2.png|thumb|right|A [[diamond plate]] texture rendered close-up using [[physically based rendering]] principles \u2013 increasingly an active area of research for computer graphics in the 2010s.]]\n\nIn the 2010s, CGI has been nearly ubiquitous in video, pre-rendered graphics are nearly scientifically [[photorealistic]], and real-time graphics on a suitably high-end system may simulate photorealism to the untrained eye.\n\n[[Texture mapping]] has matured into a multistage process with many layers; generally, it is not uncommon to implement texture mapping, [[bump mapping]] or [[isosurface]]s or [[normal mapping]], lighting maps including [[specular highlight]]s and [[reflection (computer graphics)|reflection]] techniques, and [[shadow volume]]s into one rendering engine using [[shader]]s, which are maturing considerably. Shaders are now very nearly a necessity for advanced work in the field, providing considerable complexity in manipulating [[pixels]], [[Vertex (computer graphics)|vertices]], and [[Texture (visual arts)|textures]] on a per-element basis, and countless possible effects. Their shader languages [[HLSL]] and [[GLSL]] are active fields of research and development. [[Physically based rendering]] or PBR, which implements many maps and performs advanced calculation to simulate real [[optics|optic]] light flow, is an active research area as well, along with advanced areas like  [[ambient occlusion]], [[subsurface scattering]], [[Rayleigh scattering]], [[photon mapping]], and many others. Experiments into the processing power required to provide graphics in [[real time (media)|real time]] at ultra-high-resolution modes like [[Ultra HD|4K Ultra HD]] are beginning, though beyond reach of all but the highest-end hardware.\n\nIn cinema, most [[animation|animated movies]] are CGI now; [[List of animated feature films of the 2010s|a great many animated CGI films are made per year]], but few, if any, attempt photorealism due to continuing fears of the [[uncanny valley]]. Most are 3D [[cartoons]].\n\nIn videogames, the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox One]], [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] currently dominate the home space and are all capable of highly advanced 3D graphics; the [[Windows PC]] is still one of the most active gaming platforms as well.\n\n== Image types ==\n\n=== Two-dimensional ===\n{{Main|2D computer graphics}}\n{{See also|Video display controller}}\n[[File:Blit dot.gif|thumb|[[Raster graphics|Raster graphic]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s (left) and masks (right)]]\n[[2D computer graphics]] are the computer-based generation of [[digital image]]s\u2014mostly from models, such as digital image, and by techniques specific to them.\n\n2D computer graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional [[printing]] and [[drawing]] technologies such as typography. In those applications, the two-dimensional [[image]] is not just a representation of a real-world object, but an independent artifact with added semantic value; two-dimensional models are therefore preferred because they give more direct control of the image than [[3D computer graphics]], whose approach is more akin to [[photography]] than to [[typography]].\n\n==== Pixel art ====\n{{See also|Pixel art}}\n\nA large form of digital art, pixel art is created through the use of [[raster graphics]] software, where images are edited on the [[pixel]] level. Graphics in most old (or relatively limited) computer and video games, [[graphing calculator]] games, and many [[mobile phone]] games are mostly pixel art.\n\n==== Sprite graphics ====\n{{See also|Sprite (computer graphics)}}\n\nA [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] is a two-dimensional [[image]] or [[animation]] that is integrated into a larger scene. Initially including just graphical objects handled separately from the memory [[bitmap]] of a video display, this now includes various manners of graphical overlays.\n\nOriginally, sprites were a method of integrating unrelated bitmaps so that they appeared to be part of the normal bitmap on a [[Computer monitor|screen]], such as creating an animated character that can be moved on a screen without altering the [[data]] defining the overall screen. Such sprites can be created by either electronic [[Electrical circuit|circuit]]ry or [[software]]. In circuitry, a hardware sprite is a [[Computer hardware|hardware]] construct that employs custom [[Direct memory access|DMA]] channels to integrate visual elements with the main screen in that it super-imposes two discrete video sources. Software can simulate this through specialized rendering methods.\n\n==== Vector graphics ====\n{{See also|Vector graphics}}\n\n[[File:VectorBitmapExample.svg|thumb|Example showing effect of vector graphics versus raster (bitmap) graphics.]]\n\n[[Vector graphics]] formats are complementary to [[raster graphics]]. Raster graphics is the representation of images as an array of [[pixel]]s and is typically used for the representation of photographic images.<ref>{{cite book | title = Processing: Creative Coding and Computational Art | first = Ira| last = Greenberg | publisher = Apress | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-59059-617-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WTl_7H5HUZAC&pg=PA115 }}</ref> Vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering. There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice. There are times when both formats come together. An understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology and the relationship between them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools.\n\n=== Three-dimensional ===\n{{Main|3D computer graphics}}\n{{See also|Graphics processing unit}}\n\n3D graphics, compared to 2D graphics, are graphics that use a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|three-dimensional]] representation of geometric data. For the purpose of performance, this is stored in the computer. This includes images that may be for later display or for real-time viewing.\n\nDespite these differences, 3D computer graphics rely on similar [[algorithm]]s as 2D computer graphics do in the frame and raster graphics (like in 2D) in the final rendered display. In computer graphics software, the distinction between 2D and 3D is occasionally blurred; 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and primarily 3D may use 2D rendering techniques.\n\n3D computer graphics are the same as 3D models. The model is contained within the graphical data file, apart from the rendering. However, there are differences that include the 3D model is the representation of any 3D object. Until visually displayed a model is not graphic. Due to printing, 3D models are not only confined to virtual space. 3D rendering is how a model can be displayed. Also can be used in non-graphical [[computer simulation]]s and calculations.\n\n=== Computer animation ===\n{{See also|Computer animation}}\n[[File:Activemarker2.PNG|right|thumb|Example of [[Computer animation]] produced using [[Motion capture]]]]\n[[File:FractalLandscape.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fractal landscape]], an example of [[computer-generated imagery]].]]\n[[Computer animation]] is the art of creating moving images via the use of [[computer]]s. It is a subfield of computer graphics and [[animation]]. Increasingly it is created by means of [[3D computer graphics]], though [[2D computer graphics]] are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster [[real-time rendering]] needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another [[Recording medium|medium]], such as [[film]]. It is also referred to as CGI ([[Computer-generated imagery]] or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films.\n\nVirtual entities may contain and be controlled by assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object's [[transformation matrix]]. Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form is based on the creation and editing of [[keyframe]]s, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D graphics software will change with each keyframe, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation. Other methods of animation include [[procedural animation|procedural]] and [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating [[particle system|particle]] effects and [[crowd simulation]]s; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a [[hierarchy]] offers in [[skeletal animation|skeletal system]] set up).\n\nTo create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer [[computer display|screen]] then quickly replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image, but shifted slightly. This technique is identical to the illusion of movement in [[television]] and [[film|motion pictures]].\n\n== Concepts and principles ==\nImages are typically created by devices such as [[camera]]s, [[mirror]]s, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, etc.\n\nDigital images include both [[vector graphics|vector]] images and [[raster graphics|raster]] images, but raster images are more commonly used.\n\n=== Pixel ===\n[[File:Pixel-example.png|thumb|right|In the enlarged portion of the image individual pixels are rendered as squares and can be easily seen.]]\n\nIn digital imaging, a [[pixel]] (or picture element<ref>{{cite book\n  | first = Rudolf F. |last = Graf |year = 1999 | publisher=Newnes\n  | title = Modern Dictionary of Electronics | location=Oxford, England\n  | ISBN = 0-7506-4331-5 |page = 569 |url = https://books.google.com/<!--\n  -->books?id=o2I1JWPpdusC&pg=PA569&dq=pixel+intitle:<!--\n  -->%22Modern+Dictionary+of+Electronics%22+inauthor:graf&<!--\n  -->lr=&as_brr=0&<!--\n  -->sig=7tg-LuGdu6Njypaawi2bbkeq8pw }}</ref>) is a single point in a [[raster image]]. Pixels are placed on a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots or squares. Each pixel is a [[sample (signal)|sample]] of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original. The [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three\ncomponents such as [[RGB color model|red, green, and blue]].\n\n[[Graphics]] are [[visual]] presentations on a surface, such as a computer screen. Examples are photographs, drawing, graphics designs, [[map]]s, [[engineering drawings]], or other images. Graphics often combine text and illustration. Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.\n\n=== Primitives ===\nPrimitives are basic units which a graphics system may combine to create more complex images or models.Examples would be [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and [[character maps]] in 2d video games, [[geometric primitive]]s in CAD, or [[Triangle mesh|polygons]] or [[triangle]]s in 3d rendering. Primitives may be supported in [[Hardware acceleration|hardware for efficient rendering]], or the building blocks provided by a [[graphics application]].\n\n=== Rendering ===\n[[Rendering (computer graphics)|Rendering]] is the generation of a 2D image from a 3D model by means of computer programs. A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, [[texture mapping|texture]], [[lighting]], and [[shading]] information as a description of the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a [[digital image]] or [[raster graphics]] image file. The rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software, though others are available as plug-ins or entirely separate programs. The term \"rendering\" may be by analogy with an \"artist's rendering\" of a scene. Although the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the [[graphics pipeline]] along a rendering device, such as a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. A GPU is a device able to assist the CPU in calculations. If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the [[rendering equation]]. The rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-generated imagery. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output.\n\n; 3D projection\n: [[3D projection]] is a method of mapping three dimensional points to a two dimensional plane. As most current methods for displaying graphical data are based on planar two dimensional media, the use of this type of projection is widespread, especially in computer graphics, engineering and drafting.\n\n; Ray tracing\n: [[Ray tracing (graphics)|Ray tracing]] is a technique for generating an [[digital image|image]] by tracing the path of [[light]] through [[pixel]]s in an [[image plane]]. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of [[photorealism]]; usually higher than that of typical [[scanline rendering]] methods, but at a greater [[computation time|computational cost]].\n\n; Shading\n[[File:Shading1.jpg|thumb|right|Example of shading.]]\n: [[Shading]] refers to [[wikt:depicting|depicting]] depth in [[3D model]]s or illustrations by varying levels of [[darkness]]. It is a process used in drawing for depicting levels of darkness on paper by applying media more densely or with a darker shade for darker areas, and less densely or with a lighter shade for lighter areas. There are various techniques of shading including [[Hatching|cross hatching]] where perpendicular lines of varying closeness are drawn in a grid pattern to shade an area. The closer the lines are together, the darker the area appears. Likewise, the farther apart the lines are, the lighter the area appears. The term has been recently generalized to mean that [[shader]]s are applied.\n\n; Texture mapping\n: [[Texture mapping]] is a method for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated graphic]] or [[3D model]]. Its application to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr [[Edwin Catmull]] in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) to the surface of a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon.<ref>Blythe, David. ''[http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/sig99/advanced99/notes/notes.html Advanced Graphics Programming Techniques Using OpenGL].'' Siggraph 1999. (see: [http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/sig99/advanced99/notes/node60.html Multitexture])</ref> [[Procedural texture]]s (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and [[bitmap|bitmap textures]] (created in an [[image editing]] application or imported from a [[digital camera]]) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as [[UV mapping]] (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for [[polygon mesh|polygon surfaces]], while [[non-uniform rational B-spline]] (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic [[parameterization]] used as texture coordinates. Texture mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating [[normal mapping|normal maps]] and [[bump map]]s that correspond to a texture to simulate height and [[specular highlight|specular map]]s to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as [[environment mapping]] to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss.\n\n; Anti-aliasing\n: Rendering resolution-independent entities (such as 3D models) for viewing on a raster (pixel-based) device such as a [[liquid-crystal display]] or [[Cathode ray tube|CRT television]] inevitably causes [[aliasing|aliasing artifacts]] mostly along geometric edges and the boundaries of texture details; these artifacts are informally called \"[[jaggies]]\". Anti-aliasing methods rectify such problems, resulting in imagery more pleasing to the viewer, but can be somewhat computationally expensive. Various anti-aliasing algorithms (such as [[supersampling]]) are able to be employed, then customized for the most efficient rendering performance versus quality of the resultant imagery; a graphics artist should consider this trade-off if anti-aliasing methods are to be used. A pre-anti-aliased [[bitmap|bitmap texture]] being displayed on a screen (or screen location) at a resolution different than the resolution of the texture itself (such as a textured model in the distance from the virtual camera) will exhibit aliasing artifacts, while any [[Procedural texture|procedurally defined texture]] will always show aliasing artifacts as they are resolution-independent; techniques such as [[mipmapping]] and [[texture filtering]] help to solve texture-related aliasing problems.\n\n=== Volume rendering ===\n[[File:CTWristImage.png|thumb|Volume rendered [[Computed tomography|CT]] scan of a forearm with different colour schemes for muscle, fat, bone, and blood.]]\n\n[[Volume rendering]] is a technique used to display a [[3D projection|2D projection]] of a 3D discretely [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] [[data set]]. A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired by a [[computed axial tomography|CT]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scanner.\n\nUsually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image [[pixel]]s in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or [[voxel]] represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.\n\n=== 3D modeling ===\n{{Main|3D modeling}}\n\n3D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical, [[wire frame model|wireframe]] representation of any three-dimensional object, called a \"3D model\", via specialized software. Models may be created automatically or manually; the manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to [[plastic arts]] such as [[sculpting]]. 3D models may be created using multiple approaches: use of NURBs to generate accurate and smooth surface patches, [[Polygonal modeling|polygonal mesh modeling]] (manipulation of faceted geometry), or polygonal mesh [[Subdivision surface|subdivision]] (advanced tessellation of polygons, resulting in smooth surfaces similar to NURB models). A 3D model can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called ''[[3D rendering]]'', used in a [[computer]] [[simulation]] of physical phenomena, or animated directly for other purposes. The model can also be physically created using [[3D Printing]] devices.\n\n== Pioneers in computer graphics ==\n<!-- this is just a first selection. -->\n; Charles Csuri\n: [[Charles Csuri]] is a pioneer in computer animation and digital fine art and created the first computer art in 1964. Csuri was recognized by ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' as the father of digital art and computer animation, and as a pioneer of computer animation by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and [[Association for Computing Machinery]]-[[SIGGRAPH]].\n\n; Donald P. Greenberg\n: [[Donald P. Greenberg]] is a leading innovator in computer graphics. Greenberg has authored hundreds of articles and served as a teacher and mentor to many prominent computer graphic artists, animators, and researchers such as [[Robert L. Cook]], [[Marc Levoy]], [[Brian A. Barsky]], and [[Wayne Lytle]]. Many of his former students have won Academy Awards for technical achievements and several have won the [[SIGGRAPH]] Achievement Award. Greenberg was the founding director of the NSF Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization.\n\n; A. Michael Noll\n: [[A. Michael Noll|Noll]] was one of the first researchers to use a [[Digital data|digital]] [[computer]] to create artistic patterns and to formalize the use of random processes in the creation of [[visual arts]]. He began creating digital art in 1962, making him one of the earliest digital artists. In 1965, Noll along with [[Frieder Nake]] and [[Georg Nees]] were the first to publicly exhibit their computer art. During April 1965, the Howard Wise Gallery exhibited Noll's computer art along with random-dot patterns by [[Bela Julesz]].\n\n===Other pioneers ===\n[[File:utah teapot simple 2.png|thumb|A modern render of the [[Utah teapot]], an iconic model in 3D computer graphics created by [[Martin Newell (computer scientist)|Martin Newell]], 1975]]\n\n* [[Pierre B\u00e9zier]]\n* [[Jim Blinn]]\n* [[Jack Elton Bresenham|Jack Bresenham]]\n* [[John Carmack]]\n* [[Paul de Casteljau]]\n* [[Ed Catmull]]\n* [[Franklin C.

Although the term often refers to three-dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and [[image processing]].\n\nAs an [[academic]] discipline, computer graphics studies the manipulation of visual and geometric information using computational techniques. It focuses on the ''mathematical'' and ''computational'' foundations of image generation and processing rather than purely [[aesthetic]] issues. Computer graphics is often differentiated from the field of [[visualization (graphic)|visualization]], although the two fields have many similarities.\n\n== Applications ==\nComputer graphics may be used in the following areas:\n* [[Computational biology]]\n* [[Computational photography]]\n* [[Computational physics]]\n* [[Computer-aided design]]\n* [[Computer simulation]]\n* [[Design]]\n* [[Digital art]]\n* [[Education]]\n* [[Graphic design]]\n* [[Infographics]]\n* [[Information visualization]]\n* [[Rational drug design]]\n* [[Scientific visualization]]\n* [[Special effects|Special Effects]] for [[Film|cinema]]\n* [[Video Games]]\n* [[Virtual reality]]\n* [[Web design]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Glossary of computer graphics]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n<!-- This section just gives a first impression of the many books in this field.

Tamang believe in Buddhism, and famously said that 90 percent of Tamang follow Buddhism as their religion. Their language comes from Tibeto-Burman language family.

The cover art on this limited edition features more color than the simply pink-toned normal cover.\n\nThe album was supported by a lengthy tour, which included spots opening for the likes of [[Blind Melon]], [[Soul Asylum]], and [[Stone Temple Pilots]] (and shortly before the album's release, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]).\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{Album reviews\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/too-high-to-die-mw0000107415|title=Too High to Die - Meat Puppets Review|author=Prato, Greg|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2017-10-22}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev3score = {{rating|3|5}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&pg=RA1-PA2006|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|date=2011-05-27|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|page=2006|isbn=9780857125958|language=en}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev4score = B\u2013<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/1994/02/18/too-high-die/|title=Too High to Die|date=1994-02-18|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=2017-10-22|author=Eddy, Chuck|authorlink=Chuck Eddy|language=en-US}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Consumer Guide]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating-Christgau|hm1}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVQbszFuEGMC|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=2000-10-15|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishing]]|page=202|chapter=Meat Puppets: Too High to Die|chapter-url=http://robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=2338|isbn=9780312245603|language=en}}</ref> \n|rev5 = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''\n|rev5score = {{rating|3|4}}<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-06/entertainment/ca-19543_1_meat-puppets |title=In Brief |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=1994-02-06 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-05-11 |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev6score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/meatpuppets/albums/album/99987/review/5942113/too_high_to_die|title=Too High to Die Review|last=Weisel|first=Al|authorlink=Al Weisel|date=1994-06-02|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001015423/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/meatpuppets/albums/album/99987/review/5942113/too_high_to_die|archive-date=2007-10-01|url-status=|access-date=2017-10-22}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]'' \n|rev7score = 8/10<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-bfuAAAAMAAJ |title=Spin Alternative Record Guide |last=Weisbard |first=Eric |last2=Marks |first2=Craig |date=1995 |publisher=[[Vintage Books]] |isbn=9780679755746 |language=en |author-link=Eric Weisbard}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Too High to Die'' sold very well due to the success of its single \"Backwater\", which reached #2 and #11 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] charts respectively.

With no fresh land to bring under cultivation, peasants holdings shrank as the output of rice ''per capita'' dwindled\".}}\n\nThe financing of military escalation led to war-time inflation, as land was appropriated from thousands of peasants.

The relative importance of each of these factors on the death toll is a [[#Historiography|matter of controversy]].\n\nThe provincial government denied that a famine existed, and [[humanitarian aid]] was ineffective through the worst months of the crisis. The government first attempted to influence the price of rice [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], but instead created a [[black market]] which encouraged sellers to withhold stocks, leading to hyperinflation from [[speculation]] and [[Hoarding (economics)|hoarding]] after controls were abandoned. Aid increased significantly when the Indian Army took control of funding in October 1943, but effective relief arrived after a record rice harvest that December.

The denial of boats alarmed the public; the resulting dispute was one point that helped to shape the \"Quit India\" movement of 1942 and harden the War Cabinet's response. An Indian National Congress (INC) resolution sharply decrying the destruction of boats and seizure of homes was considered treasonous by Churchill's War Cabinet, and was instrumental in the later arrest of the INC's top leadership.{{sfn|J.

The FAD explanation blames famine on crop failures brought on principally by crises such as drought, flood, or man-made devastation from war. The FEE account agrees that such external factors are in some cases important, but holds that famine is primarily the interaction between pre-existing \"structural vulnerability\" (such as poverty) and a shock event (such as war or political interference in markets) that disrupts the economic market for food. When these interact, some groups within society can become unable to purchase or acquire food even though sufficient supplies are available.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBoth the FAD and FEE perspectives would agree that Bengal experienced at least some grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown-spot infestation. However, FEE analyses do not consider shortage the main factor,{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=424}} while FAD-oriented scholars such Peter Bowbrick hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1986|pp=111\u2013114}} S.Y.{{nbsp}}Padmanabhan and later Mark Tauger, in particular, argue that the impact of brown-spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses.{{sfnm|1a1=Padmanabhan|1y=1973|1pp=11, 23|2a1=Tauger|2y=2003|2pp=65\u201367}} The signs of crop infestation by the fungus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.{{sfn|Tauger |2009|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\nAcademic consensus generally follows the FEE account, as formulated by Amartya Sen,{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1977|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1981a}} in describing the Bengal famine of 1943 as an \"entitlements famine\". On this view, the prelude to the famine was generalised war-time inflation, and the problem was exacerbated by prioritised distribution and abortive attempts at price control,{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough|1y=1982|1pp=127\u2013138|2a1=A.

The British government, this argument maintains, thus bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2010 |p=39}} Auriol Law-Smith's discussion of contributing causes of the famine also lays blame on the British Government of India, primarily emphasising Viceroy Linlithgow's lack of political will to \"infringe provincial autonomy\" by using his authority to remove interprovincial barriers, which would have ensured the free movement of life-saving grain.{{sfn|Law-Smith|1989|p=64}}\n\nA related argument, present since the days of the famine{{sfn|Greenough|1983|p=375}} but expressed at length by Madhusree Mukerjee, accuses key figures in the British government (particularly Prime Minister Winston Churchill){{sfn|Hickman|2008|pp=238\u2013240}} of genuine antipathy toward Indians and [[Winston Churchill#Indian independence|Indian independence]] \u2013 an antipathy arising mainly from a desire to protect [[imperialism|imperialist]] privilege, but tinged also with [[racism|racist]] undertones.{{sfn|Mukerjee|2010|pp=274\u2013275}} This is attributed to British anger over widespread Bengali nationalist sentiment and the perceived treachery of the violent [[Quit India]] uprising.{{sfnm|1a1=Mukerjee|1y=2010|1p=273|2a1=Bayly|2a2=Harper|2y=2005|2p=286|3a1=Collingham |3y=2012|3pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nFor its part, the report of the Famine Commission&nbsp;\u2013 its members appointed in 1944 by the British Government of India{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=423}} and chaired by Sir John Woodhead, a former Indian Civil Service (ICS) official in Bengal{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|p=161}}&nbsp; \u2013 absolved the British government from all major blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Siegel|1y=2018|1p=43|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008 |2p=24 ''note 78''}} It acknowledge some failures in its price controls and transportation efforts{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=43}} and laid additional responsibility at the feet of unavoidable fate, but reserved its broadest and most forceful finger-pointing for local politicians in the (largely Muslim){{sfn|J.

They sought the truth rather than evidence in favour of their [own] hypotheses.

In his account, Bengal was at base susceptible to famine because of population pressures and market inefficiencies, and these were exacerbated by a dire combination of war, political strife, and natural causes.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=138}} Above all else, however, direct blame should be laid on a series of government interventions that disrupted the wholesale rice market.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=262}} Once the crisis began, morbidity rates were driven by a series of cultural decisions, as dependents were abandoned by their providers at every level of society: male heads of peasant households abandoned weaker family members; landholders abandoned the various forms of patronage that (according to Greenough) had traditionally been maintained, and the government abandoned the rural poor. These abandoned groups had been socially and politically selected for death.{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough |1y=1982 | 1pp=261\u2013275|2a1=S.

The \"test\" aspect arose because there was an assumption that if relatively large numbers of people took the offer, that indicated that famine conditions were prevalent.{{sfn|J. Mukherjee |2015 |p=29 }}  Agricultural loans offered no assistance to the large numbers of rural poor who had little or no land.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=553}} Grain relief was divided between cheap grain shops and the open market, with far more going to the markets. Supplying grain to the markets was intended to lower grain prices,{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=545}} but in practice gave little help to the rural poor, instead placing them into direct purchasing competition with wealthier Bengalis at greatly inflated prices.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=559}} Thus from the beginning of the crisis until around August 1943, private charity was the principal form of relief available to the very poor.{{sfn|A. Sen|1977|p=38}}\n\nAccording to Paul Greenough, the Provincial Government of Bengal delayed its relief efforts primarily because they had no idea how to deal with a provincial rice market crippled by the interaction of man-made shocks,{{sfn|Greenough |1982 |pp=127\u2013128|ps=&nbsp;\"Finally, and perhaps most compellingly, responsible officials in the Revenue and Civil Supplies ministries simply did not know how to proceed with relief under the bizarre conditions that had developed by mid\u20131943\".}} as opposed to the far more familiar case of localised shortage due to natural disaster. Moreover, the urban middle-class were their overriding concern, not the rural poor. They were also expecting the Government of India to rescue Bengal by bringing food in from outside the province (350,000 tons had been promised but not delivered). And finally, they had long stood by a public propaganda campaign declaring \"sufficiency\" in Bengal's rice supply, and were afraid that speaking of scarcity rather than sufficiency would lead to increased [[Hoarding (economics)|hoarding]] and speculation.{{sfn|Greenough |1982 |p=127}}\n\nThere was also rampant corruption and nepotism in the distribution of government aid; often as much as half of the goods disappeared into the black market or into the hands of friends or relatives.{{sfnm|1a1=Brennan|1y=1988|1pp=555, 557 |2a1=Greenough |2y=1982 |2p=169|3a1= J.

Nevertheless, food distributed from government gruel kitchens immediately became the main source of aid for the rural poor.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nThe rails had been repaired in August and pressure from the Government of India brought substantial supplies into Calcutta during September,{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=136}} Linlithgow's final month as Viceroy. However, a second problem emerged: the Civil Supplies Department of Bengal was undermanned and under-equipped to distribute the supplies, and the resulting transportation bottleneck left very large piles of grain accumulating in the open air in several locations, including Calcutta's Botanical Garden.{{sfnm|1a1=Famine Inquiry Commission |1y=1945a |1pp=61\u201362|ps=, as cited in {{harvnb|Schneer|1947|p=176}} |2a1=Greenough |2y=1980|2p=214}} [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Archibald Wavell replaced Linlithgow that October, within two weeks he had requested military support for the transport and distribution of crucial supplies.

A key source of impoverishment was the widespread coping strategy of selling assets, including land.  In 1943 alone in one village in east Bengal, for example,  54 out of a total of 168 families sold all or part of their landholdings; among these, 39 (or very nearly 3 out of 4) did so as a coping strategy in reaction to the scarcity of food.{{sfn| \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2009|p=172}} As the famine wore on across Bengal, nearly 1.6 million families&nbsp;\u2013 roughly one-quarter of all landholders&nbsp;\u2013 sold or mortgaged their paddy lands in whole or in part. Some did so to profit from skyrocketing prices, but many others were trying to save themselves from crisis-driven distress.

The denial of boats alarmed the public; the resulting dispute was one point that helped to shape the \"Quit India\" movement of 1942 and harden the War Cabinet's response. An Indian National Congress (INC) resolution sharply decrying the destruction of boats and seizure of homes was considered treasonous by Churchill's War Cabinet, and was instrumental in the later arrest of the INC's top leadership.{{sfn|J.

The novel ''Ashani Sanket'' by [[Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay]] is a fictional account of a young doctor and his wife in rural Bengal during the famine. It was adapted into a film of the same name (''[[Distant Thunder (1973 film)|Distant Thunder]]'') by director [[Satyajit Ray]] in 1973. The film is listed in ''The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made''.{{sfn|Best movies|2003}} Also well-known are the novel ''So Many Hungers!'' (1947) by [[Bhabani Bhattacharya]] and the 1980 film ''[[Akaler Shandhaney]]'' by [[Mrinal Sen]]. [[Ella Sen]]'s collection of stories based on reality, ''Darkening Days: Being a Narrative of Famine-Stricken Bengal'' recounts horrific events from a woman's point of view.{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=37}}\n\nA contemporary sketchbook of iconic scenes of famine victims, ''Hungry Bengal: a tour through Midnapur District in November, 1943'' by [[Chittaprosad Bhattacharya|Chittaprosad]], was immediately banned by the British and 5,000 copies were seized and destroyed.{{sfn|J.

Attempting to determine culpability, research and analysis has covered complex issues such as the impacts of natural forces, market failures, failed policies or even malfeasance by governmental institutions, and war profiteering or other unscrupulous acts by private business. The questionable accuracy of much of the available contemporary statistical and anecdotal data is a complicating factor,{{sfn|Tauger |2009 |pp=173\u2013174}} as is the fact that the analyses and their conclusions are political and politicised.{{sfnm|1a1=Tauger |1y=2009 |1p=175 |2a1=Siegel|2y=2018|2p=43| 3a1=Devereux |3y=2000|3p=23 |4a1=Devereux|4y=2003|4p=256}}\n\nThe degree of crop shortfall in late 1942 and its impact in 1943 has dominated the [[historiography]] of the famine.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2015 |p=12}}{{efn-ua|See for example {{harvtxt|A.

The FAD explanation blames famine on crop failures brought on principally by crises such as drought, flood, or man-made devastation from war. The FEE account agrees that such external factors are in some cases important, but holds that famine is primarily the interaction between pre-existing \"structural vulnerability\" (such as poverty) and a shock event (such as war or political interference in markets) that disrupts the economic market for food. When these interact, some groups within society can become unable to purchase or acquire food even though sufficient supplies are available.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBoth the FAD and FEE perspectives would agree that Bengal experienced at least some grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown-spot infestation. However, FEE analyses do not consider shortage the main factor,{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=424}} while FAD-oriented scholars such Peter Bowbrick hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1986|pp=111\u2013114}} S.Y.{{nbsp}}Padmanabhan and later Mark Tauger, in particular, argue that the impact of brown-spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses.{{sfnm|1a1=Padmanabhan|1y=1973|1pp=11, 23|2a1=Tauger|2y=2003|2pp=65\u201367}} The signs of crop infestation by the fungus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.{{sfn|Tauger |2009|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\nAcademic consensus generally follows the FEE account, as formulated by Amartya Sen,{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1977|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1981a}} in describing the Bengal famine of 1943 as an \"entitlements famine\". On this view, the prelude to the famine was generalised war-time inflation, and the problem was exacerbated by prioritised distribution and abortive attempts at price control,{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough|1y=1982|1pp=127\u2013138|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1977}} but the death blow was devastating leaps in the inflation rate due to heavy speculative buying and panic-driven hoarding.{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1976|1p= 1280|2a1=A. Sen |2y=1977|2p= 50 |3a1= A. Sen|3y=1981a|3p=76}} This in turn caused a fatal decline in the [[real wage]]s of landless agricultural workers,{{sfn|Aykroyd|1975|p=74}} transforming what should have been a local shortage into a horrific famine.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2015|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nMore recent analyses often stress political factors.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=21\u201323|ps=&nbsp;\"The conclusion is inescapable: famines are ''always'' political.\"}} Discussions of the government's role split into two broad camps: those which suggest that the government unwittingly caused or was unable to respond to the crisis,{{sfn|Brennan|Heathcote|Lucas|1984|p=18}} and those which assert that the government wilfully caused or ignored the plight of starving Indians. The former see the problem as a series of avoidable war-time policy failures and \"panicky responses\"{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2002b|p=102}} from a government that was spectacularly inept,{{sfnm|1a1=A.

He is smiling and making a \"V for victory\" gesture.|thumb |upright=0.9 |British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1943]]\n\nSen, for example, does not deny that British mis-government contributed to the crisis, but sees the policy failure as a complete misunderstanding of the cause of the famine. This misunderstanding led to a wholly misguided emphasis on measuring non-existent food shortages rather than addressing the very real and devastating inflation-driven imbalances in exchange entitlements.{{sfn|A. Sen|1977|pp=52\u201353}} In stark contrast, though Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da notes that the exchange entitlements view of this famine is generally accepted,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2015|p=90|quote=The 1943\u201344 famine has become paradigmatic as an 'entitlements famine,' whereby speculation born of greed and panic produced an 'artificial' shortage of rice, the staple food.}} he lends greater weight to the importance of a crop shortfall than does Sen, and goes on to largely reject Sen's emphasis on hoarding and speculation.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|1y=2008|1pp=25\u201328|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2015|2p=90}} He does not stop there, however, but emphasises a \"lack of political will\" and the pressure of wartime priorities that drove the British government and the provincial government of Bengal to make fateful decisions: the \"denial policies\", the use of heavy shipping for war supplies rather than food, the refusal to officially declare a state of famine, and the [[Balkanization|Balkanisation]] of grain markets through inter-provincial trade barriers.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |1y=2015|1p=90|1ps=&nbsp;\"...the lack of political will to divert foodstuffs from the war effort rather than [market] speculation... was mainly responsible for the famine\"|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008|2pp=20, 33}} On this view, these policies were designed to serve British military goals at the expense of Indian interests,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|pp=190\u2013191}} reflecting the War Cabinet's willingness to \"supply the Army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wavell|1y=1973|1pp= 68, 122|2a1=S.

Mukherjee |2015|pp=251\u2013252}} The policies may have met their intended wartime goals, but only at the cost of large-scale dislocations in the domestic economy. The British government, this argument maintains, thus bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2010 |p=39}} Auriol Law-Smith's discussion of contributing causes of the famine also lays blame on the British Government of India, primarily emphasising Viceroy Linlithgow's lack of political will to \"infringe provincial autonomy\" by using his authority to remove interprovincial barriers, which would have ensured the free movement of life-saving grain.{{sfn|Law-Smith|1989|p=64}}\n\nA related argument, present since the days of the famine{{sfn|Greenough|1983|p=375}} but expressed at length by Madhusree Mukerjee, accuses key figures in the British government (particularly Prime Minister Winston Churchill){{sfn|Hickman|2008|pp=238\u2013240}} of genuine antipathy toward Indians and [[Winston Churchill#Indian independence|Indian independence]] \u2013 an antipathy arising mainly from a desire to protect [[imperialism|imperialist]] privilege, but tinged also with [[racism|racist]] undertones.{{sfn|Mukerjee|2010|pp=274\u2013275}} This is attributed to British anger over widespread Bengali nationalist sentiment and the perceived treachery of the violent [[Quit India]] uprising.{{sfnm|1a1=Mukerjee|1y=2010|1p=273|2a1=Bayly|2a2=Harper|2y=2005|2p=286|3a1=Collingham |3y=2012|3pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nFor its part, the report of the Famine Commission&nbsp;\u2013 its members appointed in 1944 by the British Government of India{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=423}} and chaired by Sir John Woodhead, a former Indian Civil Service (ICS) official in Bengal{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|p=161}}&nbsp; \u2013 absolved the British government from all major blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Siegel|1y=2018|1p=43|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008 |2p=24 ''note 78''}} It acknowledge some failures in its price controls and transportation efforts{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=43}} and laid additional responsibility at the feet of unavoidable fate, but reserved its broadest and most forceful finger-pointing for local politicians in the (largely Muslim){{sfn|J.
