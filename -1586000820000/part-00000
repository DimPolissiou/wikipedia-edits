The MacLarnon Cup is the competition for schools at senior 'B' grade.\n\nPlayers must be under nineteen at the start of the tournament. The winners advance to the semi-finals of the [[Hogan Cup]], the All-Ireland colleges \"A\" senior football championship.\n\nThe competition and trophy are named after [[Joseph MacRory]], then [[Bishop of Down and Connor]], who donated the first cup in 1923.\n\nThe 2018\u201319 winners were St Michaels College, Enniskillen who beat Omagh CBS in the final on 18 March 2019.\nThe 2020 final, along with all other Gaelic game activity, between [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's, Newry]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera|St. Patrick's, Maghera]] was postponed due to the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|Coronavirus Pandemic]]<ref>http://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/games-postponed/</ref>\n\nThe final is held every year on (or close to) St. Patrick's Day and is televised live on [[BBC Northern Ireland]] along with the [[Ulster Schools Cup|Ulster Rugby Schools Cup]] final. The venue for the last number of years has been the [[Athletic Grounds]] in Armagh. Previous finals have been held in [[Coalisland]] and [[Casement Park]].\n\n==History==\nAn inter-seminary football competition between [[St Macartan's College|St. Macartan's College, Monaghan]] and [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh]] had been started in 1902. This was a soccer competition until, in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising, a vote was taken to change over to Gaelic rules and St Patrick\u2019s won the first Gaelic encounter in 1918 by 4-4 to 0-1.\n\nBishop [[Joseph MacRory]], the Bishop of Down and Connor at this time, \u201coffered\u201d to present a Cup for the winners of an Ulster Secondary schools\u2019 competition. The \u201coffer\u201d was not honoured for another five seasons however and in the interim the matches between other seminaries and St Patrick\u2019s Armagh are recorded as \u201cchallenges\u201d until the arrival of the first MacRory Cup in late spring 1923.\n\nOver the next five seasons the competition was played on a league basis until in 1928 an Ulster Colleges\u2019 Committee was established and the MacRory Cup competition became the new body\u2019s main competition.  Participation in the MacRory Cup in its early years was confined to those who attended boarding schools. [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh|St. Patrick's Armagh]] were the first winners in 1923, and dominated the competition in its early years. First time victories by other challengers were recorded by [[St Macartan's College|St. Macartan's]] (1930), [[St. Patrick's College, Cavan]] (1935), and [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] (1949).\n\nThe 1930s was notable for the affiliation of a number of Christian Brothers\u2019 schools. These were \u2018day schools\u2019 (i.e. non boarding schools) which catered mainly for boys from humble backgrounds, but they did not yet have the prowess to compete with the established diocesan colleges, as was confirmed by comprehensive defeats for Monaghan CBS (1935), and [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS, Newry]] (1944 and 1947).\n\n1954 was a watershed year in that the triumph of [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS]] after a replay over [[St. Patrick's College, Cavan|St Patrick\u2019s Cavan]] was the first MacRory Cup win by a \u2018day school\u2019; the [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS]] repeated this feat in 1959 and 1964, but no other day school made the breakthrough until St Mary\u2019s CBS in 1971; next came Omagh CBS in 1974.\n\n1976 marks another significant landmark in the history of the competition although that particular Final ended in defeat for [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] a. It ushered in an extraordinary sequence of 14 Final appearances by [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] in the following 15 years, 8 of which were won, including 4 consecutive victories 1982-85. Those 15 years witnessed a legendary rivalry between [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] and [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] when they faced one another in 10 Finals, including replays. These included the iconic 1989 Final, won by [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] on the scoreline 4-10 to 4-9, a game which is widely and rightly regarded as one of the greatest ever played at any level in Ulster. Those were the days when the blanket defence would have been regarded as a distasteful, unchivalrous, and unthinkable option.\n\nThe 1990s marked the arrival of [[St. Patrick's Academy, Dungannon]] and [[St. Michael's College (Enniskillen)|St. Michael's College, Enniskillen]] at centre stage, and accelerated change in the educational domain with the disappearance of the remaining boarding departments in schools, and an equalisation in standards across a greater range of schools.\n\nThe new millennium produced a victory in 2000 for the original kingpins, [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh|St. Patrick's Armagh]], their first victory since 1953, and the next decade was marked by the emergence and appearance of [[Christian Brothers Grammar School, Omagh|Omagh CBS]] in 7 Finals.\n\nThe MacRory Cup, first donated by [[Joseph MacRory|Bishop MacRory]] in 1923, is now fiercely contested by 10 schools annually, and a feature of each successive year is the number of genuine contenders and the unpredictability of the outcome. That original trophy was replaced in 1962, and that trophy, in turn, was retired and donated to the O\u2019Fiaich Library in February 2012. A magnificent replacement trophy has been donated to Ulster Colleges by Cardinal Brady, thereby perpetuating the historic link between the Archdiocese of Armagh and this unique competition. The trophy won in March 2012 by [[St. Michael's College (Enniskillen)|St. Michael's, Enniskillen]] is therefore the 3rd Cup to bear the name of the original visionary, Cardinal MacRory.\n\nFifteen schools have their names on the MacRory Cup with [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] winning the first of their record 19 titles in 1949 and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]], who are in second place with 15 crowns, won their first in 1977.\n\n[[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] also lead the way in terms of [[Hogan Cup]] titles won by Ulster schools with eight and five respectively.\n<ref>http://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/history/macrory-cup/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.irishnews.com/sport/gaafootball/2019/11/01/news/macrory-cup-the-stats-1748138/</ref>\n\n==Competition format==\n'''Current Format'''\n\nThe format introduced at the start of the 2017-18 season continues. Sixteen teams compete in four groups of four teams. After the group rounds, all matches are knock-out. The four group winners are given byes to the quarter-finals. The four teams who finished third play the four teams who finished fourth in playoff round 1 with the winners playing the four group runners-up in playoff round 2 for the four remaining quarter-final places.\n\n'''2016-17 Format'''\n\nThe format was changed for the 2016-17 season. Fourteen teams competed in three groups - Groups A and B had five teams and Group C had four teams. The three group winners and the best group runner-up advanced to the quarter-finals. The fifth-placed teams in groups A and B were eliminated. The remaining eight teams played-off in four matches with the four winners completing the quarter-final line-up. From the quarter-finals onwards all matches were knock-out.<ref>{{cite web|title=New MacRory Cup format for 2016-7|url=http://ulstercollegesgaa.org/general/new-macrory-cup-format-for-2016-7/|accessdate=14 July 2016|date=24 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918093050/http://ulstercollegesgaa.org/general/new-macrory-cup-format-for-2016-7/|archivedate=18 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Previous Format'''\n\nThe competition began with a round-robin tournament consisting of two groups of six teams.

The MacLarnon Cup is the competition for schools at senior 'B' grade.\n\nPlayers must be under nineteen at the start of the tournament. The winners advance to the semi-finals of the [[Hogan Cup]], the All-Ireland colleges \"A\" senior football championship.\n\nThe competition and trophy are named after [[Joseph MacRory]], then [[Bishop of Down and Connor]], who donated the first cup in 1923.\n\nThe 2018\u201319 winners were St Michaels College, Enniskillen who beat Omagh CBS in the final on 18 March 2019.\nThe 2020 final, along with all other Gaelic game activity, between [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's, Newry]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera|St. Patrick's, Maghera]] was postponed due to the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|Coronavirus Pandemic]]<ref>http://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/games-postponed/</ref>\n\nThe final is held every year on (or close to) St. Patrick's Day and is televised live on [[BBC Northern Ireland]] along with the [[Ulster Schools Cup|Ulster Rugby Schools Cup]] final. The venue for the last number of years has been the [[Athletic Grounds]] in Armagh. Previous finals have been held in [[Coalisland]] and [[Casement Park]].\n\n==History==\nAn inter-seminary football competition between [[St Macartan's College|St. Macartan's College, Monaghan]] and [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh]] had been started in 1902. This was a soccer competition until, in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising, a vote was taken to change over to Gaelic rules and St Patrick\u2019s won the first Gaelic encounter in 1918 by 4-4 to 0-1.\n\nBishop [[Joseph MacRory]], the Bishop of Down and Connor at this time, \u201coffered\u201d to present a Cup for the winners of an Ulster Secondary schools\u2019 competition. The \u201coffer\u201d was not honoured for another five seasons however and in the interim the matches between other seminaries and St Patrick\u2019s Armagh are recorded as \u201cchallenges\u201d until the arrival of the first MacRory Cup in late spring 1923.\n\nOver the next five seasons the competition was played on a league basis until in 1928 an Ulster Colleges\u2019 Committee was established and the MacRory Cup competition became the new body\u2019s main competition.  Participation in the MacRory Cup in its early years was confined to those who attended boarding schools. [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh|St. Patrick's Armagh]] were the first winners in 1923, and dominated the competition in its early years. First time victories by other challengers were recorded by [[St Macartan's College|St. Macartan's]] (1930), [[St. Patrick's College, Cavan]] (1935), and [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] (1949).\n\nThe 1930\u2019s was notable for the affiliation of a number of Christian Brothers\u2019 schools. These were \u2018day schools\u2019 (i.e. non boarding schools) which catered mainly for boys from humble backgrounds, but they did not yet have the prowess to compete with the established diocesan colleges, as was confirmed by comprehensive defeats for Monaghan CBS (1935), and [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS, Newry]] (1944 and 1947).\n\n1954 was a watershed year in that the triumph of [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS]] after a replay over [[St. Patrick's College, Cavan|St Patrick\u2019s Cavan]] was the first MacRory Cup win by a \u2018day school\u2019; the [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS]] repeated this feat in 1959 and 1964, but no other day school made the breakthrough until St Mary\u2019s CBS in 1971; next came Omagh CBS in 1974.\n\n1976 marks another significant landmark in the history of the competition although that particular Final ended in defeat for [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] a. It ushered in an extraordinary sequence of 14 Final appearances by [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] in the following 15 years, 8 of which were won, including 4 consecutive victories 1982-85. Those 15 years witnessed a legendary rivalry between [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] and [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] when they faced one another in 10 Finals, including replays. These included the iconic 1989 Final, won by [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] on the scoreline 4-10 to 4-9, a game which is widely and rightly regarded as one of the greatest ever played at any level in Ulster. Those were the days when the blanket defence would have been regarded as a distasteful, unchivalrous, and unthinkable option.\n\nThe 1990\u2019s marked the arrival of [[St. Patrick's Academy, Dungannon]] and [[St. Michael's College (Enniskillen)|St. Michael's College, Enniskillen]] at centre stage, and accelerated change in the educational domain with the disappearance of the remaining boarding departments in schools, and an equalisation in standards across a greater range of schools.\n\nThe new millennium produced a victory in 2000 for the original kingpins, [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh|St. Patrick's Armagh]], their first victory since 1953, and the next decade was marked by the emergence and appearance of [[Christian Brothers Grammar School, Omagh|Omagh CBS]] in 7 Finals.\n\nThe MacRory Cup, first donated by [[Joseph MacRory|Bishop MacRory]] in 1923, is now fiercely contested by 10 schools annually, and a feature of each successive year is the number of genuine contenders and the unpredictability of the outcome. That original trophy was replaced in 1962, and that trophy, in turn, was retired and donated to the O\u2019Fiaich Library in February 2012. A magnificent replacement trophy has been donated to Ulster Colleges by Cardinal Brady, thereby perpetuating the historic link between the Archdiocese of Armagh and this unique competition. The trophy won in March 2012 by [[St. Michael's College (Enniskillen)|St. Michael's, Enniskillen]] is therefore the 3rd Cup to bear the name of the original visionary, Cardinal MacRory.\n\nFifteen schools have their names on the MacRory Cup with [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] winning the first of their record 19 titles in 1949 and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]], who are in second place with 15 crowns, won their first in 1977.\n\n[[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] also lead the way in terms of [[Hogan Cup]] titles won by Ulster schools with eight and five respectively.\n<ref>http://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/history/macrory-cup/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.irishnews.com/sport/gaafootball/2019/11/01/news/macrory-cup-the-stats-1748138/</ref>\n\n==Competition format==\n'''Current Format'''\n\nThe format introduced at the start of the 2017-18 season continues. Sixteen teams compete in four groups of four teams. After the group rounds, all matches are knock-out. The four group winners are given byes to the quarter-finals. The four teams who finished third play the four teams who finished fourth in playoff round 1 with the winners playing the four group runners-up in playoff round 2 for the four remaining quarter-final places.\n\n'''2016-17 Format'''\n\nThe format was changed for the 2016-17 season. Fourteen teams competed in three groups - Groups A and B had five teams and Group C had four teams. The three group winners and the best group runner-up advanced to the quarter-finals. The fifth-placed teams in groups A and B were eliminated. The remaining eight teams played-off in four matches with the four winners completing the quarter-final line-up. From the quarter-finals onwards all matches were knock-out.<ref>{{cite web|title=New MacRory Cup format for 2016-7|url=http://ulstercollegesgaa.org/general/new-macrory-cup-format-for-2016-7/|accessdate=14 July 2016|date=24 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918093050/http://ulstercollegesgaa.org/general/new-macrory-cup-format-for-2016-7/|archivedate=18 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Previous Format'''\n\nThe competition began with a round-robin tournament consisting of two groups of six teams.

In 1903, he and driving partner [[Sewall K. Crocker]] became the first people to drive an automobile across the United States.\n\n==Early life and medical career==\nBorn in [[Toronto]], on March 25, 1872, a son of Samuel Nelson Jackson (1838-1913) and Mary Anne (Parkyn) Jackson (1843-1916). His siblings included [[John Holmes Jackson]], who served zseveral terms as [[List of mayors of Burlington, Vermont|mayor of Burlington, Vermont]]. Another brother, [[Hollister Jackson]], served as [[Lieutenant governor of Vermont]]. Jackson graduated from the [[University of Vermont]] in 1893, became a [[physician]], and practiced in [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]] and [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], Vermont. He married Bertha Richardson Wells, the daughter of [[William Wells (general)|William Wells]], a [[Medal of Honor]] recipient and one of the richest men in Vermont as a partner in Wells, Richardson & Co., manufacturer of [[Paine's Celery Compound]], a popular [[patent medicine]].  H. Nelson Jackson and Bertha Wells were the parents of daughter Bertha (1906-1984), the wife of George B. Kolk.\n\n==Cross-country drive==\n\n===Wager and preparation===\nBesides his medical practice, Jackson was an auto enthusiast who differed with the then-prevailing wisdom that the automobile was a passing fad and a recreational plaything. While in San Francisco's [[University Club of San Francisco|University Club]] as a guest on May 18, 1903, he agreed to a $50 wager (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|50|1903}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) to prove that a four-wheeled machine could be driven across the country. He accepted even though at age 31 he did not own a car, had practically no experience driving, and had no maps to follow. Jackson and his wife planned to return to their Burlington, Vermont, home in a few days, and both had been taking automobile driving lessons while in San Francisco. She returned home by train, allowing him to take his adventure by automobile.\n\n[[File:1903 Winton touring car 01 2012 DC 00466.jpg|thumb|left|Exhibit at the [[National Museum of American History]] recreating H.

A route through the [[Sacramento Valley]] and along the [[Oregon Trail]] also allowed them to avoid the higher passes in the [[Rocky Mountains]].\n\n===Journey===\n[[File:HoratioJacksonNelson.jpeg|thumb|right|Jackson driving the ''Vermont'' on the 1903 cross-country drive]]\nOn May 23, 1903 the car was transported by [[ferry]] from San Francisco to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and pointed eastward.

On the second night, they stopped early in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and replaced them with a large spotlight mounted on the front of the ''Vermont''.<ref name=Duncan/> The duo was also assisted in Sacramento by bicyclists who offered them road maps. Jackson was unable to buy a new tire, but purchased some used inner tubes.\n\nGoing northwards out of Sacramento, the noise of the car covered the fact that the duo's cooking gear was falling off. They were also given a {{convert|108|mi|km|adj=on}} misdirection by a woman so that she could send them to the spot where her family could see an automobile.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nThe rough trek towards [[Oregon]] required them to haul the car across deep streams with the block and tackle. Somewhere along this route, Jackson lost a pair of his glasses. Items continued to be lost, including another pair of Jackson's glasses.<ref name=Duncan/> They were also forced to pay a $4 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|4|1905}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) toll by a land-owner in order to cross his property on a \"bad, rocky, mountain road\" as Jackson described it.<ref name=Duncan/> When their tires blew out they were required to wind rope around the wheels. Jackson did manage to find a [[telegraph]] office and wired back to San Francisco for replacement tires to be transported to them along the journey.\n\nReaching [[Alturas, California]], Jackson and Crocker stopped to wait for the tires. They offered locals rides in the car in exchange for a \"wild west show\". When the tires failed to materialize, however, they continued on after a three-day wait.\n\nOn June 6, the car broke down, and they had to be towed to a nearby ranch by a cowboy on horseback. Crocker made repairs, but a fuel leak caused them to lose all of their available gasoline, and Jackson rented a bicycle for Crocker to travel {{convert|25|mi|km}} to [[Burns, Oregon]], for fuel. After suffering a flat tire on the bicycle, he returned with {{convert|4|USgal|l}} of fuel (which Jackson complained cost him \"nearly twenty dollars\"), and they returned to Burns to fill up.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nOn June 9, outside of [[Vale, Oregon]], the ''Vermont'' ran out of oil. Jackson walked back to the last town to get oil, only to discover eventually that they had been stopped only a short distance outside of Vale. The next day they arrived in [[Ontario, Oregon]], where supplies waited for them.\n\n[[File:Photo bud portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.72|Bud]]\nSomewhere near [[Caldwell, Idaho]], Jackson and Crocker obtained a dog, a [[Pit Bull]] named Bud.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://amhistory.si.edu/onthemove/exhibition/exhibition_7_2.html |work = America on the Move |title = First to Drive Across the Continent |publisher = [[National Museum of American History]] |access-date = December 9, 2017 }}</ref> As it turns out, Jackson had wanted a dog companion since Sacramento.<ref name=Duncan/> Newspapers at the time gave a variety of stories of how Bud was acquired, including that he was stolen; in a letter to his wife, Nelson said a man sold him the dog for $15<ref>{{cite web |first = Sarah |last = Laskow |date = January 22, 2016 |url = https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-first-crosscountry-road-trip-took-2-men-and-a-pitbull-63-days |title = The First Cross-Country Road Trip Took 2 Men and a Pitbull 63 Days |work = Atlas Obscura |access-date = December 9, 2017 }}</ref> (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|15|1903}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}). It turned out that the dusty [[Alkali Flat|alkali flats]] the travelers encountered would bother Bud's eyes so much (the ''Vermont'' had neither a roof nor windshield) that Jackson eventually fitted him with a pair of goggles. At one point, Bud drank bad water and became ill, but survived.\n\nAt this point, the trio became celebrities. The press came out at every stop to take their picture and conduct interviews. At [[Mountain Home, Idaho]], citizens warned them that the Oregon Trail was not good further east, so Jackson and Crocker veered off their original course along the southern edge of the [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Mountains]]. At [[Hailey, Idaho]], Crocker wired the Winton Company for more parts.\n\nOn June 16, somewhere in [[Idaho]], Jackson's coat, containing most of the travelers' money, fell off and was not found. At their next stop, Jackson had to wire his wife to send them money to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. Between June 20 and 21, all three of them got lost in Wyoming, and went without food for 36 hours before finding a sheepherder who gave them a meal of roast lamb and boiled corn.<ref name=Duncan/> Before reaching Cheyenne, however, the car's wheel bearings gave out, and Crocker had to talk a farmer into letting them have the wheel bearings of his mowing machine.\n\nThe travelers eventually reached [[Omaha, Nebraska]], on July 12. From there on, they were able to use a few paved roads, and their trip was much easier. The only mishap happened just east of [[Buffalo, New York]], when the ''Vermont'' ran into a hidden obstacle in the road and Jackson, Croker, and Bud were thrown from the car.<ref name=Duncan/> They arrived in [[New York City]] on July 26, 1903, 63 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes after commencing their journey in San Francisco, in the first automobile to successfully transit the North American continent.<ref>{{cite book |last = Rafferty |first = Tod |title = The Complete Illustrated Encyclopedia of American Motorcycles |location = Philadelphia |publisher = Courage Books |year = 1999 |page = 22 |isbn = 9780762405282 |quote = The first transcontinental crossing by any type of motor vehicle was by [[George A.

About {{convert|15|mi|km}} from home his car once again broke down. His two brothers, each driving his own automobile, came to help him get going again. Shortly after returning to the road, both of the brothers' vehicles broke down, and Jackson towed them both home with the ''Vermont''. Upon reaching the threshold of Jackson's garage, the ''Vermont'''s drive chain snapped.

They were also given a {{convert|108|mi|km|adj=on}} misdirection by a woman so that she could send them to the spot where her family could see an automobile.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nThe rough trek towards [[Oregon]] required them to haul the car across deep streams with the block and tackle. Somewhere along this route, Jackson lost a pair of his glasses. Items continued to be lost, including another pair of Jackson's glasses.<ref name=Duncan/> They were also forced to pay a $4 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|4|1905}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) toll by a land-owner in order to cross his property on a \"bad, rocky, mountain road\" as Jackson described it.<ref name=Duncan/> When their tires blew out they were required to wind rope around the wheels. Jackson did manage to find a [[telegraph]] office and wired back to San Francisco for replacement tires to be transported to them along the journey.\n\nReaching [[Alturas, California]], Jackson and Crocker stopped to wait for the tires. They offered locals rides in the car in exchange for a \"wild west show\". When the tires failed to materialize, however, they continued on after a three-day wait.\n\nOn June 6, the car broke down, and they had to be towed to a nearby ranch by a cowboy on horseback. Crocker made repairs, but a fuel leak caused them to lose all of their available gasoline, and Jackson rented a bicycle for Crocker to travel {{convert|25|mi|km}} to [[Burns, Oregon]], for fuel. After suffering a flat tire on the bicycle, he returned with {{convert|4|USgal|l}} of fuel (which Jackson complained cost him \"nearly twenty dollars\"), and they returned to Burns to fill up.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nOn June 9, outside of [[Vale, Oregon]], the ''Vermont'' ran out of oil. Jackson walked back to the last town to get oil, only to discover eventually that they had been stopped only a short distance outside of Vale. The next day they arrived in [[Ontario, Oregon]], where supplies waited for them.\n\n[[File:Photo bud portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.72|Bud]]\nSomewhere near [[Caldwell, Idaho]], Jackson and Crocker obtained a dog, a [[Pit Bull]] named Bud.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://amhistory.si.edu/onthemove/exhibition/exhibition_7_2.html |work = America on the Move |title = First to Drive Across the Continent |publisher = [[National Museum of American History]] |access-date = December 9, 2017 }}</ref> As it turns out, Jackson had wanted a dog companion since Sacramento.<ref name=Duncan/> Newspapers at the time gave a variety of stories of how Bud was acquired, including that he was stolen; in a letter to his wife, Nelson said a man sold him the dog for $15<ref>{{cite web |first = Sarah |last = Laskow |date = January 22, 2016 |url = https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-first-crosscountry-road-trip-took-2-men-and-a-pitbull-63-days |title = The First Cross-Country Road Trip Took 2 Men and a Pitbull 63 Days |work = Atlas Obscura |access-date = December 9, 2017 }}</ref> (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|15|1903}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}). It turned out that the dusty [[Alkali Flat|alkali flats]] the travelers encountered would bother Bud's eyes so much (the ''Vermont'' had neither a roof nor windshield) that Jackson eventually fitted him with a pair of goggles. At one point, Bud drank bad water and became ill, but survived.\n\nAt this point, the trio became celebrities. The press came out at every stop to take their picture and conduct interviews. At [[Mountain Home, Idaho]], citizens warned them that the Oregon Trail was not good further east, so Jackson and Crocker veered off their original course along the southern edge of the [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Mountains]]. At [[Hailey, Idaho]], Crocker wired the Winton Company for more parts.\n\nOn June 16, somewhere in [[Idaho]], Jackson's coat, containing most of the travelers' money, fell off and was not found. At their next stop, Jackson had to wire his wife to send them money to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. Between June 20 and 21, all three of them got lost in Wyoming, and went without food for 36 hours before finding a sheepherder who gave them a meal of roast lamb and boiled corn.<ref name=Duncan/> Before reaching Cheyenne, however, the car's wheel bearings gave out, and Crocker had to talk a farmer into letting them have the wheel bearings of his mowing machine.\n\nThe travelers eventually reached [[Omaha, Nebraska]], on July 12. From there on, they were able to use a few paved roads, and their trip was much easier. The only mishap happened just east of [[Buffalo, New York]], when the ''Vermont'' ran into a hidden obstacle in the road and Jackson, Croker, and Bud were thrown from the car.<ref name=Duncan/> They arrived in [[New York City]] on July 26, 1903, 63 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes after commencing their journey in San Francisco, in the first automobile to successfully transit the North American continent.<ref>{{cite book |last = Rafferty |first = Tod |title = The Complete Illustrated Encyclopedia of American Motorcycles |location = Philadelphia |publisher = Courage Books |year = 1999 |page = 22 |isbn = 9780762405282 |quote = The first transcontinental crossing by any type of motor vehicle was by [[George A.

About {{convert|15|mi|km}} from home his car once again broke down. His two brothers, each driving his own automobile, came to help him get going again. Shortly after returning to the road, both of the brothers' vehicles broke down, and Jackson towed them both home with the ''Vermont''.

Coincidentally, both Stern and Bennett would later be co-workers at [[SiriusXM]] satellite radio.\n\n==Internet TV and Radio==\nA technology aficionado, Bennett took advantage of the early growth of the [[World Wide Web]]. After leaving FM rock radio in the late 1990s, Bennett created an Internet Television show for Play TV.  The show ended when the company went out of business.

It features a gritty [[neo-noir]] style and uses [[graphic novel]] panels (with [[voice-over]]s) in place of animated cutscenes to narrate the game, as it draws inspiration from hard-boiled detective novels by authors like [[Mickey Spillane]]. The game contains many allusions to [[Norse mythology]], particularly the myth of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], and several of the names used in the game are those of the Norse gods and mythos.

Almost all the gameplay involves [[bullet time]]-based gun-fights. Levels are generally straightforward, occasionally incorporating platforming and puzzle-solving elements. The game's storyline is advanced by the player following Max's [[internal monologue]] as the character determines what his next steps should be. Several of the game's levels involve Payne's [[surrealism|surrealistic]] nightmares and drug-related hallucinations.\n\nInitially, the player's weapon is a semi-automatic pistol. As the game progresses, other weapons become accessible, including melee and hand-thrown weapons. Some weapons can be [[dual wield|dual-wield]]ed. Max regains health by taking [[Analgesic|painkillers]], which can be found throughout the levels. The game's [[artificial intelligence|AI]] is dependent on pre-scripted commands: most of the behavior exhibited by enemies (such as taking cover, retreating from the player, or throwing grenades) is pre-scripted.\n\nThe gameplay of ''Max Payne'' revolves around bullet time, a form of slow-motion \u2014 when triggered, the passage of time is slowed down to such extent that the movements of bullets can be seen by the naked eye and enables Max to perform special moves. Although Payne's movement is also slowed, the player is still able to position the aiming reticle and react in real-time, providing an advantage over enemies. Occasionally, when the last character of an enemy group is killed, the viewpoint switches to a third-person view circling a falling body. Likewise, the camera may follow the path of a bullet fired from a sniper rifle.\n\nThe \"[[Dead on arrival|Dead on Arrival]]\" game mode limits the player to only seven saves per chapter, and the \"New York Minute\" mode forces the player to complete each chapter within the allotted time, which is replenished by killing enemies. Upon completing the game on \"Dead on Arrival\", the player unlocks \"The Last Challenge\" (\"End Combat\" or \"Final Battle\" in the different versions), featuring a fight in perpetual bullet time against the \"Killer Suit\" hitmen.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:May payne panels.jpg|thumb|left|Graphic novel panels are used in place of cutscenes as narration, an element common to neo-noir]]\nThe story is told ''[[in medias res]]'' and consists of three volumes: \"The American Dream\", \"A Cold Day in Hell\", and \"A Bit Closer to Heaven\". The game begins in January 2001, as [[New York City]] finishes experiencing the worst blizzard in its history. The intro sequence shows [[Max Payne (character)|Max Payne]] ([[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]]), a renegade [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent and former [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer, standing at the top of a skyscraper building as police units arrive. He experiences a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] from three years ago. Back in August 1998, Max returned home in New Jersey to find that a trio of apparent junkies had broken into his house while high on a new [[designer drug]] called [[Valkyrie|Valkyr]]. Max rushed to aid his family but was too late: his wife Michelle ([[Haviland Morris]]) and their newborn daughter Rose had already been brutally murdered, sending him into a deep despair. After their funeral, Payne transferred to the DEA.\n\nThree years later, Max is employed as an [[undercover]] operative inside the Punchinello [[American Mafia|Mafia]] family responsible for the [[Illegal drug trade|trafficking]] of Valkyr. His DEA colleague B.B. gives Max a message asking him to meet Alex Balder ([[Chris Phillips (voice actor)|Chris Phillips]]), his handler and best friend, in a subway station at Roscoe Street. Max's arrival at the subway results in a shoot-out after he encounters mobsters working for Jack Lupino, a Mafia [[underboss]] in the Punchinello crime family, attempting a bank robbery by breaking through from the station. Working his way back to the surface, Max encounters Alex, who is killed by an unknown assassin. Payne becomes the prime suspect in Alex's murder because he is still undercover to the media and the fact that he fled the crime scene. Additionally, the Mafia find out that he is a cop and want him dead.\n\nWhile searching for Lupino in businesses owned by him, Max busts a Valkyr drug deal and discovers that the [[Russian Mafia|Russian mobster]] Vladimir Lem is engaged in a fierce turf war against Punchinello's men. While searching, Max gets a phone call from a man named Alfred Woden, stating that the police have been tipped off as to his location, and he escapes. Max eventually finds Vinnie Gognitti, Lupino's right-hand man; he wounds and chases Gognitti through the city and learns the location of Lupino's hideout, a nightclub named Ragna Rock. After gunning down the insane Lupino, Payne meets [[Mona Sax]] ([[Julia Murney]]), a [[contract killing|contract assassin]], who pours him a drink which turns out to be laced with a sedative. In this state, Max is found by the Mafia and is dragged away to be tortured.\n\nMax manages to escape from the Mafia-owned slaughterhouse and enters a brief alliance with Lem. He agrees to kill one of Vladimir's traitors, Boris Dime, and his men aboard the cargo ship ''[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]'' at the Brooklyn waterfront. The ship is carrying a shipment of high-powered firearms belonging to the Russian mob, which Max keeps in exchange for the favor. After surviving a bomb ambush at the Mafia restaurant Casa di Angelo, Max uses the Russian weapons to storm the residence of [[Don (honorific)|Don]] Angelo Punchinello. There he finds the body of Lisa Punchinello, Mona's sister, and discovers that the Don is only a puppet in the Valkyr market when the mafioso is killed in front of Payne by agents of Nicole Horne ([[Jane Gennaro]]), the ruthless CEO of the Aesir Corporation. Horne injects Max with an [[Drug overdose|overdose]] of Valkyr and leaves him for dead, as he experiences a drug-induced nightmare and suffers internal torment from his feelings of guilt for not being able to save his family.\n\nAfter surviving the overdose and awakening, Payne pursues his only lead to a steel foundry located over a hidden underground military research complex. Inside he discovers that Valkyr is the result of the Valhalla Project, an early 1990s [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] attempt to improve soldiers' stamina and morale following earlier [[Jacob's Ladder (1990 film)#\"The Ladder\"|Ladder]] experiments; the project was sharply halted due to poor results but was later secretly restarted by Horne through Aesir. He discovers that his wife accidentally found out about the project, and Horne let loose the crazed Valkyr test subjects into his house. Aesir initiates \"Operation Dead Eyes\" to get rid of evidence and witnesses, including their scientists. Max escapes the bunker at the last moment just as it self-destructs.\n\nMax gets a call from B.B., who arranges a meeting at an underground parking lot. At this point, Max has already figured out that it was B.B. who shot Alex and framed him for his murder. The meeting turns out to be an ambush, and a running gun-fight commences as Max chases B.B. through the garage. After killing the traitor, Max gets another phone call from Woden asking him to come to the Asgard Building. Alfred reveals himself to be part of a powerful [[secret society]] called the Inner Circle, which has strong ties to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]. The Inner Circle members inform Max about Horne's identity but cannot pursue her themselves because \"their hands are tied\". They ask Max to kill Horne in exchange for dropping any criminal charges against him. Suddenly, Asgard is overrun by Aesir gunmen who kill everyone in the meeting room except for Max, who escapes, and Woden, who pretends to be shot. Max has to fight his way out of the building.\n\nMax arrives at the main office of Aesir Corporation and makes his way through the high-tech security building while avoiding strafing runs by a minigun-armed helicopter. Along the way, he runs into Mona again in an elevator, but Horne's men shoot her in the head after she refuses to kill Max; her body vanishes when Max goes back to the elevator. At the top Max confronts Horne, who escapes to the roof and boards the helicopter. Max shoots the guy wires of the building's antenna, which snaps off and crashes into the helicopter, killing Horne. The game's storyline arrives at the point where it first started: the [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit|NYPD ESU]] arrives at the scene, arresting Max and leading him out of the Aesir building, where he sees Woden. Knowing that Woden will ensure his safe passage through the judicial system, Max smiles.\n\n==Characters==\n\n;Max Payne\n{{main|Max Payne (character)}}\nMax Payne (voiced by [[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]]) is a fugitive DEA agent and former NYPD [[detective]] whose wife Michelle and newborn daughter were killed in connection with the Valkyr drug case. Max then goes undercover in the mob and eventually becomes a one-man-army [[vigilante]] waging a personal war on crime. Max ends up killing hundreds of gangsters and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] enforcers while on the run from the police determined on stopping his [[feud|vendetta]] against all those responsible for his family's death. He uses [[metaphor]]s and [[wordplay]] to describe the world around him within his inner monologues, which often contradict his external responses to characters he speaks with. The game presents the story as retold by Max from his point of view.\n\n;Mona Sax\n{{main|Mona Sax}}\nMona Sax (voiced by [[Julia Murney]]): The twin sister of Lisa Punchinello and a contract killer, Mona is the [[femme fatale]] of the game. She has a grudge against her sister Lisa's abusive husband, Mafia boss Angelo Punchinello, whom she desires to kill. After Punchinello is killed, she sides with Nicole Horne, who hires her to kill Max. Finding herself unable to do so, she is shot in the head by Horne's henchman and collapses into an elevator.\n\n==Development==\nRemedy Entertainment developed an idea of a \"third-person [[action game]]\" in late 1996, after completing ''[[Death Rally]]'' (their first game), inspired first by ''[[Loaded (video game)|Loaded]]'' and then by the success of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' (although determined to avoid its \"horrid camera system\").<ref name=Apogee>{{cite web|url=http://www.rinkworks.com/apogee/s/2.8.17.shtml |title=The Apogee FAQ: Max Payne and Max Payne 2 |publisher=Rinkworks.com |date=8 November 2002 |accessdate=16 September 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309145011/http://www.rinkworks.com/apogee/s/2.8.17.shtml |archivedate=9 March 2012 }}</ref> According to the game's story and scriptwriter [[Sam Lake]], for him \"the starting point was this [[archetype]] of the [[private investigator|private eye]], the hard-boiled cop\" that would be used in a game with a \"deeper, more psychological\" story.<ref name=making/> A game prototype and design document of the project, with the working titles ''Dark Justice'' and ''Max Heat'' (a wordplay on this is a TV show called ''Dick Justice'' and a porn film ''Max Heat'', both featured in ''[[Max Payne 2]]''), were soon created and shown to [[3D Realms]], who signed a development deal and production began.<ref>{{cite web|author=J.

In particular, the game's graphics were improved to feature much more realistic textures and lighting, while the multiplayer mode was dropped. The game was eventually released for Windows on 23 July 2001.\n\nAs a result of the inevitable comparisons to ''The Matrix'', the designers have included several homages to the film in order to capitalize on the hype: for instance, the detonation of the subway tunnel door to gain access to the bank vault is similar to the cartwheeling elevator door in the movie, while the introduction \"Nothing to Lose\" level is similar to the lobby shootout scene in the film.

However, the other gameplay features have remained very similar to the original, including the use of polygonal graphics for the characters.

Almost all the gameplay involves [[bullet time]]-based gun-fights. Levels are generally straightforward, occasionally incorporating platforming and puzzle-solving elements. The game's storyline is advanced by the player following Max's [[internal monologue]] as the character determines what his next steps should be. Several of the game's levels involve Payne's [[surrealism|surrealistic]] nightmares and drug-related hallucinations.\n\nInitially, the player's weapon is a semi-automatic pistol. As the game progresses, other weapons become accessible, including melee and hand-thrown weapons. Some weapons can be [[dual wield|dual-wield]]ed. Max regains health by taking [[Analgesic|painkillers]], which can be found throughout the levels. The game's [[artificial intelligence|AI]] is dependent on pre-scripted commands: most of the behavior exhibited by enemies (such as taking cover, retreating from the player, or throwing grenades) is pre-scripted.\n\nThe gameplay of ''Max Payne'' revolves around bullet time, a form of slow-motion \u2014 when triggered, the passage of time is slowed down to such extent that the movements of bullets can be seen by the naked eye and enables Max to perform special moves. Although Payne's movement is also slowed, the player is still able to position the aiming reticle and react in real-time, providing an advantage over enemies. Occasionally, when the last character of an enemy group is killed, the viewpoint switches to a third-person view circling a falling body. Likewise, the camera may follow the path of a bullet fired from a sniper rifle.\n\nThe \"[[Dead on arrival|Dead on Arrival]]\" game mode limits the player to only seven saves per chapter, and the \"New York Minute\" mode forces the player to complete each chapter within the allotted time, which is replenished by killing enemies. Upon completing the game on \"Dead on Arrival\", the player unlocks \"The Last Challenge\" (\"End Combat\" or \"Final Battle\" in the different versions), featuring a fight in perpetual bullet time against the \"Killer Suit\" hitmen.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:May payne panels.jpg|thumb|left|Graphic novel panels are used in place of cutscenes as narration, an element common to neo-noir]]\nThe story is told ''[[in medias res]]'' and consists of three volumes: \"The American Dream\", \"A Cold Day in Hell\", and \"A Bit Closer to Heaven\". The game begins in January 2001, as [[New York City]] finishes experiencing the worst blizzard in its history. The intro sequence shows [[Max Payne (character)|Max Payne]] ([[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]]), a renegade [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent and former [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer, standing at the top of a skyscraper building as police units arrive. He experiences a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] from three years ago. Back in August 1998, Max returned home in New Jersey to find that a trio of apparent junkies had broken into his house while high on a new [[designer drug]] called [[Valkyrie|Valkyr]]. Max rushed to aid his family but was too late: his wife Michelle ([[Haviland Morris]]) and their newborn daughter Rose had already been brutally murdered, sending him into a deep despair. After their funeral, Payne transferred to the DEA.\n\nThree years later, Max is employed as an [[undercover]] operative inside the Punchinello [[American Mafia|Mafia]] family responsible for the [[Illegal drug trade|trafficking]] of Valkyr. His DEA colleague B.B. gives Max a message asking him to meet Alex Balder ([[Chris Phillips (voice actor)|Chris Phillips]]), his handler and best friend, in a subway station at Roscoe Street. Max's arrival at the subway results in a shoot-out after he encounters mobsters working for Jack Lupino, a Mafia [[underboss]] in the Punchinello crime family, attempting a bank robbery by breaking through from the station. Working his way back to the surface, Max encounters Alex, who is killed by an unknown assassin. Payne becomes the prime suspect in Alex's murder because he is still undercover to the media and the fact that he fled the crime scene. Additionally, the Mafia find out that he is a cop and want him dead.\n\nWhile searching for Lupino in businesses owned by him, Max busts a Valkyr drug deal and discovers that the [[Russian Mafia|Russian mobster]] Vladimir Lem is engaged in a fierce turf war against Punchinello's men. While searching, Max gets a phone call from a man named Alfred Woden, stating that the police have been tipped off as to his location, and he escapes. Max eventually finds Vinnie Gognitti, Lupino's right-hand man; he wounds and chases Gognitti through the city and learns the location of Lupino's hideout, a nightclub named Ragna Rock. After gunning down the insane Lupino, Payne meets [[Mona Sax]] ([[Julia Murney]]), a [[contract killing|contract assassin]], who pours him a drink which turns out to be laced with a sedative. In this state, Max is found by the Mafia and is dragged away to be tortured.\n\nMax manages to escape from the Mafia-owned slaughterhouse and enters a brief alliance with Lem. He agrees to kill one of Vladimir's traitors, Boris Dime, and his men aboard the cargo ship ''[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]'' at the Brooklyn waterfront. The ship is carrying a shipment of high-powered firearms belonging to the Russian mob, which Max keeps in exchange for the favor. After surviving a bomb ambush at the Mafia restaurant Casa di Angelo, Max uses the Russian weapons to storm the residence of [[Don (honorific)|Don]] Angelo Punchinello. There he finds the body of Lisa Punchinello, Mona's sister, and discovers that the Don is only a puppet in the Valkyr market when the mafioso is killed in front of Payne by agents of Nicole Horne ([[Jane Gennaro]]), the ruthless CEO of the Aesir Corporation. Horne injects Max with an [[Drug overdose|overdose]] of Valkyr and leaves him for dead, as he experiences a drug-induced nightmare and suffers internal torment from his feelings of guilt for not being able to save his family.\n\nAfter surviving the overdose and awakening, Payne pursues his only lead to a steel foundry located over a hidden underground military research complex. Inside he discovers that Valkyr is the result of the Valhalla Project, an early 1990s [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] attempt to improve soldiers' stamina and morale following earlier [[Jacob's Ladder (1990 film)#\"The Ladder\"|Ladder]] experiments; the project was sharply halted due to poor results but was later secretly restarted by Horne through Aesir. He discovers that his wife accidentally found out about the project, and Horne let loose the crazed Valkyr test subjects into his house. Aesir initiates \"Operation Dead Eyes\" to get rid of evidence and witnesses, including their scientists. Max escapes the bunker at the last moment just as it self-destructs.\n\nMax gets a call from B.B., who arranges a meeting at an underground parking lot. At this point, Max has already figured out that it was B.B. who shot Alex and framed him for his murder. The meeting turns out to be an ambush, and a running gun-fight commences as Max chases B.B. through the garage. After killing the traitor, Max gets another phone call from Woden asking him to come to the Asgard Building. Alfred reveals himself to be part of a powerful [[secret society]] called the Inner Circle, which has strong ties to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]. The Inner Circle members inform Max about Horne's identity but cannot pursue her themselves because \"their hands are tied\". They ask Max to kill Horne in exchange for dropping any criminal charges against him. Suddenly, Asgard is overrun by Aesir gunmen who kill everyone in the meeting room except for Max, who escapes, and Woden, who pretends to be shot. Max has to fight his way out of the building.\n\nMax arrives at the main office of Aesir Corporation and makes his way through the high-tech security building while avoiding strafing runs by a minigun-armed helicopter. Along the way, he runs into Mona again in an elevator, but Horne's men shoot her in the head after she refuses to kill Max; her body vanishes when Max goes back to the elevator. At the top Max confronts Horne, who escapes to the roof and boards the helicopter. Max shoots the guy wires of the building's antenna, which snaps off and crashes into the helicopter, killing Horne. The game's storyline arrives at the point where it first started: the [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit|NYPD ESU]] arrives at the scene, arresting Max and leading him out of the Aesir building, where he sees Woden. Knowing that Woden will ensure his safe passage through the judicial system, Max smiles.\n\n==Characters==\n\n;Max Payne\n{{main|Max Payne (character)}}\nMax Payne (voiced by [[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]]) is a fugitive DEA agent and former NYPD [[detective]] whose wife Michelle and newborn daughter were killed in connection with the Valkyr drug case. Max then goes undercover in the mob and eventually becomes a one-man-army [[vigilante]] waging a personal war on crime. Max ends up killing hundreds of gangsters and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] enforcers while on the run from the police determined on stopping his [[feud|vendetta]] against all those responsible for his family's death. He uses [[metaphor]]s and [[wordplay]] to describe the world around him within his inner monologues, which often contradict his external responses to characters he speaks with. The game presents the story as retold by Max from his point of view.\n\n;Mona Sax\n{{main|Mona Sax}}\nMona Sax (voiced by [[Julia Murney]]): The twin sister of Lisa Punchinello and a contract killer, Mona is the [[femme fatale]] of the game. She has a grudge against her sister Lisa's abusive husband, Mafia boss Angelo Punchinello, whom she desires to kill. After Punchinello is killed, she sides with Nicole Horne, who hires her to kill Max.

In particular, the game's graphics were improved to feature much more realistic textures and lighting, while the multiplayer mode was dropped. The game was eventually released for Windows on 23 July 2001.\n\nAs a result of the inevitable comparisons to ''The Matrix'', the designers have included several homages to the film in order to capitalize on the hype: for instance, the detonation of the subway tunnel door to gain access to the bank vault is similar to the cartwheeling elevator door in the movie, while the introduction \"Nothing to Lose\" level is similar to the lobby shootout scene in the film.

However, the other gameplay features have remained very similar to the original, including the use of polygonal graphics for the characters. The story also remained the same as in PC and console versions, though some levels from the original are omitted, and the game still features many of the original's graphic novel sections, complete with some of the voice-overs.

Like other special operations units, SR units may also carry out direct action (DA) and unconventional warfare (UW), including guerrilla operations. As SOWT they were tactical observer/forecasters with ground combat capabilities and fell under the Air Force Special Tactics within the [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] (AFSOC). The mission of a Special Operations Weather Team Specialist was to deploy by the most feasible means available into combat and non-permissive environments to collect and interpret [[Meteorology|meteorological]] data and provide air and ground forces commanders with timely, accurate [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]]. They collect data, assist mission planning, generate accurate and mission-tailored target and route forecasts in support of global special operations, conduct special weather [[reconnaissance]] and train foreign national forces.

However, the changes in the pipeline will include adding reconnaissance-specific training, military free-fall and combat diver course.\n\nSOWT\u2019s new role as special reconnaissance, or SR, will shift from a specialized weather analysis focus to one of multi-domain reconnaissance and surveillance, AFSOC officials said.<ref>https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2019/05/13/spec-ops-weathermen-get-name-change-new-mission-to-better-better-fight-great-powers/</ref>}}\n\n==History==\nDuring [[World War II]], Army Air Forces combat weathermen supported the American effort against the Japanese in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India theater]] of operations. They also participated in the European theater at [[Normandy Beach]], France; and in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Yugoslavia]].\n\nHowever most of the special operations weather lineage, honors, and heraldry origins of WWII are attributed to the 10th Weather Squadron, at New Delhi, India under the 10th Air Force.  The 10th Weather Squadron was constituted 10th Weather on 15 Jun 1942 and activated on 24 Jun 1942 (New Delhi, India).  Inactivated on 3 Jul 1946 the 10th Weather Squadron was subsequently activated on 1 June 1948, inactivated on 20 May 1952, activated on 16 Jun 1966, organized on 8 Jul 1966, inactivated on 30 Sep 1975, designated 10th Combat Weather Squadron and activated on 1 Apr 1996, and finally inactivated 7 May 2014.  The inactivation of the 10th Combat Weather Squadron resulted in special operations weathermen from the unit being integrated into 720th STG.\n\nThe various regional conflicts escalating in Southeast Asia during the years 1961 through 1975 were causal for reactivating the 10th Weather Squadron on 8 July 1966 at [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]] in Thailand, to conduct combat weather operations in Southeast Asia. The 10th subsequently relocated to Long Binh AI, RVN, 3 Aug 1967 and then to Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, 18 February 1974 before being inactivated 30 June 1972. The squadron trained indigenous weather personnel and set up the clandestine weather observation networks throughout Southeast Asia. The 10th Weather Squadron played an important part in the raid on the Son Tay POW camp (a.k.a. [[Operation Ivory Coast]]) of 1970. The weather forecasting for this mission primarily relied upon images obtained from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites, data obtained by weather aircraft reconnaissance sorties, and extensive climatic analysis data.  Weather forecaster Major Keith R. Grimes who as Lt Col became the commander of the 10th during the period from 7 July 1974 to 15 Jul 1975 was weather advisor to the Joint Task Force Commander planning Operation Ivory Coast. It is Major Grimes' extensive work with climatological data and forecasts prepared by Air Weather Service personnel credited by Air Weather Service historians as setting raid's general date.\n\nPreviously during 1963 and 1964 then Captain Keith R. Grimes organized the first ad-hoc Air Weather Service Unconventional Warfare Detachment at Hurlburt Field, FL, during 1963 and 1964.  These few in member numbers special warfare weathermen began deploying to Laos with primary mission training friendly forces to take and report weather observation.  It was this small in numbers group of weathermen who worked clandestinely in Laos, under dangerous conditions and on a nearly uninterrupted basis, to establish and maintain a weather observing and reporting net essential to combat air operations. Posing as civilians with varying cover stories and carrying only a civilian identification card functioned not only as weathermen and advisors, but as forward air controllers, intelligence gatherers, and fighters. By 1972 the Air Weather Service had twenty-seven jump qualified combat weather team weathermen. Most were assigned in support of the XVIII Airborne Corps, or the 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions, but others were assigned with the 7th Weather Squadron in Germany and eight were assigned with the 5th Weather Wing's Detachment 75 at Eglin AFB's Hurlburt Field in support of Air Force and Army Special Forces. From 1972 to about 1985 parachutist qualified combat weather teams and special operations weather teams were considered nonessential.  The prevailing senior leadership attitude during this period was expressed by a question AWS chief of staff, Colonel Edwin E. Carmell hypothetically asked in December 1972 of \"If you look at it objectively, what kinds of weather [data] do you get out of those guys?\" in referring to Detachment 75.  \"I think the answer is pretty clear,\" he continued: \"they aren't needed.\"\n\nThe decisive origins of Special Operations Weather becoming a unique separate career weather Air Force Specialty Code having a specialty description is the 1 October 1996 reactivation of the 10th Air Weather Squadron as the 10th Combat Weather Squadron (10th CWS) and assigned to the 720th Special Tactics Group (720th STG) of the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).  On 5 May 2008, the Air Force approved the establishment of a new Air Force Specialty Code for Special Operations Weather, formally recognizing their commitment to deploy into restricted environments by air, land or sea to conduct weather operations, observe and analyze all environmental data.  The 10th Combat Weather Squadron was inactivated 7 May 2014 with special operations weathermen from the unit being integrated into the Special Tactics Group, Wing and Squadrons.\n\nSpecial operations weathermen were not included in the failed US embassy hostage rescue attempt in [[Iran]] in 1980, known as [[Operation Eagle Claw]].  A review group composed of six senior military officials (Admiral James L. Holloway III, United States Navy, Retired; Lieutenant General Samuel v. Wilson, United States Army, Retired; Lieutenant General Leroy J. Manor, United States Army Retired; Major General James C. Smith, United States Army; Major General John L, Piotrowski, United States Air Force, Major and General Alfred H. Gray, Jr., United States Marine Corps) released a report titled \"Rescue Mission Report, August 1980\" on Saturday, 23 August 1980.  Issue 15 \"Weather Reconnaissance\" (pages 40 and 41) of the report discusses the ability of the Joint Task Force's weather team (the AWS team was assigned to the JTP J-2 section) to accurately and reliably forecast Iranian weather, particularly along the 200 nautical mile helicopter route is discussed. The report asserts \"in hindsight\" that more timely and accurate weather data could and should have been obtained from a WC-130 reconnaissance sortie scouting the route ahead of the helicopters, which would have encountered the dust phenomena before the helicopters and forwarded this info to the helicopters.  However immediately following the \"hindsight\" suggestion is disclosure of the OPSEC risks of such a WC-130 pathfinder reconnaissance, potentially causing mission compromise, was considered to override any advantages gained.  Regardless, this working group's assessment for direct weather causals for mission abort and the Desert One tragedy was insufficient and inadequate command and control combined with lack of precise weather abort criteria being determined during mission planning for mission aircrews to rely on in the absence of positive command and control.\n\nSpecial operations weathermen have directly participated in the majority of modern special operations contingency operations since [[Operation Urgent Fury]], the U.S. invasion of [[Grenada]] working with other special operations and conventional forces.

The squadron is responsible for training indigenous weather personnel and setting up the clandestine weather observation networks throughout Southeast Asia.\n* November 1971: Timing for the Son Tay Raid was based on the three-day forecast. However much of the preliminary weather planning deciding when to best make the raid was accomplished in the United States by Major, subsequently Lt Col, Keith R. Grimes on a temporary duty assignment basis from May 1970 until January 1971.  During this period he was a faculty member of the Air Command and Staff College.   He arrived in Southeast Asia at Tan Son Nhut on 10 November 1970.   He subsequently personally selected and obtained two 1st Weather Group weather forecasters (Senior Master Sergeant Van Houdt and Master Sergeant Ralston) to perform the mission forecasting. The weather forecasting for the actual raid mostly relied on weather satellite data and data from numerous aerial weather reconnaissance sorties that were flown daily, including the day of the raid.  The weather support personnel successfully used data from weather satellites (DMSP products) and data from aircraft weather reconnaissance sorties to forecast the only 12 hours of \"go\" conditions during a 38-day period.\n\n==Status in the 21st Century==\n\nThe Air Force refers to all its ground element as Battlefield Airmen (BA).

They gathered, assessed, and interpreted weather and environmental intelligence from forward deployed locations, working primarily with Air Force and [[Army Special Operations Forces]]. SOWTs could also have been attached to [[United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command|Marine MARSOC]] and [[Navy SEAL]] teams, to collect weather, ocean, river, snow and terrain intelligence, assist mission planning, generate accurate mission-tailored target and route forecasts in support of global special operations and train joint force members and coalition partners to take and communicate limited weather observations.  They operated on 2-3 man Environmental Reconnaissance Teams (ERT).  ERT's which were attached to 8-9 man Special Tactics Teams (STT) alongside Combat Control (CCT) and Pararescue (PJ) personnel.  Together they provide SOCOM a unique capability to establish and control austere airfields in permissive and non-permissive environments.   Additionally, Special Operations Weathermen conducted special reconnaissance, fly small unmanned aerial systems (SUAS),  collected upper air data, organized, established and maintained weather data reporting networks, determined host nation meteorological capabilities and trained foreign national forces.\n\nThe mission of their successor, Special Reconnaissance, other than multi-domain reconnaissance and surveillance  is not yet publicly available.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of United States Air Force special tactics squadrons]]\n* [[United States Special Operations Forces]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n'''Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC)'''\n\n*21 STS, Pope Army Airfield, Fort Bragg, NC\n*22 STS, McChord Field, WA\n*23 STS, Hurlburt Field, FL\n*24 STS Pope Army Airfield, Fort Bragg, NC\n*321 STS, RAF Mildenhall, UK\n*320 STS, Kadena AB, Japan\n\n'''Air National Guard (ANG)'''\n\n*123d Special Tactics Sq, Louisville, KY\n*125th Special Tactics Sq, Portland, OR\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{USAF Air Force Special Operations Command}}\n{{Air Force Weather nav}}\n{{Air force infantry}}\n\n[[Category:Air force special forces units]]\n[[Category:Special operations units of the United States Air Force|Special Operations Weather]]\n[[Category:United States Air Force Special Operations Command]]\n[[Category:United States Air Force specialisms]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More footnotes|date=October 2018}}\n{{Original research|date=October 2018}}\n}}\n{{short description|US Air Force career specialty}}\n\n{{Use American English|date=May 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n| unit_name = U.S. Air Force Special Reconnaissance\n| image = USAF Special Reconnaissance Flash.png\n| caption = Special Reconnaissance flash\n| nickname = SR\n| motto = \n| colors = {{legend2|#7D7875|Pewter Grey|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n| colors_label = Color of Beret\n| march = \n| ceremonial_chief = \n| type = [[Special Operations Force]]\n| branch = {{dodseal|Air Force}} [[United States Air Force]]\n| dates = Yes\n| country = {{flag|United States of America}}\n| allegiance = \n| command_structure = [[File:United States Special Operations Command Insignia.svg|20px]] [[United States Special Operations Command]]<br />[[File:Shield of the United States Air Force Special Operations Command.svg|24px]] [[Air Force Special Operations Command]]\n| size = \n| specialization = [[Special Reconnaissance]]\n| response = \n| current_commander = \n| garrison = \n| battles = \n| notable_commanders = \n| anniversaries = \n| identification_symbol = [[File:USAF Special Operations Weather Beret.jpg|200px|center]]\n| identification_symbol_label = Pewter grey beret with former SOWT [[United States military beret flash|beret flash]]\n}}\n[[File:Sowt.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Fort Bragg, North Carolina|Ft.

Like other special operations units, SR units may also carry out direct action (DA) and unconventional warfare (UW), including guerrilla operations. As SOWT they were tactical observer/forecasters with ground combat capabilities and fell under the Air Force Special Tactics within the [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] (AFSOC). The mission of a Special Operations Weather Team Specialist was to deploy by the most feasible means available into combat and non-permissive environments to collect and interpret [[Meteorology|meteorological]] data and provide air and ground forces commanders with timely, accurate [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]]. They collect data, assist mission planning, generate accurate and mission-tailored target and route forecasts in support of global special operations, conduct special weather [[reconnaissance]] and train foreign national forces.

However, the changes in the pipeline will include adding reconnaissance-specific training, military free-fall and combat diver course.\n\nSOWT\u2019s new role as special reconnaissance, or SR, will shift from a specialized weather analysis focus to one of multi-domain reconnaissance and surveillance, AFSOC officials said.<ref>https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2019/05/13/spec-ops-weathermen-get-name-change-new-mission-to-better-better-fight-great-powers/</ref>}}\n\n==History==\nDuring [[World War II]], Army Air Forces combat weathermen supported the American effort against the Japanese in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India theater]] of operations. They also participated in the European theater at [[Normandy Beach]], France; and in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Yugoslavia]].\n\nHowever most of the special operations weather lineage, honors, and heraldry origins of WWII are attributed to the 10th Weather Squadron, at New Delhi, India under the 10th Air Force.  The 10th Weather Squadron was constituted 10th Weather on 15 Jun 1942 and activated on 24 Jun 1942 (New Delhi, India).  Inactivated on 3 Jul 1946 the 10th Weather Squadron was subsequently activated on 1 June 1948, inactivated on 20 May 1952, activated on 16 Jun 1966, organized on 8 Jul 1966, inactivated on 30 Sep 1975, designated 10th Combat Weather Squadron and activated on 1 Apr 1996, and finally inactivated 7 May 2014.  The inactivation of the 10th Combat Weather Squadron resulted in special operations weathermen from the unit being integrated into 720th STG.\n\nThe various regional conflicts escalating in Southeast Asia during the years 1961 through 1975 were causal for reactivating the 10th Weather Squadron on 8 July 1966 at [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]] in Thailand, to conduct combat weather operations in Southeast Asia. The 10th subsequently relocated to Long Binh AI, RVN, 3 Aug 1967 and then to Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, 18 February 1974 before being inactivated 30 June 1972. The squadron trained indigenous weather personnel and set up the clandestine weather observation networks throughout Southeast Asia. The 10th Weather Squadron played an important part in the raid on the Son Tay POW camp (a.k.a. [[Operation Ivory Coast]]) of 1970. The weather forecasting for this mission primarily relied upon images obtained from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites, data obtained by weather aircraft reconnaissance sorties, and extensive climatic analysis data.  Weather forecaster Major Keith R. Grimes who as Lt Col became the commander of the 10th during the period from 7 July 1974 to 15 Jul 1975 was weather advisor to the Joint Task Force Commander planning Operation Ivory Coast. It is Major Grimes' extensive work with climatological data and forecasts prepared by Air Weather Service personnel credited by Air Weather Service historians as setting raid's general date.\n\nPreviously during 1963 and 1964 then Captain Keith R. Grimes organized the first ad-hoc Air Weather Service Unconventional Warfare Detachment at Hurlburt Field, FL, during 1963 and 1964.  These few in member numbers special warfare weathermen began deploying to Laos with primary mission training friendly forces to take and report weather observation.  It was this small in numbers group of weathermen who worked clandestinely in Laos, under dangerous conditions and on a nearly uninterrupted basis, to establish and maintain a weather observing and reporting net essential to combat air operations. Posing as civilians with varying cover stories and carrying only a civilian identification card functioned not only as weathermen and advisors, but as forward air controllers, intelligence gatherers, and fighters. By 1972 the Air Weather Service had twenty-seven jump qualified combat weather team weathermen. Most were assigned in support of the XVIII Airborne Corps, or the 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions, but others were assigned with the 7th Weather Squadron in Germany and eight were assigned with the 5th Weather Wing's Detachment 75 at Eglin AFB's Hurlburt Field in support of Air Force and Army Special Forces. From 1972 to about 1985 parachutist qualified combat weather teams and special operations weather teams were considered nonessential.  The prevailing senior leadership attitude during this period was expressed by a question AWS chief of staff, Colonel Edwin E. Carmell hypothetically asked in December 1972 of \"If you look at it objectively, what kinds of weather [data] do you get out of those guys?\" in referring to Detachment 75.  \"I think the answer is pretty clear,\" he continued: \"they aren't needed.\"\n\nThe decisive origins of Special Operations Weather becoming a unique separate career weather Air Force Specialty Code having a specialty description is the 1 October 1996 reactivation of the 10th Air Weather Squadron as the 10th Combat Weather Squadron (10th CWS) and assigned to the 720th Special Tactics Group (720th STG) of the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).

They gathered, assessed, and interpreted weather and environmental intelligence from forward deployed locations, working primarily with Air Force and [[Army Special Operations Forces]]. SOWTs could also have been attached to [[United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command|Marine MARSOC]] and [[Navy SEAL]] teams, to collect weather, ocean, river, snow and terrain intelligence, assist mission planning, generate accurate mission-tailored target and route forecasts in support of global special operations and train joint force members and coalition partners to take and communicate limited weather observations.  They operated on 2-3 man Environmental Reconnaissance Teams (ERT).  ERT's which were attached to 8-9 man Special Tactics Teams (STT) alongside Combat Control (CCT) and Pararescue (PJ) personnel.  Together they provide SOCOM a unique capability to establish and control austere airfields in permissive and non-permissive environments.   Additionally, Special Operations Weathermen conducted special reconnaissance, fly small unmanned aerial systems (SUAS),  collected upper air data, organized, established and maintained weather data reporting networks, determined host nation meteorological capabilities and trained foreign national forces.\n\nThe mission of their successor, Special Reconnaissance, other than multi-domain reconnaissance and surveillance  is not yet publicly available.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of United States Air Force special tactics squadrons]]\n* [[United States Special Operations Forces]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n'''Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC)'''\n\n*21 STS, Pope Army Airfield, Fort Bragg, NC\n*22 STS, McChord Field, WA\n*23 STS, Hurlburt Field, FL\n*24 STS Pope Army Airfield, Fort Bragg, NC\n*321 STS, RAF Mildenhall, UK\n*320 STS, Kadena AB, Japan\n\n'''Air National Guard (ANG)'''\n\n*123d Special Tactics Sq, Louisville, KY\n*125th Special Tactics Sq, Portland, OR\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{USAF Air Force Special Operations Command}}\n{{Air Force Weather nav}}\n{{Air force infantry}}\n\n[[Category:Air force special forces units]]\n[[Category:Special operations units of the United States Air Force|Special Operations Weather]]\n[[Category:United States Air Force Special Operations Command]]\n[[Category:United States Air Force specialisms]]\n", "name_user": "PBSR\\QCRSDBSR0199", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Special_Reconnaissance"}
