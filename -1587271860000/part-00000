It is operated by Yayasan Harapan Kita, a foundation established by [[Siti Hartinah]], the first lady during most of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] and wife of [[Suharto]], and still run by Suharto's descendants since his death. It has an area of about {{convert|250|acre|ha|order=flip}}. The park is a synopsis of [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesian culture]], with virtually all aspects of daily life in Indonesia's 26 (in 1975) [[Provinces of Indonesia|provinces]] encapsulated in separate pavilions with the collections of ''[[rumah adat]]'' as the example of [[Indonesian architecture|Indonesian vernacular architecture]], [[National costume of Indonesia|clothing]], [[Dance in Indonesia|dances]] and [[Traditions of Indonesia|traditions]] are all depicted impeccably.

It came about at a convention on 8 Cendana Street at March 13, 1970. Through this recreational site, she hoped to cultivate national pride in more Indonesian people.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/> A project called \"Indonesian Miniature Project\" was started by Harapan Kita Foundation in 1972. The concept of this culture-based recreational area was inspired by Indonesia's unparalleled natural riches and local folk diversity.\n\n==Characteristics==\nTMII was originally located on a public area of 145 ha, as farms and fields. Later, the team was able to convert these fields into a suitable location for the construction. The [[topography]] of TMII is rather hilly, consistent with what the builders required. The team claimed the advantage of utilizing this uneven terrain was the ability to create interesting and diverse landscapes and enclosures, as well as reflecting the various characteristics of the Indonesian environment.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/>\n\n==Parts of TMII==\n[[File:Taman Mini Indonesia Indah Map en.svg|center|900px]]\n\n===Venues of Indonesian Provinces===\n[[File:Jaipongan Langit Biru 03.jpg|thumb|The [[Jaipongan]] dance performance in West Java pavilion in TMII.]]\n[[File:Indonesia in miniature, Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.jpg|thumb|The miniature of [[Indonesian Archipelago]] in the center lake viewed from the cable car.]]\n[[File:TMII West Sumatra.jpg|thumb|[[West Sumatra]] pavilion in TMII.]]\n\nSince each Indonesian province maintains its own unique and distinct cultures, shelters, attire and dialects, TMII built a model of each of the houses from Indonesian provinces. TMII attempted not only to reconstruct the homes of the various provinces, but also to create a realistic model of the environment and shelters of the various people of Indonesia.<ref name='TMIIanj'>[http://www.tamanmini.com/anjungan/ Anjungan]</ref> The venues, which are situated around the main lake in a similar fashion to the different islands of the [[Indonesian archipelago]], are thematically divided into six areas in respect to the main islands of Indonesia; [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Kalimantan]] ([[Borneo]]), [[Sulawesi]], the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]]. Each pavilions featured in typical [[vernacular]] [[Indonesian architecture]] of each provinces. Examples of Indonesian traditional vernacular houses are: [[Joglo]] and Omah Kudus [[Javanese people|Javanese]] houses of [[Central Java]] and [[Yogyakarta]] pavilion; [[Minangkabau people|Minang]] [[Rumah Gadang]] of [[West Sumatra]] pavilion; [[Malay houses]] of [[Jambi]] and [[Riau]] provinces; [[Toraja]]n [[Tongkonan]] and Bugis house of [[South Sulawesi]] pavilion; and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] house compound with intricately carved [[candi bentar]] split gate and [[Paduraksa|kori agung]] gate.\n\nIt also displays various traditional costumes, wedding costumes, dance costumes, also ethnography artifacts such as weapons and daily tools, models of traditional architecture are in display to describes the way of life of its people. Each provinces pavilions also equipped with small stage, amphitheatre or auditorium for traditional dance performances, traditional music performances or traditional ceremonies that usually held in Sundays. Some of these pavilions also equipped with cafeterias featuring traditional [[Indonesian cuisine]]s and also souvenir shops offering various handicrafts, T-shirts and souvenirs.\n\nSince 1975 until the 2000s, the original design of TMII consist of a model of the houses from the 27 provinces of Indonesia, including [[East Timor]]. But after the secession of East Timor from Indonesia in 2002, the East Timor pavilion changed its status to become the Museum of East Timor. Also since Indonesia now consist of [[Provinces of Indonesia|33 provinces]], currently the new province pavilions of [[Bangka Belitung]], [[Banten]], [[West Sulawesi]], [[North Maluku]], [[Gorontalo (province)|Gorontalo]], [[Riau Islands]], and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] is being built in northeast part of the park.\n\nAfter the recognition of [[Indonesian Chinese]] [[Chinese culture|culture]] as the integral part of Indonesian culture in 2000, the new [[Indonesian Chinese]] pavilion and a [[Confucian temple]] was built within the park.\n\n===Religious Buildings===\nThe religious buildings of several official faiths is meant to showcase the inter-faiths tolerance and religious harmony of Indonesia.

It has an area of about {{convert|250|acre|ha|order=flip}}.

It came about at a convention on 8 Cendana Street at March 13, 1970. Through this recreational site, she hoped to cultivate national pride in more Indonesian people.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/> A project called \"Indonesian Miniature Project\" was started by Harapan Kita Foundation in 1972. The concept of this culture-based recreational area was inspired by Indonesia's unparalleled natural riches and local folk diversity.\n\n==Characteristics==\nTMII was originally located on a public area of 145 ha, as farms and fields. Later, the team was able to convert these fields into a suitable location for the construction. The [[topography]] of TMII is rather hilly, consistent with what the builders required. The team claimed the advantage of utilizing this uneven terrain was the ability to create interesting and diverse landscapes and enclosures, as well as reflecting the various characteristics of the Indonesian environment.<ref name=\"TMIIweb\"/>\n\n==Parts of TMII==\n[[File:Taman Mini Indonesia Indah Map en.svg|center|900px]]\n\n===Venues of Indonesian Provinces===\n[[File:Jaipongan Langit Biru 03.jpg|thumb|The [[Jaipongan]] dance performance in West Java pavilion in TMII.]]\n[[File:Indonesia in miniature, Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.jpg|thumb|The miniature of [[Indonesian Archipelago]] in the center lake viewed from the cable car.]]\n[[File:TMII West Sumatra.jpg|thumb|[[West Sumatra]] pavilion in TMII.]]\n\nSince each Indonesian province maintains its own unique and distinct cultures, shelters, attire and dialects, TMII built a model of each of the houses from Indonesian provinces.

Each pavilions featured in typical [[vernacular]] [[Indonesian architecture]] of each provinces. Examples of Indonesian traditional vernacular houses are: [[Joglo]] and Omah Kudus [[Javanese people|Javanese]] houses of [[Central Java]] and [[Yogyakarta]] pavilion; [[Minangkabau people|Minang]] [[Rumah Gadang]] of [[West Sumatra]] pavilion; [[Malay houses]] of [[Jambi]] and [[Riau]] provinces; [[Toraja]]n [[Tongkonan]] and Bugis house of [[South Sulawesi]] pavilion; and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] house compound with intricately carved [[candi bentar]] split gate and [[Paduraksa|kori agung]] gate.\n\nIt also displays various traditional costumes, wedding costumes, dance costumes, also ethnography artifacts such as weapons and daily tools, models of traditional architecture are in display to describes the way of life of its people. Each provinces pavilions also equipped with small stage, amphitheatre or auditorium for traditional dance performances, traditional music performances or traditional ceremonies that usually held in Sundays. Some of these pavilions also equipped with cafeterias featuring traditional [[Indonesian cuisine]]s and also souvenir shops offering various handicrafts, T-shirts and souvenirs.\n\nSince 1975 until the 2000s, the original design of TMII consist of a model of the houses from the 27 provinces of Indonesia, including [[East Timor]].
