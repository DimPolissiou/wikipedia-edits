Two joint secretaries were appointed, [[Madhu Limaye]] from India and [[Hla Aung]] from Burma. The Burmese Kyaw Nyein was selected as the Treasurer of ASC, a difficult task considering the underfunding of the Rangoon office.

The meeting adopted resolutions on topics 'On Peace Settlements' (supporting the admission of the [[People's Republic of China]] into the [[United Nations]], calling for elections to a constituent assembly under international supervision in [[Indochina]], calling for reunification of [[Korea]] under an international authority acceptable to both sides), '[[Kuomintang|K.M.T.]] troops in Burma' (calling for their removal from Burma) and 'Greetings to West Asian Socialists' (condemning repression against socialists in Syria). The meeting expressed its hope in continued cordial relations with the Socialist International and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. These two organisations had observers present at the meeting, [[Morgan Phillips]] from the SI and [[Dobrivoje Vidi\u0107]] from the Yugoslav party.<ref name=\"rose238\"/><ref name=\"rose240\"/><ref>''Socialist Asia''. 1 September 1953, Vol. II, No. 5. pp. 10\u201311</ref><ref>''[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2003/08/12/stories/2003081200730900.htm dated August 12, 1953: Asian Socialists Meet in India]'', ''[[The Hindu]]'', August 12, 2003</ref>\n\nThe Hyderabad meeting decided to set an 'Anti-Colonial Bureau'. The Anti-Colonial Bureau would be led by a Co-ordination Committee, which would be appointed by the ASC chairman. An office would be set up, served by one of the ASC Joint Secretaries and another Joint Secretary selected by the Co-ordinating Committee. Some suggestions for future tasks for the Anti-Colonial Bureau raised in Hyderabad included encouraging the holding of an all-African congress, calling for Asian and African governments to strengthen their work in the UN, calling of Asian newspapers to give more coverage and support to anti-colonial movements, sending a representative to the UN to help anti-colonial movements, that the Anti-Colonial Bureau should apply to become a consultative organisation in the UN, organising a fact-finding mission to colonial possessions in Asia, collect funds for the defence of victims of colonial repression in Africa an elsewhere and calling on Asian parties to arrange internships for African representatives.<ref name=\"rose240\"/>\n\nMoreover, the Hyderabad meeting called for the creation of a joint construction brigade of the ASC. The Israeli and Burmese parties were put in charge of elaborating a proposal for such a brigade.<ref name=\"rose240\">Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. pp. 240\u2013241</ref>\n\nLimaye did not return to the Secretariat after the Hyderabad meeting. He was replaced by another Indian socialist, Madhav Gokhale. The Rangoon Secretariat was joined by one of the secretaries of the Anti-Colonial Bureau, Jim Markham of the [[Convention People's Party]] of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]. In December 1953 Roo Watanbe, a Japanese Joint Secretary, arrived in Rangoon. The two Japanese parties had debated for a long time before being able to agree on a common candidate for ASC Joint Secretary.<ref name=\"rose240\"/>\n\n===Kalaw Bureau meeting===\nThe third meeting of the ASC Bureau was supposed to have been held in Indonesia in April 1954. However, the Indonesian government refused to allow the entry of the Israeli delegation, and the meeting was postponed and its venue shifted to Burma. The Bureau met in [[Kalaw]] May 25\u201328, 1954.<ref name=\"rose242\"/> The Kalaw meeting adopted three resolutions, on Indochina, Korea and disarmament. At the meeting the Indian party had proposed a resolution condemning the formation of [[SEATO]] and calling for the formation of an Asian security alliance independent from the two superpowers, but this proposal was referred to the ASC parties rather than being adopted by the Bureau. A delegation of the [[Vietnam Socialist Party]] assisted the meeting. The delegation was led by Dr. Pham Van Ngoi. The Vietnam Socialist Party applied for ASC membership at the meeting, but the Bureau decided to wait with taking a decision on the application until a factfinding mission had been sent to Indochina and Malaya.<ref>Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. p. 243</ref> The Kalaw meeting also decided to send a factfinding mission to [[Ceylon]].<ref name=\"rose244\">Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. p. 244</ref>\n\nThe factfinding mission to Malaya and [[South Vietnam]] was carried out July\u2013August 1954. The delegation consisted of Wijono, Watanbe and Markham. Their report gave a favourable view on the Vietnam Socialist Party, whilst expressing sharp criticisms against the Labour Party of Malaya. Gokhale went on a one-man factfinding mission to Ceylon. His report suggested that ASC membership be given to the [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]].<ref name=\"rose245\">Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. p. 245</ref>\n\n===Tokyo Bureau meeting===\nThe fourth ASC Bureau meeting was held in [[Tokyo]] November 19\u201321, 1954. The meeting was preceded by the first meeting of the ASC Economic Experts' Committee. Regarding the reports of the factfinding missions, the Bureau meeting decided to suggest the next Conference to approve membership for the Vietnam Socialist Party. Regarding the Ceylonese LSSP, the meeting suggested that LSSP be give a special invitee status provided that the LSSP break its relations to the [[Trotskyist]] [[Fourth International]]. At the Tokyo meeting the LSSP leader [[Colvin R. de Silva]] participated. The LSSP could not accept the condition to break its affiliation to the Fourth International, and thus declined the proposal from ASC. After this break, the ASC began considering links with the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] instead.<ref name=\"rose245\"/>\n\n==Anti-Colonial Bureau==\nThe Hyderabad Bureau meeting had given the ASC Chairman the task of appointing the Co-ordination Committee of the Anti-Colonial Bureau. Ba Swe proposed the formation of a Committee with five representatives from the ASC parties and four representatives from African freedom movements. But problems in finding an adequate composition arose immediately, as the Moroccan appointee refused to sit in the same committee as a representative of the Israeli party.<ref name=\"rose242\">Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. p. 242</ref>\n\nThe Co-ordination Committee of the Anti-Colonial Bureau met for the first time in connection with the Kalaw ASC Bureau meeting in May 1954. Kyaw Nyein was elected Chairman of the Anti-Colonial Bureau.<ref name=\"rose244\"/>\n\n==Bombay conference==\nThe second, and last, Asian Socialist Conference was held at [[Kishinchand Chelaram College|K.C. College]], [[Bombay]], [[India]], in November 1956.<ref name=\"soc\"/><ref>Chaurasia, Radhey Shyam. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nB14ML5a6fIC History of Political Thought]''. New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers, 2003. p. 20</ref> The Asian delegations at the Bombay conference were more or less the same as the 1953 Rangoon conference, but three new parties joined the ASC as members. They were the [[Socialist Party of Vietnam|Vietnam Socialist Party]], the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] and the Nepali Congress. Non-Asian guests taking part in the conference came from the [[Italian Socialist Party]], the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]], the [[Popular Socialist Party (Chile)|Popular Socialist Party]] of [[Chile]], a [[Greece|Greek]] socialist party, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, [[Movement for the Liberation of Colonies]], [[African Freedom Committee]] and representatives from Algeria, Kenya and [[Tanganyika]].<ref name=\"soc\"/><ref name=\"sito\">Sitorus. ''Asian Socialist Today'', in ''May Day 1957'', jointly published by the Socialist International and the Asian Socialist Conference. p. 7</ref>\n\nThe debates at the Bombay conference was dominated by the [[Suez Crisis]]. The conference condemned the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt. Another resolutions called for Soviet withdrawal from [[Hungary]], recognition of the [[People's Republic of China]] in the [[United Nations]] and reunifications in [[Vietnam]] and [[Korea]].<ref name=\"soc\"/>\n\n==Israeli participation==\nIn the case of Israel, Mapai was invited to the 1953 Rangoon conference rather than the more leftist [[Mapam]]. At the time, Mapam was considered as to close to the communists.<ref name=\"rose4\"/> The Israeli presence at the Rangoon conference provoked confrontations with Arab delegates. In the beginning of the conference the Egyptian delegate refused to sit at the same table as the Israeli delegation, and left the conference in protest. The Lebanese delegation also left the conference in protest of the Israeli participation. Notably, whilst not joining the Egyptian and Lebanese walk-out, the Pakistani party retained reservations about the role of the Israeli delegation.<ref name=\"rose3\">Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. pp. 8\u20139</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the ASC provided a space for Mapai (which was the governing party in Israel) to foster relations with Asian socialists, contacts that were later to be translated into strengthening of bilateral diplomatic links with states like Burma and Nepal. The Rangoon conference was probably the first time that Nepali Congress leaders met with Israelis. The fact that Nepalese and Burmese socialists could identify with the socialist profile of Mapai contributed to the shaping of close linkages. In the case of Nepal, these links were maintained even after the Nepali Congress had been dislodged by the royal coup in 1960.<ref>Kozicki, Richard J.. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2642460 Nepal and Israel: Uniqueness in Asian Relations]'', in ''Asian Survey'', Vol. 9, No. 5 (May 1969), pp. 331\u2013342</ref> In the case of Burma, the meetings at the Rangoon conference led to the opening of diplomatic links and, soon afterwards, the first appointment of an Israeli ambassador ([[David Hacohen]]) to an Asian country.<ref>Laufer, Leopold.

The [[Japanese Socialist Party]] socialists saw the Israeli attack and the occupation of Egyptian territory and Gaza as foreign domination, intended to safe-guard colonial control over Egypt. In January 1957 the JSP adopted the 'Fukuoka Resolution', which called for the expulsion of Mapai from the Asian Socialist Conference and the Socialist International. In the end, Israeli diplomats were able to persuade the JSP not to present the Fukuoka Resolution to the ASC and SI.<ref>de Boer, John.

The Bureau, a committee of the Socialist International, had a different regional focus than the ASC, though.

During the conference, Asian delegates criticised the stance of SI towards anti-colonial liberation movements.<ref name=\"rose3\"/>\n\nThree delegations (Israelis, Malayans and Japanese Rightists) supported the proposal to merge ASC into the SI fold.

The Rangoon Bureau meeting appointed a Secretariat, which was to run the day-to-day affairs of the ASC at its Rangoon office. The post of General Secretary was earmarked for the Indonesian party, which was to name their appointee at a later stage. Two joint secretaries were appointed, [[Madhu Limaye]] from India and [[Hla Aung]] from Burma. The Burmese Kyaw Nyein was selected as the Treasurer of ASC, a difficult task considering the underfunding of the Rangoon office.

The meeting held in the [[Hill Fort Palace]] and was chaired by Ba Swe. This was the first Bureau meeting which Wijono took part in. Another notable participant was the Lebanese PSP leader [[Kamal Jumblatt]]. The meeting adopted resolutions on topics 'On Peace Settlements' (supporting the admission of the [[People's Republic of China]] into the [[United Nations]], calling for elections to a constituent assembly under international supervision in [[Indochina]], calling for reunification of [[Korea]] under an international authority acceptable to both sides), '[[Kuomintang|K.M.T.]] troops in Burma' (calling for their removal from Burma) and 'Greetings to West Asian Socialists' (condemning repression against socialists in Syria). The meeting expressed its hope in continued cordial relations with the Socialist International and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The Anti-Colonial Bureau would be led by a Co-ordination Committee, which would be appointed by the ASC chairman. An office would be set up, served by one of the ASC Joint Secretaries and another Joint Secretary selected by the Co-ordinating Committee. Some suggestions for future tasks for the Anti-Colonial Bureau raised in Hyderabad included encouraging the holding of an all-African congress, calling for Asian and African governments to strengthen their work in the UN, calling of Asian newspapers to give more coverage and support to anti-colonial movements, sending a representative to the UN to help anti-colonial movements, that the Anti-Colonial Bureau should apply to become a consultative organisation in the UN, organising a fact-finding mission to colonial possessions in Asia, collect funds for the defence of victims of colonial repression in Africa an elsewhere and calling on Asian parties to arrange internships for African representatives.<ref name=\"rose240\"/>\n\nMoreover, the Hyderabad meeting called for the creation of a joint construction brigade of the ASC.

However, the Indonesian government refused to allow the entry of the Israeli delegation, and the meeting was postponed and its venue shifted to Burma. The Bureau met in [[Kalaw]] May 25\u201328, 1954.<ref name=\"rose242\"/> The Kalaw meeting adopted three resolutions, on Indochina, Korea and disarmament. At the meeting the Indian party had proposed a resolution condemning the formation of [[SEATO]] and calling for the formation of an Asian security alliance independent from the two superpowers, but this proposal was referred to the ASC parties rather than being adopted by the Bureau. A delegation of the [[Vietnam Socialist Party]] assisted the meeting. The delegation was led by Dr. Pham Van Ngoi. The Vietnam Socialist Party applied for ASC membership at the meeting, but the Bureau decided to wait with taking a decision on the application until a factfinding mission had been sent to Indochina and Malaya.<ref>Rose, Saul.

The delegation consisted of Wijono, Watanbe and Markham. Their report gave a favourable view on the Vietnam Socialist Party, whilst expressing sharp criticisms against the Labour Party of Malaya. Gokhale went on a one-man factfinding mission to Ceylon. His report suggested that ASC membership be given to the [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]].<ref name=\"rose245\">Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. p. 245</ref>\n\n===Tokyo Bureau meeting===\nThe fourth ASC Bureau meeting was held in [[Tokyo]] November 19\u201321, 1954. The meeting was preceded by the first meeting of the ASC Economic Experts' Committee. Regarding the reports of the factfinding missions, the Bureau meeting decided to suggest the next Conference to approve membership for the Vietnam Socialist Party. Regarding the Ceylonese LSSP, the meeting suggested that LSSP be give a special invitee status provided that the LSSP break its relations to the [[Trotskyist]] [[Fourth International]]. At the Tokyo meeting the LSSP leader [[Colvin R. de Silva]] participated. The LSSP could not accept the condition to break its affiliation to the Fourth International, and thus declined the proposal from ASC. After this break, the ASC began considering links with the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] instead.<ref name=\"rose245\"/>\n\n==Anti-Colonial Bureau==\nThe Hyderabad Bureau meeting had given the ASC Chairman the task of appointing the Co-ordination Committee of the Anti-Colonial Bureau. Ba Swe proposed the formation of a Committee with five representatives from the ASC parties and four representatives from African freedom movements. But problems in finding an adequate composition arose immediately, as the Moroccan appointee refused to sit in the same committee as a representative of the Israeli party.<ref name=\"rose242\">Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. p. 242</ref>\n\nThe Co-ordination Committee of the Anti-Colonial Bureau met for the first time in connection with the Kalaw ASC Bureau meeting in May 1954. Kyaw Nyein was elected Chairman of the Anti-Colonial Bureau.<ref name=\"rose244\"/>\n\n==Bombay conference==\nThe second, and last, Asian Socialist Conference was held at [[Kishinchand Chelaram College|K.C. College]], [[Bombay]], [[India]], in November 1956.<ref name=\"soc\"/><ref>Chaurasia, Radhey Shyam. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nB14ML5a6fIC History of Political Thought]''. New Delhi: Atlantic Publishers, 2003. p. 20</ref> The Asian delegations at the Bombay conference were more or less the same as the 1953 Rangoon conference, but three new parties joined the ASC as members. They were the [[Socialist Party of Vietnam|Vietnam Socialist Party]], the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] and the Nepali Congress. Non-Asian guests taking part in the conference came from the [[Italian Socialist Party]], the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]], the [[Popular Socialist Party (Chile)|Popular Socialist Party]] of [[Chile]], a [[Greece|Greek]] socialist party, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, [[Movement for the Liberation of Colonies]], [[African Freedom Committee]] and representatives from Algeria, Kenya and [[Tanganyika]].<ref name=\"soc\"/><ref name=\"sito\">Sitorus. ''Asian Socialist Today'', in ''May Day 1957'', jointly published by the Socialist International and the Asian Socialist Conference. p. 7</ref>\n\nThe debates at the Bombay conference was dominated by the [[Suez Crisis]]. The conference condemned the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt. Another resolutions called for Soviet withdrawal from [[Hungary]], recognition of the [[People's Republic of China]] in the [[United Nations]] and reunifications in [[Vietnam]] and [[Korea]].<ref name=\"soc\"/>\n\n==Israeli participation==\nIn the case of Israel, Mapai was invited to the 1953 Rangoon conference rather than the more leftist [[Mapam]]. At the time, Mapam was considered as to close to the communists.<ref name=\"rose4\"/> The Israeli presence at the Rangoon conference provoked confrontations with Arab delegates. In the beginning of the conference the Egyptian delegate refused to sit at the same table as the Israeli delegation, and left the conference in protest. The Lebanese delegation also left the conference in protest of the Israeli participation. Notably, whilst not joining the Egyptian and Lebanese walk-out, the Pakistani party retained reservations about the role of the Israeli delegation.<ref name=\"rose3\">Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''. London: Oxford University Press, 1959. pp. 8\u20139</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the ASC provided a space for Mapai (which was the governing party in Israel) to foster relations with Asian socialists, contacts that were later to be translated into strengthening of bilateral diplomatic links with states like Burma and Nepal. The Rangoon conference was probably the first time that Nepali Congress leaders met with Israelis. The fact that Nepalese and Burmese socialists could identify with the socialist profile of Mapai contributed to the shaping of close linkages. In the case of Nepal, these links were maintained even after the Nepali Congress had been dislodged by the royal coup in 1960.<ref>Kozicki, Richard J.. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2642460 Nepal and Israel: Uniqueness in Asian Relations]'', in ''Asian Survey'', Vol. 9, No. 5 (May 1969), pp. 331\u2013342</ref> In the case of Burma, the meetings at the Rangoon conference led to the opening of diplomatic links and, soon afterwards, the first appointment of an Israeli ambassador ([[David Hacohen]]) to an Asian country.<ref>Laufer, Leopold. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2148199 Israel and the Third World]'' in ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 87, No. 4 (Dec., 1972), pp. 615\u2013630</ref>\n\nWith [[Israel]]'s role in the [[Suez Crisis|Tripartite attack on Egypt]] in 1956, relations between Mapai and socialist parties in Asia deteriorated. The [[Japanese Socialist Party]] socialists saw the Israeli attack and the occupation of Egyptian territory and Gaza as foreign domination, intended to safe-guard colonial control over Egypt. In January 1957 the JSP adopted the 'Fukuoka Resolution', which called for the expulsion of Mapai from the Asian Socialist Conference and the Socialist International. In the end, Israeli diplomats were able to persuade the JSP not to present the Fukuoka Resolution to the ASC and SI.<ref>de Boer, John. ''[http://www.japanfocus.org/-John_de-Boer/2159 Before Oil: Japan and the Question of Israel/Palestine, 1917\u20131956]''</ref>\n\n==Dissolution==\nAs of 1961, the ASC was no longer functioning.<ref name=\"soc\"/> Factors contributing to the non-continuation of the ASC experience were the suppressions of socialist parties in Burma, Indonesia and Nepal, as well as the fractional disputes which weakened the socialist movement in India.<ref name=\"mohan\"/>\n\nIn 1970 the [[Asia-Pacfic Socialist Organization|Asia-Pacific Socialist Bureau]] was formed as a successor organisation of the ASC. The Bureau, a committee of the Socialist International, had a different regional focus than the ASC, though. The Asia-Pacific Socialist Bureau was based in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], and included the [[Australian]] and New Zealand Labour parties.<ref name=\"soc\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Politics of Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:1953 establishments in Burma]]\n[[Category:Socialism in Asia]]\n[[Category:Left-wing internationals]]\n", "name_user": "Monsoonspn", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Socialist_Conference"}

It launched on September 28, 2009 as a spin-off of Nickelodeon's long-running preschool [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|programming block of the same name]], which had aired since 1988. The channel, which is aimed at [[children]] under 6, features a mix of originally-produced programming, and series previously and concurrently aired on the [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr. block]] and its previous iterations. Some of Nick Jr.'s programming includes series such as ''[[Corn & Peg]],'' ''[[PAW Patrol]]'', ''[[Bubble Guppies]],'' ''[[Blaze and the Monster Machines]],'' ''[[Shimmer and Shine]]'', and ''[[Dora and Friends: Into the City!]]''. Due to the Nickelodeon block, Nick Jr. is sometimes disclaimed on air as \"the Nick Jr. channel\" to avoid confusion, especially at times of day where both Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. are carrying preschool programming.\n\nThe channel replaced [[Noggin (brand)#TV channel|Noggin]], which was relaunched as a [[streaming service]] in 2015 and acts as a separate sister brand.

The block currently airs weekdays on [[Nickelodeon]] from 8:00&nbsp;a.m. to 2:00&nbsp;p.m. ET/PT. Those hours may vary during the summer months, other school break periods and on major national holidays), having traditional commercial breaks for certain programs. As of January 2016, Nick Jr. is available to approximately 73.0 million pay television households in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590 |title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-history (1988\u20132009)===\n{{Main|Nick Jr. (TV programming block)}}\nSince its inception in 1977, Nickelodeon's channel space had aired preschool-oriented programs, including ''[[Pinwheel (TV series)|Pinwheel]]'', which was their first original series. These were usually played on weekday mornings, when older children were in school and younger children were not. This block ran from 8:00am to 3:00pm. On January 4, 1988, Nickelodeon debuted a name for its preschool block: ''Nick Junior''. Between September 1988 and mid-1989, the name was shortened to ''Nick Jr.'' on-air.<ref name=\"Nick Jr. Premieres\">{{cite web|title=The Rugrats Timeline -- Through 1989 |url=http://www.rugratonline.com/timepr90.htm |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2015-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616133929/http://www.rugratonline.com/timepr90.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt launch, the block mostly showed imported series purchased from other companies. ''[[Eureeka's Castle]]'' was the first original series that Nickelodeon made for the block. Brown Johnson, the former vice president of Nick Jr., stated in a 2000 interview that after ''Eureeka'' ended production, Nick Jr. became \"a neglected daypart\" compared to the main Nickelodeon.<ref name=\"cablevision\">{{cite book|title=Cable Vision|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6IrAQAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Cahners Business Information}}</ref> \"Without investment of energy or money, the block floundered until 1994, when the network poured $30 million into a full-scale relaunch,\" said Johnson.<ref name=\"cablevision\"/>\n\nOn September 5, 1994, the Nick Jr. block began its relaunch and introduced an animated host character called Face.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-03-28.pdf Nick to spend $30 million on kids (page 53)] from Broadcasting & Cable</ref> ''[[Gullah Gullah Island]]'' and ''[[Allegra's Window]]'', the second and third original series made for Nick Jr., premiered. They resulted in 50% rating gains for the block. From then onward, Nickelodeon continued to create its own productions for Nick Jr. and foreign-made imports were phased out. ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' became ratings draws for both the block and Nickelodeon as a whole.\n\nBefore gaining its own spin-off network, the Nick Jr. block extended to several other networks: [[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick Jr. on CBS]] from 2000 to 2006, and [[Noggin (brand)#TV channel|Nick Jr. on Noggin]] from 2003 to 2009. The Nick Jr. on CBS block ended on September 9, 2006, when CBS replaced its Nick Jr. programming with ''[[KOL Secret Slumber Party]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=DIC, KOL to Produce on CBS|url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002725721|periodical=Mediaweek|date=June 21, 2006|access-date=August 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713195740/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002725721|archive-date=July 13, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> Nick Jr. series continued to appear on the Noggin channel until its closure in 2009, when the separate Nick Jr. channel replaced it.\n\n===Launch as a channel (2009\u2013present)===\nOn February 24, 2009, Nickelodeon announced that the Noggin channel would be replaced by a channel named after the Nick Jr. block. The intention was to bring the channel in line with the Nickelodeon brand identity. In July of that year, Nickelodeon unveiled new standardized logos for its five channels, intending to create a unified look that could better be conveyed across the services.<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon unveils new logo|url=https://variety.com/2009/biz/markets-festivals/nickelodeon-unveils-new-logo-1118006659/|publisher=Variety|date=July 29, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn September 28, 2009 at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. ET, the relaunched Nick Jr. channel debuted, accompanied by the new logo (which was designed by [[New York City]]-based creative director/designer Eric Zim). Although the use of an orange \"adult\" and blue \"child\" figure was discontinued in the new [[wordmark]] logo, the tradition of the \"Nick\" text being orange (representing the adult) and the \"Jr.\" text remaining in blue (as the child) was retained.<ref name=\"variety\"/> As is common with newer networks which have taken another former network's channel slot, some subscription providers have confusingly continued to display the channel's logos as either Noggin, The N, or both as that of Nick Jr.'s current logo on [[electronic program guide]]s. The Nick Jr. channel played several of Noggin's programs, most notably the interstitial series ''[[Moose and Zee]]'', until 2012. It also continued not to accept traditional advertising or [[Marginalized closing credits|marginalize]] closing credits for promotion of other shows on the channel.\n\nA [[Spanish language]] block featuring Nick Jr. and Nickelodeon programs debuted on July 12, 2010 on sister channel [[Tr3\u0301s]]. \"Tr3\u0301s Jr.\" aired Spanish dubs of ''Blue's Clues'' and ''[[Wonder Pets!]]''. The block was ended once the final affiliations for Tr3\u0301s broadcast stations requiring [[E/I]] programming expired.\n\nWithout warning the viewers on March 1, 2012, an update of Nick Jr.'s image debuted that was produced by Gretel Inc. The ''Moose and Zee'' interstitials were completely dropped after nine years, removing one of the last vestiges of Noggin; as a result, some of the interstitial learning activities that originally featured Moose's narration (like the ''Puzzle Time'' segments) were recycled and replaced by the voice of a female continuity announcer. Disappointed parents organized a social media effort to bring back the Moose and Zee characters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parents Rip Nick Jr. For 'Firing' Moose and Zee|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/03/07/parents-rip-nick-jr-for-firing-moose-and-zee/|publisher=Chicago CBSlocal}}</ref> The channel changed its slogan from \"It's Like Preschool On TV\" to \"The Smart Place To Play\" (which was also used as the branding for the Nick Jr. block). In addition, ''[[The Upside Down Show]]'', ''[[Oswald (TV series)|Oswald]]'', ''[[Jack's Big Music Show]]'', ''[[Franklin (TV series)|Franklin]]'', ''[[Toot & Puddle (TV series)|Toot & Puddle]]'', and ''[[Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends]]'' were pulled from the network's lineup; the latter five would return later that year.\n\nThe channel's programming at this point began to be hosted by characters from Nick Jr. shows. The channel also began incorporating programming promotions and short features on that date; seven months later, on October 1, 2012, Nick Jr. started airing limited traditional advertising (for companies such as [[ABCmouse.com Early Learning Academy|ABCMouse]], [[Kmart]], and [[Playskool]]) in the form of underwriter sponsorships airing in-between shows, whereas its [[Nickelodeon|parent network]] airs longer traditional advertising.\n\nIn mid-February 2013, a second Pacific Time Zone-based feed for Nick Jr. was launched, both to allow a unified schedule across nearly all time zones and the reaction of parents to NickMom's scheduling a few months before which meant programming for a mature audience aired in the early evening west of the Rockies.\n\n===Second return as a full 24/7 service (2015\u2013present)===\nOn September 9, 2015, the social media channels of [[NickMom]] announced that the four-hour weeknight block on Nick Jr., along with the NickMom website, would end operations by the end of September 2015 due to Viacom's 2015 cutbacks involving acquired programming and also due to NickMom's low ratings<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NickMom/status/641706404731035648|title=Unlike your laundry pile, some things do come to an end. We're sad to say NickMom will be going off air & offline at the end of the month.|work=[[Twitter|Tweet]] from network's Twitter account|publisher=9 September 2015|accessdate=26 September 2015}}</ref> with the time vacated by NickMom returned to traditional Nick Jr. programming. In the early morning of September 28, NickMom ended its 3-year run at 2am ET, with an airing of the film ''[[Guarding Tess]]''. No sign off message was shown; after the film ''Guarding Tess'', it faded straight into an episode of ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]]'' at its end. Since then, some of Nick Jr.'s most popular programming, including repeats of ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', ''[[Team Umizoomi]]'', and ''[[Bubble Guppies]]'' now fill the four hours vacated by NickMom, whose former website address is now used as a [[URL redirection|redirect]] to Nickelodeon's site for parental resources.\n\nFollowing NickMom's closure, Nick Jr. increased the amount of traditional advertising it aired, but also began scheduling programs in an inversion of the \"off-the-clock\" format where the network shortened some of its commercial breaks, allowing the network to air more programming. The \"off-the-clock\" format was previously adopted by various Viacom networks, such as [[TV Land]], [[Nick at Nite]], [[MTV]], [[MTV2]], and [[Paramount Network]] (though in a reversed form, the scheduling format for those channels was designed to ''add'' extra advertising loads).\n\nIn December 2017, Nickelodeon made a deal with [[HiT Entertainment|Mattel Creations]] to move the British show ''[[Thomas & Friends]]'' to Nick Jr. from its longtime U.S. TV home of [[PBS Kids]] starting in 2018.\n\n====Additional Nick Jr. Channel notation====\nOn May 21, 2018, the network refreshed their imaging with new interstitial pieces and updated curriculum notices, and began to promote themselves as the \"Nick Jr. Channel\" audibly and visually to avert confusion with the Nickelodeon block.\n\n==Programming==\n{{main|List of programs broadcast by Nick Jr.}}\n\n==Related services==\n\n===High-definition feed===\n[[File:Nick Jr. HD.png|right|165px]]\nAn HD feed of the channel was launched on August 1, 2013, broadcasting at [[1080i]]60 lines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dbstalk.com/community/index.php?threads/directv-hd-channel-anticipation-official-q3-13-thread.205985/|title=DIRECTV HD Channel Anticipation (Official Q3-13 Thread)|website=DBSTalk Community|language=en-US|access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avsforum.com/forum/34-hdtv-programming/1462894-official-avs-national-hd-channel-lineups-cable-dbs-fiber-iptv-updated-10-2-14-a.html|title=Official AVS National HD Channel Lineups \u2013 Cable/DBS/Fiber/IPTV \u2013 Updated 10/2/14 \u2013 AVS Forum {{!}} Home Theater Discussions And Reviews|website=www.avsforum.com|access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref> As of 2017, most subscription providers along with [[DirecTV]] carry it and downscale it for the standard definition version.\n\n===Nick Jr. on Pluto TV===\nStreaming service [[Pluto TV]], which Viacom acquired in January 2019, added a free version of Nick Jr. on May 1, consisting mainly of older library and archive content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/viacom-newfronts-pluto-tv-channels-originals-slate-1203200042/|title=Viacom Launching 14 Free Channels on Pluto TV, Sets Broad Digital Originals Slate|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2019-04-29|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref>\n\n==International==\nOn May 16, 2011, [[ViacomCBS International Media Networks|MTV Networks]] launched two new channels, [[Nick Jr. (South East Asia)|Nick Jr.]] and [[MTVNHD]], in Asia.

The block currently airs weekdays on [[Nickelodeon]] from 8:00&nbsp;a.m. to 2:00&nbsp;p.m. ET/PT. Those hours may vary during the summer months, other school break periods and on major national holidays), having traditional commercial breaks for certain programs. As of January 2016, Nick Jr. is available to approximately 73.0 million pay television households in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590 |title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-history (1988\u20132009)===\n{{Main|Nick Jr. (TV programming block)}}\nSince its inception in 1977, Nickelodeon's channel space had aired preschool-oriented programs, including ''[[Pinwheel (TV series)|Pinwheel]]'', which was their first original series. These were usually played on weekday mornings, when older children were in school and younger children were not. This block ran from 8:00am to 3:00pm. On January 4, 1988, Nickelodeon debuted a name for its preschool block: ''Nick Junior''. Between September 1988 and mid-1989, the name was shortened to ''Nick Jr.'' on-air.<ref name=\"Nick Jr. Premieres\">{{cite web|title=The Rugrats Timeline -- Through 1989 |url=http://www.rugratonline.com/timepr90.htm |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2015-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616133929/http://www.rugratonline.com/timepr90.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt launch, the block mostly showed imported series purchased from other companies. ''[[Eureeka's Castle]]'' was the first original series that Nickelodeon made for the block. Brown Johnson, the former vice president of Nick Jr., stated in a 2000 interview that after ''Eureeka'' ended production, Nick Jr. became \"a neglected daypart\" compared to the main Nickelodeon.<ref name=\"cablevision\">{{cite book|title=Cable Vision|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6IrAQAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Cahners Business Information}}</ref> \"Without investment of energy or money, the block floundered until 1994, when the network poured $30 million into a full-scale relaunch,\" said Johnson.<ref name=\"cablevision\"/>\n\nOn September 5, 1994, the Nick Jr. block began its relaunch and introduced an animated host character called Face.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-03-28.pdf Nick to spend $30 million on kids (page 53)] from Broadcasting & Cable</ref> ''[[Gullah Gullah Island]]'' and ''[[Allegra's Window]]'', the second and third original series made for Nick Jr., premiered. They resulted in 50% rating gains for the block. From then onward, Nickelodeon continued to create its own productions for Nick Jr. and foreign-made imports were phased out. ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' became ratings draws for both the block and Nickelodeon as a whole.\n\nBefore gaining its own spin-off network, the Nick Jr. block extended to several other networks: [[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick Jr. on CBS]] from 2000 to 2006, and [[Noggin (brand)#TV channel|Nick Jr. on Noggin]] from 2003 to 2009. The Nick Jr. on CBS block ended on September 9, 2006, when CBS replaced its Nick Jr. programming with ''[[KOL Secret Slumber Party]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=DIC, KOL to Produce on CBS|url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002725721|periodical=Mediaweek|date=June 21, 2006|access-date=August 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713195740/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002725721|archive-date=July 13, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> Nick Jr. series continued to appear on the Noggin channel until its closure in 2009, when the separate Nick Jr. channel replaced it.\n\n===Launch as a channel (2009\u2013present)===\nOn February 24, 2009, Nickelodeon announced that the Noggin channel would be replaced by a channel named after the Nick Jr. block. The intention was to bring the channel in line with the Nickelodeon brand identity. In July of that year, Nickelodeon unveiled new standardized logos for its five channels, intending to create a unified look that could better be conveyed across the services.<ref name=\"variety\">{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon unveils new logo|url=https://variety.com/2009/biz/markets-festivals/nickelodeon-unveils-new-logo-1118006659/|publisher=Variety|date=July 29, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn September 28, 2009 at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. ET, the relaunched Nick Jr. channel debuted, accompanied by the new logo (which was designed by [[New York City]]-based creative director/designer Eric Zim). Although the use of an orange \"adult\" and blue \"child\" figure was discontinued in the new [[wordmark]] logo, the tradition of the \"Nick\" text being orange (representing the adult) and the \"Jr.\" text remaining in blue (as the child) was retained.<ref name=\"variety\"/> As is common with newer networks which have taken another former network's channel slot, some subscription providers have confusingly continued to display the channel's logos as either Noggin, The N, or both as that of Nick Jr.'s current logo on [[electronic program guide]]s. The Nick Jr. channel played several of Noggin's programs, most notably the interstitial series ''[[Moose and Zee]]'', until 2012. It also continued not to accept traditional advertising or [[Marginalized closing credits|marginalize]] closing credits for promotion of other shows on the channel.\n\nA [[Spanish language]] block featuring Nick Jr. and Nickelodeon programs debuted on July 12, 2010 on sister channel [[Tr3\u0301s]]. \"Tr3\u0301s Jr.\" aired Spanish dubs of ''Blue's Clues'' and ''[[Wonder Pets!]]''. The block was ended once the final affiliations for Tr3\u0301s broadcast stations requiring [[E/I]] programming expired.\n\nWithout warning the viewers on March 1, 2012, an update of Nick Jr.'s image debuted that was produced by Gretel Inc. The ''Moose and Zee'' interstitials were completely dropped after nine years, removing one of the last vestiges of Noggin; as a result, some of the interstitial learning activities that originally featured Moose's narration (like the ''Puzzle Time'' segments) were recycled and replaced by the voice of a female continuity announcer. Disappointed parents organized a social media effort to bring back the Moose and Zee characters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parents Rip Nick Jr. For 'Firing' Moose and Zee|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/03/07/parents-rip-nick-jr-for-firing-moose-and-zee/|publisher=Chicago CBSlocal}}</ref> The channel changed its slogan from \"It's Like Preschool On TV\" to \"The Smart Place To Play\" (which was also used as the branding for the Nick Jr. block). In addition, ''[[The Upside Down Show]]'', ''[[Oswald (TV series)|Oswald]]'', ''[[Jack's Big Music Show]]'', ''[[Franklin (TV series)|Franklin]]'', ''[[Toot & Puddle (TV series)|Toot & Puddle]]'', and ''[[Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends]]'' were pulled from the network's lineup; the latter five would return later that year.\n\nThe channel's programming at this point began to be hosted by characters from Nick Jr. shows. The channel also began incorporating programming promotions and short features on that date; seven months later, on October 1, 2012, Nick Jr. started airing limited traditional advertising (for companies such as [[ABCmouse.com Early Learning Academy|ABCMouse]], [[Kmart]], and [[Playskool]]) in the form of underwriter sponsorships airing in-between shows, whereas its [[Nickelodeon|parent network]] airs longer traditional advertising.\n\nIn mid-February 2013, a second Pacific Time Zone-based feed for Nick Jr. was launched, both to allow a unified schedule across nearly all time zones and the reaction of parents to NickMom's scheduling a few months before which meant programming for a mature audience aired in the early evening west of the Rockies.\n\n===Second return as a full 24/7 service (2015\u2013present)===\nOn September 9, 2015, the social media channels of [[NickMom]] announced that the four-hour weeknight block on Nick Jr., along with the NickMom website, would end operations by the end of September 2015 due to Viacom's 2015 cutbacks involving acquired programming and also due to NickMom's low ratings<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/NickMom/status/641706404731035648|title=Unlike your laundry pile, some things do come to an end. We're sad to say NickMom will be going off air & offline at the end of the month.|work=[[Twitter|Tweet]] from network's Twitter account|publisher=9 September 2015|accessdate=26 September 2015}}</ref> with the time vacated by NickMom returned to traditional Nick Jr. programming. In the early morning of September 28, NickMom ended its 3-year run at 2am ET, with an airing of the film ''[[Guarding Tess]]''. No sign off message was shown; after the film ''Guarding Tess'', it faded straight into an episode of ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]]'' at its end. Since then, some of Nick Jr.'s most popular programming, including repeats of ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', ''[[Team Umizoomi]]'', and ''[[Bubble Guppies]]'' now fill the four hours vacated by NickMom, whose former website address is now used as a [[URL redirection|redirect]] to Nickelodeon's site for parental resources.\n\nFollowing NickMom's closure, Nick Jr. increased the amount of traditional advertising it aired, but also began scheduling programs in an inversion of the \"off-the-clock\" format where the network shortened some of its commercial breaks, allowing the network to air more programming. The \"off-the-clock\" format was previously adopted by various Viacom networks, such as [[TV Land]], [[Nick at Nite]], [[MTV]], [[MTV2]], and [[Paramount Network]] (though in a reversed form, the scheduling format for those channels was designed to ''add'' extra advertising loads).\n\nIn December 2017, Nickelodeon made a deal with [[HiT Entertainment|Mattel Creations]] to move the British show ''[[Thomas & Friends]]'' to Nick Jr. from its longtime U.S. TV home of [[PBS Kids]] starting in 2018.\n\n====Additional Nick Jr. Channel notation====\nOn May 21, 2018, the network refreshed their imaging with new interstitial pieces and updated curriculum notices, and began to promote themselves as the \"Nick Jr. Channel\" audibly and visually to avert confusion with the Nickelodeon block.\n\n==Programming==\n{{main|List of programs broadcast by Nick Jr.}}\n\n==Related services==\n\n===High-definition feed===\n[[File:Nick Jr. HD.png|right|165px]]\nAn HD feed of the channel was launched on August 1, 2013, broadcasting at [[1080i]]60 lines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dbstalk.com/community/index.php?threads/directv-hd-channel-anticipation-official-q3-13-thread.205985/|title=DIRECTV HD Channel Anticipation (Official Q3-13 Thread)|website=DBSTalk Community|language=en-US|access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avsforum.com/forum/34-hdtv-programming/1462894-official-avs-national-hd-channel-lineups-cable-dbs-fiber-iptv-updated-10-2-14-a.html|title=Official AVS National HD Channel Lineups \u2013 Cable/DBS/Fiber/IPTV \u2013 Updated 10/2/14 \u2013 AVS Forum {{!}} Home Theater Discussions And Reviews|website=www.avsforum.com|access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref> As of 2017, most subscription providers along with [[DirecTV]] carry it and downscale it for the standard definition version.\n\n===Nick Jr. on Pluto TV===\nStreaming service [[Pluto TV]], which Viacom acquired in January 2019, added a free version of Nick Jr. on May 1, consisting mainly of older library and archive content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/viacom-newfronts-pluto-tv-channels-originals-slate-1203200042/|title=Viacom Launching 14 Free Channels on Pluto TV, Sets Broad Digital Originals Slate|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2019-04-29|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref>\n\n==International==\nOn May 16, 2011, [[ViacomCBS International Media Networks|MTV Networks]] launched two new channels, [[Nick Jr. (South East Asia)|Nick Jr.]] and [[MTVNHD]], in Asia.

In that, he was aided by [[Martin Luther]], whose \"Saxon model\" of a Lutheran church was also soon to be implemented beyond Saxony, in other territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Luther turned to the Elector for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome.<ref>Brecht, 2:260\u201363, 67; Mullett, 184\u201386.</ref>\n\nHe took a part in the [[Protestation at Speyer]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Meissen]], he was the fifth of the seven children of [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria, Electress of Saxony|Elisabeth of Bavaria]].\n\nFrom 1486 onward he was the heir presumptive of his childless brother [[Frederick the Wise]]; upon whose death  in 1525, John inherited the title of Elector. As his nickname \"The Steadfast\" indicates, he resolutely continued the policies of his brother toward protecting the progress of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In 1527 the [[Lutheran Church]] was established as the [[state church]] in [[Rulers of Saxony#Electors of Saxony|Ernestine Saxony]], with the Elector as Chief Bishop. John had already been a zealous [[Lutheran]] for some time; he now exercised full authority over the Church, introduced the Lutheran Confession, ordered the deposition of all priests who continued in the Catholic faith, and directed the use of a vernacular liturgy drawn up by Luther. He was a leader of the [[Schmalkaldic League]] of Protestant states formed in 1530 to defend the Reformation.\nAs his nickname betrays, he had the same positive attitude to the Reformation as his older brother. His steadfastness and his courage to maintain his confessional position probably brought him the most fame with his contemporaries. Christian beliefs were the basis of his political decisions, which were regarded as very just{{By whom|date=February 2018}}. In political matters, he was often very hesitant{{according to whom|date=February 2018}}. In his collaboration with [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Philip, Landgrave of Hesse]], with whom he was closely connected by virtue of his common religious beliefs, Philip was the driving force for and outspoken advocate of a more for an aggressive foreign policy while John, on the other hand, was particularly concerned with the question of whether to defend himself as a Protestant against the Emperor.[[File:Klappm\u00fctzentaler 64312.jpg|thumb|220x220px|[[Guldengroschen]] of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], c. 1508-1525.

Luther often expressed a positive opinion about John, especially for his behavior at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, he praised him very much: \"I am sure that the Elector Johann of Saxony had the Holy Spirit. In Augsburg he proved this admirably by his confession. John said, 'Tell my scholars that they are doing what is right, praise and honor God, and take no regard for me or my country.'\" By his insistence on the Protestant profession of faith, he even went so far as to dismiss those Protestant theologians who were too compliant to the Emperor.\n\nIn 1527 the Evangelical-Lutheran Church was founded, whose bishop was the Elector of Saxony. In 1529, John belonged to the princely representatives of the Protestant minority ([[Protestation at Speyer|protestation]]) at the Reichstag in Speyer.\n\nIn the almost 40 years that John governed as a duke over the [[Electorate of Saxony]], he was often overshadowed by the person of his brother [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick]], who, as the eldest of the [[House of Wettin]] and the incumbent [[Prince-Elector|Elector]], decisively determined the policy of Saxony. John is sometimes wrongly portrayed in the history and politics of the Electorate of Saxony as a background figure at the beginning of the Reformation, in contrast to his brother Frederick and his son and successor John Frederick{{By whom|date=February 2018}}.\n\nThe Evangelical Church in Germany honors John's significance during the Reformation, with a memorial day in the Evangelische Namenkalender on 16 August.\n\nHe died in [[Schweinitz]]. After his death he was, like his brother Frederick, buried in the famous [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|Castle Church]] in [[Wittenberg]] with a grave by [[Hans Vischer]]. He was succeeded by his eldest son [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony|Johann Frederick]].\n\n==Marriage and children==\nIn [[Torgau]] on 1 March 1500 Johann married firstly [[Sophie of Mecklenburg (1481\u20131503)|Sophie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], daughter of [[Magnus II, Duke of Mecklenburg]].

W. Harper]], is one of the first novels published by an [[African American|African-American]] woman. While following what has been termed the \"sentimental\" conventions of late nineteenth-century writing about women, it also deals with serious social issues of education for women, [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]], [[miscegenation]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]], [[Reconstruction era (United States)|reconstruction]], [[Temperance movement|temperance]], and social responsibility.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Iola Leroy and family===\n'''Iola Leroy''', the principal character of the novel.\n\n'''Harriet Johnson''', Iola Leroy's grandmother. While a slave of Nancy Johnson, she resists a whipping. As a punishment, she is sold.\n\n'''Robert Johnson'''. He is still a child when separated from his mother Harriet. His enslaver, Nancy Johnson, sees him as a \"pet animal\" (chapter 1) and teaches him to read. As a young man, he becomes the leader of a group of slaves who decide to seek refuge with the Union army during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. He enlists in a colored regiment and is promoted to lieutenant. On account of his white skin, his superiors council him to change to a white regiment for better chances of promotion, but he refuses. After the war, he successfully runs a hardware store.\n\n'''Marie Leroy''', Iola's mother. A small child when brutally separated from her mother Harriet Johnson, she finally becomes the slave of wealthy Eugene Leroy. When Eugene becomes seriously ill, she nurses him back to health. He sets her free, has her educated and marries her in a secret ceremony. Although she is so white that \"no one would suspect that she has one drop of negro blood in her veins\" (chapter IX), the marriage results in the Leroy family becoming social outcasts.\n\n'''Harry Leroy''', Iola's brother. Like Iola, he is educated in a North. The African ancestry of their mother is concealed from the children, and they are not allowed to pass their vacations at home, spending that time instead together with the parents in a northern holiday resort. When he learns that his father has died and his mother and sister are enslaved, he becomes seriously ill from the shock. When he recovers, the Civil War has begun and he decides to enlist in a colored regiment, making the recruiting officer wonder why a white man should want to do that.\n\n'''Dr. Frank Latimer''', the man who Iola finally marries. He was born into slavery as the son of an enslaved mother of predominantly European ancestry and a white man. After emancipation, his mother invested her hard earnings to pay for his studies. He graduated as a medical doctor and afterwards met his white grandmother, the rich mother of his deceased father, who offered to \"adopt him as her heir, if he would ignore his identity with the colored race\" (chapter XXVIII). Although no trace of his African ancestry was visible in his appearance, he declined the offer.\n\n'''Lucille Delany''', the woman who Harry finally marries.\n\n===Other black characters===\n'''Tom Anderson''', friend of Robert Johnson. He seeks refuge with the Union army together with Johnson, causes the commander to set Iola free, joins the army and dies in Iola's care from wounds he received while knowingly sacrificing himself in order to save his comrades.\n\n'''Aunt Linda''', enslaved cook of Nancy Johnson who has a special liking for Robert.\n\n'''Uncle Daniel''', elder friend of Robert Johnson. When Robert and his group seek refuge with the Union army, he stays behind because he doesn't want to break his promise to his absent master.\n\n===White characters===\n'''Dr. Gresham''', military physician. He falls in love with Iola while he still thinks that she is white. When informed that she is \"colored\", his love helps him to overcome his prejudice, and he proposes to Iola at two different points of the story. When rejected for the second time, \"sympathy, love, and admiration were blended in the parting look he gave her\" (chapter 27).\n\n'''Dr. Latrobe''', physician from the South. He is mentioned only in chapters 26, ''Open Questions'', and 28, ''Dr. Latrobe's Mistake''. In a discussion, he voices the view of southern [[White supremacy|white supremacists]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Iola Leroy Frontispiece.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Frances Harper on the book's [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]]]]\n\nIn a [[North Carolina]] town which is only identified as \"C\u2014\", a group of slaves led by Robert Johnson seek refuge with the Union army that is approaching in the course of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Robert's friend Tom Anderson then informs the Union commander of a beautiful young woman held as slave in the neighborhood who is subsequently set free by the commander.\n\nIn a retrospective, the narrative turns to the story of that woman, Iola Leroy. Her father, Eugene Leroy, was a wealthy slaveholder, who had survived a serious illness through the care of a young slave, Marie. He set Marie free, married her and had three children, whose African ancestry was not visible in their outward appearance. The elder children, Ioala and Harry, were educated in the North and their African ancestry (called \"negro blood\" in the book) was hidden from them. When Eugene suddenly died of yellow fever, his cousin, Alfred Lorraine, had a judge declare Marie's manumission illegal. Hence, Marie and her children were legally considered slaves and the heritage fell to Lorraine and other distant relatives. Lorraine sent his agent to the northern seminary where Iola was preparing for her graduation and defending the institution of slavery in discussions with her fellow students. Deceitfully being told that her father was dying, Iola followed the agent to her home, where she learned that she was a slave and was sold away from her mother.\n\nThe narrative then returns to the events following Iola's rescue by the Union army: Robert Johnson and Tom Anderson join the army \"to strike a blow for freedom\", while Iola becomes a nurse in a military hospital. When Robert is entrusted to her care after being wounded, they tell each other their stories which indicate that Robert is the brother of Iola's mother. After the war, they return to \"C\u2014\" to search for Robert's mother, who they recognize when she tells her story during a prayer meeting.\n\nThe family is reunited when they locate Harry who had been fighting in the Union army and met with his and Iola's mother during the war.\n\n==Themes==\nMuch space is given to discussions in which the characters talk about themes such as [[Temperance movement|temperance]], religion, the position of women in society, alleged white superiority, racism and lynchings, and the color line.\n\n'''Temperance''': The damaging effects of alcohol are often discussed in the book. For example, after the war the black characters tell each other of two former masters who took to drink and ended up in the \"[[poorhouse|pore-house]]\" (chapters 18, 19). After Robert Johnson has found his long-lost mother, Aunt Linda pours three glasses of her home-made wine so they can celebrate the event. Robert refuses the wine stating, \"I'm a temperance man\", causing the conversion of Aunt Linda to the temperance idea (chapter 20).\n\n'''Religion''': Prayer plays an important role in the life of the black characters: Iola and Robert discover the first clue of their kinship when Iola sings a special hymn at the bedside of the wounded Robert, which he has learned from his mother (chapter 16). Both find Harriet, their lost grandmother and mother, during a prayer meeting (chapter 20).\n\nWhen Iola's brother Harry learns that his mother and sister have been reduced to slavery, he asks how such a thing is possible in a \"Christian country\". The principal of his school gives the answer: \"Christian in name\" (chapter 14). After the war and the abolition of slavery, in a discussion with her uncle Robert and Dr. Gresham, Iola states that a \"fuller comprehension of the claims of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and their application to our national life\" is the only \"remedy by which our nation can recover from the evil entailed upon her by slavery\", to which both Robert and Gresham agree (chapter 25).\n\nIn the discussions, the characters also mention [[Islam]]. The black pastor, ''Rev. Carmicle'', speaks of the \"imperfect creed\" of \"Mohammedanism\" (chapter 26), but ''Prof. Gradnor'', a black professor from North Carolina, sees Islamic countries as \"civilized\" and compares them favorably with the southern United States, referring to lynchings and stating, \"I know of no civilized country on the globe, Catholic, Protestant, or Mohammedan, where life is less secure than it is in the South\" (chapter 30).\n\n'''Alleged white superiority''': In chapter 17, Iola is teaching black children, when a \"gentleman\" asks to address the class. He talks about the \"achievements of the white race\" and then asks \"how they did it.\" {{quote|\u2033They've got the money,\u2033 chorused the children.\n\u2033But how did they get it ?\u2033\n\u2033They took it from us,\u2033 chimed the youngsters.}}\n\n==Literary significance and criticism==\n''Iola Leroy'' \"may well have [been] influenced\" by [[Harriet Jacobs]]'s 1861 autobiography ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''.<ref name=\"JacobsXXXI\">J.F.Yellin, Introduction to: H.Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.

Professor [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]]'s 1982 discovery of [[Harriet Wilson]]'s ''[[Our Nig]]'' (1859) displaced it from that spot. Later, [[William Wells Brown]]'s 1853 novel ''[[Clotel]], or the President's Daughter'', although first published in England where he was living at the time, came to be viewed as the first novel by an African-American author.\n\nHarper's novel remains important as one of the earliest novels written by an African American and as a fictional work dealing with complex issues of race, class, and politics in the United States. Recent scholarship suggests that Harper's novel provides a sophisticated understanding of citizenship, gender, and community, particularly the way that African Americans developed hybrid forms of ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|gemeinschaft and gesellschaft]]'' before, during, and after slavery.<ref>[[Hollis Robbins|Robbins, Hollis]] (ed.), \"Introduction,\" ''Iola Leroy, or, Shadows Uplifted,'' Penguin Classics, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe African-American journalist [[Ida B.
