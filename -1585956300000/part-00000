Eighty-four nations have competed in the Olympic archery events, with France appearing the most often at 31 times. The most noticeable trend has been the excellence of South Korean archers, who have won 23 out of 34 gold medals in events since 1984. It is governed by the [[World Archery Federation]] (WA; formerly FITA). [[Recurve bow|Recurve archery]] is the only discipline of archery featured at the Olympic Games. [[Archery at the Summer Paralympics|Archery is also an event]] at the [[Summer Paralympics]].\n\n==History==\nThe second Olympic games, Paris 1900, saw the first appearance of [[archery]]. Seven disciplines in varying distances were contested. At the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], six archery events were contested, of which three were men's and three were women's competitions. Team archery was introduced, as was women's archery. At the [[1908 Summer Olympics]], three archery events were held. Archery was not featured at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] but reappeared in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]].\n\nBetween 1920 and 1972, archery was not contested at the Olympic games. The archery competition featured at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]] consisted of a double FITA Round (from 2014 known as a '1440 Round') competition with two events: men's individual and women's individual. This form of archery competition was held until the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], when team competition was added and the Grand FITA Round format was used. Starting at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], the Olympic Round with head-to-head matches was adopted and has been used ever since.\n\nIn [[1984 Summer Olympic Games|1984]] at Los Angeles, [[Neroli Fairhall]] of [[New Zealand]] was the first [[paraplegic]] competitor in the [[Olympic Games]].\n\n==Medal tables==\n===1900\u20131920===\nThis table includes archery competitions in 1900, 1904, 1908, and 1920.

The nations that competed during that period were France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and the United States.

There is no minimum age for an Olympic archer. There are two ways an NOC may earn qualification spots: by team or by individual. For each gender, an NOC that earns a team qualification spot may send three archers to compete in that team event; each archer also competes in the individual competition. NOCs that earn individual qualification spots are limited to a single entry in the individual event.\n\nFor each gender, there are 12 team qualification spots: the host nation, the top 8 teams at the [[World Archery Championships]], and the top 3 teams at the Final World Team Qualification Tournament.<ref name=\"World Archery Federation\">{{cite web|title=Archery Qualification|url=http://corporate.olympics.com.au/files/dmfile/Rio2016QualificationSystem-Archery.pdf|publisher=[[World Archery Federation]]|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the 36 entries awarded through team qualification, an additional 28 individual qualification spots are available for each gender, bringing the total number of competitors in each individual event to 64.\n\nQualification for the mixed team event is done through the ranking round at the Olympics.\n\n===2012===\nFor 2012, the qualification rules were adjusted slightly.  The host nation continued to receive three spots, as did the top eight teams at the World Championship.  However, only 8 further individuals qualified through the individual placement at the World Championship.  The continental tournaments received unbalanced allocations, with Africa and Oceania receiving only two qualification spots to the other continents' three.  The Tripartite Commission retained its three selections.  The remaining 13 spots were decided by Final Qualification Tournaments.  Three additional team spots (9 individual spots) were allocated through the Final Qualification team event, and the last 4 spots through the Final Qualification individual tournament.  If any of the NOCs qualifying through Final Qualification had already earned an individual spot, one more spot as added to the individual Final Qualification quota.<ref name=2012Quals>[http://www.archery.org/UserFiles/Document/Olympic%20Games/2012_OG_London/12_London_Qualif_System-e.pdf 2012 London Qualification System]</ref>\n\n===2016===\nAfrica received 3 qualification spots in the continental tournaments, leaving Oceania as the only continent to receive 2 spots rather than 3.\n\n===2020===\nFor the 2020 Olympics, the five Continental Games were added to the qualification pathway. The winning NOC in the mixed team event at each of the five receives one allocation spot per gender; there is also one quota spot per gender for the individual event winners at the Asian, European, and Pan American Games. The World Championship allocation was reduced to 4 per gender and the Tripartite Commission allocation was reduced to 2 per gender. The European continental tournament received an additional spot (up to 4) at the expense of Oceania (down to 1) and Africa (down to 2). The base allocation for the final individual qualification tournament was reduced to only 1 per gender, though this tournament also reallocates unused quota spots.\n\n==Competition==\nFrom 1988 through 2016, Olympic archery consisted of four medal events: men's individual, women's individual, men's team, and women's team. The mixed team event is being added in 2020. In all five events, the distance from the archer to the target is 70 meters.\n\n===Individual===\nIn the individual competitions, 64 archers compete. The competition begins with the ranking round. Each archer shoots 72 [[arrow]]s (in six ends, or groups, of 12 arrows). They are then ranked by score to determine their seeding for the single-elimination bracket. After this, final rankings for each archer are determined by the archer's score in the round in which the archer was defeated, with the archers defeated in the first round being ranked 33rd through 64th.\n\n====Pre-2008====\nThe first [[Archery Olympic Round|elimination round]] pits the first ranked archer against the sixty-fourth, the second against the sixty-third, and so on. In this match as well as the second and third, the archers shoot simultaneously 18 arrows in ends of 3 arrows. The archer with the higher score after 18 arrows moves on to the next round while the loser is eliminated.\n\nAfter three such rounds, there are 8 archers remaining. The remaining three rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and medal matches) are referred to as the finals rounds. They consist of each archer shooting 12 arrows, again in ends of 3 arrows. The two archers in the match alternate by arrow instead of shooting their arrows simultaneously as in the first three rounds. The losers of the quarterfinals are eliminated, while the losers of the semifinals play each other to determine the [[bronze medal]] and fourth place. The two archers who are undefeated through the semifinals face each other in the gold medal match, in which the winner takes the [[gold medal]] while the loser receives the [[silver medal]].\n\n====2008 changes====\nAll matches in 2008 were in the previous finals round format, using 12 arrow matches. Archers alternated shooting by arrow.\n\n====2012 changes====\nThe individual match system was completely overhauled for the 2012 Olympics, though the single elimination with bronze medal match format was retained.  The matches now consisted of sets.  Each set comprised both archers shooting three arrows.  The archer with the best score in the set received two points; if the set was drawn, each archer received one point.  The match would continue until one archer reached six points.  If the match was tied after five sets, a single arrow shoot-off was held with the closest arrow to center winning.<ref name=2012IndividualFormat>{{Cite web |url=http://www.london2012.com/archery/event/men-individual/competition-format/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501095908/http://www.london2012.com/archery/event/men-individual/competition-format/ |archive-date=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Team===\nThe team event uses the results of the same ranking round as the individual competition to determine seeding for the teams. The team's three individual archers' scores are summed to get a team ranking round score. The competition thereafter is a single-elimination bracket, with the top 4 teams receiving a bye into the quarterfinals. The semifinal losers face each other in the bronze medal match. The set format from the individual competition was not used in 2012, but was used beginning in 2016.<ref name=2016Format>[http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/archery-101-competition ]</ref> In team matches prior to 2016, each archer shot 8 arrows, with the best overall team score (for the total of 24 arrows) winning the match. Beginning with 2016, the set format (with each archer shooting two arrows per set for a total of six arrows per team per set) is used.\n\n===Mixed team===\nThe mixed team competition uses the results of the ranking round to both qualify and seed teams. Each of the 16 teams that compete consist of one man and one woman. <!-- Presumably they will do a single-elimination bracket using a set system, but need source before adding that. -->\n\n==Events==\n\n===Early Games===\nEarly Olympic archery competitions had events that were unique for each of the Games.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n![[Archery at the 1900 Summer Olympics|1900]]\n![[Archery at the 1904 Summer Olympics|1904]]\n![[Archery at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908]]\n!1912\n![[Archery at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920]]\n|-\n|''6 events, men only''\n|''6 events, men and women''\n|''3 events, men and women''\n|''not held''\n|''10 events, men only''\n|-\n|valign=top|\n*[[Archery at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Au Cordon Dor\u00e9 50 metres|Au Cordon Dor\u00e9, 50 metres]]\n*[[Archery at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Au Cordon Dor\u00e9 33 metres|Au Cordon Dor\u00e9, 33 metres]]\n*[[Archery at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Au Chapelet 50 metres|Au Chapelet, 50 metres]]\n*[[Archery at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Au Chapelet 33 metres|Au Chapelet, 33 metres]]\n*[[Archery at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Sur la Perche \u00e0 la Herse|Sur la Perche \u00e0 la Herse]]\n*[[Archery at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Sur la Perche \u00e0 la Pyramide|Sur la Perche \u00e0 la Pyramide]]\n|valign=top|\n*[[Archery at the 1904 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team round|Team round, men]]\n*[[Archery at the 1904 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's team round|Team round, women]]\n*[[Archery at the 1904 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's double American round|Double American round, men]]\n*[[Archery at the 1904 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's double Columbia round|Double Columbia round, women]]\n*[[Archery at the 1904 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's double National round|Double National round, women]]\n*[[Archery at the 1904 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's double York round|Double York round, men]]\n|valign=top|\n*[[Archery at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's double National round|Double National round, women]] \n*[[Archery at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's double York round|Double York round, men]]\n*[[Archery at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's Continental style|Continental style, men]]\n|&nbsp;\n|valign=top|\n*[[Archery at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual fixed large bird|Individual fixed large bird]]\n*[[Archery at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual fixed small bird|Individual fixed small bird]]\n*[[Archery at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual moving bird, 50 metres|Individual moving bird, 50 metres]]\n*[[Archery at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual moving bird, 33 metres|Individual moving bird, 33 metres]]\n*[[Archery at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual moving bird, 28 metres|Individual moving bird, 28 metres]]\n*[[Archery at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Team fixed large bird|Team fixed large bird]]\n*[[Archery at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Team fixed small bird|Team fixed small bird]]\n*[[Archery at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Team moving bird, 50 metres|Team moving bird, 50 metres]]\n*[[Archery at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Team moving bird, 33 metres|Team moving bird, 33 metres]]\n*[[Archery at the 1920 Summer Olympics \u2013 Team moving bird, 28 metres|Team moving bird, 28 metres]]\n|}\n\n===Modern Games===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|colspan=31 align=center| '''Current program'''\n|-align=center\n!

Eighty-four nations have competed in the Olympic archery events, with France appearing the most often at 31 times. The most noticeable trend has been the excellence of South Korean archers, who have won 23 out of 34 gold medals in events since 1984. It is governed by the [[World Archery Federation]] (WA; formerly FITA). [[Recurve bow|Recurve archery]] is the only discipline of archery featured at the Olympic Games. [[Archery at the Summer Paralympics|Archery is also an event]] at the [[Summer Paralympics]].\n\n==History==\nThe second Olympic games, Paris 1900, saw the first appearance of [[archery]]. Seven disciplines in varying distances were contested. At the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], six archery events were contested, of which three were men's and three were women's competitions. Team archery was introduced, as was women's archery. At the [[1908 Summer Olympics]], three archery events were held. Archery was not featured at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] but reappeared in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]].\n\nBetween 1920 and 1972, archery was not contested at the Olympic games. The archery competition featured at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]] consisted of a double FITA Round (from 2014 known as a '1440 Round') competition with two events: men's individual and women's individual. This form of archery competition was held until the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], when team competition was added and the Grand FITA Round format was used. Starting at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], the Olympic Round with head-to-head matches was adopted and has been used ever since.\n\nIn [[1984 Summer Olympic Games|1984]] at Los Angeles, [[Neroli Fairhall]] of [[New Zealand]] was the first [[paraplegic]] competitor in the [[Olympic Games]].\n\n==Medal tables==\n===1900\u20131920===\nThis table includes archery competitions in 1900, 1904, 1908, and 1920.

The nations that competed during that period were France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and the United States.

There is no minimum age for an Olympic archer. There are two ways an NOC may earn qualification spots: by team or by individual. For each gender, an NOC that earns a team qualification spot may send three archers to compete in that team event; each archer also competes in the individual competition. NOCs that earn individual qualification spots are limited to a single entry in the individual event.\n\nFor each gender, there are 12 team qualification spots: the host nation, the top 8 teams at the [[World Archery Championships]], and the top 3 teams at the Final World Team Qualification Tournament.<ref name=\"World Archery Federation\">{{cite web|title=Archery Qualification|url=http://corporate.olympics.com.au/files/dmfile/Rio2016QualificationSystem-Archery.pdf|publisher=[[World Archery Federation]]|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the 36 entries awarded through team qualification, an additional 28 individual qualification spots are available for each gender, bringing the total number of competitors in each individual event to 64.\n\nQualification for the mixed team event is done through the ranking round at the Olympics.\n\n===2012===\nFor 2012, the qualification rules were adjusted slightly.  The host nation continued to receive three spots, as did the top eight teams at the World Championship.  However, only 8 further individuals qualified through the individual placement at the World Championship.  The continental tournaments received unbalanced allocations, with Africa and Oceania receiving only two qualification spots to the other continents' three.  The Tripartite Commission retained its three selections.  The remaining 13 spots were decided by Final Qualification Tournaments.  Three additional team spots (9 individual spots) were allocated through the Final Qualification team event, and the last 4 spots through the Final Qualification individual tournament.  If any of the NOCs qualifying through Final Qualification had already earned an individual spot, one more spot as added to the individual Final Qualification quota.<ref name=2012Quals>[http://www.archery.org/UserFiles/Document/Olympic%20Games/2012_OG_London/12_London_Qualif_System-e.pdf 2012 London Qualification System]</ref>\n\n===2016===\nAfrica received 3 qualification spots in the continental tournaments, leaving Oceania as the only continent to receive 2 spots rather than 3.\n\n===2020===\nFor the 2020 Olympics, the five Continental Games were added to the qualification pathway. The winning NOC in the mixed team event at each of the five receives one allocation spot per gender; there is also one quota spot per gender for the individual event winners at the Asian, European, and Pan American Games. The World Championship allocation was reduced to 4 per gender and the Tripartite Commission allocation was reduced to 2 per gender. The European continental tournament received an additional spot (up to 4) at the expense of Oceania (down to 1) and Africa (down to 2). The base allocation for the final individual qualification tournament was reduced to only 1 per gender, though this tournament also reallocates unused quota spots.\n\n==Competition==\nFrom 1988 through 2016, Olympic archery consisted of four medal events: men's individual, women's individual, men's team, and women's team. The mixed team event is being added in 2020. In all five events, the distance from the archer to the target is 70 meters.\n\n===Individual===\nIn the individual competitions, 64 archers compete. The competition begins with the ranking round. Each archer shoots 72 [[arrow]]s (in six ends, or groups, of 12 arrows). They are then ranked by score to determine their seeding for the single-elimination bracket. After this, final rankings for each archer are determined by the archer's score in the round in which the archer was defeated, with the archers defeated in the first round being ranked 33rd through 64th.\n\n====Pre-2008====\nThe first [[Archery Olympic Round|elimination round]] pits the first ranked archer against the sixty-fourth, the second against the sixty-third, and so on. In this match as well as the second and third, the archers shoot simultaneously 18 arrows in ends of 3 arrows. The archer with the higher score after 18 arrows moves on to the next round while the loser is eliminated.\n\nAfter three such rounds, there are 8 archers remaining. The remaining three rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and medal matches) are referred to as the finals rounds. They consist of each archer shooting 12 arrows, again in ends of 3 arrows. The two archers in the match alternate by arrow instead of shooting their arrows simultaneously as in the first three rounds. The losers of the quarterfinals are eliminated, while the losers of the semifinals play each other to determine the [[bronze medal]] and fourth place. The two archers who are undefeated through the semifinals face each other in the gold medal match, in which the winner takes the [[gold medal]] while the loser receives the [[silver medal]].\n\n====2008 changes====\nAll matches in 2008 were in the previous finals round format, using 12 arrow matches. Archers alternated shooting by arrow.\n\n====2012 changes====\nThe individual match system was completely overhauled for the 2012 Olympics, though the single elimination with bronze medal match format was retained.  The matches now consisted of sets.  Each set comprised both archers shooting three arrows.  The archer with the best score in the set received two points; if the set was drawn, each archer received one point.  The match would continue until one archer reached six points.  If the match was tied after five sets, a single arrow shoot-off was held with the closest arrow to center winning.<ref name=2012IndividualFormat>{{Cite web |url=http://www.london2012.com/archery/event/men-individual/competition-format/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501095908/http://www.london2012.com/archery/event/men-individual/competition-format/ |archive-date=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Team===\nThe team event uses the results of the same ranking round as the individual competition to determine seeding for the teams. The team's three individual archers' scores are summed to get a team ranking round score. The competition thereafter is a single-elimination bracket, with the top 4 teams receiving a bye into the quarterfinals. The semifinal losers face each other in the bronze medal match. The set format from the individual competition was not used in 2012, but was used beginning in 2016.<ref name=2016Format>[http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/archery-101-competition ]</ref> In team matches prior to 2016, each archer shot 8 arrows, with the best overall team score (for the total of 24 arrows) winning the match. Beginning with 2016, the set format (with each archer shooting two arrows per set for a total of six arrows per team per set) is used.\n\n===Mixed team===\nThe mixed team competition uses the results of the ranking round to both qualify and seed teams.

Satyricon became a prominent music venue in the city, and hosted various local and touring [[punk rock|punk]] and [[alternative rock]] bands throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn May 2003, the club abruptly closed, after which it was acquired by new owners and reopened as an all-ages venue in 2006.

Davis makes art from found objects and often includes mixed media.\nHe has also worked in [[photography]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[ceramic]]s and [[sculpture]] but accounts clay as is his most expressive medium of art due to its direct physical influence from it. He feels that there's a disconnect when a tool separates him from the work such as a brush or a lens. Art to Davis \"is a wonderful way to understand self and to understand others.\"\n\nIn his works he would tend to have a strong influence in African and African American textiles. \"There's a triangle motif that\u2019s common in his art that\u2019s borrowed from the patterns found in African Quilts and architecture found in Guana, Africa.<ref name=\":0\" />\"  \"Among Davis's works many have been featured in public and private collections alike from the U.S.A. Europe and China to Ghana, Senegal and Nigeria with exhibits featured in the Museum of Harlem, the African Craft Museum, the Renwick gallery and many more.<ref name=\":0\" />\"\n\nBeing an African American and growing up in the civil rights movement has influenced Davis.

Davis makes art from found objects and often includes mixed media.\nHe has also worked in [[photography]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[ceramic]]s and [[sculpture]] but accounts clay as is his most expressive medium of art due to its direct physical influence from it. He feels that there's a disconnect when a tool separates him from the work such as a brush or a lens. Art to Davis \"is a wonderful way to understand self and to understand others.\"\n\nIn his works he would tend to have a strong influence in African and African American textiles. \"There's a triangle motif that\u2019s common in his art that\u2019s borrowed from the patterns found in African Quilts and architecture found in Guana, Africa.<ref name=\":0\" />\"  \"Among Davis's works many have been featured in public and private collections alike from the U.S.A.

Stone also pointed out that although Sunni Islam was the state religion, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the ''timar'' system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the ''timar'' system became inheritable, land owners in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged ''[[Timariot]]s'' from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the ''timariots'' to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation, which ultimately had harmful effects on the Ottoman economy.<ref>Stone, pp. 94-95.</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n{{Main|State organization of the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Jean Baptiste Vanmour - Dinner at the Palace in Honour of an Ambassador - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Ambassadors at the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]]]]\n\nBefore the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the [[state organization of the Ottoman Empire]] was a system with two main dimensions, the military administration, and the civil administration. The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The state had control over the clergy.

The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son, or nephew) because his enemies perceived him as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.<ref name=\"Kapucu\"/> As such, the last Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI (r. 1918\u20131922) was a [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant]] of the first Ottoman sultan [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), which was unparalleled in both Europe (e.g., the male line of the House of Habsburg became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world.

The politics of the state had several advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as [[Divan]]. The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a ''[[Bey]]lik'', was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a Grand Vizier was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal, and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the ''de facto'' head of state.<ref name=\"Black p199\"/>\n\n[[File:Yusuf Ziya Pa\u015fa.jpg|thumb|[[Yusuf Ziya Pasha]], Ottoman ambassador to the [[United States]], in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], 1913]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces.

For instance, the Islamic courts, which were the Empire's primary courts, could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic ''Sharia'' law system had been developed from a combination of the [[Qur'an]]; the [[Hadith|Had\u012bth]], or words of the prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]; ''[[ijma|ijm\u0101']]'', or consensus of the members of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]; [[qiyas]], a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs.

The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the [[Ottoman Army]] included Janissary, [[Sipahi]], [[Akinci|Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] and [[Ottoman military band|Mehter\u00e2n]]. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons. The Ottoman Turks began using ''[[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]]'', which were short but wide cannons, during the [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|Siege of Constantinople]].

In 1826 Sultan Mahmud II abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the [[Nizam-\u0131 Cedid]] (New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the Young Turks movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Navy]] vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of [[Algeria]] and Egypt to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of [[Greece]] in 1821 and Algeria in 1830, Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] (reigned 1861\u20131876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France.

Sultan [[Abd\u00fclhamid II]] distrusted the admirals who sided with the reformist [[Midhat Pasha]] and claimed that the large and expensive fleet was of no use against the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War. He locked most of the fleet inside the [[Golden Horn]], where the ships decayed for the next 30 years.

Still, as Western Europe modernized its military organization technology, the Janissaries became a reactionary force that resisted all change. Steadily the Ottoman military power became outdated, but when the Janissaries felt their privileges were being threatened or outsiders wanted to modernize them, or the cavalrymen might supersede them, they rose in rebellion. The rebellions were highly violent on both sides, but by the time the Janissaries were suppressed, it was far too late for Ottoman military power to catch up with the West. <ref>Peter Mansfield, ''A History of the Middle East'' (1991) p. 31.</ref><ref>Oleg Benesch,  \"Comparing Warrior Traditions: How the Janissaries and Samurai Maintained Their Status and Privileges During Centuries of Peace.\" ''Comparative Civilizations Review'' 55.55 (2006): 6:37-55 [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1669&context=ccr Online].</ref> The political system was transformed by the destruction of the [[Janissaries]] in the [[Auspicious Incident]] of 1826, who was a potent military/governmental/police force that revolted. Sultan Mahmud II crushed the revolt executed the leaders and disbanded the large organization.  That set the stage for a slow process of modernization of government functions, as the government sought, with mixed success, to adopt the main elements of Western bureaucracy and military technology. The Janissaries had been recruited from Christians and other minorities; their abolition enabled the emergence of a Turkish elite to control the Ottoman Empire.  The problem was that the Turkish element was very poorly educated, lacking higher schools of any sort, and locked into the Turkish language that used the Arabic alphabet that inhibited wider learning.  A large number of ethnic and religious minorities were tolerated in their separate segregated domains called millets.<ref>Karen Barkey, and George Gavrilis, \"The Ottoman millet system: non-territorial autonomy and its contemporary legacy.\" ''Ethnopolitics'' 15.1 (2016): 24\u201342.</ref> They were primarily [[Ottoman Greeks|Greek]], [[Ottoman Armenians|Armenian]], or [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish]].  In each locality, they governed themselves, spoke their language, ran their schools, cultural and religious institutions, and paid somewhat higher taxes. They had no power outside the millet. The Imperial government protected them and prevented major violent clashes between ethnic groups. However, the millets showed very little loyalty to the Empire. Ethnic nationalism, based on distinctive religion and language, provided a centripetal force that eventually destroyed the Ottoman Empire.<ref>, Donald Quataert, ''Social Disintegration and Popular Resistance in the Ottoman Empire 1881\u20131908'' (1083)</ref> Also, Muslim ethnic groups, which were not part of the Millett system, especially the Arabs and the Kurds, were outside the Turkish culture and developed their separate nationalism. The British sponsored Arab nationalism in the First World War, promising an independent Arab state in return for Arab support.  Most Arabs supported the Sultan, but those near Mecca believed in and supported the British promise.<ref>, Youssef M. Choueiri, ''Arab Nationalism: A History: Nation and State in the Arab World'' (2001), pp. 56\u2013100.</ref>\n\nAt the local level, power was held beyond the control of the Sultan by the [[Ottoman Ayan|\"ayan\"]] or local notables. The ayan collected taxes, formed local armies to compete with other notables, took a reactionary attitude toward political or economic change, and often defied policies handed down by the Sultan.<ref>{{cite book|author=G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston and Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA64|year=2010|publisher=Infobase |page=64|isbn=9781438110257}}</ref>\n\nThe economic system made little progress. Printing was forbidden until the 18th century,  for fear of defiling the secret documents of Islam. The millets, however, were allowed their presses, using Greek, Hebrew, Armenian, and other languages that greatly facilitated nationalism. The religious prohibition on charging interest foreclosed most of the entrepreneurial skills among Muslims, although it did flourish among the Jews and Christians.\n\nAfter the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was shrinking, as Russia put on heavy pressure and expanded to its south; Egypt became effectively independent in 1805, and the British later took it over, along with Cyprus. Greece became independent, and Serbia and other Balkan areas became highly restive as the force of nationalism pushed against imperialism.  The French took over Algeria and Tunisia. The  Europeans all thought that the empire was a sick man in rapid decline. Only the Germans seemed helpful, and their support led to the Ottoman Empire joining the central powers in 1915, with the result that they came out as one of the most massive losers of the First World War in 1918.<ref>Naci Yorulmaz, ''Arming the Sultan: German Arms Trade and Personal Diplomacy in the Ottoman Empire Before World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014).</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Culture of the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}\n[[File:WaldmeierLebanon.gif|thumb|left|Depiction of a [[hookah]] shop in [[Lebanon]], Ottoman Empire]]\n\nThe Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art, and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them.

Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], short story, or novel. Analog genres did exist, though, in both [[Turkish folk literature]] and in [[Divan poetry]].\n\nOttoman [[Divan poetry]] was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the [[Persian poetry]] that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships\u2014both of similitude (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0638\u064a\u0631 mura'\u00e2t-i naz\u00eer / \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628 ten\u00e2s\u00fcb) and opposition (\u062a\u0636\u0627\u062f tez\u00e2d) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either [[gazel]]s (which make up the most significant part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kas\u00eedes. There were, however, other common genres, most notably the mesnev\u00ee, a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the [[Leyli and Majnun]] of [[Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee]] and the [[H\u00fcsn \u00fc A\u015fk]] of [[\u015eeyh G\u00e2lib]].\n\n[[File:Nedim (divan edb.\u015fairi).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmet Ned\u00eem Efendi]], one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets]]\n\nUntil the 19th century, [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (\u0633\u062c\u0639, also transliterated as seci), or [[rhymed prose]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Murat Belge |title=Osmanl\u0131'da kurumlar ve k\u00fclt\u00fcr |year=2005 |publisher=\u0130stanbul Bilgi \u00dcniversitesi Yay\u0131nlar\u0131 |isbn=978-975-8998-03-6 |page=389}}</ref> a type of writing descended from the Arabic [[saj']] and which prescribed that between each adjective and [[noun]] in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]]. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional.

As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents. In the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of [[Romanticism]] can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] movements that became paramount.\n\nMany of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously. For instance, the poet [[Nam\u0131k Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel \u0130ntib\u00e2h (\"Awakening\"), while the journalist [[\u0130brahim \u015einasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy \"\u015eair Evlenmesi\" (\"The Poet's Marriage\"). An earlier play, a [[farce]] entitled \"Vak\u00e2yi'-i 'Acibe ve Hav\u00e2dis-i Garibe-yi Kef\u015fger Ahmed\" (\"The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed\"), dates from the beginning of the 19th century. Still, there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist [[Ahmed Midhat Efendi]] wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mell\u00e2h y\u00e2hud S\u0131rr \u0130\u00e7inde Esr\u00e2r, 1873; \"Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery\"), Realism (Hen\u00fcz On Yedi Ya\u015f\u0131nda, 1881; \"Just Seventeen Years Old\"), and Naturalism (M\u00fc\u015f\u00e2hed\u00e2t, 1891; \"Observations\"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman [[social structure]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Berna|title=T\u00fcrk Roman\u0131na Ele\u015ftirel Bir Bak\u0131\u015f Vol. 1|isbn=978-975-470-054-1|page=19|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\n{{main|Media of the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Ottoman architecture}}\n[[File:Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace in 1862.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the main entrance of [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in 1862, taken by [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]]]]\n\n[[Ottoman architecture]] was influenced by [[Persian Architecture|Persian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectures. During the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Rise period]] (The early or first Ottoman architecture period), Ottoman art was in search of new ideas. The [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|growth period]] of the Empire became the classical period of architecture when Ottoman art was at its most confident. During the years of the [[Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Stagnation period]], Ottoman architecture moved away from this style, however.\n\n[[File:Bridge on the Drina July 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed Pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 Bridge]], completed in 1577 by [[Mimar Sinan]], the most celebrated architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture]]\n\nDuring the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]], it was under the influence of the highly ornamented styles of Western Europe; [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Empire (style)|Empire]] and other styles intermingled. Concepts of Ottoman architecture concentrate mainly on the [[Mosque#Architecture|mosque]]. The mosque was integral to society, [[Urban planning|city planning]], and communal life. Besides the mosque, it is also possible to find good examples of Ottoman architecture in [[soup kitchen]]s, theological schools, hospitals, [[Turkish bath]]s, and tombs.\n\nExamples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, besides Istanbul<!--Modern-day naming, so this OK--> and [[Edirne]]<!--Modern-day naming, so this OK-->, can also be seen in Egypt, Eritrea, Tunisia, Algiers, the Balkans, and Romania, where mosques, bridges, fountains, and schools were built. The art of Ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the Ottoman Empire. The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional [[Byzantine art]] with elements of [[Chinese art]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Eli Shah |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |title=The Ottoman Artistic Legacy |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213131926/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |archivedate=13 February 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Decorative arts ===\n[[File:Ottoman miniature painters.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman miniature painters]]\n\nThe tradition of [[Ottoman miniature]]s, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] art form. However, it also included elements of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of [[manuscript illumination|illumination]] and painting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A Greek academy of painters, the ''Nakkashane-i-Rum'', was established in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the ''Nakkashane-i-Irani'', was added.\n\n[[Ottoman illumination]] covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in ''[[muraqqa]]'' or albums, as opposed to the symbolic images of the [[Ottoman miniature]]. It was a part of the Ottoman Book Arts together with the Ottoman miniature (''taswir''), calligraphy (''hat''), [[Islamic calligraphy]], bookbinding (''cilt'') and [[paper marbling]] (''ebru''). In the Ottoman Empire, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated and illustrated manuscripts]] were commissioned by the Sultan or the administrators of the court. In Topkapi Palace, these manuscripts were created by the artists working in ''Nakkashane'', the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists. Both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated. Also, sheets for albums ''levha'' consisted of illuminated calligraphy (''hat'') of ''[[tughra]]'', religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.\n\nThe art of carpet [[weaving]] was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.<ref name=\"foroqhi\">{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire|year=2005|publisher=I.B.

Turks used carpets, rugs, and [[kilim]]s not just on the floors of a room but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to [[mosques]], which often amassed large collections of them.<ref name=\"foroqhip153\">{{cite book |last=Faroqhi |first=Suraiya |title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire |edition=New |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

A number of the Ottoman sultans have accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as [[Selim III]], whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of [[Byzantine music]], [[Armenian music]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. Compositionally, it is organized around rhythmic units called [[Usul (music)|usul]], which are somewhat similar to [[Metre (music)|meter]] in Western music, and [[Melody|melodic]] units called [[makam]], which bear some resemblance to Western [[musical mode]]s.\n\nThe [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the [[baglama|saz]], the [[Baglama|ba\u011flama]], the [[Kemenche|kemence]]), other Middle Eastern instruments (the [[Oud|ud]], the [[tanbur]], the [[Qanun (instrument)|kanun]], the [[ney]]), and\u2014later in the tradition\u2014Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of [[folk music]] were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are Balkan-Thracian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, North-Eastern ([[Laz people|Laz]]) T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Aegean T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Central Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Eastern Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, and Caucasian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs. Some of the distinctive styles were: [[Ottoman military band|Janissary Music]], [[Roma music]], [[Belly dance]], [[Turkish folk music]].\n\nThe traditional [[shadow play]] called [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire and featured characters representing all of the major ethnic and social groups in that culture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat, a Turkish shadow play |publisher=All About Turkey |date=20 November 2006 |url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/karagoz.htm |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Emin \u015eenyer |title=Karagoz, Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre |publisher=Karagoz.net |url=http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm |accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref> It was performed by a single puppet master, who voiced all of the characters, and accompanied by [[tambourine]] (''def'').

This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through [[Ramadan]] events, and through the cooking at the [[Yal\u0131]]s of the [[Pasha]]s, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.\n\nMuch of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine, especially [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], and including [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] cuisines.<ref name=\"Fragner\">Bert Fragner, \"From the Caucasus to the Roof of the World: a culinary adventure\", in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London, [[Prague]] and New York, p. 52</ref> Many common dishes in the region, descendants of the once-common Ottoman cuisine, include [[yogurt]], [[d\u00f6ner kebab]]/[[Gyro (food)|gyro]]/[[shawarma]], [[cac\u0131k]]/tzatziki, [[ayran]], [[pita]] bread, [[feta]] cheese, [[baklava]], [[lahmacun]], [[moussaka]], [[yuvarlak]], [[k\u00f6fte]]/keft\u00e9s/kofta, [[b\u00f6rek]]/boureki, [[rak\u0131]]/[[rakia]]/[[tsipouro]]/[[tsikoudia]], [[meze]], [[dolma]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], rice [[pilaf]], [[Turkish coffee]], [[sujuk]], [[kashk]], [[ke\u015fkek]], [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[lavash]], [[kanafeh]], and more.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{Main|Science, and technology in the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Ottoman Imperial Museum (Today- Istanbul Archaeology Museums).jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman Imperial Museum, today the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]]]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts.<ref name=\"\u00c1goston and Alan Masters583\"/> A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century.

Stone also pointed out that although Sunni Islam was the state religion, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the ''timar'' system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the ''timar'' system became inheritable, land owners in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged ''[[Timariot]]s'' from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the ''timariots'' to adopt a strategy of short term exploitation, which ultimately had harmful effects on the Ottoman economy.<ref>Stone, pp. 94-95.</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n{{Main|State organization of the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Jean Baptiste Vanmour - Dinner at the Palace in Honour of an Ambassador - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Ambassadors at the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]]]]\n\nBefore the reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries, the [[state organization of the Ottoman Empire]] was a system with two main dimensions, the military administration, and the civil administration. The Sultan was the highest position in the system. The civil system was based on local administrative units based on the region's characteristics. The state had control over the clergy.

The Ottoman dynasty was Turkish in origin. On eleven occasions, the sultan was deposed (replaced by another sultan of the Ottoman dynasty, who were either the former sultan's brother, son, or nephew) because his enemies perceived him as a threat to the state. There were only two attempts in Ottoman history to unseat the ruling Ottoman dynasty, both failures, which suggests a political system that for an extended period was able to manage its revolutions without unnecessary instability.<ref name=\"Kapucu\"/> As such, the last Ottoman sultan Mehmed VI (r. 1918\u20131922) was a [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|direct patrilineal (male-line) descendant]] of the first Ottoman sultan [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), which was unparalleled in both Europe (e.g., the male line of the House of Habsburg became extinct in 1740) and in the Islamic world.

The politics of the state had several advisors and ministers gathered around a council known as [[Divan]]. The Divan, in the years when the Ottoman state was still a ''[[Bey]]lik'', was composed of the elders of the tribe. Its composition was later modified to include military officers and local elites (such as religious and political advisors). Later still, beginning in 1320, a Grand Vizier was appointed to assume certain of the sultan's responsibilities. The Grand Vizier had considerable independence from the sultan with almost unlimited powers of appointment, dismissal, and supervision. Beginning with the late 16th century, sultans withdrew from politics and the Grand Vizier became the ''de facto'' head of state.<ref name=\"Black p199\"/>\n\n[[File:Yusuf Ziya Pa\u015fa.jpg|thumb|[[Yusuf Ziya Pasha]], Ottoman ambassador to the [[United States]], in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], 1913]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, there were many instances in which local governors acted independently, and even in opposition to the ruler. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Ottoman state became a constitutional monarchy. The sultan no longer had executive powers. A parliament was formed, with representatives chosen from the provinces.

For instance, the Islamic courts, which were the Empire's primary courts, could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic ''Sharia'' law system had been developed from a combination of the [[Qur'an]]; the [[Hadith|Had\u012bth]], or words of the prophet [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]; ''[[ijma|ijm\u0101']]'', or consensus of the members of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]; [[qiyas]], a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs.

The military system became an intricate organization with the advance of the Empire. The Ottoman military was a complex system of recruiting and fief-holding. The main corps of the [[Ottoman Army]] included Janissary, [[Sipahi]], [[Akinci|Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] and [[Ottoman military band|Mehter\u00e2n]]. The Ottoman army was once among the most advanced fighting forces in the world, being one of the first to use muskets and cannons. The Ottoman Turks began using ''[[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]]'', which were short but wide cannons, during the [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|Siege of Constantinople]].

In 1826 Sultan Mahmud II abolished the Janissary corps and established the modern Ottoman army. He named them as the [[Nizam-\u0131 Cedid]] (New Order). The Ottoman army was also the first institution to hire foreign experts and send its officers for training in western European countries. Consequently, the Young Turks movement began when these relatively young and newly trained men returned with their education.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Navy]] vastly contributed to the expansion of the Empire's territories on the European continent. It initiated the conquest of North Africa, with the addition of [[Algeria]] and Egypt to the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Starting with the loss of [[Greece]] in 1821 and Algeria in 1830, Ottoman naval power and control over the Empire's distant overseas territories began to decline. Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] (reigned 1861\u20131876) attempted to reestablish a strong Ottoman navy, building the largest fleet after those of Britain and France.

Sultan [[Abd\u00fclhamid II]] distrusted the admirals who sided with the reformist [[Midhat Pasha]] and claimed that the large and expensive fleet was of no use against the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War. He locked most of the fleet inside the [[Golden Horn]], where the ships decayed for the next 30 years.

Still, as Western Europe modernized its military organization technology, the Janissaries became a reactionary force that resisted all change. Steadily the Ottoman military power became outdated, but when the Janissaries felt their privileges were being threatened or outsiders wanted to modernize them, or the cavalrymen might supersede them, they rose in rebellion. The rebellions were highly violent on both sides, but by the time the Janissaries were suppressed, it was far too late for Ottoman military power to catch up with the West. <ref>Peter Mansfield, ''A History of the Middle East'' (1991) p. 31.</ref><ref>Oleg Benesch,  \"Comparing Warrior Traditions: How the Janissaries and Samurai Maintained Their Status and Privileges During Centuries of Peace.\" ''Comparative Civilizations Review'' 55.55 (2006): 6:37-55 [https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1669&context=ccr Online].</ref> The political system was transformed by the destruction of the [[Janissaries]] in the [[Auspicious Incident]] of 1826, who was a potent military/governmental/police force that revolted. Sultan Mahmud II crushed the revolt executed the leaders and disbanded the large organization.  That set the stage for a slow process of modernization of government functions, as the government sought, with mixed success, to adopt the main elements of Western bureaucracy and military technology. The Janissaries had been recruited from Christians and other minorities; their abolition enabled the emergence of a Turkish elite to control the Ottoman Empire.  The problem was that the Turkish element was very poorly educated, lacking higher schools of any sort, and locked into the Turkish language that used the Arabic alphabet that inhibited wider learning.  A large number of ethnic and religious minorities were tolerated in their separate segregated domains called millets.<ref>Karen Barkey, and George Gavrilis, \"The Ottoman millet system: non-territorial autonomy and its contemporary legacy.\" ''Ethnopolitics'' 15.1 (2016): 24\u201342.</ref> They were primarily [[Ottoman Greeks|Greek]], [[Ottoman Armenians|Armenian]], or [[Ottoman Jews|Jewish]].  In each locality, they governed themselves, spoke their language, ran their schools, cultural and religious institutions, and paid somewhat higher taxes. They had no power outside the millet. The Imperial government protected them and prevented major violent clashes between ethnic groups. However, the millets showed very little loyalty to the Empire. Ethnic nationalism, based on distinctive religion and language, provided a centripetal force that eventually destroyed the Ottoman Empire.<ref>, Donald Quataert, ''Social Disintegration and Popular Resistance in the Ottoman Empire 1881\u20131908'' (1083)</ref> Also, Muslim ethnic groups, which were not part of the Millett system, especially the Arabs and the Kurds, were outside the Turkish culture and developed their separate nationalism. The British sponsored Arab nationalism in the First World War, promising an independent Arab state in return for Arab support.  Most Arabs supported the Sultan, but those near Mecca believed in and supported the British promise.<ref>, Youssef M. Choueiri, ''Arab Nationalism: A History: Nation and State in the Arab World'' (2001), pp. 56\u2013100.</ref>\n\nAt the local level, power was held beyond the control of the Sultan by the [[Ottoman Ayan|\"ayan\"]] or local notables. The ayan collected taxes, formed local armies to compete with other notables, took a reactionary attitude toward political or economic change, and often defied policies handed down by the Sultan.<ref>{{cite book|author=G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston and Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA64|year=2010|publisher=Infobase |page=64|isbn=9781438110257}}</ref>\n\nThe economic system made little progress. Printing was forbidden until the 18th century,  for fear of defiling the secret documents of Islam. The millets, however, were allowed their presses, using Greek, Hebrew, Armenian, and other languages that greatly facilitated nationalism. The religious prohibition on charging interest foreclosed most of the entrepreneurial skills among Muslims, although it did flourish among the Jews and Christians.\n\nAfter the 18th century, the Ottoman Empire was shrinking, as Russia put on heavy pressure and expanded to its south; Egypt became effectively independent in 1805, and the British later took it over, along with Cyprus. Greece became independent, and Serbia and other Balkan areas became highly restive as the force of nationalism pushed against imperialism.  The French took over Algeria and Tunisia. The  Europeans all thought that the empire was a sick man in rapid decline. Only the Germans seemed helpful, and their support led to the Ottoman Empire joining the central powers in 1915, with the result that they came out as one of the most massive losers of the First World War in 1918.<ref>Naci Yorulmaz, ''Arming the Sultan: German Arms Trade and Personal Diplomacy in the Ottoman Empire Before World War I'' (IB Tauris, 2014).</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Culture of the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}\n[[File:WaldmeierLebanon.gif|thumb|left|Depiction of a [[hookah]] shop in [[Lebanon]], Ottoman Empire]]\n\nThe Ottomans absorbed some of the traditions, art, and institutions of cultures in the regions they conquered and added new dimensions to them.

Poetry was by far the dominant stream. Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of fiction: there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], short story, or novel. Analog genres did exist, though, in both [[Turkish folk literature]] and in [[Divan poetry]].\n\nOttoman [[Divan poetry]] was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the [[Persian poetry]] that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships\u2014both of similitude (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0638\u064a\u0631 mura'\u00e2t-i naz\u00eer / \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628 ten\u00e2s\u00fcb) and opposition (\u062a\u0636\u0627\u062f tez\u00e2d) were more or less prescribed. Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either [[gazel]]s (which make up the most significant part of the repertoire of the tradition), or kas\u00eedes. There were, however, other common genres, most notably the mesnev\u00ee, a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the [[Leyli and Majnun]] of [[Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee]] and the [[H\u00fcsn \u00fc A\u015fk]] of [[\u015eeyh G\u00e2lib]].\n\n[[File:Nedim (divan edb.\u015fairi).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmet Ned\u00eem Efendi]], one of the most celebrated Ottoman poets]]\n\nUntil the 19th century, [[Prose of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman prose]] did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (\u0633\u062c\u0639, also transliterated as seci), or [[rhymed prose]],<ref>{{cite book |author=Murat Belge |title=Osmanl\u0131'da kurumlar ve k\u00fclt\u00fcr |year=2005 |publisher=\u0130stanbul Bilgi \u00dcniversitesi Yay\u0131nlar\u0131 |isbn=978-975-8998-03-6 |page=389}}</ref> a type of writing descended from the Arabic [[saj']] and which prescribed that between each adjective and [[noun]] in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]]. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional.

As a result, many of the same movements prevalent in France during this period also had their Ottoman equivalents. In the developing Ottoman prose tradition, for instance, the influence of [[Romanticism]] can be seen during the Tanzimat period, and that of the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] movements in subsequent periods; in the poetic tradition, on the other hand, it was the influence of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Parnassian poets|Parnassian]] movements that became paramount.\n\nMany of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously. For instance, the poet [[Nam\u0131k Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel \u0130ntib\u00e2h (\"Awakening\"), while the journalist [[\u0130brahim \u015einasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy \"\u015eair Evlenmesi\" (\"The Poet's Marriage\"). An earlier play, a [[farce]] entitled \"Vak\u00e2yi'-i 'Acibe ve Hav\u00e2dis-i Garibe-yi Kef\u015fger Ahmed\" (\"The Strange Events and Bizarre Occurrences of the Cobbler Ahmed\"), dates from the beginning of the 19th century. Still, there remains some doubt about its authenticity. In a similar vein, the novelist [[Ahmed Midhat Efendi]] wrote important novels in each of the major movements: Romanticism (Hasan Mell\u00e2h y\u00e2hud S\u0131rr \u0130\u00e7inde Esr\u00e2r, 1873; \"Hasan the Sailor, or The Mystery Within the Mystery\"), Realism (Hen\u00fcz On Yedi Ya\u015f\u0131nda, 1881; \"Just Seventeen Years Old\"), and Naturalism (M\u00fc\u015f\u00e2hed\u00e2t, 1891; \"Observations\"). This diversity was, in part, due to the Tanzimat writers' wish to disseminate as much of the new literature as possible, in the hopes that it would contribute to a revitalization of Ottoman [[social structure]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moran|first=Berna|title=T\u00fcrk Roman\u0131na Ele\u015ftirel Bir Bak\u0131\u015f Vol. 1|isbn=978-975-470-054-1|page=19|year=1997}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\n{{main|Media of the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Ottoman architecture}}\n[[File:Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace in 1862.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of the main entrance of [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]] in 1862, taken by [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]]]]\n\n[[Ottoman architecture]] was influenced by [[Persian Architecture|Persian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine Greek]] and [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectures. During the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Rise period]] (The early or first Ottoman architecture period), Ottoman art was in search of new ideas. The [[Growth of the Ottoman Empire|growth period]] of the Empire became the classical period of architecture when Ottoman art was at its most confident. During the years of the [[Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|Stagnation period]], Ottoman architecture moved away from this style, however.\n\n[[File:Bridge on the Drina July 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Mehmed Pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107 Bridge]], completed in 1577 by [[Mimar Sinan]], the most celebrated architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture]]\n\nDuring the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]], it was under the influence of the highly ornamented styles of Western Europe; [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Empire (style)|Empire]] and other styles intermingled. Concepts of Ottoman architecture concentrate mainly on the [[Mosque#Architecture|mosque]]. The mosque was integral to society, [[Urban planning|city planning]], and communal life. Besides the mosque, it is also possible to find good examples of Ottoman architecture in [[soup kitchen]]s, theological schools, hospitals, [[Turkish bath]]s, and tombs.\n\nExamples of Ottoman architecture of the classical period, besides Istanbul<!--Modern-day naming, so this OK--> and [[Edirne]]<!--Modern-day naming, so this OK-->, can also be seen in Egypt, Eritrea, Tunisia, Algiers, the Balkans, and Romania, where mosques, bridges, fountains, and schools were built. The art of Ottoman decoration developed with a multitude of influences due to the wide ethnic range of the Ottoman Empire. The greatest of the court artists enriched the Ottoman Empire with many pluralistic artistic influences, such as mixing traditional [[Byzantine art]] with elements of [[Chinese art]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Eli Shah |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |title=The Ottoman Artistic Legacy |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=26 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213131926/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/The%20Ottoman%20Artistic%20Legacy |archivedate=13 February 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Decorative arts ===\n[[File:Ottoman miniature painters.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman miniature painters]]\n\nThe tradition of [[Ottoman miniature]]s, painted to illustrate manuscripts or used in dedicated albums, was heavily influenced by the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] art form. However, it also included elements of the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of [[manuscript illumination|illumination]] and painting.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A Greek academy of painters, the ''Nakkashane-i-Rum'', was established in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in the 15th century, while early in the following century a similar Persian academy, the ''Nakkashane-i-Irani'', was added.\n\n[[Ottoman illumination]] covers non-figurative painted or drawn decorative art in books or on sheets in ''[[muraqqa]]'' or albums, as opposed to the symbolic images of the [[Ottoman miniature]]. It was a part of the Ottoman Book Arts together with the Ottoman miniature (''taswir''), calligraphy (''hat''), [[Islamic calligraphy]], bookbinding (''cilt'') and [[paper marbling]] (''ebru''). In the Ottoman Empire, [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated and illustrated manuscripts]] were commissioned by the Sultan or the administrators of the court. In Topkapi Palace, these manuscripts were created by the artists working in ''Nakkashane'', the atelier of the miniature and illumination artists. Both religious and non-religious books could be illuminated. Also, sheets for albums ''levha'' consisted of illuminated calligraphy (''hat'') of ''[[tughra]]'', religious texts, verses from poems or proverbs, and purely decorative drawings.\n\nThe art of carpet [[weaving]] was particularly significant in the Ottoman Empire, carpets having an immense importance both as decorative furnishings, rich in religious and other symbolism and as a practical consideration, as it was customary to remove one's shoes in living quarters.<ref name=\"foroqhi\">{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire|year=2005|publisher=I.B.

Turks used carpets, rugs, and [[kilim]]s not just on the floors of a room but also as a hanging on walls and doorways, where they provided additional insulation. They were also commonly donated to [[mosques]], which often amassed large collections of them.<ref name=\"foroqhip153\">{{cite book |last=Faroqhi |first=Suraiya |title=Subjects of the Sultan: culture and daily life in the Ottoman Empire |edition=New |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.

A number of the Ottoman sultans have accomplished musicians and composers themselves, such as [[Selim III]], whose compositions are often still performed today. Ottoman classical music arose largely from a confluence of [[Byzantine music]], [[Armenian music]], [[Arabic music]], and [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. Compositionally, it is organized around rhythmic units called [[Usul (music)|usul]], which are somewhat similar to [[Metre (music)|meter]] in Western music, and [[Melody|melodic]] units called [[makam]], which bear some resemblance to Western [[musical mode]]s.\n\nThe [[Musical instrument|instruments]] used are a mixture of Anatolian and Central Asian instruments (the [[baglama|saz]], the [[Baglama|ba\u011flama]], the [[Kemenche|kemence]]), other Middle Eastern instruments (the [[Oud|ud]], the [[tanbur]], the [[Qanun (instrument)|kanun]], the [[ney]]), and\u2014later in the tradition\u2014Western instruments (the violin and the piano). Because of a geographic and cultural divide between the capital and other areas, two broadly distinct styles of music arose in the Ottoman Empire: Ottoman classical music and folk music. In the provinces, several different kinds of [[folk music]] were created. The most dominant regions with their distinguished musical styles are Balkan-Thracian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, North-Eastern ([[Laz people|Laz]]) T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Aegean T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Central Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, Eastern Anatolian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs, and Caucasian T\u00fcrk\u00fcs. Some of the distinctive styles were: [[Ottoman military band|Janissary Music]], [[Roma music]], [[Belly dance]], [[Turkish folk music]].\n\nThe traditional [[shadow play]] called [[Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat]] was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire and featured characters representing all of the major ethnic and social groups in that culture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Karag\u00f6z and Hacivat, a Turkish shadow play |publisher=All About Turkey |date=20 November 2006 |url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/karagoz.htm |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Emin \u015eenyer |title=Karagoz, Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre |publisher=Karagoz.net |url=http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm |accessdate=11 February 2013}}</ref> It was performed by a single puppet master, who voiced all of the characters, and accompanied by [[tambourine]] (''def'').

This diverse cuisine was honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the Empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. The creations of the Ottoman Palace's kitchens filtered to the population, for instance through [[Ramadan]] events, and through the cooking at the [[Yal\u0131]]s of the [[Pasha]]s, and from there on spread to the rest of the population.\n\nMuch of the cuisine of former Ottoman territories today is descended from a shared Ottoman cuisine, especially [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], and including [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] cuisines.<ref name=\"Fragner\">Bert Fragner, \"From the Caucasus to the Roof of the World: a culinary adventure\", in Sami Zubaida and Richard Tapper, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London, [[Prague]] and New York, p. 52</ref> Many common dishes in the region, descendants of the once-common Ottoman cuisine, include [[yogurt]], [[d\u00f6ner kebab]]/[[Gyro (food)|gyro]]/[[shawarma]], [[cac\u0131k]]/tzatziki, [[ayran]], [[pita]] bread, [[feta]] cheese, [[baklava]], [[lahmacun]], [[moussaka]], [[yuvarlak]], [[k\u00f6fte]]/keft\u00e9s/kofta, [[b\u00f6rek]]/boureki, [[rak\u0131]]/[[rakia]]/[[tsipouro]]/[[tsikoudia]], [[meze]], [[dolma]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], rice [[pilaf]], [[Turkish coffee]], [[sujuk]], [[kashk]], [[ke\u015fkek]], [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[lavash]], [[kanafeh]], and more.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{Main|Science, and technology in the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Ottoman Imperial Museum (Today- Istanbul Archaeology Museums).jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman Imperial Museum, today the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]]]]\n\nThroughout Ottoman history, the Ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures, as well as original manuscripts.<ref name=\"\u00c1goston and Alan Masters583\"/> A great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century.

As a youth level coach for Argentina, he won the [[FIFA World Youth Championship]] three times, and the U20 [[South American Youth Championship]] twice. He coached the [[Argentina national football team]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and became coach of the [[Colombian national football team|Colombian national team]] in 2012. He subsequently managed the Colombian national team during the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups where he led the team to their best result in 2014.\n\n==Player career==\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Pekerman Deportivo Toluca 2007.jpg|thumb|Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman in 2007]]\nP\u00e9kerman's career as a footballer was uneventful. A [[midfielder]], he played from 1970 to 1974 for [[Argentinos Juniors]] scoring 12 goals in 134 matches. He was transferred to [[Independiente Medell\u00edn]], in Colombia, where he scored 15 goals in 101 matches.\n\nHis player days ended at age 28 with a serious knee injury. P\u00e9kerman supported himself and his family with various odd jobs, including a stint as a taxi driver.{{CN|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Coaching career==\n===Youth coaching===\nBack in Argentina, P\u00e9kerman worked as a youth coach for [[Chacarita Juniors]] and then occupied the same position with [[Argentinos Juniors]]. He then moved to Chile to coach [[Colo-Colo]]'s youth divisions.\n\nIn 1994, he was offered to coach the Argentina national under-20 and under-17 sides by the [[Argentine Football Association]]. This caused some surprise as his [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]] did not include any major achievements at this stage. He teamed up with [[Hugo Tocalli]] and coach Eduardo Urtasun.\n\nP\u00e9kerman's success, however, silenced the critics: his under-20 team won the [[FIFA World Youth Championship]] three times, [[1995 FIFA World Youth Championship|1995]] (Qatar), [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship|1997]] (Malaysia), and [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship|2001]] (Argentina), thus giving the names to his three pet dogs - Qatar, Malaysia and Argentina. The team also won the two [[South American Youth Championship]]s in 1997 and 1999.\n\nWhen the national coach [[Daniel Passarella]] resigned after the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], P\u00e9kerman was offered his position. He declined, assuming instead the position of general manager of all national teams. [[Marcelo Bielsa]] was hired as coach on P\u00e9kerman's recommendation, and remained in charge until after Argentina's gold medal performance in the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn 2003, P\u00e9kerman moved to Spain at the behest of Argentine businessman [[Daniel Grinbank]], who had acquired [[Spanish Second Division]] side [[CD Legan\u00e9s]]. After a few months serving as director of football, the project crumbled and P\u00e9kerman left Spain.\n\nWhen Marcelo Bielsa resigned as coach, P\u00e9kerman was one of the two candidates for the coaching job, alongside [[Carlos Bianchi]], who had left [[Boca Juniors]] a few months earlier, and wanted to take a [[sabbatical|sabbatical year]] away from football.\n\n===World Cup 2006===\nOn 15 September 2004, P\u00e9kerman was named coach of the [[Argentina national football team]], which qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. The nation dominated its initial two group stage matches and drew with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the third match, emerging on top of their group on goal difference. The ''Albicelestes'' then moved on to the round of 16, beating [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 2\u20131 [[overtime (sports)|after extra time]] in a comeback victory.\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Argentina went ahead 1\u20130 against hosts [[Germany national football team|Germany]], but shortly before the end of the match, Germany equalised through a [[Miroslav Klose]] header. Germany would go on to win on penalties, sending Argentina out of the tournament. P\u00e9kerman made defensive substitutions, including taking off [[Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme]] for [[Esteban Cambiasso]], and after the loss, announced his resignation. [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA) President [[Julio Grondona]] tried to dissuade P\u00e9kerman from leaving, but it was later announced that [[Alfio Basile]], who had previously coached Argentina during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], would replace him as coach.\n\n===Post-World Cup===\nOn 30 May 2007, P\u00e9kerman resumed his coaching career, taking up the position of head coach of [[Club Toluca]] in Mexico, replacing fellow Argentine [[Am\u00e9rico Gallego]]. At the end of the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Clausura 2008|Clausura 2008 tournament]], he was replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Torre]].\n\nOn 23 February 2009, P\u00e9kerman was appointed as the head coach of [[UANL Tigres]] after the sacking of [[Manuel Lapuente]] following a series of bad results. After the end of [[2009 Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Clausura|Clausura 2009]], however, he was terminated and replaced by [[Daniel Guzm\u00e1n]].\n\nIn July 2010, it had been reported that P\u00e9kerman was in serious talks with the [[Australia national association football team|Australian national team]], as well as talks with the [[Japan national football team|Japanese national team]] about taking over the role as senior manager following the resignation of their managers.\n\n===2014 World Cup cycle and becoming coach of Colombia===\nIn January 2012, P\u00e9kerman became the new coach of the [[Colombian national football team|Colombian national team]], replacing ousted coach [[Leonel \u00c1lvarez (footballer, born 1965)|Leonel \u00c1lvarez]]. P\u00e9kerman was the third coach of the Colombian team during the South American World Cup qualifiers; before \u00c1lvarez, [[Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo G\u00f3mez]] was at the helm. For his first match, a friendly against Mexico, P\u00e9kerman impressed, with the Colombians completely taking control of the friendly in an eventual 2\u20130 victory. In his first [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualifying]] match for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], a struggling Colombia managed to win 0\u20131 over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] in [[Lima]]. P\u00e9kerman, however, was criticized for using a long-range style of play rather than a close midfield passing control. This resulted in a weak Colombian side that lost to [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] 1\u20130 away from home, his first loss.\n\nIn his home debut, P\u00e9kerman orchestrated an astonishing comeback as Colombia demolished [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] champions [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 4\u20130 in the seventh round of World Cup qualifiers. Under his direction, Colombia also won 1\u20133 away over [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and 2\u20130 over [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] at home in [[Barranquilla]]. A few days later, P\u00e9kerman experimented without many star players such as [[Radamel Falcao]] and [[James Rodr\u00edguez]] against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], resulting in a comfortable 3\u20130 home victory. For the last match of 2012, Colombia drew 2014 World Cup hosts [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 1\u20131 despite missing two of the squad's star players.\n\nIn the opening match of 2013, P\u00e9kerman experimented yet again, this time against the [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]] side; he used only substitutes in a 4\u20131 victory, opting not to deploy senior stars, including Radamel Falcao. During the next round of qualifiers, P\u00e9kerman continued with the promising 4\u20132\u20132\u20132 formation that facilitated Colombia's comfortable defeat of [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in a 5\u20130 home victory. P\u00e9kerman, however, decided to use a different formation in the match, 4\u20134\u20131\u20131, which led to a shocking 1\u20130 away loss to neighbours [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]]. He was heavily criticized for experimenting with his side's formation, a loss that took the nation from second to third place in the qualifying table. In the match against his home nation Argentina, P\u00e9kerman changed the lineup and formation to better \"deal\" with the South American giants, which led to a hard-fought 0\u20130 draw. Despite this, P\u00e9kerman was again questioned with his lineup choices.<ref>{{cite web|author=Featured Columnist |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1666131-argentina-vs-colombia-6-things-we-learned-from-world-cup-qualifer/page/5 |title=Argentina vs. Colombia: 6 Things We Learned from World Cup Qualifier |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter Colombia qualified for the 2014 World Cup after a 3\u20133 home draw against Chile, P\u00e9kerman expressed his joy for helping Colombia return to the World Cup for the first time in 16 years, considering it to be \"one of the greatest joys in his life.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Diego |first=Juan |url=http://comutricolor.com/una-de-las-mayores-alegrias-de-mi-vida-pekerman/ |title=\"Es una de las mayores alegr\u00edas de mi vida\": Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman |publisher=ComuTricolor.com |date= |accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref> Following Colombia's qualification, P\u00e9kerman received Colombian citizenship from [[Juan Manuel Santos]], the [[president of Colombia]].<ref name=\"comutricolor1\">{{cite web|author=webmaster |url=http://comutricolor.com/jose-pekerman-nacionalidad-colombiana/ |title=Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman ser\u00e1 nacionalizado colombiano |publisher=ComuTricolor.com |date= |accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nColombia won all three of its group matches (scoring nine goals and conceding only two) and went on to defeat Uruguay in the Round of 16 before losing to the host nation of Brazil in the quarter-finals. In August 2014, P\u00e9kerman extended his contract with Colombia until 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2728906/Jose-Pekerman-signs-new-four-year-deal-stay-Colombia-manager.html|title=Pekerman signs new four-year deal to stay on as Colombia manager|work=Mail Online|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nFor the second consecutive time, P\u00e9kerman qualified Colombia for the [[FIFA World Cup]] this time for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 edition]] in Russia. Colombia suffered a controversial defeat in their first group stage game against a well organized and determined Japan, but then came out much stronger to inflict a 3-0 victory over Poland (effectively knocking them out of the tournament in the process). After beating Senegal 1-0 in the last game of the group stage, Colombia moved to the round of 16 as first in their group. After a bitter and contested match, Colombia lost on penalties to England.\n\n==Honours==\n===Manager===\n;Argentina U20\n*[[South American Youth Championship]]: [[1997 South American U-20 Championship|1997]], [[1999 South American U-20 Championship|1999]]; Runner-up [[1995 South American U-20 Championship|1995]], [[2001 South American U-20 Championship|2001]]\n*[[FIFA U-20 World Cup]]: [[1995 FIFA World Youth Championship|1995]], [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship|1997]],  [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship|2001]]\n\n;Argentina\n[[FIFA Confederations Cup]]: Runner-up [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup|2005]]\n\n===Individual===\n* South American Coach of the Year (3): 2012, 2013, 2014 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2014/1/1/jose-pekerman-mejor-sudamerica-759299.asp |title=Jos\u00e9 Pekerman, el mejor DT de Sudam\u00e9rica - M\u00e1s Deportes - Diario Los Andes |publisher=Losandes.com.ar |date= |accessdate=12 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405004221/http://losandes.com.ar/notas/2014/1/1/jose-pekerman-mejor-sudamerica-759299.asp |archive-date=5 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* IFFHS Best National Coach of the Year Nominee (1): 2013 (5th) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ke/news/4500/main/2014/01/28/4575364/scolari-named-among-elite-coaches |title=Scolari named among elite coaches |publisher=Goal.com |date=28 January 2014 |accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Management style and legacy==\nP\u00e9kerman is known for his tactical management style, often selecting the players that fit his style of coaching, regardless of how talented a player is. P\u00e9kerman can make controversial selections with line-ups against certain teams.

({{IPA-es|xo\u02c8se \u02c8pekerman}}; born 3 September 1949) is an Argentine-Colombian professional [[Association football|football]] coach and former manager of [[Colombia national football team|the Colombian national football team]]. As a youth level coach for Argentina, he won the [[FIFA World Youth Championship]] three times, and the U20 [[South American Youth Championship]] twice. He coached the [[Argentina national football team]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and became coach of the [[Colombian national football team|Colombian national team]] in 2012. He subsequently managed the Colombian national team during the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups where he led the team to their best result in 2014.\n\n==Player career==\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Pekerman Deportivo Toluca 2007.jpg|thumb|Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman in 2007]]\nP\u00e9kerman's career as a footballer was uneventful. A [[midfielder]], he played from 1970 to 1974 for [[Argentinos Juniors]] scoring 12 goals in 134 matches. He was transferred to [[Independiente Medell\u00edn]], in Colombia, where he scored 15 goals in 101 matches.\n\nHis player days ended at age 28 with a serious knee injury. P\u00e9kerman supported himself and his family with various odd jobs, including a stint as a taxi driver.{{CN|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Coaching career==\n===Youth coaching===\nBack in Argentina, P\u00e9kerman worked as a youth coach for [[Chacarita Juniors]] and then occupied the same position with [[Argentinos Juniors]]. He then moved to Chile to coach [[Colo-Colo]]'s youth divisions.\n\nIn 1994, he was offered to coach the Argentina national under-20 and under-17 sides by the [[Argentine Football Association]]. This caused some surprise as his [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]] did not include any major achievements at this stage. He teamed up with [[Hugo Tocalli]] and coach Eduardo Urtasun.\n\nP\u00e9kerman's success, however, silenced the critics: his under-20 team won the [[FIFA World Youth Championship]] three times, [[1995 FIFA World Youth Championship|1995]] (Qatar), [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship|1997]] (Malaysia), and [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship|2001]] (Argentina), thus giving the names to his three pet dogs - Qatar, Malaysia and Argentina. The team also won the two [[South American Youth Championship]]s in 1997 and 1999.\n\nWhen the national coach [[Daniel Passarella]] resigned after the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], P\u00e9kerman was offered his position. He declined, assuming instead the position of general manager of all national teams. [[Marcelo Bielsa]] was hired as coach on P\u00e9kerman's recommendation, and remained in charge until after Argentina's gold medal performance in the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn 2003, P\u00e9kerman moved to Spain at the behest of Argentine businessman [[Daniel Grinbank]], who had acquired [[Spanish Second Division]] side [[CD Legan\u00e9s]]. After a few months serving as director of football, the project crumbled and P\u00e9kerman left Spain.\n\nWhen Marcelo Bielsa resigned as coach, P\u00e9kerman was one of the two candidates for the coaching job, alongside [[Carlos Bianchi]], who had left [[Boca Juniors]] a few months earlier, and wanted to take a [[sabbatical|sabbatical year]] away from football.\n\n===World Cup 2006===\nOn 15 September 2004, P\u00e9kerman was named coach of the [[Argentina national football team]], which qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. The nation dominated its initial two group stage matches and drew with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the third match, emerging on top of their group on goal difference. The ''Albicelestes'' then moved on to the round of 16, beating [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 2\u20131 [[overtime (sports)|after extra time]] in a comeback victory.\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Argentina went ahead 1\u20130 against hosts [[Germany national football team|Germany]], but shortly before the end of the match, Germany equalised through a [[Miroslav Klose]] header. Germany would go on to win on penalties, sending Argentina out of the tournament. P\u00e9kerman made defensive substitutions, including taking off [[Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme]] for [[Esteban Cambiasso]], and after the loss, announced his resignation. [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA) President [[Julio Grondona]] tried to dissuade P\u00e9kerman from leaving, but it was later announced that [[Alfio Basile]], who had previously coached Argentina during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], would replace him as coach.\n\n===Post-World Cup===\nOn 30 May 2007, P\u00e9kerman resumed his coaching career, taking up the position of head coach of [[Club Toluca]] in Mexico, replacing fellow Argentine [[Am\u00e9rico Gallego]]. At the end of the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Clausura 2008|Clausura 2008 tournament]], he was replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Torre]].\n\nOn 23 February 2009, P\u00e9kerman was appointed as the head coach of [[UANL Tigres]] after the sacking of [[Manuel Lapuente]] following a series of bad results. After the end of [[2009 Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Clausura|Clausura 2009]], however, he was terminated and replaced by [[Daniel Guzm\u00e1n]].\n\nIn July 2010, it had been reported that P\u00e9kerman was in serious talks with the [[Australia national association football team|Australian national team]], as well as talks with the [[Japan national football team|Japanese national team]] about taking over the role as senior manager following the resignation of their managers.\n\n===2014 World Cup cycle and becoming coach of Colombia===\nIn January 2012, P\u00e9kerman became the new coach of the [[Colombian national football team|Colombian national team]], replacing ousted coach [[Leonel \u00c1lvarez (footballer, born 1965)|Leonel \u00c1lvarez]]. P\u00e9kerman was the third coach of the Colombian team during the South American World Cup qualifiers; before \u00c1lvarez, [[Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo G\u00f3mez]] was at the helm. For his first match, a friendly against Mexico, P\u00e9kerman impressed, with the Colombians completely taking control of the friendly in an eventual 2\u20130 victory. In his first [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualifying]] match for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], a struggling Colombia managed to win 0\u20131 over [[Peru national football team|Peru]] in [[Lima]]. P\u00e9kerman, however, was criticized for using a long-range style of play rather than a close midfield passing control. This resulted in a weak Colombian side that lost to [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] 1\u20130 away from home, his first loss.\n\nIn his home debut, P\u00e9kerman orchestrated an astonishing comeback as Colombia demolished [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] champions [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 4\u20130 in the seventh round of World Cup qualifiers. Under his direction, Colombia also won 1\u20133 away over [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and 2\u20130 over [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] at home in [[Barranquilla]]. A few days later, P\u00e9kerman experimented without many star players such as [[Radamel Falcao]] and [[James Rodr\u00edguez]] against [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]], resulting in a comfortable 3\u20130 home victory. For the last match of 2012, Colombia drew 2014 World Cup hosts [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 1\u20131 despite missing two of the squad's star players.\n\nIn the opening match of 2013, P\u00e9kerman experimented yet again, this time against the [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]] side; he used only substitutes in a 4\u20131 victory, opting not to deploy senior stars, including Radamel Falcao. During the next round of qualifiers, P\u00e9kerman continued with the promising 4\u20132\u20132\u20132 formation that facilitated Colombia's comfortable defeat of [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in a 5\u20130 home victory. P\u00e9kerman, however, decided to use a different formation in the match, 4\u20134\u20131\u20131, which led to a shocking 1\u20130 away loss to neighbours [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]]. He was heavily criticized for experimenting with his side's formation, a loss that took the nation from second to third place in the qualifying table. In the match against his home nation Argentina, P\u00e9kerman changed the lineup and formation to better \"deal\" with the South American giants, which led to a hard-fought 0\u20130 draw. Despite this, P\u00e9kerman was again questioned with his lineup choices.<ref>{{cite web|author=Featured Columnist |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1666131-argentina-vs-colombia-6-things-we-learned-from-world-cup-qualifer/page/5 |title=Argentina vs. Colombia: 6 Things We Learned from World Cup Qualifier |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter Colombia qualified for the 2014 World Cup after a 3\u20133 home draw against Chile, P\u00e9kerman expressed his joy for helping Colombia return to the World Cup for the first time in 16 years, considering it to be \"one of the greatest joys in his life.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Diego |first=Juan |url=http://comutricolor.com/una-de-las-mayores-alegrias-de-mi-vida-pekerman/ |title=\"Es una de las mayores alegr\u00edas de mi vida\": Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman |publisher=ComuTricolor.com |date= |accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref> Following Colombia's qualification, P\u00e9kerman received Colombian citizenship from [[Juan Manuel Santos]], the [[president of Colombia]].<ref name=\"comutricolor1\">{{cite web|author=webmaster |url=http://comutricolor.com/jose-pekerman-nacionalidad-colombiana/ |title=Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman ser\u00e1 nacionalizado colombiano |publisher=ComuTricolor.com |date= |accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nColombia won all three of its group matches (scoring nine goals and conceding only two) and went on to defeat Uruguay in the Round of 16 before losing to the host nation of Brazil in the quarter-finals. In August 2014, P\u00e9kerman extended his contract with Colombia until 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2728906/Jose-Pekerman-signs-new-four-year-deal-stay-Colombia-manager.html|title=Pekerman signs new four-year deal to stay on as Colombia manager|work=Mail Online|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nFor the second consecutive time, P\u00e9kerman qualified Colombia for the [[FIFA World Cup]] this time for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 edition]] in Russia. Colombia suffered a controversial defeat in their first group stage game against a well organized and determined Japan, but then came out much stronger to inflict a 3-0 victory over Poland (effectively knocking them out of the tournament in the process). After beating Senegal 1-0 in the last game of the group stage, Colombia moved to the round of 16 as first in their group. After a bitter and contested match, Colombia lost on penalties to England.\n\n==Honours==\n===Manager===\n;Argentina U20\n*[[South American Youth Championship]]: [[1997 South American U-20 Championship|1997]], [[1999 South American U-20 Championship|1999]]; Runner-up [[1995 South American U-20 Championship|1995]], [[2001 South American U-20 Championship|2001]]\n*[[FIFA U-20 World Cup]]: [[1995 FIFA World Youth Championship|1995]], [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship|1997]],  [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship|2001]]\n\n;Argentina\n[[FIFA Confederations Cup]]: Runner-up [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup|2005]]\n\n===Individual===\n* South American Coach of the Year (3): 2012, 2013, 2014 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2014/1/1/jose-pekerman-mejor-sudamerica-759299.asp |title=Jos\u00e9 Pekerman, el mejor DT de Sudam\u00e9rica - M\u00e1s Deportes - Diario Los Andes |publisher=Losandes.com.ar |date= |accessdate=12 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405004221/http://losandes.com.ar/notas/2014/1/1/jose-pekerman-mejor-sudamerica-759299.asp |archive-date=5 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* IFFHS Best National Coach of the Year Nominee (1): 2013 (5th) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ke/news/4500/main/2014/01/28/4575364/scolari-named-among-elite-coaches |title=Scolari named among elite coaches |publisher=Goal.com |date=28 January 2014 |accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Management style and legacy==\nP\u00e9kerman is known for his tactical management style, often selecting the players that fit his style of coaching, regardless of how talented a player is. P\u00e9kerman can make controversial selections with line-ups against certain teams. He experimented heavily with the Argentinean youth squads when he was coaching them.\n\nBefore the 2006 World Cup began, P\u00e9kerman made the controversial decision to drop established defenders [[Javier Zanetti]] and [[Walter Samuel]]. When Argentina was eliminated by Germany in the quarter-finals, his substitution decision caused storms of criticism, as well. Despite the dramatic loss, P\u00e9kerman was still hailed by many fans and press as a very effective coach and the \"P\u00e9kerman Era\" is regarded as one that brought a lot of pride to the country.{{cn|date=July 2018}} His team lost its temper after the elimination and instigated a huge brawl, which was believed to be a major factor in his resignation.\n\n==Managerial statistics==\n:''Statistics accurate as of 12 September 2018''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://es.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=40510/index.html|title=Torneos FIFA Jugadores y Entrenadores - Jos\u00e9 P\u00c9KERMAN|website=FIFA.com|language=es-ES|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/kolumbien-team/21/|title=Colombia - Historical results|website=worldfootball.net|language=en-GB|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/argentinien-team/21/|title=Argentina - Historical results|website=worldfootball.net|language=en-GB|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arg-intres-pekerman.html|title=Argentina - International Matches in Era Pekerman 2004-2006|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arg-u23-intres.html|title=U-23 ARGENTINA NATIONAL TEAM - Matches & Statistics 1937-2008|last=Pelayes|first=H\u00e9ctor Dar\u00edo|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/argentinien-u20-h-team/21/|title=Argentina [U20] - Historical results|website=worldfootball.net|language=en-GB|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.football-lineups.com/coach/1337/|title=Jose Nestor Pekerman - Football Coach|website=Football-Lineups|language=en|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Team\n!rowspan=\"2\"|From\n!rowspan=\"2\"|To\n! colspan=\"5\" |Record\n|-\n!P!!W!!D!!L!!Win %\n|-\n|[[Argentina national under-17 football team|Argentina U17]]\n|align=left|May 1995\n|align=left|September 1997\n{{WDL|23|15|3|5}}\n|-\n|[[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina U20]]\n|align=left|January 1995\n|align=left|December 2001\n{{WDL|58|42|8|8}}\n|-\n|[[Argentina national under-23 football team|Argentina U23]]\n|align=left|September 1999\n|align=left|February 2000\n{{WDL|15|8|3|4}}\n|-\n|[[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]\n|align=left|October 2004\n|align=left|June 2006\n{{WDL|27|14|7|6}}\n|-\n|[[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]]\n|align=left|August 2007\n|align=left|May 2008\n{{WDL|41|18|14|9}}\n|-\n|[[Tigres UANL]]\n|align=left|March 2009\n|align=left|May 2009\n{{WDL|10|1|5|4}}\n|-\n|[[Colombia national football team|Colombia]]\n|align=left|February 2012\n|align=left|August 2018\n{{WDL|77|42|20|15}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Total\n{{WDLtot|251|140|60|51}}\n|}\n\n==Personal life==\nP\u00e9kerman was born in [[Villa Dom\u00ednguez]], [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre R\u00edos]].

He is regarded as a pioneering moderniser of Orthodox Judaism in Germany and as a founder of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:HildesheimerStreetJerusalem.jpg|thumb|200px|A street in Jerusalem named after Hildesheimer.]]\n\nHildesheimer was born in [[Halberstadt]], [[Province of Saxony]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the son of Rabbi [[L\u00f6b Glee Hildesheimer]], a native of [[Hildesheim]], [[Electorate of Hanover]], a city near [[Hanover]]. He attended the ''Hasharat Zvi'' school in Halberstadt, and, from age seventeen, the [[Yeshiva]] of Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]] in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]];  ''[[hakham|Chacham]]'' [[Isaac Bernays]] was one of his teachers and his model as a [[maggid|preacher]].  While studying in yeshiva Hildesheimer also studied [[classical languages]]. In 1840 he returned to Halberstadt, took his [[matriculation|diploma]] at the public K\u00f6nigliches [[Cathedral#Designation|Dom]]-[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], and entered the [[University of Berlin]]; he became a disciple of the dominant [[Hegel]]ian school. He studied [[Semitic languages]] and [[mathematics]], and continued his study in [[Talmud]].  In 1842 he went to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle upon Saale]] where he earned his doctorate from the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle-Wittenberg]] in 1844 under [[Wilhelm Gesenius]] and [[Emil R\u00f6diger]] (''{{lang|de|Ueber die rechte Art der Bibelinterpretation}}'', English: ''On the Right Kind of Bible Interpretation''). He then returned to Halberstadt, where he married Henrietta Hirsch, whose dowry made them financially independent.\n\nIn 1851 he became [[Rabbi]] of [[Eisenstadt]] (Kis Marton), [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538\u20131867)|Hungary]] (now located in [[Austria]]); the principal city of the [[Siebengemeinden]] or ''Sheva kehillot''. His first notable act there was to found a [[parochial school]], where correct [[German language|German]] was used, and modern principles of [[pedagogy]] were adopted in teaching [[Secular education|secular]], as well as Jewish, subjects. Hildesheimer initially introduced limited secular studies in the elementary school; the older students received a secular education as well, but with a focus on [[mathematics]] and other subjects that would enhance their understanding of [[gemara]].\n\nNext, Hildesheimer established a [[Yeshiva]]. The Yeshiva was unusual in that it was the only Orthodox institution where students were required to have a significant secular education before they were admitted. Also, the curriculum devoted time to studying [[Tanakh|Tanach]] and the [[Hebrew language]]. Despite this approach, within a few years the Yeshiva attracted a large number of pupils. (After beginning with six students in 1851, the seminary had 128 students in 1868, including one from the [[United States]].) His son, Hirsch Hildesheimer, was a professor there.\n\nIn 1869 the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox minority]] in [[Berlin]] was granted government permission to found a separate Orthodox synagogal congregation, the [[Israelitische Synagogen-Gemeinde Adass Jisroel zu Berlin]]<ref>Adass Jisroel (= adas yissro'el) renders the Yiddish articulation of the Hebrew name in Latin letters according to their German pronunciation.</ref> (Israelite Synagogal Congregation of Adass Yisroel [\u05e2\u05d3\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc] in Berlin; extant from 1869 to 1939, and again since 1989), then comprising about 200 families. They were dissatisfied with Rabbi [[Joseph Aub (rabbi)|Joseph Aub]], appointed in 1867 by the ''J\u00fcdische Gemeinde zu Berlin'' (till 1869 the only Jewish congregation in Berlin). Adass Jisroel chose Hildesheimer to represent them as an \"Orthodox rabbi of standing\". Here, he similarly established a religious school and a [[yeshiva]] (''Rabbinerseminar f\u00fcr das orthodoxe Judenthum in Berlin'' 1873\u20131880, then the name was shortened to ''Rabbiner-Seminar zu Berlin'', known as the [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary]]), which immediately attracted thirty former pupils. Hildesheimer was thus the real intellectual founder and leader of the ''Adass Jisroel'' congregation.\n\nAided by [[Mayer Lehmann]], the editor of ''Israelit'' in [[Mainz]] (Mayence), Hildesheimer \"exerted his whole energy\" in the fight against [[Reform Judaism]]. In 1861 he took his stand against [[Abraham Geiger]] by criticising Geiger, ''Die Geiger'sche Brosch\u00fcre Notwendigkeit und Maass einer Reform des j\u00fcdischen Gottesdienstes'' (under the name variant Israel Hildesheimer, Mayence: Verlag der Le Roux'schen Hofbuchhandlung, 1861). (In fact, as early as 1847\u2014as the representative of the communities in the [[Magdeburg]] district\u2014he had energetically opposed the Reform attempts of [[Ludwig Philippson]].)\n\nHildesheimer was \"simple in his habits and fearless\"; he had an unusual capacity for work; and his great Talmudic learning \"was joined to practical administrative ability\". He was financially independent, and never accepted remuneration for his rabbinical activity. He was frequently engaged in philanthropic activities connected with his own congregation, but additionally, \"no labor was too great and no journey too long for him\" in the service of the Jews of Germany, Austria, Russia, and even [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] and [[Persian Empire|Persia]], so that he came to be known as the \"international [[schnorrer (Yiddish)|schnorrer]]\". Hildesheimer also took a special interest in the welfare of the [[Palestinian Jews|Jews of Palestine]]. In 1860, when the [[missionary]] society of Palestine provided seventy free dwellings for homeless Jews, Hildesheimer himself built houses in [[Jerusalem]] for the free use of Jewish pilgrims and for the poor.\n\nHildesheimer died in [[Berlin]] on 12 July 1899.

Engel, 1890).\n\n==Modernisation within Orthodoxy==\nHildesheimer is regarded as a pioneering \"Moderniser\" of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in Germany. He was insistent that for Orthodox Jews living in the [[Western world|West]], there was no possibility to segregate oneself behind ghetto walls. On the contrary, he felt that modern Jewish education must teach Jews how best to confront and deal with modernity in all of its aspects [http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/%2FTU9%5FShapiro%2Epdf].\n\nHis firm conviction that traditional Judaism need have no fear of the light of [[European culture]] determined his attitude and his activity in Hungary and Germany from the start, and gave him a definite aim. In an address delivered at his rabbinical seminary and defining his position he said:\n\n{{cquote|Unconditional agreement with the culture of the present day; harmony between Judaism and science; but also unconditional steadfastness in the faith and traditions of Judaism: these constitute the program of the New Community, the standard round which gather the Israelites of Berlin who are faithful to the Law.}}\n\nHe thus undertook a variety of actions which render him a \"modern\" activist and institution-builder. The most important of these, as discussed above, are:\n# Jewish education for males and females which included both religious and secular studies.\n# The [[Yeshiva|seminary]] which incorporated not only secular studies but academic scholarship.\n# Maintaining traditional Jewish attachments to the [[Land of Israel]] and working with the non-Orthodox on its behalf.\n# Working with communal leaders, even non-Orthodox ones, on issues that affected the community, such as anti-Semitism and ritual slaughtering.\n\n===Orthodox opposition===\nThe introduction into the Eisenstadt School of modern methods of education and of secular learning was resented by the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]. (Hildesheimer's \"liberal tendencies and sympathy with modern culture\" soon changed this resentment \"to positive antipathy\".) Eventually his Yeshiva was denounced before the representatives of the government at [[Oedenburg]], the result being that the Hungarian government ordered the school closed within twenty-four hours and the pupils removed from the city. Soon afterward (in 1858), however, Hildesheimer succeeded in obtaining state recognition for the Yeshiva. Interestingly, the Yeshiva also had opponents on the left: Reform saw it as a threat because its graduates would be equipped to defend Orthodoxy against Reform's inroads. In 1860, the zealot [[Akiva Yosef Schlesinger]] placed Hildesheimer under a ban as \"not truly a sincere Jew\" (\"''emessdiger J\u00fcd''\").  Hildesheimer, however, seems to have cared little for the ban.\n\nAt the Hungarian Jewish Congress of 14 December 1868, Hildesheimer at first endeavored to associate himself with the existing Orthodox party. When the impossibility of this union became evident, he formed a separate group, with thirty-five followers, which has been described as \"Cultured Orthodox\". In the Hungarian Jewish Congress held at Budapest in 1869 he defined this party as representing a \"faithful adherence to traditional teachings combined with an effective effort to keep in touch with the spirit of progress\".\n\n==See also==\n*[[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]\n*[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]]\n*[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]\n*[[Torah Umadda]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |first=David Henry |last=Ellenson |title=Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer and the creation of a modern Jewish orthodoxy |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |publisher=Univ. of Alabama Press |year=1990 |series=Judaic studies series |isbn=0-8173-0485-1 }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Internet Archive author |sname=Azriel Hildesheimer}}\n*{{Commonscat-inline|Esriel Hildesheimer}}\n*[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=725&letter=H Hildesheimer, Israel (Azriel)], jewishencyclopedia.com\n*[http://judaism.org/learning/hamaayan/5762/korach.html Rabbi Dr. Esriel Hildesheimer z\"l: part 1]; [http://www.torah.org/learning/hamaayan/5762/pinchas.html part 2], hamaayan\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050306042702/http://www.jewishhistory.org.il/1820.htm Azriel Hildesheimer], jewishhistory.org.il\n*[http://www.yutorah.org/_shiurim/%2FTU9%5FShapiro%2Epdf Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer's Program of Torah u-Madda], Marc B.

He is regarded as a pioneering moderniser of Orthodox Judaism in Germany and as a founder of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:HildesheimerStreetJerusalem.jpg|thumb|200px|A street in Jerusalem named after Hildesheimer.]]\n\nHildesheimer was born in [[Halberstadt]], [[Province of Saxony]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the son of Rabbi [[L\u00f6b Glee Hildesheimer]], a native of [[Hildesheim]], [[Electorate of Hanover]], a city near [[Hanover]]. He attended the ''Hasharat Zvi'' school in Halberstadt, and, from age seventeen, the [[Yeshiva]] of Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]] in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]];  ''[[hakham|Chacham]]'' [[Isaac Bernays]] was one of his teachers and his model as a [[maggid|preacher]].  While studying in yeshiva Hildesheimer also studied [[classical languages]]. In 1840 he returned to Halberstadt, took his [[matriculation|diploma]] at the public K\u00f6nigliches [[Cathedral#Designation|Dom]]-[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], and entered the [[University of Berlin]]; he became a disciple of the dominant [[Hegel]]ian school. He studied [[Semitic languages]] and [[mathematics]], and continued his study in [[Talmud]].  In 1842 he went to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle upon Saale]] where he earned his doctorate from the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle-Wittenberg]] in 1844 under [[Wilhelm Gesenius]] and [[Emil R\u00f6diger]] (''{{lang|de|Ueber die rechte Art der Bibelinterpretation}}'', English: ''On the Right Kind of Bible Interpretation''). He then returned to Halberstadt, where he married Henrietta Hirsch, whose dowry made them financially independent.\n\nIn 1851 he became [[Rabbi]] of [[Eisenstadt]] (Kis Marton), [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538\u20131867)|Hungary]] (now located in [[Austria]]); the principal city of the [[Siebengemeinden]] or ''Sheva kehillot''. His first notable act there was to found a [[parochial school]], where correct [[German language|German]] was used, and modern principles of [[pedagogy]] were adopted in teaching [[Secular education|secular]], as well as Jewish, subjects. Hildesheimer initially introduced limited secular studies in the elementary school; the older students received a secular education as well, but with a focus on [[mathematics]] and other subjects that would enhance their understanding of [[gemara]].\n\nNext, Hildesheimer established a [[Yeshiva]]. The Yeshiva was unusual in that it was the only Orthodox institution where students were required to have a significant secular education before they were admitted. Also, the curriculum devoted time to studying [[Tanakh|Tanach]] and the [[Hebrew language]]. Despite this approach, within a few years the Yeshiva attracted a large number of pupils. (After beginning with six students in 1851, the seminary had 128 students in 1868, including one from the [[United States]].) His son, Hirsch Hildesheimer, was a professor there.\n\nIn 1869 the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox minority]] in [[Berlin]] was granted government permission to found a separate Orthodox synagogal congregation, the [[Israelitische Synagogen-Gemeinde Adass Jisroel zu Berlin]]<ref>Adass Jisroel (= adas yissro'el) renders the Yiddish articulation of the Hebrew name in Latin letters according to their German pronunciation.</ref> (Israelite Synagogal Congregation of Adass Yisroel [\u05e2\u05d3\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc] in Berlin; extant from 1869 to 1939, and again since 1989), then comprising about 200 families. They were dissatisfied with Rabbi [[Joseph Aub (rabbi)|Joseph Aub]], appointed in 1867 by the ''J\u00fcdische Gemeinde zu Berlin'' (till 1869 the only Jewish congregation in Berlin). Adass Jisroel chose Hildesheimer to represent them as an \"Orthodox rabbi of standing\". Here, he similarly established a religious school and a [[yeshiva]] (''Rabbinerseminar f\u00fcr das orthodoxe Judenthum in Berlin'' 1873\u20131880, then the name was shortened to ''Rabbiner-Seminar zu Berlin'', known as the [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary]]), which immediately attracted thirty former pupils. Hildesheimer was thus the real intellectual founder and leader of the ''Adass Jisroel'' congregation.\n\nAided by [[Mayer Lehmann]], the editor of ''Israelit'' in [[Mainz]] (Mayence), Hildesheimer \"exerted his whole energy\" in the fight against [[Reform Judaism]]. In 1861 he took his stand against [[Abraham Geiger]] by criticising Geiger, ''Die Geiger'sche Brosch\u00fcre Notwendigkeit und Maass einer Reform des j\u00fcdischen Gottesdienstes'' (under the name variant Israel Hildesheimer, Mayence: Verlag der Le Roux'schen Hofbuchhandlung, 1861). (In fact, as early as 1847\u2014as the representative of the communities in the [[Magdeburg]] district\u2014he had energetically opposed the Reform attempts of [[Ludwig Philippson]].)\n\nHildesheimer was \"simple in his habits and fearless\"; he had an unusual capacity for work; and his great Talmudic learning \"was joined to practical administrative ability\". He was financially independent, and never accepted remuneration for his rabbinical activity. He was frequently engaged in philanthropic activities connected with his own congregation, but additionally, \"no labor was too great and no journey too long for him\" in the service of the Jews of Germany, Austria, Russia, and even [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] and [[Persian Empire|Persia]], so that he came to be known as the \"international [[schnorrer (Yiddish)|schnorrer]]\". Hildesheimer also took a special interest in the welfare of the [[Palestinian Jews|Jews of Palestine]]. In 1860, when the [[missionary]] society of Palestine provided seventy free dwellings for homeless Jews, Hildesheimer himself built houses in [[Jerusalem]] for the free use of Jewish pilgrims and for the poor.\n\nHildesheimer died in [[Berlin]] on 12 July 1899. His grave is preserved in the [[Wei\u00dfensee Cemetery#Cemetery of the Orthodox congregation Adass Jisroel|Cemetery of the Synagogal Congregation of Adass Jisroel]] on Wittlicher Stra\u00dfe, Berlin-Wei\u00dfensee.\n\nIn [[Israel]] the [[moshav]] [[Azri'el]] is named after him, as well as streets in Jerusalem and [[Tel Aviv]].\n\n===Writings===\nHildesheimer contributed articles to various journals and newspapers: the ''J\u00fcdische Presse'', ''Ha-Lebanon'', ''He-Chalutz'' and ''Archives Isra\u00e9lites''. During his lifetime he wrote his name in his books usually as Israel Hildesheimer. His son, Hirsch was editor of the ''J\u00fcdische Presse''.\n\nOther writings include:\n*\"Materialien zur Beurtheilung der Septuaginta\", in: ''Literaturblatt des Orients'', 1848, Nos. 30 et seq.;\n*''Die Epitaphien der Grabsteine auf dem Hiesigen [of Halberstadt] J\u00fcdischen Friedhofe'', 1846;\n*''Verwaltung der J\u00fcdischen Gemeinde Halberstadt'', Halberstadt: D\u00f6lle, 1849.\n*''Offener Brief an den Redacteur der Monatsschrift \"Ben-Chananja\", Leopold L\u00f6v'', Vienna, 1858;\n*''\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05de\u05e0\u05d7\u05d4 \u05d8\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4: \u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc \u05d3\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d7\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d4\u05d3\u05dc\u05e7\u05d4 / Minchah Tehorah'', Solomon ben Moses Bonhard, Hildesheimer (ed.)
