The first courthouse was built in Greensville, later called [[Oldtown, Virginia|Oldtown]], constructed in 1794 and rebuilt beginning in 1832. In 1842, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] authorized the division of Grayson County, the northeastern portion becoming [[Carroll County, Virginia|Carroll County]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], little fighting occurred within Grayson County. However, the \"Grayson Dare Devils\" (Company F, 4th Regiment of the [[Stonewall Brigade]]) were recruited from the Elk Creek Valley of Grayson County shortly after Virginia seceded, and sustained significant losses as the [[First Battle of Manassas]]. The Grayson Cavalry was Company C of the [[8th Virginia Cavalry]], which served until the war's end.<ref>The wartime correspondence of Earl Carson Andis is published in Fields and Hughes, Grayson County: A History in Words and Pictures (Grayson County Historical Society, 1976) pp. 99-133</ref> Company D of the 50th Virginia Infantry was recruited in the Mouth of Wilson Community and they were known as the \"Wilson Rifles.\"\n\nThe county seat since shortly before the American Civil War has been [[Independence, Virginia]], since the former county seat had been centrally located until Carroll County split off (and Oldtown now is a district within Grayson county).<ref>For some explanation of what had been a decade-long controversy over the county seat relocation, see the NRIS for the old courthouse, section 8 p. 6 available at http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Grayson/038-0004_Old_Grayson_County_Courthouse_1997_Final_Nomination.pdf</ref> The [[Old Grayson County Courthouse and Clerk's Office]] renovated circa 1834 still exists, but is now located near what since 1953 is the independent city of [[Galax, Virginia]]. Even by 1890 the nearest railroad to Grayson county was nine miles from the county line, a [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] stop called \"Rural Retreat.\" Textile and then furniture factories arrived in [[Galax, Virginia|Galax]] (which was planned as a town near the old village of Blair on a plateau beginning in 1903, and renamed after a plant harvested from the surrounding mountains). Also the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] was dammed at [[Fries, Virginia|Fries]] to power a cotton mill, which also led to more direct service by the Norfolk and Western to [[Troutdale, Virginia|Troutdale]] (which later faltered). Whitetop City and Fairwood also virtually disappeared during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>Fields and Hughes, p. 10</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|446|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|442|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|3.8|sqmi}} (0.8%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The southernmost point in Virginia lies in Grayson County.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n\n{|\n|-valign=top\n|\n* [[Johnson County, Tennessee]] (southwest)\n* [[Washington County, Virginia]] (west)\n* [[Smyth County, Virginia|Smyth County]] (northwest)\n* [[Wythe County, Virginia|Wythe County]] (northeast)\n* [[Ashe County, North Carolina]] (south)\n|\n* [[Alleghany County, North Carolina]] (south)\n* [[Surry County, North Carolina]] (southeast)\n* [[Independent city (United States)|Independent City]] of [[Galax, Virginia|Galax]] (east)\n* [[Carroll County, Virginia|Carroll County]] (east)\n|}\n\n===National protected areas===\n* [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] (part)\n* [[Jefferson National Forest]] (part)\n* [[Mount Rogers National Recreation Area]] (part)\n\n===Major highways===\n* {{Jct|state=VA|US|21}}\n* {{Jct|state=VA|US|58}}\n* {{Jct|state=VA|US|221}}\n* {{Jct|state=VA|SR|16}}\n* {{Jct|state=VA|SR|89}}\n* {{Jct|state=VA|SR|93}}\n* {{Jct|state=VA|SR|94}}\n* {{Jct|state=VA|SR|274}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1800= 3912\n|1810= 4941\n|1820= 5598\n|1830= 7675\n|1840= 9087\n|1850= 6677\n|1860= 8252\n|1870= 9587\n|1880= 13068\n|1890= 14394\n|1900= 16853\n|1910= 19856\n|1920= 19816\n|1930= 20017\n|1940= 21916\n|1950= 21379\n|1960= 17930\n|1970= 15439\n|1980= 16579\n|1990= 16278\n|2000= 17917\n|2010= 15533\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=15631\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/va190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

The [[population density]] was 40 people per square mile (16/km\u00b2).  There were 9,123 housing units at an average density of 21 per square&nbsp;mile (8/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the county was 91.70% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 6.79% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.12% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 0.07% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.70% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.60% from two or more races.  1.55% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 7,259 households out of which 26.40% had children under the           living with them, 57.60% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 8.50% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.90% were non-families. 26.80% of all households were made up of individuals and 12.90% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.77.\n\nIn the county, the population was spread out with 19.50% under the age of 18, 7.60% from 18 to 24, 29.80% from 25 to 44, 26.20% from 45 to 64, and 16.90% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females there were 107.70 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 109.70 males.\n[[File:OldGraysonCoVaCourthouse.jpg|thumb|250px|The Old Grayson County Courthouse, now used as a museum and site for public events.]]\nThe median income for a household in the county was $28,676, and the median income for a family was $35,076. Males had a median income of $24,126 versus $17,856 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the county was $16,768.  About 10.00% of families and 13.60% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 18.80% of those under age 18 and 16.30% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Economy==\nGrayson is economically isolated, without an Interstate Highway and surrounded by mountains. It struggled to attract and retain business; a situation made much worse beginning in 2009 with the recession. Losses of jobs in the furniture and textile sectors resulted in an unemployment rate of 14.6%. As part of the reformation of county government beginning in 2009, the new but idle River North Correctional Center was activated by the state brought in several hundred jobs. County government efforts were successful in retaining Core Fitness' Nautilus facility as the largest employer in the county and integrating local businesses as part of their supply chain. Independence Lumber suffered significant losses in a fire in November 2012 which forced it to relocate operations to North Carolina. Efforts by the county led to the company rebuilding and reopening its facility in 2014 with 125 jobs.  By 2014 a focus on job creation brought additional business operations and 300 more jobs to the county and resulted in an unemployment rate of only 6.9%.<ref name=\"AC&C\"/> By April 2019, the unemployment rate had plummeted to just 2.6%.<ref>[https://data.bls.gov/map/MapToolServlet?state=51&datatype=unemployment&survey=la&map=county&seasonal=u Local Area Unemployment Statistics Map], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]</ref>\n\n==Government==\nIn 2009, the county, in dire financial condition from mismanagement and the failing economy, hired Jonathan Sweet as County Administrator. The county debt was $18.3 million and operational expenses were being paid by added borrowing. By 2015 the county had reversed its fiscal direction, revitalized the business climate, and begun to regain the confidence of its citizens. The county fund balance was 35% of its operating expenses and government operations were financially stable with reduced debt.<ref name=\"AC&C\">{{cite journal | url=http://americancityandcounty.com/administration/home-where-heart | title=Home is where the heart is | author=Prall, Derek | journal=American City & County |date=July 2015  | volume=130 | issue=7 | pages=16\u201323}}</ref>\n\n===Board of Supervisors===\n* At-Large District: John Fant(I)\n* Elk Creek District: Brenda R.

The first courthouse was built in Greensville, later called [[Oldtown, Virginia|Oldtown]], constructed in 1794 and rebuilt beginning in 1832. In 1842, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] authorized the division of Grayson County, the northeastern portion becoming [[Carroll County, Virginia|Carroll County]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], little fighting occurred within Grayson County. However, the \"Grayson Dare Devils\" (Company F, 4th Regiment of the [[Stonewall Brigade]]) were recruited from the Elk Creek Valley of Grayson County shortly after Virginia seceded, and sustained significant losses as the [[First Battle of Manassas]]. The Grayson Cavalry was Company C of the [[8th Virginia Cavalry]], which served until the war's end.<ref>The wartime correspondence of Earl Carson Andis is published in Fields and Hughes, Grayson County: A History in Words and Pictures (Grayson County Historical Society, 1976) pp. 99-133</ref> Company D of the 50th Virginia Infantry was recruited in the Mouth of Wilson Community and they were known as the \"Wilson Rifles.\"\n\nThe county seat since shortly before the American Civil War has been [[Independence, Virginia]], since the former county seat had been centrally located until Carroll County split off (and Oldtown now is a district within Grayson county).<ref>For some explanation of what had been a decade-long controversy over the county seat relocation, see the NRIS for the old courthouse, section 8 p. 6 available at http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Grayson/038-0004_Old_Grayson_County_Courthouse_1997_Final_Nomination.pdf</ref> The [[Old Grayson County Courthouse and Clerk's Office]] renovated circa 1834 still exists, but is now located near what since 1953 is the independent city of [[Galax, Virginia]]. Even by 1890 the nearest railroad to Grayson county was nine miles from the county line, a [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] stop called \"Rural Retreat.\" Textile and then furniture factories arrived in [[Galax, Virginia|Galax]] (which was planned as a town near the old village of Blair on a plateau beginning in 1903, and renamed after a plant harvested from the surrounding mountains). Also the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] was dammed at [[Fries, Virginia|Fries]] to power a cotton mill, which also led to more direct service by the Norfolk and Western to [[Troutdale, Virginia|Troutdale]] (which later faltered).

The [[population density]] was 40 people per square mile (16/km\u00b2).  There were 9,123 housing units at an average density of 21 per square&nbsp;mile (8/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the county was 91.70% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 6.79% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.12% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 0.07% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.70% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.60% from two or more races.  1.55% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 7,259 households out of which 26.40% had children under the           living with them, 57.60% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 8.50% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.90% were non-families. 26.80% of all households were made up of individuals and 12.90% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.77.\n\nIn the county, the population was spread out with 19.50% under the age of 18, 7.60% from 18 to 24, 29.80% from 25 to 44, 26.20% from 45 to 64, and 16.90% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 10.00% of families and 13.60% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 18.80% of those under age 18 and 16.30% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Economy==\nGrayson is economically isolated, without an Interstate Highway and surrounded by mountains. It struggled to attract and retain business; a situation made much worse beginning in 2009 with the recession. Losses of jobs in the furniture and textile sectors resulted in an unemployment rate of 14.6%. As part of the reformation of county government beginning in 2009, the new but idle River North Correctional Center was activated by the state brought in several hundred jobs. County government efforts were successful in retaining Core Fitness' Nautilus facility as the largest employer in the county and integrating local businesses as part of their supply chain. Independence Lumber suffered significant losses in a fire in November 2012 which forced it to relocate operations to North Carolina. Efforts by the county led to the company rebuilding and reopening its facility in 2014 with 125 jobs.  By 2014 a focus on job creation brought additional business operations and 300 more jobs to the county and resulted in an unemployment rate of only 6.9%.<ref name=\"AC&C\"/> By April 2019, the unemployment rate had plummeted to just 2.6%.<ref>[https://data.bls.gov/map/MapToolServlet?state=51&datatype=unemployment&survey=la&map=county&seasonal=u Local Area Unemployment Statistics Map], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]</ref>\n\n==Government==\nIn 2009, the county, in dire financial condition from mismanagement and the failing economy, hired Jonathan Sweet as County Administrator. The county debt was $18.3 million and operational expenses were being paid by added borrowing. By 2015 the county had reversed its fiscal direction, revitalized the business climate, and begun to regain the confidence of its citizens. The county fund balance was 35% of its operating expenses and government operations were financially stable with reduced debt.<ref name=\"AC&C\">{{cite journal | url=http://americancityandcounty.com/administration/home-where-heart | title=Home is where the heart is | author=Prall, Derek | journal=American City & County |date=July 2015  | volume=130 | issue=7 | pages=16\u201323}}</ref>\n\n===Board of Supervisors===\n* At-Large District: John Fant(I)\n* Elk Creek District: Brenda R.

The county is probably named for Sir [[Richard Grenville]], leader of the settlement on [[Roanoke Island]], 1585.  There is also belief that it may be named after [[Nathanael Greene]], a major general of the [[Continental Army]] and one of [[George Washington]]'s brightest officers.\n\nAn early chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] was formed in Greensville County and Emporia (the county seat) in May 1940, under the leadership of dentist Dr. F. A. Sealy, of [[Boydton, Virginia]] and president of the [[Mecklenburg County, Virginia]] branch. However he died in 1943, as efforts to desegregate the county's schools began with the assistance of attorneys [[Oliver W. Hill]].<ref>First Annual Founders' Day program at Greensville County High School June 23, 2007 pp. 15-27</ref> After service in World War II, Hill's colleague [[Samuel Wilbert Tucker|Samuel W.

The county is probably named for Sir [[Richard Grenville]], leader of the settlement on [[Roanoke Island]], 1585.  There is also belief that it may be named after [[Nathanael Greene]], a major general of the [[Continental Army]] and one of [[George Washington]]'s brightest officers.\n\nAn early chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] was formed in Greensville County and Emporia (the county seat) in May 1940, under the leadership of dentist Dr. F. A. Sealy, of [[Boydton, Virginia]] and president of the [[Mecklenburg County, Virginia]] branch. However he died in 1943, as efforts to desegregate the county's schools began with the assistance of attorneys [[Oliver W. Hill]].<ref>First Annual Founders' Day program at Greensville County High School June 23, 2007 pp. 15-27</ref> After service in World War II, Hill's colleague [[Samuel Wilbert Tucker|Samuel W.

It is marked \"Aquae Armentiae Derventio\" indicating the Buxton to [[Little Chester]] (Derby) Roman road. It is further inscribed: \"Huius viae curam curatores viarum non susceperunt\". This translates as \"The road menders have not taken care of this road\". Roman roads also led north to [[Mamucium|Mancunium]] ([[Manchester]]) and to [[Ardotalia|Melandra]] fort, near [[Glossop]] (Margary Number 71b). Sections of [[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]] from these two northbound rounds have been identified and excavated. There was also a Roman Road (Margary Number 713) between Buxton and Leek (which may be the Roman town of Chesterton) whose course joins the present A53 road towards Leek at Morridge Top.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3270628|title=Geograph:: A plaque in the wall (C) Peter Barr|website=www.geograph.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe convergence of roads upon Aquae Armetiae, led Edward Tristram in 1916 to deduce the possible location of a fort in the town to the south of the market place by the current Bath Road.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tristram|first=Edward|date=1916|title=Roman Buxton|url=|journal=Derbyshire Archaeological Journal|volume=38|pages=84-104|via=}}</ref>\n[[File:Centurion_Stone_from_Navio_Roman_Fort.jpg|alt=|thumb|Centurial Stone from Navio Roman Fort]]\n[[File:Plaque on The Street (Buxton to Derby Roman Road).jpg|alt=|thumb|Plaque by Buxton to Derby Roman Road]]\nNavio fort guarded the route northwest to the larger fort of Melandra.
