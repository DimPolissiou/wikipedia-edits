Wrestling}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early life and career===\nBorn in Toronto, Hutchison became interested in professional wrestling at a young age watching [[Ed Farhat|The Shiek]] and [[The Missing Link (wrestler)|Dewey Robertson]]. In 1981, while still attending [[Northern Secondary School (Toronto)|Northern Secondary]] high school, the 17-year-old Hutchison began training with [[Sweet Daddy Siki]] and [[Johnny Powers (wrestler)|Johnny Powers]] at Sully's Gym.\n\nTraining part-time for two years, he would wrestle his first professional match with Danny Little Wolf defeating Teddy Marshall and Joey War Eagle at [[Scarboro Arena Gardens]] on June 5, 1983 and began wrestling for promoter [[Dave McKigney|\"Bearman\" Dave McKigney]] soon after his debut.\n\nHe would also wrestle for the WWF around Southern Ontario during the mid-1980s appearing in a televised match against [[The Iron Sheik]] on the WWF's [[Black Saturday (1984)|Black Saturday]] cards and regularly appeared on televised matches for [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] in [[Brantford, Ontario]].<ref name=\"Bio\"/> He would later face [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]] on April 26 and [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] on May 10 while the WWF toured Ontario in 1986.\n\n===Grand Prix Wrestling===\nDuring the summer season, he also toured with Maritime-based Grand Prix Wrestling as well as [[National Wrestling Alliance]]-affiliated territories in the Montreal and southern Ontario-area with Pro Wrestling Canada. For over three years, he would face wrestlers including [[Masahiro Chono]], [[Mr. Pogo]], [[Karl Krupp|\"Killer\" Karl Krupp]], [[Jos Leduc]], [[Frenchy Martin]] and [[Leo Burke]] during his time in the Maritime provinces. He would also wrestle midget star [[Sky Low Low]] and [[Rhonda Singh|\"Monster Ripper\" Rhonda Singh]] in mixed tag team matches as well.\n\nAfter touring Quebec with Leo Burke's International Wrestling promotion during 1986 and 1987, he returned to Grand Prix Wrestling as the masked wrestler The Intelligent and the Sensational Masked Thunderbolt as a member of [[Bob Brown (wrestler)|\"Bulldog\" Bob Brown]] stable Bulldog's Army feuding with Leo Burke, [[Ron Starr|\"Rotten\" Ron Starr]], [[The Great Malumba]], [[Stephen Petitpas]], [[Vinnie Valentino]], [[\u00c1ngel Acevedo|Cuban Assassin]], [[Sunny War Cloud]] and [[Buddy Lane]] for over two years.\n\n===Retirement===\nThe same year he made his wrestling debut, he began attending [[Ryerson Polytechnic University|Ryerson Polytechnical Institute]] studying [[journalism]] and continued wrestling part-time during the semester, and full-time during the summer. When Johnny Powers left Sully's Gym, he was offered a position as an instructor by Siki who was impressed by his knowledge of amateur wrestling. After retiring in 1990, he remained at Sully's Gym after Siki left in 1994. Later opening a wrestling school with Siki, he would train many of Canada's top independent wrestlers throughout the 1990s, many of whom would later compete in the WWF and NWA: TNA.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nIn September 1997, Hutchison would appear on a wrestling event promoted by [[Tiger Jeet Singh]] in [[Middlesex, England]] with over 10,000 in attendance and later aired on PPV in India. During that year, he would also appear with WWF Canada President [[Carl De Marco]] on CBC TV's teen talk show \"[[Jonovision]]\" as well as a second appearance in September 1998 along with two students, Tiger Ali Singh and [[Jason Sensation]].\n\n===Apocalypse Wrestling Federation===\nIn August 1998, in association with his wrestling school, Hutchison established the Apocalypse Wrestling Federation which began holding events in the Toronto-area with its first show on August 30, 1998. During the next year, [[Missy Hyatt]] would make her Canadian debut appearing at the supercard \"A Valentine to Remember\" on February 14 winning the AWF Heavyweight Championship in a mixed tag team match with Miss B. Haven against [[Sherri Martel]] and the Squeegee Kid during the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/whawfp2.html|title=AWF World Heavyweight History|accessdate=2007-09-16|author=Westcott, Brian|year=2003|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}</ref> This would be the first wrestling event in which a woman would hold a men's wrestling title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosH/hyatt_missy_dec01-can.html|title=Book, website, school important to Missy|author=Waldman, Jon|date=2001-12-11|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling}}</ref>\n\nDuring that same year, he would also promote [[Terry Funk]]'s Canadian retirement match \"One Last Dance\" in which Funk would defeat [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] on June 6, 1999. The following month, he would begin promoting the annual AWF Ironman Tournament in which over 100 matches would be booked in an 18-day period. The tournament, which would be held for the next four years, would feature matches from top Canadian independent wrestlers and, in 2002, the Canadian debuts of [[Jillian Hall]], [[Beth Phoenix]] and Japanese female wrestler [[Sumie Sakai]].\n\nOn Sun. May 3, 2009 Hutchison revived the Apocalypse Wrestling Federation when the AWF promoted a card called \"Super Scrap\" to crown a new AWF Heavyweight Champion in Whitby, Ontario, Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=APOCALYPSE WRESTLING FEDERATION presents AWF Pro-Wrestling LIVE!|url=http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/60241|website=www.brownpapertickets.com|accessdate=4 May 2016}}</ref>   The promotion continued to run in Whitby for several years hence.\n\nOn Aug. 11 and 12, 2012 Hutchison's Apocalypse Wrestling Federation teamed with concert promoters Live Nation to present The Heavy TO Heavyweight Series, outdoors, in Toronto's Downsview Park.

In 1981, while still attending [[Northern Secondary School (Toronto)|Northern Secondary]] high school, the 17-year-old Hutchison began training with [[Sweet Daddy Siki]] and [[Johnny Powers (wrestler)|Johnny Powers]] at Sully's Gym.\n\nTraining part-time for two years, he would wrestle his first professional match with Danny Little Wolf defeating Teddy Marshall and Joey War Eagle at [[Scarboro Arena Gardens]] on June 5, 1983 and began wrestling for promoter [[Dave McKigney|\"Bearman\" Dave McKigney]] soon after his debut.\n\nHe would also wrestle for the WWF around Southern Ontario during the mid-1980s appearing in a televised match against [[The Iron Sheik]] on the WWF's [[Black Saturday (1984)|Black Saturday]] cards and regularly appeared on televised matches for [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] in [[Brantford, Ontario]].<ref name=\"Bio\"/> He would later face [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]] on April 26 and [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] on May 10 while the WWF toured Ontario in 1986.\n\n===Grand Prix Wrestling===\nDuring the summer season, he also toured with Maritime-based Grand Prix Wrestling as well as [[National Wrestling Alliance]]-affiliated territories in the Montreal and southern Ontario-area with Pro Wrestling Canada. For over three years, he would face wrestlers including [[Masahiro Chono]], [[Mr. Pogo]], [[Karl Krupp|\"Killer\" Karl Krupp]], [[Jos Leduc]], [[Frenchy Martin]] and [[Leo Burke]] during his time in the Maritime provinces. He would also wrestle midget star [[Sky Low Low]] and [[Rhonda Singh|\"Monster Ripper\" Rhonda Singh]] in mixed tag team matches as well.\n\nAfter touring Quebec with Leo Burke's International Wrestling promotion during 1986 and 1987, he returned to Grand Prix Wrestling as the masked wrestler The Intelligent and the Sensational Masked Thunderbolt as a member of [[Bob Brown (wrestler)|\"Bulldog\" Bob Brown]] stable Bulldog's Army feuding with Leo Burke, [[Ron Starr|\"Rotten\" Ron Starr]], [[The Great Malumba]], [[Stephen Petitpas]], [[Vinnie Valentino]], [[\u00c1ngel Acevedo|Cuban Assassin]], [[Sunny War Cloud]] and [[Buddy Lane]] for over two years.\n\n===Retirement===\nThe same year he made his wrestling debut, he began attending [[Ryerson Polytechnic University|Ryerson Polytechnical Institute]] studying [[journalism]] and continued wrestling part-time during the semester, and full-time during the summer. When Johnny Powers left Sully's Gym, he was offered a position as an instructor by Siki who was impressed by his knowledge of amateur wrestling. After retiring in 1990, he remained at Sully's Gym after Siki left in 1994.

{"title_page": "Suplex", "text_new": "{{short description|Wrestling maneuver}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2007}}\n\nA '''suplex''' is an [[Offense (sports)|offensive]] move used in  [[professional wrestling]]. It is a throw that involves lifting the opponent and [[Bridge (grappling)|bridging]] or rolling to slam the opponent on their back.\n\nProfessional wrestling features many different varieties of suplexes. The following are among the most common, but many more exist, particularly as the signature techniques of individual wrestlers.\n\n==Front facelock variants==\nIn these suplexes, the wrestlers begin by facing each other, the attacking wrestler then applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] to the opponent before executing a throw. In most cases, the opponent is suspended upside-down during part of the move. The most common front facelock suplex is the [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]].\n\n===Fisherman suplex{{anchor|Fisherman's suplex}}===\nAlso known as a fisherman's suplex and also known as a leg hook suplex. With their opponent in a [[professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] with the near arm draped over the attacker's shoulder, the wrestler hooks the opponent's near leg behind the opponent's knee with their free arm and falls backwards, flipping the opponent onto their back. In most cases the attacking wrestler will keep the leg hooked and bridge to pin the opponent in a cradle-like position, as in the case of [[Curt Hennig]] and [[Curtis Axel|Joe Hennig]]'s ''Perfect-plex''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-45|title=the 50 coolest maneuvers of all time - Perfect-plex|date=2014-02-21|accessdate=2014-05-04|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Other times the wrestler will apply a [[Professional wrestling holds#Leg locks|leglock submission hold]] to the hooked leg.\n\n====Swinging fisherman suplex====\nMore commonly referred to as swinging fisherman neckbreaker. A swinging variation of the standard fisherman suplex, this move sees a wrestler, with their opponent in a front facelock with the near arm draped over their shoulder, hook the opponent's near leg with their free arm and roll over to the same side of the arm being used to hook the opponent's leg, flipping the opponent over onto their back.\n\n===Hammerlock suplex===\nIn this variation of the suplex, the attacker applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Hammerlock|hammerlock]] on his opponent before applying a front facelock and positioning the opponent's free arm over the attacker's head. The attacker then lifts up the opponent and falls backwards, dropping the opponent down back first, landing with their trapped arm bent behind their back.\n\n===Slingshot suplex===\nThe attacker faces a standing opponent with one side of the ring immediately behind the opponent. The attacker applies a front facelock to the opponent, takes hold of the opponent with their free hand, then lifts the opponent until he/she is nearly vertical. The attacker then falls forward so that the torso of the opponent bounces off the top ring rope, and uses this momentum to quickly lift the opponent overhead once more and falls backwards, driving the back and shoulders of the opponent into the ground.\n\n===Suplex slam===\nThis move is similar to most suplexes and starts with the attacker applying a front face lock to their opponent and draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, then lifting him/her up and holding the opponent in the vertical position. This is where the move differs from most of its counterparts with the attacker not falling with the opponent, but rather shifting themselves slightly and throwing their opponent to the mat on his back. Sometimes this involves the wrestler turning the opponent in midair and slamming the opponent down to the mat ''in front'' of him/her onto their back, similar to a high-angled [[Professional wrestling throws#Body slam|body slam]]. The suplex slam can also be used for other suplexes such as the [[Suplex#Fisherman suplex|fisherman suplex]] or [[Suplex#Gutwrench suplex|gutwrench suplex]].\n\nThere is also a sitout version. Also called a suplex [[Professional wrestling throws#Driver|driver]], this sees an attacker apply a [[professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] to the opponent and drapes the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then takes hold of the opponent's torso with their free arm and lifts the opponent to a vertical position. The facelock is loosened so the opponent can be twisted slightly, then the attacker falls to a sitting position and the victim's back and shoulders are driven into the mat. The opponent lands between the attacker's legs with their head toward them.\n\nAnother variation sees the wrestler perform a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]], but instead of twisting the upside down opponent to face them, the wrestler turns 180\u00b0 to face the opponent before sitting down and driving them back first between their legs.\n\n====Reverse suplex slam{{anchor|Inverted suplex slam|Front suplex|Gourdbuster}}====\nAlso called a front suplex or a gourdbuster, this move sees the attacker apply a front face lock to the opponent and drape the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then lifts the opponent into a vertical position, then he falls or kneels forward, driving the opponents face into the ground. A standing version also exists. It was invented by [[Arn Anderson]]\n\nIn the sitout version, the attacker applies a front face lock to the opponent and drapes the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then lifts the opponent into a vertical position, and falls into a sit-out position, driving the face of the opponent into the ground. In another variation, the wrestler releases the hold just prior to the sitout position letting his opponents own momentum to force them down head first.\n\n===Superplex===\n[[File:Cesaro superplex.jpg|thumb|[[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] performing a superplex on [[Jack Swagger]]]]\nA superplex (a portmanteau of \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Super|super]]\" and \"suplex\") refers to any suplex performed by an attacker standing on the second or third rope against an opponent sitting on the top rope or top turnbuckle. The most common suplex used for this top rope move is the standard [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] variation (known as the suicide-plex), in which the attackers apply a front face lock to the opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their respective shoulders, at this point the wrestler falls backwards and flips the opponent over them so they both land on their backs.\n\n===Tornado suplex===\nIn a set-up similar to a [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Tornado DDT|tornado DDT]], a wrestler goes to the top rope and applies a front facelock on their opponent from an elevated position, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The wrestler then jumps forward and swings around, but lands on their feet and performs a suplex on their opponent.\n\n===Vertical suplex===\n[[File:Ryze suplex on Hooker.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A wrestler performing a vertical suplex on an opponent]]In a set-up similar to a snap suplex, the attacking wrestler applies a front face lock to the opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, when the opponent is in position they are lifted to an upside-down position before the attacking wrestler falls backwards slamming the opponent's back into the mat.\n\nThe delayed variation of a vertical suplex, also known as the hanging suplex, standing suplex or stalling suplex, sees the attacking wrestler holds an opponent in the upside-down position at the peak of the arc for several seconds before completing the maneuver, thereby (in [[kayfabe]]) causing blood to pool into the head of the opponent. This move is a staple of larger and powerful wrestlers as it gives an aura of dominance over their opponents who can do nothing but wait to drop in the suplex.\n\nThe rotating variation of a vertical suplex, also sometimes known as the rotation suplex, rotary suplex, or twisting suplex, sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but turn around as he or she falls back to twist the opponent into the mat.\n\n====Drop suplex====\nThis variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but then simply drop them flat to the mat instead of falling backwards with them. The move was first popularized in WCW by [[Kevin Nash]], who began to use it instead of a standard suplex to avoid aggravating a back injury.\n\n====Rolling release suplex====\nThis variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]], also known as the ''[[EZ Money#In wrestling|Crash Landing]]'', sees the attacker lift his opponent up with the standard suplex lift but instead of falling backwards and having the opponent drop down onto his shoulders and back, the attacker turns the opponent and releases them from the [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] at the apex of the lift. Both the attacker and the opponent fall forward, with the opponent landing on his neck, shoulders and back.\n\n====Rolling non-release suplex====\nAlso known as triple rolling verticals, or triple rolling vertical suplexes, this variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler perform a single vertical or [[#Snap suplex|snap]] suplex to the opponent, but the attacking wrestler doesn't release the hold, instead rolling his legs and body into a standing position to execute a second suplex, then repeats the process for a third suplex. This was popularized by [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] Hall of Famer [[Eduardo Gory Guerrero Llanes|Eddie Guerrero]] used this move calling it the ''Three Amigos''. Many other WWE superstars used this move to pay tribute to him such as  [[Chavo Guerrero Jr.|Chavo]] and [[Tyler Black|Seth Rollins]].\n\n====Running suplex====\nThis variation is similar to a classic suplex including the attacking wrestlers begins with a standard [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] and then when he starts lifting opponent, he makes a few running steps forward while continue the suplex rotation, slamming the opponent back-first onto the mat.\n\n====Snap suplex====\n[[File:Brie Bella Suplex.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Brie Bella]] setting up a snap suplex on [[Aksana (wrestler)|Aksana]] at [[WrestleMania XXX]]]]\nThis move sees the attacker apply a front face lock to their opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, the attacker stomps down hard and suplexes the opponent stiffly, resulting in a quicker throw.\n\n===Toss suplex===\nThis variation of [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but then simply toss them across the mat instead of falling backwards with them.\n\n=== Jumping suplex ===\nInstead of just falling down onto his/her own back, the attacking wrestler jumps up and uses his momentum to drive the opponent down to the mat back first.\n\n===Underhook suplex{{anchor|Half hatch suplex|Half-hatch suplex}}===\nAlso known as a half-hatch suplex. It is performed in similar fashion to a [[Suplex#Snap suplex|snap suplex]]. The wrestler applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] with one arm but instead of draping the arm over their shoulders as seen in most suplexes, the attacker [[underhook]]s one of the opponent's arms with their other, placing their hand palm down on the back of the opponent. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up while bridging backwards, bringing the opponent overhead and onto their back. This can be performed with or without a pinning combination in which the wrestler bridges their back and legs to hold the opponent's shoulders against the mat. It can also be done with a kick for an added snap effect.\n\n==Belly-to-back variants==\nIn these variants, the attacker stands behind his opponent and applies a hold before falling backwards, dropping the opponent on his or her upper back. The most common belly-to-back variants are the [[#German suplex|German suplex]] and the [[#Belly-to-back suplex|back suplex]].\n\n===Belly-to-back suplex{{anchor|Belly to back suplex|Back suplex}}===\n[[File:Pepper Parks belly-to-back suplex.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[Pepper Parks]] (bottom) performing a belly-to-back suplex on RJ City.]]\nFor the belly-to-back suplex, the wrestler stands behind his opponent and puts his head under the arm of the opponent. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up grabbing the waist and thigh of the opponent, so the opponent is on the attacker's shoulder. The attacker finally falls backwards, dropping the opponent flat on his back.<ref name=toa>[http://www.otherarena.com/nCo/finish/finish.html Finishing move list, from TheOtherArena.com]</ref><ref name=bbowm>[http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part1.htm Big Book of Wrestling Moves, from DeathValleyDriver.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506000024/http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part1.htm |date=2013-05-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome wrestlers perform the back suplex into a bridging position, simultaneously arching their own back and legs to elevate themselves, gaining leverage and [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pinning]] their opponent. Very popular in [[Mexico]]'s [[Lucha Libre]], where this bridging version is known as a '''Puente Griego''' or Greek Bridge in [[English language|English]]. In 2018, the Colombian referee [[Wilmar Roldan]] announced a campaign to introduce this variant of the suplex to international soccer.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=\nSpostamento di wrestling da introdurre nel calcio internazionale? |trans-title=Wrestling move to be introduced to international soccer? |newspaper=Gazzetta Dello Sport|location=Milan |date=2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\nSince the wrestler taking the move is falling backwards, the potential for injury is significant if it is not performed properly. Japanese wrestler [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] suffered a spinal injury which triggered a fatal cardiac arrest during his last match in 2009 after [[Akitoshi Saito]] gave him the belly to back suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/9617/|title=Misawa Passes Away After Backdrop In Hiroshima Match|publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online|date=2009-06-13|accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref><ref name=\"Slam\">{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2009/06/13/9788666.html|title=Japanese legend Mitsuharu Misawa dies in the ring|author=Schramm, Chris|work=Slam!

He then lifts the opponent up using both of his arms wrapped around the torso of the opponent. The attacker finally falls backwards to drive the opponent to the mat on their neck and shoulders.\n\n====Leg hook belly-to-back suplex====\nSometimes referred to as a leg lift back suplex or leg lift backdrop, it is applied just as a back suplex would be, except that the wrestler wraps only the near arm or no arm around the torso of their opponent. With the free arm(s), the wrestler then hoists their opponent's knees or thighs and throws them backwards in that manner.\n\n====Cobra clutch suplex====\nThe attacker places the opponent in a [[professional wrestling holds#Cobra clutch|cobra clutch hold]]. They then proceed to lift the opponent up and fall backwards, driving the opponent to the mat on their head.\n\n====Crossface chickenwing suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent. He locks one of the opponent's arms in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Chickenwing|chickenwing]], and [[professional wrestling holds#Crossface|wraps his other arm around the opponent's head]]. He then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, driving the opponent on to the top of their head, down to the mat.\n\n====Crotch clutch suplex====\nThis move involves the attacking wrestler approaching an opponent from behind, reaching down and grasping his crotch with both forearms, with hands together and facing upwards into his groin, and lifting him overhead into a belly-to-back release suplex. The opponent reacts to both the suplex and being grabbed and lifted by his crotch, to humorous effect. The move was popularized by [[Joey Ryan (wrestler)|Joey Ryan]], who dubs it the \"[[YouPorn]] Plex\".<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/youporn-signs-joey-ryan-wrestlings-king-of-dong-style-40940/|title=YouPorn Signs Joey Ryan, Wrestling\u2019s 'King of Dong Style'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=James|last=Montgomery|date=December 18, 2015|accessdate=January 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Dragon suplex{{anchor|Full nelson suplex}}====\nThis belly-to-back suplex variation sees the wrestler apply a [[nelson hold#Full nelson|full nelson]] and then bridge his back, lifting the opponent over him and onto their shoulders down to the mat. The wrestler keeps his back arched and the hold applied, [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] the opponent's shoulders down to the mat. The wrestler may also release the opponent mid-arch, throwing them down to the mat shoulders and neck first, in a variation known as release dragon suplex.\n\n====Electric chair suplex====\nAlso known as an [[Professional wrestling throws#Electric chair drop|electric chair slam]]. The wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in an [[Professional wrestling holds#Electric chair|electric chair]] sitting position and then bridges his back, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first.\n\n====German suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent, grabs them around their waist, lifts them up, and falls backwards while bridging his back and legs, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first. The wrestler keeps the waistlock and continues bridging with their back and legs, pinning the opponent's shoulders down against the mat. The regular pinning variation can be referred to as the German suplex pin. The wrestler can also release the opponent in mid arch, which is referred to as a release German suplex. Sometimes, rather than bridging for a pin, the wrestler may roll himself into another position to perform the move again, often referred to as multiple, rolling, or non-release German suplexes, in which the attacking wrestler performs a German suplex, then rolls his legs to get back into a standing position, but does ''not'' let the opponent go to do so. The attacking wrestler then repeats this numerous times, most commonly three, but sometimes up to eight or more. The most common WWE superstar that uses the manoeuvre is Brock Lesnar.\n\n====Straight jacket suplex{{anchor|X-Plex|X-plex}}====\n[[File:Adam Cole straightjacket german suplex.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Cole]] performing straight jacket suplex on [[Kevin Owens|Kevin Steen]]]]\nThe [[Professional wrestling holds#Straight jacket|straight jacket]] suplex or package German suplex has the attacker trapping the opponent's arms while performing a German suplex. Variants such as the cross-arm suplex or X-Plex see the opponent's arms crossed across their chest and held by the attacker. The wrestler then uses the crossed arms as leverage to aid in lifting the opponent up while falling backwards to throw the opponent as in a German suplex.\n\n====Half and half suplex====\nThis is a suplex variation in which the wrestler, while standing behind the opponent, places one arm in a [[nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] and the other arm in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Chickenwing|chickenwing]]. The wrestler then proceeds to fall backwards while lifting the opponent overhead in the hold and driving them into the mat behind them. This move is referred to as a half and half suplex as it is a combination of a [[#Half nelson suplex|half nelson suplex]] and a [[#Tiger suplex|tiger suplex]]. The move can be either released or bringed into a pin.\n\n====Half nelson suplex====\nThis is a version of a [[#German suplex|German suplex]] where the attacker stands behind the opponent, facing the same direction. The attacker uses one hand to apply a [[nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] hold and wraps the other hand around the opponent's waist. The attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, dropping the opponent on their head, neck, or shoulders. The move can be either released or bringed into a pin.\n\n====Pumphandle suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent and bends him forward. One of the opponent's arms is pulled back between his legs and held, while the opponent's other arm is hooked by the attacker maneuvering his arm around in front of the opponent's shoulder (as in a [[professional wrestling holds#Pumphandle|pumphandle]]) and securing it behind the head (a [[nelson hold#Quarter nelson|quarter-nelson]]). The attacker then lifts his opponent up over his head and falls backwards to slam the opponent against the mat back-first.\n\nThere are many variations of the pumphandle suplex, including the maintaining of the grip in order to land the opponent on the mat face-first, or inverting the opponent's body position and securing the opponent's free arm using a [[nelson hold#Quarter nelson|half-nelson grip]] instead of the normal quarter-nelson.\n\n====Sleeper suplex====\nThe attacker places the opponent in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|sleeper hold]] and then hooks one of the opponents arms with his free arm. The attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, driving the opponent on their head. A slight variation sees the attacker apply a [[kata ha jime|half nelson choke]] instead of the sleeper hold before performing the suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-16 |title=the 50 coolest maneuvers of all time|date=2014-02-21|accessdate=2014-03-13|publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\n====Three-quarter nelson suplex====\nThe attacker stands behind the opponent, facing the same direction. The wrestler then pass both of his arms under the opponent's arms and puts one arm in a half nelson and the other hand around the neck in front of the opponent, like in a sleeper. The hand in front of the neck is locked with the other hand at the wrist. With the grip secure, the attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, dropping the opponent on their head, neck, or shoulders. The move can end in a release or bridging position.\n\n====Tiger suplex {{anchor|Double chickenwing suplex}}====\n[[File:Tiger suplex by Tsukushi.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Tsukushi (wrestler)|Tsukushi]] performing a tiger suplex on [[Sendai Sachiko]].]]\nInnovated by [[Alfonso Dant\u00e9s]] and popularized by the original [[Tiger Mask (professional wrestling)|Tiger Mask]] ([[Satoru Sayama]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/07/30/6312326.html|title=Mexican great Alfonso Dant\u00e9s dies|author=Schramm, Chris|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2010-02-21|date=July 31, 2008}}</ref> this move sees the wrestler standing behind their opponent, [[Professional wrestling holds#Double chickenwing|hooks both of the opponent's arms from the sides]], and places their hands palm down flat against the opponent's upper back. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, arching their back and legs and then slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and neck first. Like other suplex variations, this move can either end in a bridging pin or be released upon execution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://headlockbackdrop.wordpress.com/2010/12/15/12-tiger-suplex/|title=Tiger suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=Headlocks&Backdrops}}</ref>\n\n====Wheelbarrow suplex====\nThis move is performed when a wrestler wraps a forward-facing opponent's legs around their waist, in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Wheelbarrow|wheelbarrow hold]], from either standing behind an opponent who is laying face-first on the mat or by catching a charging opponent before then applying a waistlock to lift the opponent up off the ground into the air, then the attacking wrestler would continue lifting the opponent over their while falling backwards to hit belly-to-back suplex.\n\n==Belly-to-belly variants==\nIn these suplexes, the wrestlers begin by facing each other. The attacker then applies a bodylock before falling backwards and flipping the opponent onto his back and down on the mat.\n\n===Belly-to-belly suplex{{anchor|Belly to belly suplex}}===\n[[File:Bayley performing a Bayley-to-belly suplex on Alexa Bliss.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] performs a Bayley-to-belly suplex (belly-to-belly suplex) on [[Alexa Bliss]]]]\nThe wrestler wraps their arms around the opponent in a waistlock or a bodylock position and flips them over by violently bridging their own body so the opponent lands on their back. This can be done either overhead or to the side. For a side belly-to-belly suplex, the attacker usually holds on to the opponent for the duration of the move, but for the overhead belly-to-belly suplex, the attacker usually executes an overhead throw and lets go of the opponent. It can also be performed in a \"snap\" fashion, where the attacker stomps down hard and suplexes the opponent stiffly, resulting in a quicker throw.\n\n====Capture suplex====\nThe attacker stands facing a standing opponent. The attacker then catches one leg of the opponent and pulls the opponent towards them so that they are face-to-face, with the attacker reaching under the opponent's leg and hooking it. The attacker then uses their free arm to reach behind the neck of the opponent and take hold of them. The attacker then quickly bridges backwards and releases the opponent, throwing them overhead, or turns 180\u00b0 while slamming the opponent down to the mat. This move can be used to counter a kick. The move is also known as the head and leg suplex, and can be seen as a variation of the head and arm suplex.\n\n====Double underhook suplex{{anchor|Double arm suplex|Butterfly suplex}}====\nAlso known as a double arm suplex, reverse nelson suplex, double axe handle suplex, and a butterfly suplex, the wrestler and opponent face each other, the opponent bent forward. The wrestler hooks the opponent's arms back in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Butterfly|reverse nelson]], placing his forearms in the crooks of the opponent's elbows, with his hands on top of the opponent's back in a butcher's grip. The wrestler then lifts the opponent into an upside-down vertical position and falls back, shifting the opponent to one side as the opponent flips over. The wrestler executing the suplex may release the reverse nelson hold during the throw, or can maintain the grip and attempt a bridging pin or submission hold transition upon impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestling.wonderhowto.com/how-to/do-butterfly-suplex-315172/|title=Double underhook suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=WonderHowTo}}</ref>\n\n====Exploder suplex====\n[[File:Shelton Benjamin - T-Bone Suplex.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shelton Benjamin]] hits a variant of the T-Bone suplex, with a powerslam pin, on [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]].]]\nThe attacker stands facing his opponent and positions himself under one of the opponent's arms and wraps his arm around the opponent's neck and back (this position is similar to that of a [[Powerslam|side slam]]) and then grabs the leg of the opponent and tosses him backwards, over the attacker's head. Several other variations exist, such as the wrist-clutch exploder suplex (often called '''Exploder '98''') and the bridging exploder suplex (also called '''Blizzard Suplex''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://headlockbackdrop.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/17-exploder-suplex/|title=Exploder suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=Headlocks&Backdrops}}</ref>\n\n====Head-and-arm suplex====\nAlso called a gargoyle suplex, the move is a variation of the traditional overhead belly-to-belly suplex in which the wrestler, standing face-to-face with his opponent, clutches his hands together having firmly encircled the opponent's head and one arm.  This grip, as opposed to the waistlock of a normal belly-to-belly, is then used to hoist the opponent in the overhead arching throw.\n\n====Northern Lights suplex{{anchor|Northern lights suplex}}====\n[[File:Alicia Fox Northern lights suplex on Dana Brooke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alicia Fox]] performs a Northern Lights suplex w/ bridge on [[Dana Brooke]]]]\nFounder\u3000: Hiroshi Hase(Japanese Minister).The attacking wrestler puts his head under the arm of the opponent, wraps his arms around the waist of the opponent and flips him/her backwards. This suplex can either be released or bridged into a pin. The wrestler can also float over into another Northern Lights suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestling.wonderhowto.com/how-to/do-northern-lights-suplex-pro-wrestling-move-417507/|title=Northern Lights suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=WonderHowTo}}</ref>\n\n====Table top suplex====\n{{see also|[[Professional wrestling throws#Fallaway slam|Fallaway slam]]}}\nAlso known as a fallaway slam, the wrestler lifts the opponent up so the opponent is horizontal across the wrestler's body then falls backward, throwing the opponent over their head down to the mat back-first. This slam can be either bridged into a pin, or the wrestler can float over into another fallaway slam. This move is sometimes used as a continuation move from catching the opponent's high-cross body, to emphasize the wrestler's strength.\n\n====Trapping suplex====\nThis is when a wrestler holds both the opponent's arms under his own (known as ''overhooks'' in mixed martial arts and amateur wrestling, as the arms loop under the opponent's arms from above) with the hands connected below the opponent's triceps, from here the opponent is left secure and unable to counter or move away from the attacker while he/she delivers a belly-to-belly throw flipping the opponent overhead in the normal belly-to-belly motion. In amateur wrestling and other contact-sports, the trapping suplex is called the suicide throw. It is done slightly differently, usually the opponent is tossed to the side and lands on their back.\n\nThis move consists of one wrestler picking up his or her opponent off the ground (or mat) and then using a large portion of his or her own body weight to drive the opponent down on the mat. He or she begins face-to-face, then the attacker forces the opponent's head down and locks the opponent's arm around it.\n\n==Side variants==\nIn the side variants the attacker stands to the side of his or her opponent and applies a hold before falling backwards to slam the opponent to the mat. The most common is the [[#Saito suplex|Saito suplex]].\n\n===Gutwrench suplex===\nThis throw involves a wrestler standing on one side of a prone opponent locking both arms around the opponent's waist [[Professional wrestling holds#Gutwrench|near arm in front of the opponent and far arm behind]], and lifting him/her up to slam him/her over back-first down to the mat. An inverted version also exists.\n\n===Saito suplex===\nThe attacker stands either facing directly one of their opponent's sides or slightly behind in an angle. He places the opponent's near arm over his shoulder, grabs a waistlock, and then lifts the opponent up while falling backwards, causing the opponent to land on their neck and shoulders.\n\n[[File:Allysin Kay Cut-Throat.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Allysin Kay]] performing a Leg-hook Saito suplex]]\nThere is also a leg-hook variation where the attacker stands behind and to one side of the opponent. The attacker wraps one arm around the waist of the opponent and grabs the back of the opponent's near leg with their other arm. The attacker then lifts the opponent on to their shoulder and then falls backwards, driving the opponent into the mat at a high angle.\n\n===Side suplex===\n:''See [[Powerslam#Uranage|Ura-nage]] or [[Professional wrestling throws#Russian legsweep|Russian legsweep]].''\nThis move is also known as a sambo suplex or side suplex. To perform it, the wrestler stands face-to-face with the opponent, slightly to their side. The wrestler either reaches across the opponent's chest and around their neck with their near arm and locks both hands behind the opponent's shoulders or just locks both hands behind the opponent's waist. The wrestler then simultaneously lifts the opponent up, twists 180\u00b0 and falls backwards, bringing the opponent over them and slamming the opponent back-first on the mat.\n\nThe name ura-nage (or uranage) comes from a Judo throw which translated directly from Japanese, means \"throw to behind/back\" and is commonly (albeit incorrectly) used to refer to a regular side slam in pro wrestling. The Judo ura-nage throw more closely resembles a saito suplex in execution.\n\n====Cravate suplex====\nThis sees a wrestler lock their opponent in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Three-quarter facelock|cravate]] and pull down with their arms so that the opponent is forced to bend over. The wrestler then positions the opponent so that they are facing across the body of the wrestler and with their head in front of the wrestlers chest while stil standing. The wrestler then falls backwards, pulling upwards with the cravate and forcing the opponent off their feet into the air and over the wrestler, landing on their neck and shoulders.\n\n==Inverted facelock variants==\nIn these suplexes, an attacker begins by facing the back of an opponent and applying an [[Professional wrestling holds#Inverted facelock|inverted facelock]] before executing a throw. In most, the opponent is suspended upside-down during part of the move.\n\n===Inverted suplex===\nAlso known as a reverse suplex, this move sees the attacker stands behind an opponent and applies an inverted facelock with one arm, and uses the other arm to aid in elevating the opponent so that he/she is lifted up and held upside-down before the attacker falls to his back driving the opponent down to the mat face first, behind the attacker.\n\n==In other sports==\nSuplex tackles in [[gridiron football]] are not allowed and may be subject to penalties or even fines.<ref name=\"Moddejonge\">{{cite news|last1=Moddejonge|first1=Gerry|title=Back-to-back interceptions avoid CFL version of Montreal Screwjob|url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2016/08/12/back-to-back-interceptions-avoid-cfl-version-of-montreal-screwjob|accessdate=13 August 2016|work=Edmonton Sun|date=13 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Professional wrestling throws]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121028142636/http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part3.htm \"Professional Wrestling Moves: Part 3\"] Death Valley Driver.com\n*''The Professional Wrestlers' Workout & Instructional Guide'' - [[Harley Race]], [[Ricky Steamboat]], [[Les Thatcher]], and [[Alex Marvez]] pg. 80-84\n{{Wrestling Moves}}\n\n[[Category:Wrestling]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling moves]]\n\n[[de:Liste der Wrestling-Kampftechniken#Suplessen]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wrestling maneuver}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2007}}\n\nA '''suplex''' is an [[Offense (sports)|offensive]] move used in  [[professional wrestling]]. It is a throw that involves lifting the opponent and [[Bridge (grappling)|bridging]] or rolling to slam the opponent on their back.\n\nProfessional wrestling features many different varieties of suplexes. The following are among the most common, but many more exist, particularly as the signature techniques of individual wrestlers.\n\n==Front facelock variants==\nIn these suplexes, the wrestlers begin by facing each other, the attacking wrestler then applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] to the opponent before executing a throw. In most cases, the opponent is suspended upside-down during part of the move. The most common front facelock suplex is the [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]].\n\n===Fisherman suplex{{anchor|Fisherman's suplex}}===\nAlso known as a fisherman's suplex and also known as a leg hook suplex. With their opponent in a [[professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] with the near arm draped over the attacker's shoulder, the wrestler hooks the opponent's near leg behind the opponent's knee with their free arm and falls backwards, flipping the opponent onto their back. In most cases the attacking wrestler will keep the leg hooked and bridge to pin the opponent in a cradle-like position, as in the case of [[Curt Hennig]] and [[Curtis Axel|Joe Hennig]]'s ''Perfect-plex''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-45|title=the 50 coolest maneuvers of all time - Perfect-plex|date=2014-02-21|accessdate=2014-05-04|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Other times the wrestler will apply a [[Professional wrestling holds#Leg locks|leglock submission hold]] to the hooked leg.\n\n====Swinging fisherman suplex====\nMore commonly referred to as swinging fisherman neckbreaker. A swinging variation of the standard fisherman suplex, this move sees a wrestler, with their opponent in a front facelock with the near arm draped over their shoulder, hook the opponent's near leg with their free arm and roll over to the same side of the arm being used to hook the opponent's leg, flipping the opponent over onto their back.\n\n===Hammerlock suplex===\nIn this variation of the suplex, the attacker applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Hammerlock|hammerlock]] on his opponent before applying a front facelock and positioning the opponent's free arm over the attacker's head. The attacker then lifts up the opponent and falls backwards, dropping the opponent down back first, landing with their trapped arm bent behind their back.\n\n===Slingshot suplex===\nThe attacker faces a standing opponent with one side of the ring immediately behind the opponent. The attacker applies a front facelock to the opponent, takes hold of the opponent with their free hand, then lifts the opponent until he/she is nearly vertical. The attacker then falls forward so that the torso of the opponent bounces off the top ring rope, and uses this momentum to quickly lift the opponent overhead once more and falls backwards, driving the back and shoulders of the opponent into the ground.\n\n===Suplex slam===\nThis move is similar to most suplexes and starts with the attacker applying a front face lock to their opponent and draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, then lifting him/her up and holding the opponent in the vertical position. This is where the move differs from most of its counterparts with the attacker not falling with the opponent, but rather shifting themselves slightly and throwing their opponent to the mat on his back. Sometimes this involves the wrestler turning the opponent in midair and slamming the opponent down to the mat ''in front'' of him/her onto their back, similar to a high-angled [[Professional wrestling throws#Body slam|body slam]]. The suplex slam can also be used for other suplexes such as the [[Suplex#Fisherman suplex|fisherman suplex]] or [[Suplex#Gutwrench suplex|gutwrench suplex]].\n\nThere is also a sitout version. Also called a suplex [[Professional wrestling throws#Driver|driver]], this sees an attacker apply a [[professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] to the opponent and drapes the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then takes hold of the opponent's torso with their free arm and lifts the opponent to a vertical position. The facelock is loosened so the opponent can be twisted slightly, then the attacker falls to a sitting position and the victim's back and shoulders are driven into the mat. The opponent lands between the attacker's legs with their head toward them.\n\nAnother variation sees the wrestler perform a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]], but instead of twisting the upside down opponent to face them, the wrestler turns 180\u00b0 to face the opponent before sitting down and driving them back first between their legs.\n\n====Reverse suplex slam{{anchor|Inverted suplex slam|Front suplex|Gourdbuster}}====\nAlso called a front suplex or a gourdbuster, this move sees the attacker apply a front face lock to the opponent and drape the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then lifts the opponent into a vertical position, then he falls or kneels forward, driving the opponents face into the ground. A standing version also exists. It was invented by [[Arn Anderson]]\n\nIn the sitout version, the attacker applies a front face lock to the opponent and drapes the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The attacker then lifts the opponent into a vertical position, and falls into a sit-out position, driving the face of the opponent into the ground. In another variation, the wrestler releases the hold just prior to the sitout position letting his opponents own momentum to force them down head first.\n\n===Superplex===\n[[File:Cesaro superplex.jpg|thumb|[[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] performing a superplex on [[Jack Swagger]]]]\nA superplex (a portmanteau of \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Super|super]]\" and \"suplex\") refers to any suplex performed by an attacker standing on the second or third rope against an opponent sitting on the top rope or top turnbuckle. The most common suplex used for this top rope move is the standard [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] variation (known as the suicide-plex), in which the attackers apply a front face lock to the opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their respective shoulders, at this point the wrestler falls backwards and flips the opponent over them so they both land on their backs.\n\n===Tornado suplex===\nIn a set-up similar to a [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Tornado DDT|tornado DDT]], a wrestler goes to the top rope and applies a front facelock on their opponent from an elevated position, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder. The wrestler then jumps forward and swings around, but lands on their feet and performs a suplex on their opponent.\n\n===Vertical suplex===\n[[File:Ryze suplex on Hooker.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A wrestler performing a vertical suplex on an opponent]]In a set-up similar to a snap suplex, the attacking wrestler applies a front face lock to the opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, when the opponent is in position they are lifted to an upside-down position before the attacking wrestler falls backwards slamming the opponent's back into the mat.\n\nThe delayed variation of a vertical suplex, also known as the hanging suplex, standing suplex or stalling suplex, sees the attacking wrestler holds an opponent in the upside-down position at the peak of the arc for several seconds before completing the maneuver, thereby (in [[kayfabe]]) causing blood to pool into the head of the opponent. This move is a staple of larger and powerful wrestlers as it gives an aura of dominance over their opponents who can do nothing but wait to drop in the suplex.\n\nThe rotating variation of a vertical suplex, also sometimes known as the rotation suplex, rotary suplex, or twisting suplex, sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but turn around as he or she falls back to twist the opponent into the mat.\n\n====Drop suplex====\nThis variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but then simply drop them flat to the mat instead of falling backwards with them. The move was first popularized in WCW by [[Kevin Nash]], who began to use it instead of a standard suplex to avoid aggravating a back injury.\n\n====Rolling release suplex====\nThis variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]], also known as the ''[[EZ Money#In wrestling|Crash Landing]]'', sees the attacker lift his opponent up with the standard suplex lift but instead of falling backwards and having the opponent drop down onto his shoulders and back, the attacker turns the opponent and releases them from the [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] at the apex of the lift. Both the attacker and the opponent fall forward, with the opponent landing on his neck, shoulders and back.\n\n====Rolling non-release suplex====\nAlso known as triple rolling verticals, or triple rolling vertical suplexes, this variation of a [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler perform a single vertical or [[#Snap suplex|snap]] suplex to the opponent, but the attacking wrestler doesn't release the hold, instead rolling his legs and body into a standing position to execute a second suplex, then repeats the process for a third suplex. This was popularized by [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] Hall of Famer [[Eduardo Gory Guerrero Llanes|Eddie Guerrero]] used this move calling it the ''Three Amigos''. Many other WWE superstars used this move to pay tribute to him such as  [[Chavo Guerrero Jr.|Chavo]] and [[Tyler Black|Seth Rollins]].\n\n====Running suplex====\nThis variation is similar to a classic suplex including the attacking wrestlers begins with a standard [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] and then when he starts lifting opponent, he makes a few running steps forward while continue the suplex rotation, slamming the opponent back-first onto the mat.\n\n====Snap suplex====\n[[File:Brie Bella Suplex.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Brie Bella]] setting up a snap suplex on [[Aksana (wrestler)|Aksana]] at [[WrestleMania XXX]]]]\nThis move sees the attacker apply a front face lock to their opponent, draping the opponent's near arm over their shoulder, the attacker stomps down hard and suplexes the opponent stiffly, resulting in a quicker throw.\n\n===Toss suplex===\nThis variation of [[#Vertical suplex|vertical suplex]] sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent as in a normal vertical suplex, but then simply toss them across the mat instead of falling backwards with them.\n\n=== Jumping suplex ===\nInstead of just falling down onto his/her own back, the attacking wrestler jumps up and uses his momentum to drive the opponent down to the mat back first.\n\n===Underhook suplex{{anchor|Half hatch suplex|Half-hatch suplex}}===\nAlso known as a half-hatch suplex. It is performed in similar fashion to a [[Suplex#Snap suplex|snap suplex]]. The wrestler applies a [[Professional wrestling holds#Front facelock|front facelock]] with one arm but instead of draping the arm over their shoulders as seen in most suplexes, the attacker [[underhook]]s one of the opponent's arms with their other, placing their hand palm down on the back of the opponent. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up while bridging backwards, bringing the opponent overhead and onto their back. This can be performed with or without a pinning combination in which the wrestler bridges their back and legs to hold the opponent's shoulders against the mat. It can also be done with a kick for an added snap effect.\n\n==Belly-to-back variants==\nIn these variants, the attacker stands behind his opponent and applies a hold before falling backwards, dropping the opponent on his or her upper back. The most common belly-to-back variants are the [[#German suplex|German suplex]] and the [[#Belly-to-back suplex|back suplex]].\n\n===Belly-to-back suplex{{anchor|Belly to back suplex|Back suplex}}===\n[[File:Pepper Parks belly-to-back suplex.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[Pepper Parks]] (bottom) performing a belly-to-back suplex on RJ City.]]\nFor the belly-to-back suplex, the wrestler stands behind his opponent and puts his head under the arm of the opponent. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up grabbing the waist and thigh of the opponent, so the opponent is on the attacker's shoulder. The attacker finally falls backwards, dropping the opponent flat on his back.<ref name=toa>[http://www.otherarena.com/nCo/finish/finish.html Finishing move list, from TheOtherArena.com]</ref><ref name=bbowm>[http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part1.htm Big Book of Wrestling Moves, from DeathValleyDriver.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506000024/http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part1.htm |date=2013-05-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome wrestlers perform the back suplex into a bridging position, simultaneously arching their own back and legs to elevate themselves, gaining leverage and [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pinning]] their opponent. Very popular in [[Mexico]]'s [[Lucha Libre]], where this bridging version is known as a '''Puente Griego''' or Greek Bridge in [[English language|English]]. In 2018, the Colombian referee [[Wilmar Roldan]] announced a campaign to introduce this variant of the suplex to international soccer.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=\nSpostamento di wrestling da introdurre nel calcio internazionale? |trans-title=Wrestling move to be introduced to international soccer? |newspaper=Gazzetta Dello Sport|location=Milan |date=2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\nSince the wrestler taking the move is falling backwards, the potential for injury is significant if it is not performed properly. Japanese wrestler [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] suffered a spinal injury which triggered a fatal cardiac arrest during his last match in 2009 after [[Akitoshi Saito]] gave him the belly to back suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/9617/|title=Misawa Passes Away After Backdrop In Hiroshima Match|publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online|date=2009-06-13|accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref><ref name=\"Slam\">{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2009/06/13/9788666.html|title=Japanese legend Mitsuharu Misawa dies in the ring|author=Schramm, Chris|work=Slam!

He then lifts the opponent up using both of his arms wrapped around the torso of the opponent. The attacker finally falls backwards to drive the opponent to the mat on their neck and shoulders.\n\n====Leg hook belly-to-back suplex====\nSometimes referred to as a leg lift back suplex or leg lift backdrop, it is applied just as a back suplex would be, except that the wrestler wraps only the near arm or no arm around the torso of their opponent. With the free arm(s), the wrestler then hoists their opponent's knees or thighs and throws them backwards in that manner.\n\n====Cobra clutch suplex====\nThe attacker places the opponent in a [[professional wrestling holds#Cobra clutch|cobra clutch hold]]. They then proceed to lift the opponent up and fall backwards, driving the opponent to the mat on their head.\n\n====Crossface chickenwing suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent. He locks one of the opponent's arms in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Chickenwing|chickenwing]], and [[professional wrestling holds#Crossface|wraps his other arm around the opponent's head]]. He then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, driving the opponent on to the top of their head, down to the mat.\n\n====Crotch clutch suplex====\nThis move involves the attacking wrestler approaching an opponent from behind, reaching down and grasping his crotch with both forearms, with hands together and facing upwards into his groin, and lifting him overhead into a belly-to-back release suplex. The opponent reacts to both the suplex and being grabbed and lifted by his crotch, to humorous effect. The move was popularized by [[Joey Ryan (wrestler)|Joey Ryan]], who dubs it the \"[[YouPorn]] Plex\".<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/youporn-signs-joey-ryan-wrestlings-king-of-dong-style-40940/|title=YouPorn Signs Joey Ryan, Wrestling\u2019s 'King of Dong Style'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=James|last=Montgomery|date=December 18, 2015|accessdate=January 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Dragon suplex{{anchor|Full nelson suplex}}====\nThis belly-to-back suplex variation sees the wrestler apply a [[nelson hold#Full nelson|full nelson]] and then bridge his back, lifting the opponent over him and onto their shoulders down to the mat. The wrestler keeps his back arched and the hold applied, [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] the opponent's shoulders down to the mat. The wrestler may also release the opponent mid-arch, throwing them down to the mat shoulders and neck first, in a variation known as release dragon suplex.\n\n====Electric chair suplex====\nAlso known as an [[Professional wrestling throws#Electric chair drop|electric chair slam]]. The wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in an [[Professional wrestling holds#Electric chair|electric chair]] sitting position and then bridges his back, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first.\n\n====German suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent, grabs them around their waist, lifts them up, and falls backwards while bridging his back and legs, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first. The wrestler keeps the waistlock and continues bridging with their back and legs, pinning the opponent's shoulders down against the mat. The regular pinning variation can be referred to as the German suplex pin. The wrestler can also release the opponent in mid arch, which is referred to as a release German suplex. Sometimes, rather than bridging for a pin, the wrestler may roll himself into another position to perform the move again, often referred to as multiple, rolling, or non-release German suplexes, in which the attacking wrestler performs a German suplex, then rolls his legs to get back into a standing position, but does ''not'' let the opponent go to do so. The attacking wrestler then repeats this numerous times, most commonly three, but sometimes up to eight or more. The most common WWE superstar that uses the manoeuvre is Brock Lesnar.\n\n====Straight jacket suplex{{anchor|X-Plex|X-plex}}====\n[[File:Adam Cole straightjacket german suplex.jpg|thumb|[[Adam Cole]] performing straight jacket suplex on [[Kevin Owens|Kevin Steen]]]]\nThe [[Professional wrestling holds#Straight jacket|straight jacket]] suplex or package German suplex has the attacker trapping the opponent's arms while performing a German suplex. Variants such as the cross-arm suplex or X-Plex see the opponent's arms crossed across their chest and held by the attacker. The wrestler then uses the crossed arms as leverage to aid in lifting the opponent up while falling backwards to throw the opponent as in a German suplex.\n\n====Half and half suplex====\nThis is a suplex variation in which the wrestler, while standing behind the opponent, places one arm in a [[nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] and the other arm in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Chickenwing|chickenwing]]. The wrestler then proceeds to fall backwards while lifting the opponent overhead in the hold and driving them into the mat behind them. This move is referred to as a half and half suplex as it is a combination of a [[#Half nelson suplex|half nelson suplex]] and a [[#Tiger suplex|tiger suplex]].\n\n====Half nelson suplex====\nThis is a version of a [[#German suplex|German suplex]] where the attacker stands behind the opponent, facing the same direction. The attacker uses one hand to apply a [[nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] hold and wraps the other hand around the opponent's waist. The attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, dropping the opponent on their head, neck, or shoulders.\n\n====Pumphandle suplex====\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent and bends him forward. One of the opponent's arms is pulled back between his legs and held, while the opponent's other arm is hooked by the attacker maneuvering his arm around in front of the opponent's shoulder (as in a [[professional wrestling holds#Pumphandle|pumphandle]]) and securing it behind the head (a [[nelson hold#Quarter nelson|quarter-nelson]]). The attacker then lifts his opponent up over his head and falls backwards to slam the opponent against the mat back-first.\n\nThere are many variations of the pumphandle suplex, including the maintaining of the grip in order to land the opponent on the mat face-first, or inverting the opponent's body position and securing the opponent's free arm using a [[nelson hold#Quarter nelson|half-nelson grip]] instead of the normal quarter-nelson.\n\n====Sleeper suplex====\nThe attacker places the opponent in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Sleeper hold|sleeper hold]] and then hooks one of the opponents arms with his free arm. The attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, driving the opponent on their head. A slight variation sees the attacker apply a [[kata ha jime|half nelson choke]] instead of the sleeper hold before performing the suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-16 |title=the 50 coolest maneuvers of all time|date=2014-02-21|accessdate=2014-03-13|publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\n====Three-quarter nelson suplex====\nThe attacker stands behind the opponent, facing the same direction. The wrestler then pass both of his arms under the opponent's arms and puts one arm in a half nelson and the other hand around the neck in front of the opponent, like in a sleeper. The hand in front of the neck is locked with the other hand at the wrist. With the grip secure, the attacker then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, dropping the opponent on their head, neck, or shoulders. The move can end in a release or bridging position.\n\n====Tiger suplex {{anchor|Double chickenwing suplex}}====\n[[File:Tiger suplex by Tsukushi.JPG|thumb|220px|[[Tsukushi (wrestler)|Tsukushi]] performing a tiger suplex on [[Sendai Sachiko]].]]\nInnovated by [[Alfonso Dant\u00e9s]] and popularized by the original [[Tiger Mask (professional wrestling)|Tiger Mask]] ([[Satoru Sayama]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/07/30/6312326.html|title=Mexican great Alfonso Dant\u00e9s dies|author=Schramm, Chris|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2010-02-21|date=July 31, 2008}}</ref> this move sees the wrestler standing behind their opponent, [[Professional wrestling holds#Double chickenwing|hooks both of the opponent's arms from the sides]], and places their hands palm down flat against the opponent's upper back. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up and falls backwards, arching their back and legs and then slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and neck first. Like other suplex variations, this move can either end in a bridging pin or be released upon execution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://headlockbackdrop.wordpress.com/2010/12/15/12-tiger-suplex/|title=Tiger suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=Headlocks&Backdrops}}</ref>\n\n====Wheelbarrow suplex====\nThis move is performed when a wrestler wraps a forward-facing opponent's legs around their waist, in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Wheelbarrow|wheelbarrow hold]], from either standing behind an opponent who is laying face-first on the mat or by catching a charging opponent before then applying a waistlock to lift the opponent up off the ground into the air, then the attacking wrestler would continue lifting the opponent over their while falling backwards to hit belly-to-back suplex.\n\n==Belly-to-belly variants==\nIn these suplexes, the wrestlers begin by facing each other. The attacker then applies a bodylock before falling backwards and flipping the opponent onto his back and down on the mat.\n\n===Belly-to-belly suplex{{anchor|Belly to belly suplex}}===\n[[File:Bayley performing a Bayley-to-belly suplex on Alexa Bliss.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] performs a Bayley-to-belly suplex (belly-to-belly suplex) on [[Alexa Bliss]]]]\nThe wrestler wraps their arms around the opponent in a waistlock or a bodylock position and flips them over by violently bridging their own body so the opponent lands on their back. This can be done either overhead or to the side. For a side belly-to-belly suplex, the attacker usually holds on to the opponent for the duration of the move, but for the overhead belly-to-belly suplex, the attacker usually executes an overhead throw and lets go of the opponent. It can also be performed in a \"snap\" fashion, where the attacker stomps down hard and suplexes the opponent stiffly, resulting in a quicker throw.\n\n====Capture suplex====\nThe attacker stands facing a standing opponent. The attacker then catches one leg of the opponent and pulls the opponent towards them so that they are face-to-face, with the attacker reaching under the opponent's leg and hooking it. The attacker then uses their free arm to reach behind the neck of the opponent and take hold of them. The attacker then quickly bridges backwards and releases the opponent, throwing them overhead, or turns 180\u00b0 while slamming the opponent down to the mat. This move can be used to counter a kick. The move is also known as the head and leg suplex, and can be seen as a variation of the head and arm suplex.\n\n====Double underhook suplex{{anchor|Double arm suplex|Butterfly suplex}}====\nAlso known as a double arm suplex, reverse nelson suplex, double axe handle suplex, and a butterfly suplex, the wrestler and opponent face each other, the opponent bent forward. The wrestler hooks the opponent's arms back in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Butterfly|reverse nelson]], placing his forearms in the crooks of the opponent's elbows, with his hands on top of the opponent's back in a butcher's grip. The wrestler then lifts the opponent into an upside-down vertical position and falls back, shifting the opponent to one side as the opponent flips over. The wrestler executing the suplex may release the reverse nelson hold during the throw, or can maintain the grip and attempt a bridging pin or submission hold transition upon impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestling.wonderhowto.com/how-to/do-butterfly-suplex-315172/|title=Double underhook suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=WonderHowTo}}</ref>\n\n====Exploder suplex====\n[[File:Shelton Benjamin - T-Bone Suplex.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shelton Benjamin]] hits a variant of the T-Bone suplex, with a powerslam pin, on [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]].]]\nThe attacker stands facing his opponent and positions himself under one of the opponent's arms and wraps his arm around the opponent's neck and back (this position is similar to that of a [[Powerslam|side slam]]) and then grabs the leg of the opponent and tosses him backwards, over the attacker's head. Several other variations exist, such as the wrist-clutch exploder suplex (often called '''Exploder '98''') and the bridging exploder suplex (also called '''Blizzard Suplex''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://headlockbackdrop.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/17-exploder-suplex/|title=Exploder suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=Headlocks&Backdrops}}</ref>\n\n====Head-and-arm suplex====\nAlso called a gargoyle suplex, the move is a variation of the traditional overhead belly-to-belly suplex in which the wrestler, standing face-to-face with his opponent, clutches his hands together having firmly encircled the opponent's head and one arm.  This grip, as opposed to the waistlock of a normal belly-to-belly, is then used to hoist the opponent in the overhead arching throw.\n\n====Northern Lights suplex{{anchor|Northern lights suplex}}====\n[[File:Alicia Fox Northern lights suplex on Dana Brooke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alicia Fox]] performs a Northern Lights suplex w/ bridge on [[Dana Brooke]]]]\nFounder\u3000: Hiroshi Hase(Japanese Minister).The attacking wrestler puts his head under the arm of the opponent, wraps his arms around the waist of the opponent and flips him/her backwards. This suplex can either be released or bridged into a pin. The wrestler can also float over into another Northern Lights suplex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestling.wonderhowto.com/how-to/do-northern-lights-suplex-pro-wrestling-move-417507/|title=Northern Lights suplex|accessdate=2013-06-06|publisher=WonderHowTo}}</ref>\n\n====Table top suplex====\n{{see also|[[Professional wrestling throws#Fallaway slam|Fallaway slam]]}}\nAlso known as a fallaway slam, the wrestler lifts the opponent up so the opponent is horizontal across the wrestler's body then falls backward, throwing the opponent over their head down to the mat back-first. This slam can be either bridged into a pin, or the wrestler can float over into another fallaway slam. This move is sometimes used as a continuation move from catching the opponent's high-cross body, to emphasize the wrestler's strength.\n\n====Trapping suplex====\nThis is when a wrestler holds both the opponent's arms under his own (known as ''overhooks'' in mixed martial arts and amateur wrestling, as the arms loop under the opponent's arms from above) with the hands connected below the opponent's triceps, from here the opponent is left secure and unable to counter or move away from the attacker while he/she delivers a belly-to-belly throw flipping the opponent overhead in the normal belly-to-belly motion. In amateur wrestling and other contact-sports, the trapping suplex is called the suicide throw. It is done slightly differently, usually the opponent is tossed to the side and lands on their back.\n\nThis move consists of one wrestler picking up his or her opponent off the ground (or mat) and then using a large portion of his or her own body weight to drive the opponent down on the mat. He or she begins face-to-face, then the attacker forces the opponent's head down and locks the opponent's arm around it.\n\n==Side variants==\nIn the side variants the attacker stands to the side of his or her opponent and applies a hold before falling backwards to slam the opponent to the mat. The most common is the [[#Saito suplex|Saito suplex]].\n\n===Gutwrench suplex===\nThis throw involves a wrestler standing on one side of a prone opponent locking both arms around the opponent's waist [[Professional wrestling holds#Gutwrench|near arm in front of the opponent and far arm behind]], and lifting him/her up to slam him/her over back-first down to the mat. An inverted version also exists.\n\n===Saito suplex===\nThe attacker stands either facing directly one of their opponent's sides or slightly behind in an angle. He places the opponent's near arm over his shoulder, grabs a waistlock, and then lifts the opponent up while falling backwards, causing the opponent to land on their neck and shoulders.\n\n[[File:Allysin Kay Cut-Throat.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Allysin Kay]] performing a Leg-hook Saito suplex]]\nThere is also a leg-hook variation where the attacker stands behind and to one side of the opponent. The attacker wraps one arm around the waist of the opponent and grabs the back of the opponent's near leg with their other arm. The attacker then lifts the opponent on to their shoulder and then falls backwards, driving the opponent into the mat at a high angle.\n\n===Side suplex===\n:''See [[Powerslam#Uranage|Ura-nage]] or [[Professional wrestling throws#Russian legsweep|Russian legsweep]].''\nThis move is also known as a sambo suplex or side suplex. To perform it, the wrestler stands face-to-face with the opponent, slightly to their side. The wrestler either reaches across the opponent's chest and around their neck with their near arm and locks both hands behind the opponent's shoulders or just locks both hands behind the opponent's waist. The wrestler then simultaneously lifts the opponent up, twists 180\u00b0 and falls backwards, bringing the opponent over them and slamming the opponent back-first on the mat.\n\nThe name ura-nage (or uranage) comes from a Judo throw which translated directly from Japanese, means \"throw to behind/back\" and is commonly (albeit incorrectly) used to refer to a regular side slam in pro wrestling. The Judo ura-nage throw more closely resembles a saito suplex in execution.\n\n====Cravate suplex====\nThis sees a wrestler lock their opponent in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Three-quarter facelock|cravate]] and pull down with their arms so that the opponent is forced to bend over. The wrestler then positions the opponent so that they are facing across the body of the wrestler and with their head in front of the wrestlers chest while stil standing. The wrestler then falls backwards, pulling upwards with the cravate and forcing the opponent off their feet into the air and over the wrestler, landing on their neck and shoulders.\n\n==Inverted facelock variants==\nIn these suplexes, an attacker begins by facing the back of an opponent and applying an [[Professional wrestling holds#Inverted facelock|inverted facelock]] before executing a throw. In most, the opponent is suspended upside-down during part of the move.\n\n===Inverted suplex===\nAlso known as a reverse suplex, this move sees the attacker stands behind an opponent and applies an inverted facelock with one arm, and uses the other arm to aid in elevating the opponent so that he/she is lifted up and held upside-down before the attacker falls to his back driving the opponent down to the mat face first, behind the attacker.\n\n==In other sports==\nSuplex tackles in [[gridiron football]] are not allowed and may be subject to penalties or even fines.<ref name=\"Moddejonge\">{{cite news|last1=Moddejonge|first1=Gerry|title=Back-to-back interceptions avoid CFL version of Montreal Screwjob|url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2016/08/12/back-to-back-interceptions-avoid-cfl-version-of-montreal-screwjob|accessdate=13 August 2016|work=Edmonton Sun|date=13 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Professional wrestling throws]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121028142636/http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part3.htm \"Professional Wrestling Moves: Part 3\"] Death Valley Driver.com\n*''The Professional Wrestlers' Workout & Instructional Guide'' - [[Harley Race]], [[Ricky Steamboat]], [[Les Thatcher]], and [[Alex Marvez]] pg. 80-84\n{{Wrestling Moves}}\n\n[[Category:Wrestling]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling moves]]\n\n[[de:Liste der Wrestling-Kampftechniken#Suplessen]]\n", "name_user": "JohnCenaBg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex"}

The band currently consist of lead vocalist Dave Faber, lead guitarist Jordan Pritchett, bass guitarist Jeremy \"Krikit\" Liddle and drummer Seamus O'Neill.\n\n==Biography==\nFaber Drive is a four-piece Juno Award-nominated Canadian rock band from Mission, British Columbia. They have toured with bands such as Hedley, Stereos, Marianas Trench, Simple Plan and Metro Station. They have gained a huge amount of popularity in many parts of Canada. Already well known for a local fan base, Faber Drive released a limited-edition three-song EP under the band name Faber. Due to legal issues, the band changed their name to Faber Drive.\n\nDiscovered by [[Chad Kroeger]] of [[Nickelback]] and signed to his [[604 Records]] label, Faber Drive released their debut album ''Seven Second Surgery'' on May 1, 2007, which was followed by the release of four singles. The band's biggest influences are [[U2]], [[The Police]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Stryper]] and [[Winger (band)|Winger]]. The band also featured in the American drama television series ''[[Kyle XY]]''. Two of their songs, \"Killin' Me\" and \"Summer Fades to Fall\", had featured in the show. The band also made an appearance in episode 3.01, \"Psychic Friend\", which aired on January 19, 2009. The band's lead singer Dave Faber is married to Ricarda Faber and has four kids\u2014Faith, David Dayton, Patience and Isaiah.\n\n==Name==\nThe band got their name when Faber and Red were driving and Faber was playing guitar behind the wheel and drove through a red light. Red then said \"Faber drive!\", thus giving them the name Faber Drive. After winning the Fox Seeds competition, they changed their name to Faber Drive to avoid potential legal issues. One of the names they considered before electing Faber Drive was Seven Second Surgery, but they decided it made a better album title than band name.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\nFaber taught \"Red\" how to play drums for a while and asked him if he wanted to audition for his band. Hinsley was referred to Faber by his brother. At first, Dave thought he wasn't what he was looking for. A couple days later, Hinsley invited Faber for some beverages and they just connected. Dave found his lead guitarist. Red and Faber saw Krikit playing bass at an Easter service at the local church. Faber gave him his number, Krikit thought he was trying to make him come to church more often but he was going to stop coming because he had started drinking and didn't feel it was right. When he found out Faber and Red weren't from the church he was overwhelmed. He learned all the songs and played without hesitation three days before the band's first gig. Since then, they have opened for bands such as Nickelback, Hedley and Simple Plan.\n\n===Early years and rise to fame===\nAfter forming Faber, Dave would sign to Chad Kroeger of Nickelback's 604 Records label and hook up with [[Joey Moi]] for pre-production and Brian Howes to co-write with Faber. They then joined Fox's Battle of the Bands and would eventually win. After the band's triumph, they released a [[Faber (EP)|limited edition self-titled EP]]. They would later change their name to Faber Drive to avoid potential legal issues and would go on tour to promote their debut album titled ''[[Seven Second Surgery]]''. Some concerts were partially taped on camera by band members and posted on YouTube. They would release three singles and music videos from ''Seven Second Surgery''. In April 2008, Ray was married and decided to leave the band. Calvin \"Poncho\" Lechner would join Faber Drive's line up and replace Red. They would later release a fourth single titled \"[[Sleepless Nights (Faber Drive song)|Sleepless Nights]]\", concerning a child's point of view of his parents fighting. In the summer of 2008, David Hinsley quit the band. Zubin Thakkar from the band Prize Fighter would come in to replace Hinsley and play in concerts until Faber Drive's last show in October 2008.\n\n===''Seven Second Surgery''===\nFaber Drive's debut album, ''[[Seven Second Surgery]]'', was released on May 1, 2007. Four singles were released from ''Seven Second Surgery'': \"[[Second Chance (Faber Drive song)|Second Chance]]\", \"[[Tongue Tied (Faber Drive song)|Tongue Tied]]\", \"[[When I'm with You (Faber Drive song)|When I'm with You]]\", and \"[[Sleepless Nights (Faber Drive song)|Sleepless Nights]]\" (featuring Brian Melo). While \"Second Chance\" and \"Tongue Tied\" had successful chart positions in the west of Canada, \"When I'm with You\" had its best chart positions in the east.\n\n===''Can't Keep a Secret''===\nThe band's second album, ''[[Can't Keep a Secret]]'', was released on November 10, 2009. The lead single, \"[[G-Get Up and Dance]]\", was produced by Faber, [[Dave Ogilvie|Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie]] ([[Nine Inch Nails]]) and Colin \"Crocker\" Friesen. The single premiered on July 13, 2009, and became available on iTunes on July 21, 2009. Guitarist Jordan Pritchett, son of country singer [[Aaron Pritchett]], and drummer Andrew Stricko joined and replaced Hinsley and Lechner. \"G-Get Up and Dance\" went Gold after five weeks and reached number 6 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]].\n\n===''Lost in Paradise''===\nThe band released their third studio album, ''Lost in Paradise'', on August 28, 2012. Since the album's release, Faber Drive has shot and released music videos for the songs \"Do It in Hollywood\", \"Candy Store\" and \"Life Is Waiting\". And before they released their new single \"Life Is Waiting\", [[Andrew Stricko]] left the band and Seamus O'Neill replaced him. The band headed across Canada on the successful Lost in Paradise tour in Fall/Winter 2012. They have since visited [[Singapore]] to perform two shows for Music Matters and performed at some music festivals during the summer of 2013. They have since released two more singles from their third studio album, \"Too Little Too Late\" (featuring [[Pierre Bouvier]] of [[Simple Plan]]) and \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" (featuring Proper Villains). But the Music Videos are still not made. Therefore, the Official Lyric Video of \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" is already made by [[Warner Music Philippines]]. Note: (The single \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" [featuring Proper Villains] is the promotional single in Philippines).\n\n===2014 to present===\nIn April 2014, Faber Drive announced that they would play at Spring Fest 2014 at Kal Tire Place in Vernon, British Columbia, featuring [[Kardinal Offishall]], [[Karl Wolf]], [[JRDN]] and [[These Kids Wear Crowns]]. On May 23, 2014, the show was cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. Simple Plan toured with Faber Drive in June 2014 in Kirkland Lake, Canada, marking Faber Drive's last show of 2014. They later released two demos from their fourth album, \"The Best of Me\" and \"Gonna Make It\". On July 24, 2015, the band held an acoustic mini-show at Highstreet in Abbotsford, British Columbia.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn January 2016, Faber Drive posted on their official Facebook account that they would have new exciting things possibly happening that year. Then, they started to post some photos from their past concerts and music videos from their previous albums. Six months later, the band posted a photo that Dave is already back in the studio and they hinted that they would release new music shortly. On December 4, 2016, they held a reunion concert with their friends and special guests at the Hard Rock Casino in Vancouver. Following this, they released a Christmas song called \"We 3 Kings\". On March 13, 2017, they released new demos from their upcoming album \u2015 \"More Than Perfect\",\"Without\",\"Without a Fight\", \"One Million\" and \"Done My Best\". On August 5, 2018, they released a new single called \"Surrender\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Members==\n\n===Current members===\n*Dave Faber \u2013 lead vocals, guitar <small>(2004\u2013present)</small>\n*Jeremy \"Krikit\" Liddle \u2013 bass, vocals <small>(2004\u2013present)</small>\n*Jordan \"JP\" Pritchett \u2013 lead guitar, vocals <small>(2008\u2013present)</small>\n*Seamus O'Neill \u2013 drums, vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n\n===Former members===\n*Ray 'red' Bull \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]], [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] <small>(2004\u20132008)</small>\n*David Hinsley \u2013 [[lead guitar]], backing vocals <small>(2004\u20132008)</small>\n*Calvin Lechner \u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n*[[Andrew Stricko]] \u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(2009\u20132012)</small>\n\n===Touring members===\n* Zubin Thakkar \u2013 lead guitar and backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n* Simon Nagel \u2013 lead guitar and backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Faber Drive discography}}\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date of release'''\n|'''Title'''\n|'''Label'''\n|-\n|May 1, 2007\n|''[[Seven Second Surgery]]''\n|rowspan=\"3\"| [[604 Records]]\n|-\n|November 10, 2009\n|''[[Can't Keep a Secret]]''\n|-\n|August 28, 2012\n|''[[Lost in Paradise (Faber Drive album)|Lost in Paradise]]''\n|}\n\n===EP===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date of release'''\n|'''Title'''\n|'''Label'''\n|-\n|2005\n|''[[Faber (EP)|Faber]]''\n| [[604 Records]]\n|}\n\n==Awards==\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n| 2007 || \"[[Tongue Tied (Faber Drive song)|Tongue Tied]]\" || [[SOCAN]] No. 1 Song Award || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2008 || rowspan=\"2\"|\"[[Second Chance (Faber Drive song)|Second Chance]]\" || Canadian Radio Music Awards for Best New Group (Hot A/C) of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Juno Awards|Juno]] for Best New Group of the Year || {{nom}}\n|-\n{{end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Faber Drive discography]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/faberdrivetv Faber Drive TV] on [[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.faberdrivefreaks.ning.com Official Faber Drive Street Team]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Faber Drive}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Canadian pop punk groups]]\n[[Category:People from Mission, British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Musical quartets]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from British Columbia]]\n[[Category:2004 establishments in British Columbia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian pop punk band}}\n{{Redirect|Ray Bull|the British psychologist|Ray Bull (psychologist)}}\n{{unreferenced|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = \n| background      = group_or_band\n| image           = [[File:Faberdrivenow.jpg|250 px]]\n| caption         = Faber Drive in 2011.

The lead single, \"[[G-Get Up and Dance]]\", was produced by Faber, [[Dave Ogilvie|Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie]] ([[Nine Inch Nails]]) and Colin \"Crocker\" Friesen. The single premiered on July 13, 2009, and became available on iTunes on July 21, 2009. Guitarist Jordan Pritchett, son of country singer [[Aaron Pritchett]], and drummer Andrew Stricko joined and replaced Hinsley and Lechner. \"G-Get Up and Dance\" went Gold after 5 weeks, reached number 6 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]].\n\n===''Lost in Paradise''===\nThe band released their third studio album, ''Lost in Paradise'', on August 28, 2012. Since the album's release, Faber Drive has shot and released music videos for the songs \"Do It in Hollywood\", \"Candy Store\" and \"Life Is Waiting\". And before they released their new single \"Life Is Waiting\", [[Andrew Stricko]] left the band and Seamus O'Neill replaced him. The band headed across Canada on the successful Lost in Paradise tour in Fall/Winter 2012. They have since visited [[Singapore]] to perform two shows for Music Matters and performed at some music festivals during the summer of 2013. They have since released two more singles from their third studio album, \"Too Little Too Late\" (featuring [[Pierre Bouvier]] of [[Simple Plan]]) and \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" (featuring Proper Villains). But the Music Videos are still not made. Therefore, the Official Lyric Video of \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" is already made by [[Warner Music Philippines]]. Note: (The single \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" [featuring Proper Villains] is the promotional single in Philippines).\n\n===2014 to present===\nIn April 2014, Faber Drive announced that they would play at Spring Fest 2014 at Kal Tire Place in Vernon, British Columbia, featuring [[Kardinal Offishall]], [[Karl Wolf]], [[JRDN]] and [[These Kids Wear Crowns]]. On May 23, 2014, the show was cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. Simple Plan toured with Faber Drive in June 2014 in Kirkland Lake, Canada, marking Faber Drive's last show of 2014. They later released two demos from their fourth album, \"The Best of Me\" and \"Gonna Make It\". On July 24, 2015, the band held an acoustic mini-show at Highstreet in Abbotsford, British Columbia.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn January 2016, Faber Drive posted on their official Facebook account that they would have new exciting things possibly happening that year. Then, they started to post some photos from their past concerts and music videos from their previous albums. Six months later, the band posted a photo that Dave is already back in the studio and they hinted that they would release new music shortly. On December 4, 2016, they held a reunion concert with their friends and special guests at the Hard Rock Casino in Vancouver. Following this, they released a Christmas song called \"We 3 Kings\". On March 13, 2017, they released new demos from their upcoming album \u2015 \"More Than Perfect\",\"Without\",\"Without a Fight\", \"One Million\" and \"Done My Best\". On August 5, 2018, they released a new single called \"Surrender\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Members==\n\n===Current members===\n*Dave Faber \u2013 lead vocals, guitar <small>(2004\u2013present)</small>\n*Jeremy \"Krikit\" Liddle \u2013 bass, vocals <small>(2004\u2013present)</small>\n*Jordan \"JP\" Pritchett \u2013 lead guitar, vocals <small>(2008\u2013present)</small>\n*Seamus O'Neill \u2013 drums, vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n\n===Former members===\n*Ray 'red' Bull \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]], [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] <small>(2004\u20132008)</small>\n*David Hinsley \u2013 [[lead guitar]], backing vocals <small>(2004\u20132008)</small>\n*Calvin Lechner \u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n*[[Andrew Stricko]] \u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(2009\u20132012)</small>\n\n===Touring members===\n* Zubin Thakkar \u2013 lead guitar and backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n* Simon Nagel \u2013 lead guitar and backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Faber Drive discography}}\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date of release'''\n|'''Title'''\n|'''Label'''\n|-\n|May 1, 2007\n|''[[Seven Second Surgery]]''\n|rowspan=\"3\"| [[604 Records]]\n|-\n|November 10, 2009\n|''[[Can't Keep a Secret]]''\n|-\n|August 28, 2012\n|''[[Lost in Paradise (Faber Drive album)|Lost in Paradise]]''\n|}\n\n===EP===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date of release'''\n|'''Title'''\n|'''Label'''\n|-\n|2005\n|''[[Faber (EP)|Faber]]''\n| [[604 Records]]\n|}\n\n==Awards==\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n| 2007 || \"[[Tongue Tied (Faber Drive song)|Tongue Tied]]\" || [[SOCAN]] No. 1 Song Award || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2008 || rowspan=\"2\"|\"[[Second Chance (Faber Drive song)|Second Chance]]\" || Canadian Radio Music Awards for Best New Group (Hot A/C) of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Juno Awards|Juno]] for Best New Group of the Year || {{nom}}\n|-\n{{end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Faber Drive discography]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/faberdrivetv Faber Drive TV] on [[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.faberdrivefreaks.ning.com Official Faber Drive Street Team]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Faber Drive}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Canadian pop punk groups]]\n[[Category:People from Mission, British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Musical quartets]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from British Columbia]]\n[[Category:2004 establishments in British Columbia]]\n", "name_user": "1980fast", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCan't Keep a Secret:Reformat low number; grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faber_Drive"}

Consolidated with ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' (1963), it was heard by the United States [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], which ruled that officially sanctioned mandatory [[Bible]]-reading in American public schools was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court had prohibited officially sponsored prayer in schools in '' [[Engel v. Vitale]]'' (1962) on similar grounds. Through American Atheists, O'Hair filed numerous other suits on issues of separation of church and state.\n\nIn 1995, O'Hair, her second son [[Jon Garth Murray]] (known as \"Garth\"), and her granddaughter and adopted daughter Robin Murray O'Hair (daughter of [[William J. Murray]] (her son) and his high school girlfriend Susan), disappeared from [[Austin, Texas]]. Garth Murray withdrew hundreds of thousands of dollars from American Atheists' funds, and there was speculation that the trio had absconded. David Roland Waters, a convicted felon and former employee of American Atheists, was convicted of murdering O'Hair, Jon Garth Murray, and Robin Murray O'Hair.

I'm not saying that all American men are this way, but nine out of ten are breast-fixated, wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am cretins who just don't give a damn about anyone's gratification but their own. If you're talking about intellectual and social equality for women, we're not much better off. We're just beginning to break the ice. America is still very much a male-dominated society. Most American men feel threatened sexually unless they're taller than the female, more intellectual, better educated, better paid and higher placed statuswise in the business world. They've got to be the authority, the final word. They say they're looking for a girl just like the girl who married dear old dad, but what they really want, and usually get, is an empty-headed little chick who's very young and very physical&nbsp;\u2014 and very submissive. Well, I just can't see either a man or a woman in a dependency position, because from this sort of relationship flows a feeling of superiority on one side and inferiority on the other, and that's a form of slow poison. As I see it, men wouldn't want somebody inferior to them unless they felt inadequate themselves. They're intimidated by a mature woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antitheists.co.uk/madalyn-murray-ohair-playboy-interview.php|title=Madalyn Murray O'Hair Playboy Interview - Antitheist Atheist|access-date=18 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110121546/http://www.antitheists.co.uk/madalyn-murray-ohair-playboy-interview.php#|archive-date=November 10, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nShe also expressed her discontent with the [[women's liberation movement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fECcidFL5NU|title=Madalyn Murray O'Hair 1970 Short Film Part 6|access-date=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Kidnapping and murder==\nOn August 27, 1995, O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray, and her granddaughter and adopted daughter Robin Murray O'Hair disappeared from their home and office.<ref name=\"time\" /> A typewritten note was attached to the locked office door, saying \"The Murray O'Hair family has been called out of town on an emergency basis.

American Atheists was facing serious financial problems because of the withdrawal of funds, and membership dwindled in the face of an apparent scandal. There was speculation that the trio may have disappeared to conceal assets or avoid creditors.<ref name=Epstein-Walker/>\n\n===Investigation and arrests===\nUltimately, the investigation focused on David Roland Waters, an ex-felon with a violent history, who had worked for American Atheists.

Waters had been sentenced to prison for eight years.<ref name=\"manning\" /><ref name=\"preying\" />\n\nFederal agents for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], along with the police, concluded that Waters and his accomplices had kidnapped all three Murray/O'Hair family members, forced them to withdraw the missing funds, gone on several shopping sprees with their money and credit cards, and killed and dismembered all three people.<ref name=Milloy_03_16_2001>{{cite news |title=Bodies Identified as Those of Missing Atheist and Kin |first=Ross E. |last=Milloy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/16/us/bodies-identified-as-those-of-missing-atheist-and-kin.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 16, 2001 |access-date=October 14, 2012}}</ref> Waters' accomplices were Gary Paul Karr and Danny Fry.<ref name=Milloy_03_16_2001 /> A few days after O'Hair and her family were killed, Waters and Karr killed Fry. His body was found on a riverbed with the head and hands missing. It was not identified for three and a half years.<ref name=Milloy_03_16_2001 />\n\nA search warrant was executed for the apartment of Waters and his girlfriend. The search revealed ammunition of various calibers. Waters, a convicted felon, was arrested, and the contents of his apartment were seized.  At the same time, Gary Karr was contacted in [[Walled Lake, Michigan]], and interviewed. Having served the last 30 years in prison for kidnapping a judge's daughter, Karr would not talk. He was read his rights and asked to listen to the information being discussed. Karr decided to talk and implicated Waters in the deaths of Murray and the O'Hairs. Karr signed an affidavit and drew a map so that the police could find the bodies. Karr was arrested for possession of two firearms and taken to jail. He was held in [[Detroit]], awaiting trial. The weapon charge was dismissed, and Karr was transferred to the custody of the United States Marshals in Austin to stand trial for the deaths of the O'Hairs.\n\nAfter a three-week trial, Karr was found guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion, traveling interstate to commit violent acts, money laundering, and interstate transportation of stolen property, all charges related to the O'Hair case. He was acquitted of charges of conspiring to kidnap, because the authorities had not yet located the bodies of the O'Hairs.<ref name=Milloy_03_16_2001 /> In August 2000, Karr was sentenced to two life sentences in prison by U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks.<ref name=Vertuno_01_25_2001>{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&dat=20010125&id=n1IeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8scEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3789,2994716|title=Times Daily - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref>\n\nWaters was arrested and prosecuted; in a plea agreement to the charge of conspiracy, he agreed to lead authorities to the site where the dismembered bodies of the O'Hairs had been burned and buried. He was sentenced to serve 20 years in federal prison, which he had requested, rather than serve time in Texas state prison on his earlier theft conviction. He did not go to trial for the kidnapping and murders of the O'Hair.<ref>The San Antonio Express-News, Jan. 30, 2001 and March 31. 2001.</ref> He was also ordered to pay back a total of $543,665 to the American Atheists and to the estates of Madalyn Murray O'Hair, Jon Garth Murray, and Robin Murray O'Hair. It is unlikely that these debts were paid, because Waters had no ability to earn money while in prison. Waters died of [[lung cancer]] on January 27, 2003 at the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Butner|Federal Medical Center]] in [[Butner, North Carolina]].<ref name=\"manning\" />\n\nIn January 2001, after his plea to conspiracy, Waters told the federal agents that the O'Hairs were buried on a Texas ranch, and subsequently led them to the bodies.<ref name=\"manning\" /><ref name=\"mac\" /> When law enforcement excavated there, they discovered that the legs of the three people had been cut off with a saw. The remains had such extensive mutilation and [[decomposition]] that officials had to identify them through [[Forensic dentistry|dental records]], [[DNA]] testing and, in Madalyn O'Hair's case, records of a prosthetic hip from [[Brackenridge Hospital]] in Austin (the serial number identified her body).<ref name=\"giveaway\">{{cite web| last =MacCormack| first =John| title =Dead Giveaway| work =[[Dallas Observer]]| date =2001-02-01| url =http://www.dallasobserver.com/2001-02-01/news/dead-giveaway/| access-date =2007-12-01}}</ref> The head and hands of Danny Fry were also found at the site.\n\nWaters and his girlfriend had put the gold coins extorted from the O'Hairs in an unsecured storage locker rented by the girlfriend. It had only a cheap [[Master Lock|Master]] padlock.<ref name=\"manning\" /> Waters had taken some coins and partied for a few days with Gary Karr and his former wife. When he returned to the locker, he discovered that the remaining gold coins ([[American gold eagle|American eagles]], [[Canadian Gold Maple Leaf|Maple Leaf coins]], and [[Krugerrand]]s) had been stolen. A group of thieves from San Antonio operating in that area had gained keys to the type of lock used by the girlfriend. In the course of their activities, the thieves had come across the locker, used a key, and found a suitcase full of gold coins. They returned to San Antonio, and with the help of friends, converted the gold coins to cash. The friends were taken to [[Las Vegas]] for a weekend. All but one coin, given as a pendant gift to an aunt, were spent by these thieves. That last coin was recovered by the FBI after a Memorial Day 1999 public appeal.<ref name=\"manning\" />\n\nDuring the case, Austin reporter [[Robert Bryce (writer)|Robert Bryce]] criticized the relative lack of action by the [[Austin Police Department]]. He noted the investigation was being led by agents of the [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and the Dallas County Sheriff's Office.<ref name=\"preying\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\nMurray's 1960 lawsuit against the Baltimore City School System was later consolidated with a similar one from Pennsylvania, when these reached the US Supreme Court on appeal. The Court ruled in 1963 (in ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]])'' that school-sponsored Bible reading in public schools in the United States was unconstitutional. This decision gradually resulted in the end of religious activities sponsored by public schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=People & Ideas: Madalyn Murray O'Hair|url=https://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/people/madalyn-murray-ohair.html|work=God In America|publisher=PBS|access-date=22 January 2016}}</ref> Non-religious students had been expected to participate in such activities, and state-level policies varied.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Cohen|editor1-first=Jean L.|editor2-last=Laborde|editor2-first=Cecile|title=Religion, Secularism, and Constitutional Democracy|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=2016|page=230}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, a memorial brick for Murray, her son [[Jon Garth Murray|Jon]], and her granddaughter Robin was placed at Lou Neff Point in [[Zilker Park]] in Austin, Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2012/04/01/a-memorial-brick-for-the-ohairs/|title=A Memorial Brick for the O\u2019Hairs|first=Friendly|last=Atheist}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the first atheist monument to be erected on American government property was unveiled at the [[Bradford County, Florida|Bradford County]] Courthouse in Florida, where other residents had installed a monument to religious ideals.

It is true that a new case with a different plot and differing actions make it unlike the O'Hair murders in many respects.  But there is an obvious basis in the similar relationships and dynamics of the Murray-O'Hair family, the kidnapping and murder of a famous Atheist woman, a son who had become a born-again Christian minister, another son who was an Atheist, a mixed-up granddaughter, an embezzlement scheme, gold coins, and the criminal ringleader an ex-con and an ex-employee of the Atheist organization and a betrayer of his partners in crime.

In 1963 she founded [[American Atheists]] and served as its president until 1986, after which her son [[Jon Garth Murray]] succeeded her. She created the first issues of ''[[American Atheist Magazine]]''.\n\nO'Hair is best known for the ''[[Murray v. Curlett]]'' lawsuit, which challenged the policy of mandatory prayers and Bible reading in Baltimore public schools, in which she named her first son [[William J. Murray]] as plaintiff. Consolidated with ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' (1963), it was heard by the United States [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], which ruled that officially sanctioned mandatory [[Bible]]-reading in American public schools was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court had prohibited officially sponsored prayer in schools in '' [[Engel v. Vitale]]'' (1962) on similar grounds. Through American Atheists, O'Hair filed numerous other suits on issues of separation of church and state.\n\nIn 1995, O'Hair, her second son [[Jon Garth Murray]] (known as \"Garth\"), and her granddaughter and adopted daughter Robin Murray O'Hair (daughter of [[William J.

Garth Murray withdrew hundreds of thousands of dollars from American Atheists' funds, and there was speculation that the trio had absconded.

I'm not saying that all American men are this way, but nine out of ten are breast-fixated, wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am cretins who just don't give a damn about anyone's gratification but their own. If you're talking about intellectual and social equality for women, we're not much better off. We're just beginning to break the ice. America is still very much a male-dominated society. Most American men feel threatened sexually unless they're taller than the female, more intellectual, better educated, better paid and higher placed statuswise in the business world. They've got to be the authority, the final word. They say they're looking for a girl just like the girl who married dear old dad, but what they really want, and usually get, is an empty-headed little chick who's very young and very physical&nbsp;\u2014 and very submissive. Well, I just can't see either a man or a woman in a dependency position, because from this sort of relationship flows a feeling of superiority on one side and inferiority on the other, and that's a form of slow poison.
