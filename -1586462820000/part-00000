He was the last ruler of the First Saudi State and was executed in Istanbul under the Ottoman Empire. Although the Ottomans maintained several garrisons in the Najd thereafter, they were unable to prevent the rise of the [[Emirate of Nejd]] (the Second Saudi State) led by [[Turki bin Abdallah bin Muhammad bin Saud]].\n\n==Fall of the First Saudi State==\nHe succeeded his father&nbsp;&ndash; [[Saud bin Abdul Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud|Saud]]. Saud had initiated a war with the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the capture of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. Because of his father's conquest, Abdullah immediately had to face an invasion of his domains by an Ottoman-Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the son of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha|Muhammad Ali]]. The Ottoman forces began their campaign by quickly recapturing Mecca and Medina. Heavily outnumbered and under-equipped, the Saudi forces retreated to their stronghold of [[Najd]].\n\nRather than engage the invaders in open battle, Abdullah decided to attempt to weather the invasion by fortifying his forces in the Najd towns. As a result, Ibrahim took the villages of Najd one by one, sacking any town that resisted. Ibrahim finally reached the Saudi capital at [[Diriyah]]. After a siege that lasted several months, Abdullah finally surrendered in the winter of 1818, marking the end of the Saudi state. Ibrahim systematically razed Diriyah to the ground and sent many members of the [[Al Saud]] clan into captivity in Egypt and [[Constantinople]], the Ottoman Empire. Abdullah himself was promptly executed in Constantinople at the order of the Ottoman Sultan.\n\n==Reasons for his execution==\nIn 1801, the tomb of Imam Husayn   was destroyed by the army of Abdullah bin Saud, causing anger among the [[Shia Islam|Shiite Muslims]].<ref name=ssh/> Additionally, there were stories spread upon some people that many people in Islam's holiest cities of Makkah and Madina were killed by his army in the same year. As a result, [[The Ottoman Empire|the Ottoman authorities]] found themselves in a situation that they had to punish the Saudis for their crimes. The guardian of Islam's religious places was the Turkish-Ottoman Caliph in [[Constantinople]], [[Mahmud II]]. Mahmud II ordered that an Egyptian force be sent to the Arabian Peninsula to defeat Abdullah bin Saud and his allies.

He was the last ruler of the First Saudi State and was executed in Istanbul under the Ottoman Empire. Although the Ottomans maintained several garrisons in the Najd thereafter, they were unable to prevent the rise of the [[Emirate of Nejd]] (the Second Saudi State) led by [[Turki bin Abdallah bin Muhammad bin Saud]].\n\n==Fall of the First Saudi State==\nHe succeeded his father&nbsp;&ndash; [[Saud bin Abdul Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud|Saud]]. Saud had initiated a war with the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the capture of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. Because of his father's conquest, Abdullah immediately had to face an invasion of his domains by an Ottoman-Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the son of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha|Muhammad Ali]]. The Ottoman forces began their campaign by quickly recapturing Mecca and Medina. Heavily outnumbered and under-equipped, the Saudi forces retreated to their stronghold of [[Najd]].\n\nRather than engage the invaders in open battle, Abdullah decided to attempt to weather the invasion by fortifying his forces in the Najd towns. As a result, Ibrahim took the villages of Najd one by one, sacking any town that resisted. Ibrahim finally reached the Saudi capital at [[Diriyah]]. After a siege that lasted several months, Abdullah finally surrendered in the winter of 1818, marking the end of the Saudi state. Ibrahim systematically razed Diriyah to the ground and sent many members of the [[Al Saud]] clan into captivity in Egypt and [[Constantinople]], the Ottoman Empire. Abdullah himself was promptly executed in Constantinople at the order of the Ottoman Sultan.\n\n==Reasons for his execution==\nIn 1801, the tomb of Imam Husayn   was destroyed by the army of Abdullah bin Saud, causing anger among the [[Shia Islam|Shiite Muslims]].<ref name=ssh/> Additionally, there were stories spread upon some people that many people in Islam's holiest cities of Makkah and Madina were killed by his army in the same year. As a result, [[The Ottoman Empire|the Ottoman authorities]] found themselves in a situation that they had to punish the Saudis for their crimes. The guardian of Islam's religious places was the Turkish-Ottoman Caliph in [[Constantinople]], [[Mahmud II]]. Mahmud II ordered that an Egyptian force be sent to the Arabian Peninsula to defeat Abdullah bin Saud and his allies. In 1818, an Egyptian army led by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] ([[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammad Ali]]'s son) completely destroyed Abdullah's forces and took their capital, [[Diriyah]] in Najd.

The region that the Diocese comprises extends from its northern border on the south shore of [[Lake Ontario]] through the [[Finger Lakes]] region to its southern border at the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Pennsylvania]] border. \n\nThe Diocese of Rochester comprises 12 counties in New York, with approximately 350,000 Catholics and over 125 faith communities (parishes and chapels), 22 diocesan elementary schools and 7 independent parochial high schools. The bishop of the diocese is currently [[Salvatore Ronald Matano]]. The metropolitan for the diocese is the Archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]], currently Cardinal [[Timothy Dolan]]. The [[cathedral]] [[parish]] for the diocese is [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Rochester)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral - Rochester, New York.jpg|thumb|right|St. Patrick's Cathedral in Rochester (1868-1937)]]\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester began on March 3, 1868, when [[Pope Pius IX]] entrusted eight counties (Monroe, Livingston, Wayne, Ontario, Seneca, Cayuga, Yates, and Tompkins) within the Diocese of Buffalo to [[Bernard J. McQuaid]], the first bishop of Rochester. The new diocese had about 54,500 Catholics in 35 parish churches and 29 mission churches.\n\nIn 1896, the counties of Schuyler, Tioga, Chemung, and Steuben were added to the Diocese of Rochester from the Diocese of Buffalo, forming the current boundaries.\n\nThe diocese grew as Catholic immigrants came to western New York, peaking in the 1960s. Since then, the Catholic population has stabilized while the numbers of ordained presbyters (priests) and [[Religious sister (Catholic)|religious sisters]] has fallen.<ref>[http://www.dor.org/dorhomepage/history.htm Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester - Diocesan History]</ref>\n*In 1909, there were 121,000 Catholics in 93 parishes, 36 missions and 53 parish schools with 18,000 pupils. There were 164 priests and more than 500 sisters.\n*In 1938, there were 223,657 Catholics in 129 parishes, 36 missions and 72 parish schools serving 23,796 pupils. There were 289 active diocesan priests.\n*In 1966, there were 361,790 Catholics in 155 parishes, 36 mission churches and 99 elementary parish schools serving 45,540 pupils. There were 371 active diocesan priests and 1,549 sisters.\n*In 1978, there were 358,850 Catholics in 161 parishes, 29 mission churches and 75 schools serving 19,526 pupils. There were 311 active diocesan priests and 1,095 women religious.\n*In 1992, there were 361,384 Catholics in 162 parishes and 58 elementary schools serving 11,992 pupils. There were 208 active diocesan priests and 842 sisters.\n\nOn September 22, 2017, the Diocese of Rochester inaugurated its sesquicentennial anniversary marked by a solemn Mass at Sacred Heart Cathedral. This event marks a year long celebration of the 150 year anniversary and the year of the Eucharist which was proclaimed by Bishop Salvatore Matano on the Feast of Corpus Christi.\n\n==Reports of sex abuse and bankruptcy==\n\nIn June 2018, it was revealed that the Diocese had secretly paid $1.6 million since 1950 in compensation to 20 sex abuse victims.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/andreatta/2018/06/09/andreatta-diocese-rochester-has-paid-1-6-m-20-sex-abuse-victims/686390002/|title=Andreatta: Diocese of Rochester has paid $1.6 million to 20 sex abuse victims|last=Andreatta|first=David|website=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> Most of the payments occurred after the eruption of the 2002 clergy sex abuse scandal, although some are decades old.

The region that the Diocese comprises extends from its northern border on the south shore of [[Lake Ontario]] through the [[Finger Lakes]] region to its southern border at the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Pennsylvania]] border. \n\nThe Diocese of Rochester comprises 12 counties in New York, with approximately 350,000 Catholics and over 125 faith communities (parishes and chapels), 22 diocesan elementary schools and 7 independent parochial high schools. The bishop of the diocese is currently [[Salvatore Ronald Matano]]. The metropolitan for the diocese is the Archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]], currently Cardinal [[Timothy Dolan]]. The [[cathedral]] [[parish]] for the diocese is [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Rochester)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral - Rochester, New York.jpg|thumb|right|St. Patrick's Cathedral in Rochester (1868-1937)]]\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester began on March 3, 1868, when [[Pope Pius IX]] entrusted eight counties (Monroe, Livingston, Wayne, Ontario, Seneca, Cayuga, Yates, and Tompkins) within the Diocese of Buffalo to [[Bernard J. McQuaid]], the first bishop of Rochester. The new diocese had about 54,500 Catholics in 35 parish churches and 29 mission churches.\n\nIn 1896, the counties of Schuyler, Tioga, Chemung, and Steuben were added to the Diocese of Rochester from the Diocese of Buffalo, forming the current boundaries.\n\nThe diocese grew as Catholic immigrants came to western New York, peaking in the 1960s. Since then, the Catholic population has stabilized while the numbers of ordained presbyters (priests) and [[Religious sister (Catholic)|religious sisters]] has fallen.<ref>[http://www.dor.org/dorhomepage/history.htm Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester - Diocesan History]</ref>\n*In 1909, there were 121,000 Catholics in 93 parishes, 36 missions and 53 parish schools with 18,000 pupils. There were 164 priests and more than 500 sisters.\n*In 1938, there were 223,657 Catholics in 129 parishes, 36 missions and 72 parish schools serving 23,796 pupils. There were 289 active diocesan priests.\n*In 1966, there were 361,790 Catholics in 155 parishes, 36 mission churches and 99 elementary parish schools serving 45,540 pupils. There were 371 active diocesan priests and 1,549 sisters.\n*In 1978, there were 358,850 Catholics in 161 parishes, 29 mission churches and 75 schools serving 19,526 pupils. There were 311 active diocesan priests and 1,095 women religious.\n*In 1992, there were 361,384 Catholics in 162 parishes and 58 elementary schools serving 11,992 pupils. There were 208 active diocesan priests and 842 sisters.\n\nOn September 22, 2017, the Diocese of Rochester inaugurated its sesquicentennial anniversary marked by a solemn Mass at Sacred Heart Cathedral. This event marks a year long celebration of the 150 year anniversary and the year of the Eucharist which was proclaimed by Bishop Salvatore Matano on the Feast of Corpus Christi.\n\n==Reports of sex abuse and bankruptcy==\n\nIn June 2018, it was revealed that the Diocese had secretly paid $1.6 million since 1950 in compensation to 20 sex abuse victims.<ref>https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/andreatta/2018/06/09/andreatta-diocese-rochester-has-paid-1-6-m-20-sex-abuse-victims/686390002/</ref> Most of the payments occurred after the eruption of the 2002 clergy sex abuse scandal, although some are decades old. On June 10, 2019, a man claiming that he had been molested between 1969 and 1971 by local priest Rev. Francis Vogt filed a lawsuit against the Diocese of Rochester and several other local Catholic organizations affiliated the Diocese, claiming that they shielded Vogt from potential prosecution.<ref name=grownnot>https://13wham.com/news/local/victim-sues-diocese-of-rochester-over-claims-of-sexual-abuse-by-priest</ref> On September 12, 2019, the Diocese filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]] in the wake of lawsuits against priests and other ministers who served in the Diocese.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/09/12/rochester-ny-catholic-diocese-bankruptcy-sex-abuse-lawsuits-child-victims-act-cva-chapter-11/2297878001/|title=Diocese bankruptcy: Matano says it was 'a very difficult and painful decision'|last=Orr|first=Steve|date=September 12, 2019|work=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref> <ref name=protectionnotgood /> The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester is the first Catholic diocese in the state of New York to file for bankruptcy and also the 20th Catholic diocese in the U.S. to do so.<ref name=protectionnotgood>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/12/catholic-sex-abuse-rochester-diocese-files-bankruptcy-protection/2308133001/</ref>\n\n==Bishops==\nThe following are lists of bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishops of Rochester===\n# [[Bernard J.

Headquartered in the USA, [[Menlo Park, California]], Noosphere Ventures invests in projects from all over the world mainly focused on space and development of a New Space concept as well as in underperforming businesses. Noosphere Ventures developed the ecosystems of Space-technology.\n\nThe Noosphere space portfolio also includes projects EOS Data Analytics, including EOS SAR; Firefly Aerospace; D-Orbit; Space systems engineering, who is the owner of Space Electric Thruster Systems (SETS), etc.\n\n==== Key people ====\nMax Polyakov - Managing Partner\n\nMark Watt - Consultant\n\nWilliam Woods - Space Entrepreneur consultant\n\nEvgeniy Yakovlev - VP of space business development\n\n== STRATEGIC VISION ==\nStrategic development and expansion in the space sector are one of the primary focus areas of Noosphere Ventures. The company\u00a0 believes that the space industry will adopt the principles of vertical integration, allowing the new generation of space companies to hold control over the launch, satellites, data analysis, communications, and ground stations.\n\nBy versing funds into the development of game-changing space initiatives, we are on the cusp of creating a next-gen business vertical that is to bring about fundamental planet wide changes.\n\n== INVESTMENT TARGETS ==\n\n\nCurrent investment segments of the space ecosystem: \n\n* Orbital transfer vehicles for deploying satellites\n* Space tugs and debris removal systems\n* Component suppliers for small satellites\n* Earth observation and data analysis\n* Ground and communication services\n* Moon projects and commercial deep space exploration missions\n\n== PORTFOLIO ==\nNoosphere, as an investor and a holding company, has invested in 17 currently active companies, though not all of them are in the space industry. Noosphere has averaged between $30 million and $50 million in merger and acquisition-type investments over the past five years.

Burns School of Medicine. Milton Diamond had a long running feud with the psychologist Dr. [[John Money]]. In the early seventies, Diamond and Money were attending a conference on transgenderism in [[Dubrovnik]]. According to the book ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Raised As a Girl'' (p.&nbsp;174)<ref name=\"Colapintobook\">Colapinto, John (2000). ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised As a Girl.'' HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0-06-092959-6}}</ref> at this conference Money initiated a loud and aggressive argument with Diamond. One witness claims that Money punched Diamond; however, Diamond himself said that he could not recall any physical contact during this encounter.\n\n==David Reimer==\nDiamond is known for following up the case of [[David Reimer]], a boy raised as a girl after a botched [[circumcision]], which had been performed using an unconventional method of [[electrocauterization]], rather than more typical methods using a clamp and scalpel, causing his penis to be burned beyond surgical repair.<ref>{{cite book |last=Colapinto |first=John |author-link=John Colapinto |year=2001|title=As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl|url=https://archive.org/details/asnaturemadehim00john |url-access=registration |location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-019211-2\n|pages=[https://archive.org/details/asnaturemadehim00john/page/11 11-13]}}</ref><ref name=BBCHealthCheck>{{cite news |date=23 November 2010 |title=Health Check: The Boy Who Was Raised a Girl |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11814300 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> This case, which Diamond renamed that of \"John/Joan\" to protect Reimer\u2019s privacy, has become one of the most cited cases in the literature of [[psychiatry]], [[anthropology]], [[women's studies]], [[child development]], and [[biology of gender]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} With the cooperation of H. Keith Sigmundson, who had been Reimer\u2019s supervising psychiatrist, Diamond tracked down the adult Reimer and found that [[John Money]]\u2019s sex reassignment of Reimer had failed.
