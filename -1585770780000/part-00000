Kramnik, choosing second because he was the 2nd-highest rated player at the event, chose Caruana as his first round opponent. With the white pieces, Caruana defeated Kramnik to put himself and So in a good position to qualify for the Candidates Tournament. Kramnik's surprise loss to [[James Tarjan]], who quit chess for a few decades to become a librarian, further helped solidify Caruana and So as the ratings qualifiers. Furthermore, Kramnik ended up receiving a wild card into the Candidates event, officially clinching the qualifications for Caruana and So.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kramnik to play 2018 Candidates |url=https://en.chessbase.com/(X(1)S(rg2ylarr0wonrzrhfene5qre))/post/kramnik-to-play-2018-candidates |accessdate=22 June 2018 |work=ChessBase  |date=30 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017 with the Candidates qualification already decided, Caruana rebounded and won his only tournament of the year at the [[London Chess Classic]] in tiebreaks.

(3968109583).jpg|thumb|right|On the southern shore of Issyk Kul lake, [[Issyk Kul Region]].]]\nCentral Asia is an extremely large region of varied geography, including high passes and [[mountain ranges|mountains]] ([[Tian Shan]]), vast [[desert]]s ([[Kyzyl Kum]], [[Taklamakan]]), and especially treeless, grassy [[steppe]]s. The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of [[Eastern Europe]] as a homogeneous geographical zone known as the [[Eurasian Steppe]].\n\nMuch of the land of Central Asia is too dry or too rugged for farming. The [[Gobi desert]] extends from the foot of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], 77\u00b0&nbsp;E, to the [[Great Khingan]] (Da Hinggan) Mountains, 116\u00b0\u2013118\u00b0&nbsp;E.\n\nCentral Asia has the following geographic extremes:\n* The world's northernmost [[desert]] ([[dune|sand dunes]]), at Buurug Deliin Els, [[Mongolia]], 50\u00b018'&nbsp;N.\n* The [[Northern Hemisphere]]'s southernmost [[permafrost]], at Erdenetsogt sum, [[Mongolia]], 46\u00b017'&nbsp;N.\n* The world's shortest distance between non-frozen [[desert]] and [[permafrost]]: {{convert|770|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n* The Eurasian [[pole of inaccessibility]].\n\nA majority of the people earn a living by herding livestock. Industrial activity centers in the region's cities.\n\nMajor rivers of the region include the [[Amu Darya]], the [[Syr Darya]], [[Irtysh]], the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] and the [[Morghab River (Afghanistan)|Murghab River]]. Major bodies of water include the [[Aral Sea]] and [[Lake Balkhash]], both of which are part of the huge west-central Asian [[endorheic]] basin that also includes the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\nBoth of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia and can lead to rather significant international disputes.\n\n== Historical regions ==\n{{Location map+ | Kazakhstan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Kazakhstan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historical regions of Central Asia<br />\non a map of Kazakhstan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=73.37|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=44.00|long=76.95|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=45.00|long=85.00|label=Dzun-<br />garia|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=84.00|label=Tarim_Basin|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n|float=right\n| caption = Historical Regions of Central Asia<br />on a map of Uzbekistan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=40.00|long=72.00|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.50|long=65.00|label=Transoxiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.00|long=65.00|label=(Sogdia)|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=43.00|long=72.00|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.50|long=70.00|label=Bactria|position=bottom|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.00|long=61.90|label=Margiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historic cities of Central Asia<br />Kokand is one of the many towns that rose and fell in the Ferghana Valley\n| places  =\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.70|long=66.98|label=Samarkand|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.77|long=64.33|label=Bukhara|position=left|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.38|long=60.22|label=Khiva|position=top}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=40.53|long=70.93|label=Kokand|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.27|long=69.22|label=Tashkent|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=37.66|long=62.19|label=Merv}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=36.8|long=66.87|label=Balkh}}\n}}\n\nCentral Asia is bounded on the north by the forests of Siberia. The northern half of Central Asia (Kazakhstan) is the middle part of the [[Eurasian steppe]]. Westward the Kazakh steppe merges into the Russian-Ukrainian steppe and eastward into the steppes and deserts of Dzungaria and Mongolia. Southward the land becomes increasingly dry and the nomadic population increasingly thin. The south supports areas of dense population and cities wherever irrigation is possible. The main irrigated areas are along the eastern mountains, along the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]] and [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] Rivers and along the north flank of the [[Kopet Dagh]] near the Persian border. East of the Kopet Dagh is the important oasis of [[Merv]] and then a few places in Afghanistan like [[Herat]] and [[Balkh]]. Two projections of the [[Tian Shan]] create three \"bays\" along the eastern mountains. The largest, in the north, is eastern Kazakhstan, traditionally called [[Jetysu]] or Semirechye which contains [[Lake Balkhash]]. In the center is the small but densely-populated [[Ferghana valley]]. In the south is [[Bactria]], later called Tocharistan, which is bounded on the south by the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of Afghanistan. The [[Syr Darya]] (Jaxartes) rises in the Ferghana valley and the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus) rises in Bactria. Both flow northwest into the [[Aral Sea]]. Where the Oxus meets the Aral Sea it forms a large delta called [[Khwarazm]] and later the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. North of the Oxus is the less-famous but equally important [[Zarafshan River]] which waters the great trading cities of [[Bokhara]] and [[Samarkand]]. The other great commercial city was [[Tashkent]] northwest of the mouth of the Ferghana valley. The land immediately north of the Oxus was called [[Transoxiana]] and also [[Sogdia]], especially when referring to the Sogdian merchants who dominated the silk road trade.\n\nTo the east, Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin were united into the Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] about 1759. Caravans from China usually went along the north or south side of the Tarim basin and joined at [[Kashgar]] before crossing the mountains northwest to Ferghana or southwest to Bactria. A minor branch of the silk road went north of the Tian Shan through Dzungaria and Zhetysu before turning southwest near Tashkent. Nomadic migrations usually moved from Mongolia through Dzungaria before turning southwest to conquer the settled lands or continuing west toward Europe.\n\nThe [[Kyzyl Kum]] Desert or semi-desert is between the Oxus and Jaxartes, and the [[Karakum Desert]] is between the Oxus and [[Kopet Dagh]] in Turkmenistan. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] meant approximately northeast Persia and northern Afghanistan. [[Margiana]] was the region around Merv. The [[Ustyurt Plateau]] is between the Aral and Caspian Seas.\n\nTo the southwest, across the Kopet Dagh, lies Persia. From here Persian and Islamic civilization penetrated Central Asia and dominated its high culture until the Russian conquest. In the southeast is the route to India. In early times Buddhism spread north and throughout much of history warrior kings and tribes would move southeast to establish their rule in northern India. Most nomadic conquerors entered from the northeast. After 1800 western civilization in its Russian and Soviet form penetrated from the northwest.\n\n=== Names of historical regions ===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ariana]]\n* [[Bactria]]\n* [[Dahae|Dahistan]]\n* [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]\n* [[Khwarazm]]\n* [[Margiana]]\n* [[Parthia]]\n* [[Sogdia]]\n* [[Transoxiana]]\n* [[Turan]]\n* [[Turkestan]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\nBecause Central Asia is not buffered by a large body of water, temperature fluctuations are often severe, excluding the hot, sunny summer months. In most areas the climate is dry and continental, with hot summers and cool to cold winters, with occasional snowfall. Outside high-elevation areas, the climate is mostly semi-arid to arid. In lower elevations, summers are hot with blazing sunshine. Winters feature occasional rain and/or snow from low-pressure systems that cross the area from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Average monthly precipitation is extremely low from July to September, rises in autumn (October and November) and is highest in March or April, followed by swift drying in May and June. Winds can be strong, producing dust storms sometimes, especially toward the end of the dry season in September and October. Specific cities that exemplify Central Asian climate patterns include [[Tashkent]] and [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan, [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan, and [[Dushanbe]], Tajikistan, the last of these representing one of the wettest climates in Central Asia, with an average annual precipitation of over 22 inches.\n\nAccording to the [[Biome#WWF system|WWF Ecozones system]], Central Asia is part of the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]]. The largest [[biomes]] in Central Asia are the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome. Central Asia also contains the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] as well as [[temperate coniferous forests]] biomes.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC.

The aridness of the region made [[Agriculture in Central Asia|agriculture]] difficult, and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus, few major cities developed in the region; instead, the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the [[steppe]].\n\nRelations between the [[Eurasian nomads|steppe nomads]] and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict. The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to [[war]]fare, and the steppe [[Horses in warfare|horse riders]] became some of the most militarily potent people in the world, limited only by their lack of internal unity. Any internal unity that was achieved was most probably due to the influence of the [[Silk Road]], which traveled along Central Asia. Periodically, great leaders or changing conditions would organize several tribes into one force and create an almost unstoppable power. These included the [[Huns|Hun]] invasion of Europe, the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] attacks on China and most notably the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] of much of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html A Land Conquered by the Mongols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Three.html |date=23 April 2008 }}</ref>\n[[File:Men from Khiva.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Uzbek men from [[Khiva]], ca. 1861\u20131880]]\nDuring pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, southern Central Asia was inhabited predominantly by speakers of [[Iranian languages]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>C.E.

The [[Tang Dynasty|Tang Chinese]] were defeated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arabs]] at the [[battle of Talas]] in 751, marking the end of the Tang Dynasty's western expansion. The [[Tibetan Empire]] would take the chance to rule portion of Central Asia along with South Asia. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Mongols]] conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history.  Most of Central Asia fell under the control of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]. [[File:SB - Kazakh man on horse with golden eagle.jpg|thumb|[[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] man on a horse with golden eagle]]\nThe dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as [[firearm]]s allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. [[Russia]], [[China]], and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the western Central Asian regions were incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]]. The eastern part of Central Asia, known as East Turkestan or [[Xinjiang]], was [[Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China|incorporated]] into the [[People's Republic of China]]. Mongolia remained independent but became a Soviet [[satellite state]]. Afghanistan remained relatively independent of major influence by the USSR until the [[Saur Revolution]] of 1978.\n\nThe Soviet areas of Central Asia saw much [[Soviet infrastructure in Central Asia|industrialization and construction of infrastructure]], but also the suppression of local cultures, hundreds of thousands of deaths from failed collectivization programs, and a lasting legacy of ethnic tensions and environmental problems.

Thus, [[Yama (East Asia)|Yama]], Lord of Death, was revered in Tibet as a spiritual guardian and judge. Mongolian Buddhism, in particular, was influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] of Qing China in the 18th century was Tibetan Buddhist and would sometimes travel from [[Beijing]] to other cities for personal religious worship.\n\nCentral Asia also has an indigenous form of improvisational [[oral poetry]] that is over 1000 years old. It is principally practiced in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan by ''akyns'', lyrical improvisationists. They engage in [[Freestyle battle|lyrical battles]], the ''aitysh'' or the ''alym sabak''. The tradition arose out of early bardic [[Oral history|oral historians]]. They are usually accompanied by a [[String instrument|stringed instrument]]\u2014in Kyrgyzstan, a three-stringed [[komuz]], and in Kazakhstan, a similar two-stringed instrument, the dombra.\n\nPhotography in Central Asia began to develop after 1882, when a [[Russian Mennonite]] photographer named Wilhelm Penner moved to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] during the Mennonite migration to Central Asia led by [[Claas Epp, Jr.]] Upon his arrival to [[Khanate of Khiva]], Penner shared his photography skills with a local student Khudaybergen Divanov, who later became the founder of [[Uzbek photography]].<ref>Walter Ratliff, \"Pilgrims on the Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khiva\", Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2010</ref>\n\nSome also learn to sing the ''[[Manas (epic)|Manas]]'', Kyrgyzstan's epic poem (those who learn the ''Manas'' exclusively but do not improvise are called ''manaschis''). During Soviet rule, ''akyn'' performance was co-opted by the authorities and subsequently declined in popularity. With the fall of the Soviet Union, it has enjoyed a resurgence, although ''akyns'' still do use their art to campaign for political candidates. A 2005 ''[[The Washington Post]]'' article proposed a similarity between the improvisational art of ''akyns'' and modern [[freestyle rap]] performed in the West.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10646-2005Mar5.html|title=\"In Central Asia, a Revival of an Ancient Form of Rap \u2013 Art of Ad-Libbing Oral History Draws New Devotees in Post-Communist Era\" by Peter Finn, Washington Post Foreign Service, Sunday, March 6, 2005, p.

The first years of the Soviet regime saw the appearance of modernism, which took inspiration from the Russian avant-garde movement. Until the 1980s, Central Asian arts had developed along with general tendencies of Soviet arts. In the 90s, arts of the region underwent some significant changes. Institutionally speaking, some fields of arts were regulated by the birth of the art market, some stayed as representatives of official views, while many were sponsored by international organizations. The years of 1990\u20132000 were times for the establishment of contemporary arts. In the region, many important international exhibitions are taking place, Central Asian art is represented in European and American museums, and the Central Asian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale has been organized since 2005.\n\n=== Sports ===\n[[Equestrianism|Equestrian sports]] are traditional in Central Asia, with disciplines like [[endurance riding]], [[buzkashi]], [[dzhigit]] and [[kyz kuu]].\n\nThe Traditional game of [[Buzkashi]] is played throughout the Central Asian region, the countries sometimes organize Buzkashi competition amongst each other.

The ultimate aim is to emulate the Asian Tigers by becoming the local equivalent, Central Asian snow leopards. However, reform has been deliberately gradual and selective, as governments strive to limit the social cost and ameliorate living standards. All five countries are implementing structural reforms to improve competitiveness. In particular, they have been modernizing the industrial sector and fostering the development of service industries through business-friendly fiscal policies and other measures, to reduce the share of agriculture in GDP. Between 2005 and 2013, the share of agriculture dropped in all but Tajikistan, where it increased while industry descreased. The fastest growth in industry was observed in Turkmenistan, whereas the services sector progressed most in the other four countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nPublic policies pursued by Central Asian governments focus on buffering the political and economic spheres from external shocks. This includes maintaining a trade balance, minimizing public debt and accumulating national reserves. They cannot totally insulate themselves from negative exterior forces, however, such as the persistently weak recovery of global industrial production and international trade since 2008. Notwithstanding this, they have emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009. Growth faltered only briefly in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan and not at all in Uzbekistan, where the economy grew by more than 7% per year on average between 2008 and 2013. Turkmenistan achieved unusually high 14.7% growth in 2011. Kyrgyzstan's performance has been more erratic but this phenomenon was visible well before 2008.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe republics which have fared best benefitted from the commodities boom during the first decade of the 2000s. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have abundant oil and natural gas reserves and Uzbekistan's own reserves make it more or less self-sufficient. Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan all have gold reserves and Kazakhstan has the world's largest uranium reserves. Fluctuating global demand for cotton, aluminium and other metals (except gold) in recent years has hit Tajikistan hardest, since aluminium and raw cotton are its chief exports \u2212 the Tajik Aluminium Company is the country's primary industrial asset. In January 2014, the Minister of Agriculture announced the government's intention to reduce the acreage of land cultivated by cotton to make way for other crops. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are major cotton exporters themselves, ranking fifth and ninth respectively worldwide for volume in 2014.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Central Asia.

Kyrgyzstan has the added disadvantage of being considered resource poor, although it does have ample water. Most of its electricity is generated by hydropower.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe Kyrgyz economy was shaken by a series of shocks between 2010 and 2012. In April 2010, President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was deposed by a popular uprising, with former minister of foreign affairs Roza Otunbayeva assuring the interim presidency until the election of Almazbek Atambayev in November 2011. Food prices rose two years in a row and, in 2012, production at the major Kumtor gold mine fell by 60% after the site was perturbed by geological movements.

Many national research institutions established during the Soviet era have since become obsolete with the development of new technologies and changing national priorities. This has led countries to reduce the number of national research institutions since 2009 by grouping existing institutions to create research hubs. Several of the [[Turkmen Academy of Sciences|Turkmen Academy of Science']]<nowiki/>s institutes were merged in 2014: the Institute of Botany was merged with the Institute of Medicinal Plants to become the [[Institute of Biology and Medicinal Plants]]; the Sun Institute was merged with the Institute of Physics and Mathematics to become the [[Institute of Solar Energy]]; and the Institute of Seismology merged with the State Service for Seismology to become the [[Institute of Seismology and Atmospheric Physics]]. In [[Science and technology in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]], more than 10 institutions of the Academy of Sciences have been reorganized, following the issuance of a decree by the Cabinet of Ministers in February 2012. The aim is to orient academic research towards problem-solving and ensure continuity between basic and applied research. For example, the Mathematics and Information Technology Research Institute has been subsumed under the [[National University of Uzbekistan]] and the Institute for Comprehensive Research on Regional Problems of Samarkand has been transformed into a problem-solving laboratory on environmental issues within [[Samarkand State University]]. Other research institutions have remained attached to the [[Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan|Uzbek Academy of Sciences]], such as the [[Centre of Genomics and Bioinformatics]].<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[Science and technology in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] and [[Science and technology in Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan]] are also building technology parks as part of their drive to modernize infrastructure. In 2011, construction began of a technopark in the village of Bikrova near Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital. It will combine research, education, industrial facilities, business incubators and exhibition centres. The technopark will house research on alternative energy sources (sun, wind) and the assimilation of nanotechnologies. Between 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Nur-Sultan. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies which will be part of the planned Caspian Energy Hub. In addition, the Centre for Technology Commercialization has been set up in Kazakhstan as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups. The centre plans to conduct a technology audit in Kazakhstan and to review the legal framework regulating the commercialization of research results and technology.<ref name=\":13\" />[[File:Trends in GERD GDP ratio in Central Asia, 2001\u22122013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Trends in research expenditure in Central Asia, as a percentage of GDP, 2001\u20132013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: 2030 (2015), Figure 14.3]]Countries are seeking to augment the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors but also to make greater use of information and communication technologies and other modern technologies, such as solar energy, to develop the business sector, education and research. In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources in Uzbekistan, with funding from the [[Asian Development Bank]] and other institutions: the SPU Physical\u2212Technical Institute ([[Physics Sun Institute]]) and the [[International Solar Energy Institute]]. Three universities have been set up since 2011 to foster competence in strategic economic areas: [[Nazarbayev University]] in Kazakhstan (first intake in 2011), an international research university, [[Inha University in Tashkent|Inha University]] in Uzbekistan (first intake in 2014), specializing in information and communication technologies, and the [[International Oil and Gas University]] in Turkmenistan (founded in 2013). Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are both generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have both adopted the three-tier bachelor's, master's and PhD degree system, in 2007 and 2012 respectively, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science. In 2010, Kazakhstan became the only Central Asian member of the [[Bologna Process]], which seeks to harmonize higher education systems in order to create a European Higher Education Area.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Financial investment in research ===\nThe Central Asian republics' ambition of developing the business sector, education and research is being hampered by chronic low investment in research and development. Over the decade to 2013, the region's investment in research and development hovered around 0.2\u20130.3% of GDP. Uzbekistan broke with this trend in 2013 by raising its own research intensity to 0.41% of GDP.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is the only country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development \u2013 but research intensity overall is low in Kazakhstan: just 0.18% of GDP in 2013. Moreover, few industrial enterprises conduct research in Kazakhstan. Only one in eight (12.5%) of the country's manufacturing firms were active in innovation in 2012, according to a survey by the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]]. Enterprises prefer to purchase technological solutions that are already embodied in imported machinery and equipment. Just 4% of firms purchase the license and patents that come with this technology. Nevertheless, there appears to be a growing demand for the products of research, since enterprises spent 4.5 times more on scientific and technological services in 2008 than in 1997.<ref name=\":13\" />\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.

The number of researchers per million population is close to the world average (1,083 in 2013) in Kazakhstan (1,046) and higher than the world average in Uzbekistan (1,097).<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is the only Central Asian country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development. Uzbekistan is in a particularly vulnerable position, with its heavy reliance on higher education: three-quarters of researchers were employed by the university sector in 2013 and just 6% in the business enterprise sector. With most Uzbek university researchers nearing retirement, this imbalance imperils Uzbekistan's research future. Almost all holders of a Candidate of Science, Doctor of Science or PhD are more than 40 years old and half are aged over 60; more than one in three researchers (38.4%) holds a PhD degree, or its equivalent, the remainder holding a bachelor's or master's degree.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.4]]Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have all maintained a share of women researchers above 40% since the fall of the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan has even achieved gender parity, with Kazakh women dominating medical and health research and representing some 45\u201355% of engineering and technology researchers in 2013. In Tajikistan, however, only one in three scientists (34%) was a woman in 2013, down from 40% in 2002. Although policies are in place to give Tajik women equal rights and opportunities, these are underfunded and poorly understood. Turkmenistan has offered a state guarantee of equality for women since a law adopted in 2007 but the lack of available data makes it impossible to draw any conclusions as to the law's impact on research.  As for Turkmenistan, it does not make data available on higher education, research expenditure or researchers.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n'''Table:''' '''PhDs obtained in science and engineering in Central Asia, 2013 or closest year'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" href=\"\u00dcr\u00fcmqi\"\n| href=\"File:Bringing the sheep home, on the southern shore of Issy-Kol.

The growth in exports was more gradual \u2013 from US$2.3 billion to US$3.1 billion \u2013 and dominated by chemical products (other than pharmaceuticals), which represented two-thirds of exports in 2008 (US$1.5 billion) and 83% (US$2.6 billion) in 2013.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== International cooperation ===\nThe five Central Asian republics belong to several international bodies, including the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] and the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]]. They are also members of the [[Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program|Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation]] (CAREC) Programme, which also includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia and Pakistan. In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the ''CAREC 2020 Strategy'', a blueprint for furthering regional co-operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50 billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members' competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems. Only Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan border the [[Caspian Sea]] and none of the republics has direct access to an ocean, complicating the transportation of hydrocarbons, in particular, to world markets.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is also one of the three founding members of the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] in 2014, along with Belarus and the Russian Federation. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan have since joined this body. As co-operation among the member states in science and technology is already considerable and well-codified in legal texts, the Eurasian Economic Union is expected to have a limited additional impact on co-operation among public laboratories or academia but it should encourage business ties and scientific mobility, since it includes provision for the free circulation of labour and unified patent regulations.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":02\">{{cite book |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf |title=Countries in the Black Sea basin.

In 2012, 86 Russian organizations participated, plus three from Belarus, one from Kazakhstan and three from Tajikistan, as well as two scientific research groups from Germany. At the time, Vladimir Debabov, Scientific Director of the Genetika State Research Institute for Genetics and the Selection of Industrial Micro-organisms in the Russian Federation, stressed the paramount importance of developing bio-industry. 'In the world today, there is a strong tendency to switch from petrochemicals to renewable biological sources,' he said. 'Biotechnology is developing two to three times faster than chemicals.'<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan also participated in a second project of the Eurasian Economic Community, the establishment of the Centre for Innovative Technologies on 4 April 2013, with the signing of an agreement between the Russian Venture Company (a government fund of funds), the Kazakh JSC National Agency and the Belarusian Innovative Foundation. Each of the selected projects is entitled to funding of US$3\u201390 million and is implemented within a public\u2013private partnership. The first few approved projects focused on supercomputers, space technologies, medicine, petroleum recycling, nanotechnologies and the ecological use of natural resources. Once these initial projects have spawned viable commercial products, the venture company plans to reinvest the profits in new projects. This venture company is not a purely economic structure; it has also been designed to promote a common economic space among the three participating countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nFour of the five Central Asian republics have also been involved in a project launched by the [[European Union]] in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage [[European Union's scientific cooperation beyond the bloc|Central Asian countries to participate in research projects]] within [[Horizon 2020]], the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research projects is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions \u2013 universities, companies and research institutes \u2013 for funding of up to \u20ac10, 000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe [[International Science and Technology Center]] (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer.

The region itself never held a dominant stationary population nor was able to make use of natural resources. Thus, it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state. Central Asia has been divided, redivided, conquered out of existence, and fragmented time and time again. Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers than as a power in its own right.\n\nCentral Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.\n* To the North, the steppe allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols, and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the Russian Empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports. The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan.\n* To the East, the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia since the [[Silk Road]] period of [[Han Dynasty]]. However, with the Sino-Soviet split and collapse of Soviet Union, China would project its soft power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.\n* To the Southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the [[Hindu Kush]], and slightly beyond. From its base in India, the [[British Empire]] competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n* To the Southwest, Western Asian powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia (usually Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan). Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; Alexander the Great's Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia; two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well. Turkey, through a common [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nation identity, has gradually increased its ties and influence as well in the region. Furthermore, since Uzbekistan announced their intention to join in April 2018, Turkey and all of the Central Asian Turkic-speaking states except Turkmenistan are together part of the [[Turkic Council]].<ref>http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/uzbekistan-decides-to-join-turkic-alliance-during-erdogans-visit-131109</ref>\n\nIn the post\u2013Cold War era, Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the United States:\n* Russia continues to dominate political decision-making throughout the former SSRs; although, as other countries move into the area, Russia's influence has begun to wane though Russia still maintains military bases in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Why Russia Will Send More Troops to Central Asia|url = https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/why-russia-will-send-more-troops-central-asia|website = Stratfor|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}</ref>\n* The United States, with its military involvement in the region and oil diplomacy, is also significantly involved in the region's politics.

U.S. military bases have also been established in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, causing both Russia and the People's Republic of China to voice their concern over a permanent U.S. military presence in the region.\n\nWestern governments have accused Russia, China and the former Soviet republics of justifying the suppression of separatist movements, and the associated ethnics and religion with the War on Terror.\n\n== Major cultural, scientific and economic centres ==\n=== Cities within the regular definition of Central Asia and Afghanistan<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan |title=Afghanistan |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=17 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225235842/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan |archivedate=25 February 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Tan |first1=Anjelica |title=A new strategy for Central Asia |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/international/483511-a-new-strategy-for-central-asia |work=TheHill |date=18 February 2020 |language=en|quote=, as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has noted, Afghanistan is itself a Central Asian country.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Afghanistan {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |publisher=Cambridge University |isbn=9781107619500 |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/afghanistan |language=en}}</ref> ===\n{{Largest cities of Central Asia}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Population\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Image\n! style=\"width:350px;\"|Information\n|-\n| [[Nur-Sultan]]\n| Kazakhstan\n| {{nts|1,006,574}}<br />(2017)\n| [[File:Central Astana on a Sunny, Snowy Day in February 2013.jpg|200px]]\n| The capital and second largest city in Kazakhstan.

However, the later Nikolay Khanikoff also included more of the Central Asian Inland into this definition, including However, Nikolay Khanikoff later included more territory into the Central Asia definition, to include all \"Inland Regions\" of Asia which does not have water flowing into the Oceans, and thus included the areas of present day [[Mongolia]] and [[Inner Mongolia]], the Tibetan Plateau of [[Qinghai]], and [[Tibet]], [[Xinjiang]], the five post-Soviet Stans, Kashmir and the Pamirs, as well as Eastern parts of [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Meanwhile, Richthofen prefers to call the Eastern parts of this region as Central Asia, and the whole as Inner Asia. [19] Nevertheless, these definitive origins were since overshadowed by the Russian definition, who colonized the dominant part of the region since the 19th Century and its definitions shaped the modern English understanding. The Russian definition has two distinct terms: \u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f (Srednyaya Aziya or \"Middle Asia\", the narrower definition, which includes only those traditionally non-Slavic, Central Asian lands that were incorporated within those borders of the [[Russian Empire]] since the nineteenth century) and \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f (Tsentralnaya Aziya or \"Central Asia\", the wider definition, which includes Central Asian lands that have never been part of historical Russia).\n\nThe most limited definition was the official one of the [[Soviet Union]], which defined Middle Asia as consisting solely of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]], hence omitting [[Kazakhstan]]. This definition was also often used outside the USSR during this period.\nSoon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the leaders of the four former [[Soviet Central Asia]]n Republics met in [[Tashkent]] and declared that the definition of Central Asia should include Kazakhstan as well as the original four included by the Soviets. Since then, this has become the most common definition of Central Asia.\n\nThe [[UNESCO]] ''History of the Civilizations of Central Asia'', published in 1992, defines the region as \"Afghanistan, northeastern Iran, northern and central Pakistan, northern India, western China, Mongolia and the former Soviet Central Asian republics.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28186754|title=History of civilizations of Central Asia.|date=1992-2005|publisher=Unesco|others=Dani, Ahmad Hasan., Masson, V.

(3968109583).jpg|thumb|right|On the southern shore of Issyk Kul lake, [[Issyk Kul Region]].]]\nCentral Asia is an extremely large region of varied geography, including high passes and [[mountain ranges|mountains]] ([[Tian Shan]]), vast [[desert]]s ([[Kyzyl Kum]], [[Taklamakan]]), and especially treeless, grassy [[steppe]]s. The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of [[Eastern Europe]] as a homogeneous geographical zone known as the [[Eurasian Steppe]].\n\nMuch of the land of Central Asia is too dry or too rugged for farming. The [[Gobi desert]] extends from the foot of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], 77\u00b0&nbsp;E, to the [[Great Khingan]] (Da Hinggan) Mountains, 116\u00b0\u2013118\u00b0&nbsp;E.\n\nCentral Asia has the following geographic extremes:\n* The world's northernmost [[desert]] ([[dune|sand dunes]]), at Buurug Deliin Els, [[Mongolia]], 50\u00b018'&nbsp;N.\n* The [[Northern Hemisphere]]'s southernmost [[permafrost]], at Erdenetsogt sum, [[Mongolia]], 46\u00b017'&nbsp;N.\n* The world's shortest distance between non-frozen [[desert]] and [[permafrost]]: {{convert|770|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n* The Eurasian [[pole of inaccessibility]].\n\nA majority of the people earn a living by herding livestock. Industrial activity centers in the region's cities.\n\nMajor rivers of the region include the [[Amu Darya]], the [[Syr Darya]], [[Irtysh]], the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] and the [[Morghab River (Afghanistan)|Murghab River]]. Major bodies of water include the [[Aral Sea]] and [[Lake Balkhash]], both of which are part of the huge west-central Asian [[endorheic]] basin that also includes the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\nBoth of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia and can lead to rather significant international disputes.\n\n== Historical regions ==\n{{Location map+ | Kazakhstan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Kazakhstan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historical regions of Central Asia<br />\non a map of Kazakhstan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=73.37|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=44.00|long=76.95|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=45.00|long=85.00|label=Dzun-<br />garia|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=84.00|label=Tarim_Basin|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n|float=right\n| caption = Historical Regions of Central Asia<br />on a map of Uzbekistan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=40.00|long=72.00|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.50|long=65.00|label=Transoxiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.00|long=65.00|label=(Sogdia)|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=43.00|long=72.00|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.50|long=70.00|label=Bactria|position=bottom|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.00|long=61.90|label=Margiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historic cities of Central Asia<br />Kokand is one of the many towns that rose and fell in the Ferghana Valley\n| places  =\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.70|long=66.98|label=Samarkand|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.77|long=64.33|label=Bukhara|position=left|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.38|long=60.22|label=Khiva|position=top}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=40.53|long=70.93|label=Kokand|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.27|long=69.22|label=Tashkent|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=37.66|long=62.19|label=Merv}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=36.8|long=66.87|label=Balkh}}\n}}\n\nCentral Asia is bounded on the north by the forests of Siberia. The northern half of Central Asia (Kazakhstan) is the middle part of the [[Eurasian steppe]]. Westward the Kazakh steppe merges into the Russian-Ukrainian steppe and eastward into the steppes and deserts of Dzungaria and Mongolia. Southward the land becomes increasingly dry and the nomadic population increasingly thin. The south supports areas of dense population and cities wherever irrigation is possible. The main irrigated areas are along the eastern mountains, along the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]] and [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] Rivers and along the north flank of the [[Kopet Dagh]] near the Persian border. East of the Kopet Dagh is the important oasis of [[Merv]] and then a few places in Afghanistan like [[Herat]] and [[Balkh]]. Two projections of the [[Tian Shan]] create three \"bays\" along the eastern mountains. The largest, in the north, is eastern Kazakhstan, traditionally called [[Jetysu]] or Semirechye which contains [[Lake Balkhash]]. In the center is the small but densely-populated [[Ferghana valley]]. In the south is [[Bactria]], later called Tocharistan, which is bounded on the south by the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of Afghanistan. The [[Syr Darya]] (Jaxartes) rises in the Ferghana valley and the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus) rises in Bactria. Both flow northwest into the [[Aral Sea]]. Where the Oxus meets the Aral Sea it forms a large delta called [[Khwarazm]] and later the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. North of the Oxus is the less-famous but equally important [[Zarafshan River]] which waters the great trading cities of [[Bokhara]] and [[Samarkand]]. The other great commercial city was [[Tashkent]] northwest of the mouth of the Ferghana valley. The land immediately north of the Oxus was called [[Transoxiana]] and also [[Sogdia]], especially when referring to the Sogdian merchants who dominated the silk road trade.\n\nTo the east, Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin were united into the Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] about 1759. Caravans from China usually went along the north or south side of the Tarim basin and joined at [[Kashgar]] before crossing the mountains northwest to Ferghana or southwest to Bactria. A minor branch of the silk road went north of the Tian Shan through Dzungaria and Zhetysu before turning southwest near Tashkent. Nomadic migrations usually moved from Mongolia through Dzungaria before turning southwest to conquer the settled lands or continuing west toward Europe.\n\nThe [[Kyzyl Kum]] Desert or semi-desert is between the Oxus and Jaxartes, and the [[Karakum Desert]] is between the Oxus and [[Kopet Dagh]] in Turkmenistan. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] meant approximately northeast Persia and northern Afghanistan. [[Margiana]] was the region around Merv. The [[Ustyurt Plateau]] is between the Aral and Caspian Seas.\n\nTo the southwest, across the Kopet Dagh, lies Persia. From here Persian and Islamic civilization penetrated Central Asia and dominated its high culture until the Russian conquest. In the southeast is the route to India. In early times Buddhism spread north and throughout much of history warrior kings and tribes would move southeast to establish their rule in northern India. Most nomadic conquerors entered from the northeast. After 1800 western civilization in its Russian and Soviet form penetrated from the northwest.\n\n=== Names of historical regions ===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ariana]]\n* [[Bactria]]\n* [[Dahae|Dahistan]]\n* [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]\n* [[Khwarazm]]\n* [[Margiana]]\n* [[Parthia]]\n* [[Sogdia]]\n* [[Transoxiana]]\n* [[Turan]]\n* [[Turkestan]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\nBecause Central Asia is not buffered by a large body of water, temperature fluctuations are often severe, excluding the hot, sunny summer months. In most areas the climate is dry and continental, with hot summers and cool to cold winters, with occasional snowfall. Outside high-elevation areas, the climate is mostly semi-arid to arid. In lower elevations, summers are hot with blazing sunshine. Winters feature occasional rain and/or snow from low-pressure systems that cross the area from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Average monthly precipitation is extremely low from July to September, rises in autumn (October and November) and is highest in March or April, followed by swift drying in May and June. Winds can be strong, producing dust storms sometimes, especially toward the end of the dry season in September and October. Specific cities that exemplify Central Asian climate patterns include [[Tashkent]] and [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan, [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan, and [[Dushanbe]], Tajikistan, the last of these representing one of the wettest climates in Central Asia, with an average annual precipitation of over 22 inches.\n\nAccording to the [[Biome#WWF system|WWF Ecozones system]], Central Asia is part of the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]]. The largest [[biomes]] in Central Asia are the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome. Central Asia also contains the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] as well as [[temperate coniferous forests]] biomes.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC.

The aridness of the region made [[Agriculture in Central Asia|agriculture]] difficult, and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus, few major cities developed in the region; instead, the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the [[steppe]].\n\nRelations between the [[Eurasian nomads|steppe nomads]] and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict. The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to [[war]]fare, and the steppe [[Horses in warfare|horse riders]] became some of the most militarily potent people in the world, limited only by their lack of internal unity. Any internal unity that was achieved was most probably due to the influence of the [[Silk Road]], which traveled along Central Asia. Periodically, great leaders or changing conditions would organize several tribes into one force and create an almost unstoppable power. These included the [[Huns|Hun]] invasion of Europe, the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] attacks on China and most notably the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] of much of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html A Land Conquered by the Mongols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Three.html |date=23 April 2008 }}</ref>\n[[File:Men from Khiva.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Uzbek men from [[Khiva]], ca. 1861\u20131880]]\nDuring pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, southern Central Asia was inhabited predominantly by speakers of [[Iranian languages]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>C.E.

The [[Tang Dynasty|Tang Chinese]] were defeated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arabs]] at the [[battle of Talas]] in 751, marking the end of the Tang Dynasty's western expansion. The [[Tibetan Empire]] would take the chance to rule portion of Central Asia along with South Asia. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Mongols]] conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history.  Most of Central Asia fell under the control of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]. [[File:SB - Kazakh man on horse with golden eagle.jpg|thumb|[[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] man on a horse with golden eagle]]\nThe dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as [[firearm]]s allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. [[Russia]], [[China]], and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the western Central Asian regions were incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]]. The eastern part of Central Asia, known as East Turkestan or [[Xinjiang]], was [[Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China|incorporated]] into the [[People's Republic of China]]. Mongolia remained independent but became a Soviet [[satellite state]]. Afghanistan remained relatively independent of major influence by the USSR until the [[Saur Revolution]] of 1978.\n\nThe Soviet areas of Central Asia saw much [[Soviet infrastructure in Central Asia|industrialization and construction of infrastructure]], but also the suppression of local cultures, hundreds of thousands of deaths from failed collectivization programs, and a lasting legacy of ethnic tensions and environmental problems.

Thus, [[Yama (East Asia)|Yama]], Lord of Death, was revered in Tibet as a spiritual guardian and judge. Mongolian Buddhism, in particular, was influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] of Qing China in the 18th century was Tibetan Buddhist and would sometimes travel from [[Beijing]] to other cities for personal religious worship.\n\nCentral Asia also has an indigenous form of improvisational [[oral poetry]] that is over 1000 years old. It is principally practiced in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan by ''akyns'', lyrical improvisationists. They engage in [[Freestyle battle|lyrical battles]], the ''aitysh'' or the ''alym sabak''. The tradition arose out of early bardic [[Oral history|oral historians]]. They are usually accompanied by a [[String instrument|stringed instrument]]\u2014in Kyrgyzstan, a three-stringed [[komuz]], and in Kazakhstan, a similar two-stringed instrument, the dombra.\n\nPhotography in Central Asia began to develop after 1882, when a [[Russian Mennonite]] photographer named Wilhelm Penner moved to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] during the Mennonite migration to Central Asia led by [[Claas Epp, Jr.]] Upon his arrival to [[Khanate of Khiva]], Penner shared his photography skills with a local student Khudaybergen Divanov, who later became the founder of [[Uzbek photography]].<ref>Walter Ratliff, \"Pilgrims on the Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khiva\", Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2010</ref>\n\nSome also learn to sing the ''[[Manas (epic)|Manas]]'', Kyrgyzstan's epic poem (those who learn the ''Manas'' exclusively but do not improvise are called ''manaschis''). During Soviet rule, ''akyn'' performance was co-opted by the authorities and subsequently declined in popularity. With the fall of the Soviet Union, it has enjoyed a resurgence, although ''akyns'' still do use their art to campaign for political candidates.

The first years of the Soviet regime saw the appearance of modernism, which took inspiration from the Russian avant-garde movement. Until the 1980s, Central Asian arts had developed along with general tendencies of Soviet arts. In the 90s, arts of the region underwent some significant changes. Institutionally speaking, some fields of arts were regulated by the birth of the art market, some stayed as representatives of official views, while many were sponsored by international organizations. The years of 1990\u20132000 were times for the establishment of contemporary arts. In the region, many important international exhibitions are taking place, Central Asian art is represented in European and American museums, and the Central Asian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale has been organized since 2005.\n\n=== Sports ===\n[[Equestrianism|Equestrian sports]] are traditional in Central Asia, with disciplines like [[endurance riding]], [[buzkashi]], [[dzhigit]] and [[kyz kuu]].\n\nThe Traditional game of [[Buzkashi]] is played throughout the Central Asian region, the countries sometimes organize Buzkashi competition amongst each other. The First regional competition among the Central Asian countries, [[Russia]], Chinese [[Xinjiang]] and [[Turkey]] was held in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=Asia Holds First 'Kokpar' Championship |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/25104199.html |website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty |accessdate=31 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The first world title competition was played in 2017 and won by [[Kazakhstan]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Showdown In Astana: Rival Kazakhs, Kyrgyz Battle For First Kokpar World Title |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/kazakhstan-kyrgyzstan-kokpar-rivalry-world-championship/28701819.html |website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Association football]] is popular across Central Asia.

The ultimate aim is to emulate the Asian Tigers by becoming the local equivalent, Central Asian snow leopards. However, reform has been deliberately gradual and selective, as governments strive to limit the social cost and ameliorate living standards. All five countries are implementing structural reforms to improve competitiveness. In particular, they have been modernizing the industrial sector and fostering the development of service industries through business-friendly fiscal policies and other measures, to reduce the share of agriculture in GDP. Between 2005 and 2013, the share of agriculture dropped in all but Tajikistan, where it increased while industry descreased. The fastest growth in industry was observed in Turkmenistan, whereas the services sector progressed most in the other four countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nPublic policies pursued by Central Asian governments focus on buffering the political and economic spheres from external shocks. This includes maintaining a trade balance, minimizing public debt and accumulating national reserves. They cannot totally insulate themselves from negative exterior forces, however, such as the persistently weak recovery of global industrial production and international trade since 2008. Notwithstanding this, they have emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009. Growth faltered only briefly in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan and not at all in Uzbekistan, where the economy grew by more than 7% per year on average between 2008 and 2013. Turkmenistan achieved unusually high 14.7% growth in 2011. Kyrgyzstan's performance has been more erratic but this phenomenon was visible well before 2008.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe republics which have fared best benefitted from the commodities boom during the first decade of the 2000s. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have abundant oil and natural gas reserves and Uzbekistan's own reserves make it more or less self-sufficient. Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan all have gold reserves and Kazakhstan has the world's largest uranium reserves. Fluctuating global demand for cotton, aluminium and other metals (except gold) in recent years has hit Tajikistan hardest, since aluminium and raw cotton are its chief exports \u2212 the Tajik Aluminium Company is the country's primary industrial asset. In January 2014, the Minister of Agriculture announced the government's intention to reduce the acreage of land cultivated by cotton to make way for other crops. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are major cotton exporters themselves, ranking fifth and ninth respectively worldwide for volume in 2014.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Central Asia.

Kyrgyzstan has the added disadvantage of being considered resource poor, although it does have ample water. Most of its electricity is generated by hydropower.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe Kyrgyz economy was shaken by a series of shocks between 2010 and 2012. In April 2010, President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was deposed by a popular uprising, with former minister of foreign affairs Roza Otunbayeva assuring the interim presidency until the election of Almazbek Atambayev in November 2011. Food prices rose two years in a row and, in 2012, production at the major Kumtor gold mine fell by 60% after the site was perturbed by geological movements. According to the World Bank, 33.7% of the population was living in absolute poverty{{clarify|date=January 2020}}<!-- what's the threshold?--> in 2010 and 36.8% a year later.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nDespite high rates of economic growth in recent years, GDP per capita in Central Asia was higher than the average for developing countries only in Kazakhstan in 2013 (PPP$23,206) and Turkmenistan (PPP$14 201). It dropped to PPP$5,167 for Uzbekistan, home to 45% of the region's population, and was even lower for Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan leads the Central Asian region in terms of foreign direct investments.

Many national research institutions established during the Soviet era have since become obsolete with the development of new technologies and changing national priorities. This has led countries to reduce the number of national research institutions since 2009 by grouping existing institutions to create research hubs. Several of the [[Turkmen Academy of Sciences|Turkmen Academy of Science']]<nowiki/>s institutes were merged in 2014: the Institute of Botany was merged with the Institute of Medicinal Plants to become the [[Institute of Biology and Medicinal Plants]]; the Sun Institute was merged with the Institute of Physics and Mathematics to become the [[Institute of Solar Energy]]; and the Institute of Seismology merged with the State Service for Seismology to become the [[Institute of Seismology and Atmospheric Physics]]. In [[Science and technology in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]], more than 10 institutions of the Academy of Sciences have been reorganized, following the issuance of a decree by the Cabinet of Ministers in February 2012. The aim is to orient academic research towards problem-solving and ensure continuity between basic and applied research. For example, the Mathematics and Information Technology Research Institute has been subsumed under the [[National University of Uzbekistan]] and the Institute for Comprehensive Research on Regional Problems of Samarkand has been transformed into a problem-solving laboratory on environmental issues within [[Samarkand State University]]. Other research institutions have remained attached to the [[Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan|Uzbek Academy of Sciences]], such as the [[Centre of Genomics and Bioinformatics]].<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[Science and technology in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] and [[Science and technology in Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan]] are also building technology parks as part of their drive to modernize infrastructure. In 2011, construction began of a technopark in the village of Bikrova near Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital. It will combine research, education, industrial facilities, business incubators and exhibition centres. The technopark will house research on alternative energy sources (sun, wind) and the assimilation of nanotechnologies. Between 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Nur-Sultan. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies which will be part of the planned Caspian Energy Hub. In addition, the Centre for Technology Commercialization has been set up in Kazakhstan as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups. The centre plans to conduct a technology audit in Kazakhstan and to review the legal framework regulating the commercialization of research results and technology.<ref name=\":13\" />[[File:Trends in GERD GDP ratio in Central Asia, 2001\u22122013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Trends in research expenditure in Central Asia, as a percentage of GDP, 2001\u20132013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: 2030 (2015), Figure 14.3]]Countries are seeking to augment the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors but also to make greater use of information and communication technologies and other modern technologies, such as solar energy, to develop the business sector, education and research. In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources in Uzbekistan, with funding from the [[Asian Development Bank]] and other institutions: the SPU Physical\u2212Technical Institute ([[Physics Sun Institute]]) and the [[International Solar Energy Institute]]. Three universities have been set up since 2011 to foster competence in strategic economic areas: [[Nazarbayev University]] in Kazakhstan (first intake in 2011), an international research university, [[Inha University in Tashkent|Inha University]] in Uzbekistan (first intake in 2014), specializing in information and communication technologies, and the [[International Oil and Gas University]] in Turkmenistan (founded in 2013). Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are both generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have both adopted the three-tier bachelor's, master's and PhD degree system, in 2007 and 2012 respectively, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science. In 2010, Kazakhstan became the only Central Asian member of the [[Bologna Process]], which seeks to harmonize higher education systems in order to create a European Higher Education Area.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Financial investment in research ===\nThe Central Asian republics' ambition of developing the business sector, education and research is being hampered by chronic low investment in research and development. Over the decade to 2013, the region's investment in research and development hovered around 0.2\u20130.3% of GDP. Uzbekistan broke with this trend in 2013 by raising its own research intensity to 0.41% of GDP.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is the only country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development \u2013 but research intensity overall is low in Kazakhstan: just 0.18% of GDP in 2013. Moreover, few industrial enterprises conduct research in Kazakhstan. Only one in eight (12.5%) of the country's manufacturing firms were active in innovation in 2012, according to a survey by the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]]. Enterprises prefer to purchase technological solutions that are already embodied in imported machinery and equipment. Just 4% of firms purchase the license and patents that come with this technology. Nevertheless, there appears to be a growing demand for the products of research, since enterprises spent 4.5 times more on scientific and technological services in 2008 than in 1997.<ref name=\":13\" />\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.

The number of researchers per million population is close to the world average (1,083 in 2013) in Kazakhstan (1,046) and higher than the world average in Uzbekistan (1,097).<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is the only Central Asian country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development. Uzbekistan is in a particularly vulnerable position, with its heavy reliance on higher education: three-quarters of researchers were employed by the university sector in 2013 and just 6% in the business enterprise sector. With most Uzbek university researchers nearing retirement, this imbalance imperils Uzbekistan's research future. Almost all holders of a Candidate of Science, Doctor of Science or PhD are more than 40 years old and half are aged over 60; more than one in three researchers (38.4%) holds a PhD degree, or its equivalent, the remainder holding a bachelor's or master's degree.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.4]]Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have all maintained a share of women researchers above 40% since the fall of the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan has even achieved gender parity, with Kazakh women dominating medical and health research and representing some 45\u201355% of engineering and technology researchers in 2013. In Tajikistan, however, only one in three scientists (34%) was a woman in 2013, down from 40% in 2002. Although policies are in place to give Tajik women equal rights and opportunities, these are underfunded and poorly understood. Turkmenistan has offered a state guarantee of equality for women since a law adopted in 2007 but the lack of available data makes it impossible to draw any conclusions as to the law's impact on research.  As for Turkmenistan, it does not make data available on higher education, research expenditure or researchers.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n'''Table:''' '''PhDs obtained in science and engineering in Central Asia, 2013 or closest year'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" href=\"\u00dcr\u00fcmqi\"\n| href=\"File:Bringing the sheep home, on the southern shore of Issy-Kol.

At the time, Vladimir Debabov, Scientific Director of the Genetika State Research Institute for Genetics and the Selection of Industrial Micro-organisms in the Russian Federation, stressed the paramount importance of developing bio-industry. 'In the world today, there is a strong tendency to switch from petrochemicals to renewable biological sources,' he said. 'Biotechnology is developing two to three times faster than chemicals.'<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan also participated in a second project of the Eurasian Economic Community, the establishment of the Centre for Innovative Technologies on 4 April 2013, with the signing of an agreement between the Russian Venture Company (a government fund of funds), the Kazakh JSC National Agency and the Belarusian Innovative Foundation. Each of the selected projects is entitled to funding of US$3\u201390 million and is implemented within a public\u2013private partnership. The first few approved projects focused on supercomputers, space technologies, medicine, petroleum recycling, nanotechnologies and the ecological use of natural resources. Once these initial projects have spawned viable commercial products, the venture company plans to reinvest the profits in new projects. This venture company is not a purely economic structure; it has also been designed to promote a common economic space among the three participating countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nFour of the five Central Asian republics have also been involved in a project launched by the [[European Union]] in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage [[European Union's scientific cooperation beyond the bloc|Central Asian countries to participate in research projects]] within [[Horizon 2020]], the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research projects is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions \u2013 universities, companies and research institutes \u2013 for funding of up to \u20ac10, 000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe [[International Science and Technology Center]] (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer.

The region itself never held a dominant stationary population nor was able to make use of natural resources. Thus, it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state. Central Asia has been divided, redivided, conquered out of existence, and fragmented time and time again. Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers than as a power in its own right.\n\nCentral Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.\n* To the North, the steppe allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols, and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the Russian Empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports. The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan.\n* To the East, the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia since the [[Silk Road]] period of [[Han Dynasty]]. However, with the Sino-Soviet split and collapse of Soviet Union, China would project its soft power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.\n* To the Southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the [[Hindu Kush]], and slightly beyond. From its base in India, the [[British Empire]] competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n* To the Southwest, Western Asian powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia (usually Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan). Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; Alexander the Great's Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia; two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well. Turkey, through a common [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nation identity, has gradually increased its ties and influence as well in the region. Furthermore, since Uzbekistan announced their intention to join in April 2018, Turkey and all of the Central Asian Turkic-speaking states except Turkmenistan are together part of the [[Turkic Council]].<ref>http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/uzbekistan-decides-to-join-turkic-alliance-during-erdogans-visit-131109</ref>\n\nIn the post\u2013Cold War era, Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the United States:\n* Russia continues to dominate political decision-making throughout the former SSRs; although, as other countries move into the area, Russia's influence has begun to wane though Russia still maintains military bases in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Why Russia Will Send More Troops to Central Asia|url = https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/why-russia-will-send-more-troops-central-asia|website = Stratfor|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}</ref>\n* The United States, with its military involvement in the region and oil diplomacy, is also significantly involved in the region's politics.

U.S. military bases have also been established in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, causing both Russia and the People's Republic of China to voice their concern over a permanent U.S. military presence in the region.\n\nWestern governments have accused Russia, China and the former Soviet republics of justifying the suppression of separatist movements, and the associated ethnics and religion with the War on Terror.\n\n== Major cultural, scientific and economic centres ==\n=== Cities within the regular definition of Central Asia and Afghanistan<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan |title=Afghanistan |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=17 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225235842/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan |archivedate=25 February 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Tan |first1=Anjelica |title=A new strategy for Central Asia |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/international/483511-a-new-strategy-for-central-asia |work=TheHill |date=18 February 2020 |language=en|quote=, as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has noted, Afghanistan is itself a Central Asian country.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Afghanistan {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |publisher=Cambridge University |isbn=9781107619500 |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/afghanistan |language=en}}</ref> ===\n{{Largest cities of Central Asia}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Population\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Image\n! style=\"width:350px;\"|Information\n|-\n| [[Nur-Sultan]]\n| Kazakhstan\n| {{nts|1,006,574}}<br />(2017)\n| [[File:Central Astana on a Sunny, Snowy Day in February 2013.jpg|200px]]\n| The capital and second largest city in Kazakhstan.

aim of the magazine was to create a publication which combined resolutely socialist politics with the accessibility of titles such as ''[[The Nation]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]''.<ref name=nlr>{{cite journal |last1=Sunkara |first1=Bhaskar |author-link1=Bhaskar Sunkara |year=2014 |title=Interview: Project Jacobin|url=https://newleftreview.org/II/90/bhaskar-sunkara-project-jacobin

Socialist Organization]]'s ''[[Socialist Worker]]'' and ''International Socialist Review'' which were oriented towards party members and other revolutionary socialists, seeking a broader audience than those works whilst still anchoring the magazine in a [[Marxism|Marxist]] perspective.<ref name=revue /> In an interview he gave in 2018 Sunkara said that he intended for ''Jacobin'' to perform a similar role on the contemporary left to that undertaken by ''[[National Review]]'' on the post-war right, \"to cohere people around a set of ideas, and to interact with the mainstream of liberalism with that set of ideas\".<ref name=cjr />\n\nEarlier in 2013, Jacobin Books was announced, a partnership with [[Verso Books]] and [[Random House]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.versobooks.com/series_collections/112-jacobin |title=Jacobin Books series |author=Verso}}</ref> A collection of essays by ''Jacobin'' contributors was published by [[Henry Holt and

the 16 cities in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2014/02/class-action-an-activist-teachers-handbook/ |title=Class Action: An Activist Teacher's Handbook

foreign-language edition, ''Jacobin Italia'', was launched. Sunkara described it as \"a classic franchise model\", with the parent publication providing publishing and editorial advice and taking a small slice of revenue, but otherwise granting the Italian magazine autonomy.<ref name=cjr>{{cite web |url=https://www.cjr.org/special_report/the-abcs-of-jacobin-socialist-magazine.php/ |title=The ABCs of Jacobin |last=Baird |first=Robert P. |date=2 January 2019 |website=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|access-date=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Title and logo ==\nThe name of the magazine derives from the book [[The Black Jacobins|''The Black Jacobins: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the San Domingo Revolution'']] by [[C.

Sunkara has said he feels that \"all of our writers fit within a broad socialist tradition\", noting that the magazine does sometimes publish articles by [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]], but that such pieces are written from a perspective that is consistent with the magazine's editorial vision, saying that \"we might publish a piece by a liberal advocating single-payer healthcare, because they\u2019re calling for the decommodification of a sector; and since we believe in the decommodification of the whole economy, it fits in\". In terms of the sociological background of contributors, Sunkara acknowledged that they were mostly under the age of 35 and stated that \"there are a lot of grad students, young adjunct professors or tenured professors.
