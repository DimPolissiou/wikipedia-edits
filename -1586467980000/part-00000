She sold flowers in San Francisco as a teenage runaway. In a conversation with novelist and short story writer [[Matthew Sharpe]] for ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', Gaitskill said she chose to become a writer at age 18 because she was \"indignant about things\u2014it was the typical teenage sense of 'things are wrong in the world and I must say something.'\"<ref>Sharpe, Matthew.

The first four stories are written in the third person point of view from the perspectives of male characters. The remaining five stories are written from the perspectives of female characters. ''Secretary'' is the only story in the book written in the first person point of view. Several of the stories have themes of sexuality, romance, love, [[sex work]], [[sadomasochism]], drug addiction, being a writer in New York City, and living in New York City. ''A Romantic Weekend'' and ''Secretary'' both explore themes of [[BDSM]] and psychological aspects of dominance and submission in sexual relationships. The story ''Connection'' is about a female friendship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=Bad Behavior|date=1988|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4391-4887-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/badbehaviorstori0000gait}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's fiction is typically about female characters dealing with their own inner conflicts, and her subject matter matter-of-factly includes many \"taboo\" subjects such as [[prostitution]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]], and [[sado-masochism]].  Gaitskill says that she had worked as a stripper and call girl.  She showed similar candor in an essay about being raped, \"On Not Being a Victim,\" for ''[[Harper's]]''.\n\nGaitskill's 1994 essay in ''Harper's'' also addresses feminist debates about [[date rape]], victimization, and responsibility. She describes ways that individual subjectivity influences all experiences, making it impossible to come to \"universally agreed-upon conclusions.\" <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=On Not Being a Victim|journal=Harper's Magazine|date=March 1994|volume=288|issue=1726|page=35}}</ref>\n\nThe film ''[[Secretary (2002 film)|Secretary]]'' (2002) is based on the short story of the same name in ''Bad Behavior'', although the two have little in common.  She characterized the film as \"the ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' version, heavy on the charm (and a little too nice),\" but observed that the \"bottom line is that if [a film adaptation is] made you get some money and exposure, and people can make up their minds from there.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Gaitskill Interview|url=http://failbetter.com/19/GaitskillInterview.php?sxnSrc=ltst|publisher=Failbetter|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe novel ''Two Girls, Fat and Thin'' follows the childhood and adult lives of Justine Shade (thin) and Dorothy Never (fat).  Justine works through her sadomasochistic issues while Dorothy works through her up-and-down commitment to the philosophy of \"Definitism\" and its founder \"Anna Granite\" (thinly veiled satires of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and [[Ayn Rand]]).  When journalist Justine interviews Dorothy for an expos\u00e9 of Definitism, an unusual relationship begins between the two women.  In an interview, Gaitskill discussed what she was trying to convey about Justine via her sadomasochistic impulses:\n\n{{ quote|It's a kind of inward aggression. It seems like self-contempt, but it's really an inverted contempt for everything. That's what I was trying to describe in her. I would say it had to do with her childhood, not because she was sexually abused, but because the world that she was presented with was so inadequate in terms of giving her a full-spirited sense of herself. That inadequacy can make you implode with a lot of disgust. It can become the gestalt of who you are. So the masochism is like \"I'm going to make myself into a debased object because that is what I think of you. This is what I think of your love. I don't want your love. Your love is shit. Your love is nothing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Alexander Laurence (originally at Altx.com) |url=http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |date=1994 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921215639/http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |archivedate=2016-09-21 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe novel ''The Mare'', published in 2015, is written from the perspectives of several different characters. The primary characters are named Ginger and Velvet (short for Velveteen). Ginger is a middle-aged woman who meets Velvet, a young adolescent, through [[The Fresh Air Fund]]. Other characters whose perspectives are featured include Paul (Ginger's husband), Silvia (Velvet's mother), Dante (Velvet's younger brother), and Beverly (a horse trainer).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=The Mare|date=2015|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-37974-0}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002 and a PEN/Faulkner Award nomination for ''Because They Wanted To'' in 1998. ''Veronica'' (2005) was a [[National Book Award]] nominee, as well as a National Book Critics Circle finalist for that year.  The book is centered on the narrator, a former fashion model and her friend Veronica who contracts [[AIDS]].  Gaitskill mentioned working on the novel in a 1994 interview, but that same year she put it aside until 2001.  Writing of ''Veronica'' and Gaitskill's career in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in March 2006, [[Wyatt Mason]] said:\n\n{{ quote|Through four books over eighteen years, Mary Gaitskill has been formulating her fiction around the immutable question of how we manage to live in a seemingly inscrutable world. In the past, she has described, with clarity and vision, the places in life where we sometimes get painfully caught. Until ''Veronica'', however, she had never ventured to show fully how life could also be made a place where, despite all, we find meaningful release.}}\n\nGaitskill's favorite writers have changed over time, as she noted in a 2005 interview,<ref>[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&cid=973021#interview Barnes & Noble.com - Mary Gaitskill - Books: Meet the Writers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but one constant is the author [[Vladimir Nabokov]], whose ''[[Lolita]]'' \"will be on my ten favorites list until the end of my life.\" Another consistently named influence is [[Flannery O'Connor]]. Despite her well-known S/M themes, Gaitskill does not appear to consider the [[Marquis de Sade]] himself an influence, or at least not a literary one:  \"I don't think much of Sade as a writer, although I enjoyed beating off to him as a child.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Alexander Laurence/Portable Infinite (originally at Altx.com)|url=http://portable-infinite.blogspot.com/2006/11/mary-gaitskill-interview.html|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Bad Behavior'' (1988) (stories) {{ISBN|0-671-65871-9}}\n*''Two Girls, Fat and Thin'' (1991) (novel) {{ISBN|0-671-68540-6}}\n*''Because They Wanted To'' (1997) (stories) {{ISBN|0-684-80856-0}}\n*''Veronica'' (2005) (novel, [[National Book Award]] Finalist) {{ISBN|0-375-42145-9}}\n*''Don't Cry'' (2009) (stories) {{ISBN|0-375-42419-9}}\n*''The Mare'' (November 2015) (novel) {{ISBN|978-0307379740}}\n*''Somebody with a Little Hammer'' (2017) (essays) {{ISBN|0-307-37822-5}}\n\n==Awards==\n\n* [[Hopwood Award]]\n* [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for fiction (2002)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womenwriters.as.uky.edu/presenters/mary-gaitskill|title=Mary Gaitskill {{!}} womenwriters.as.uky.edu|website=womenwriters.as.uky.edu|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n* Cullman Research Fellowship at the [[New York Public Library]] (2010)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womenwriters.as.uky.edu/presenters/mary-gaitskill|title=Mary Gaitskill {{!}} womenwriters.as.uky.edu|website=womenwriters.as.uky.edu|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n* Arts and Letters Award in Literature, [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]] (2018).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2010/mary-gaitskill Author interview] (2010) by Suzanne Warren at [http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2010/mary-gaitskill Narrative.com].\n* {{Cite web |url=http://www.collegecrier.com/interviews/int-00351.asp |work=College Crier |first=Carri Anne |last=Yager |title=Mary Gaitskill: Critics line up to praise her work- and don't have a clue |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009042111/http://www.collegecrier.com/interviews/int-00351.asp |archivedate=2007-10-09 }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060421140536/http://www.failbetter.com/19/GaitskillInterview.htm Author interview] (2005?) at [http://www.failbetter.com failbetter.com].\n* [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&cid=973021#interview Author interview] (2005) for Barnes & Noble's \"Meet the Writers\" website.

They divorced in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barrodale|first=Amie|title=I'm Psychic... with Mary Gaitskill|url=https://www.vice.com/read/im-psychic-mary-gaitskill|work=Interview with Vice Magazine|magazine=Vice Magazine|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill has taught at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], the [[University of Houston]], [[New York University]], [[The New School]], [[Brown University]], in the MFA program at [[Temple University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/faculty/mary-gaitskill/|title=Department of English: Mary Gaitskill|publisher=Temple University College of Liberal Arts|access-date=February 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203162351/http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/faculty/mary-gaitskill/|archive-date=February 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Syracuse University]]. She was the Writer-In-Residence at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]]. As of 2020, Gaitskill is a [[Visiting Professor|visiting professor]] of literature at [[Claremont McKenna College]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmc.edu/news/prof-mary-gaitskill-recognized-by-american-academy-of-arts-and-letters|title=Prof. Mary Gaitskill recognized by American Academy of Arts and Letters|last=Affairs|first=Office of Public|last2=Claremont|first2=Communications 400 N.

The first four stories are written in the third person point of view from the perspectives of male characters. The remaining five stories are written from the perspectives of female characters. ''Secretary'' is the only story in the book written in the first person point of view. Several of the stories have themes of sexuality, romance, love, [[sex work]], [[sadomasochism]], drug addiction, being a writer in New York City, and living in New York City. ''A Romantic Weekend'' and ''Secretary'' both explore themes of [[BDSM]] and psychological aspects of dominance and submission in sexual relationships. The story ''Connection'' is about a female friendship.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=Bad Behavior|date=1988|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4391-4887-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/badbehaviorstori0000gait}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's fiction is typically about female characters dealing with their own inner conflicts, and her subject matter matter-of-factly includes many \"taboo\" subjects such as [[prostitution]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]], and [[sado-masochism]].  Gaitskill says that she had worked as a stripper and call girl.  She showed similar candor in an essay about being raped, \"On Not Being a Victim,\" for ''[[Harper's]]''.\n\nGaitskill's 1994 essay in ''Harper's'' also addresses feminist debates about [[date rape]], victimization, and responsibility. She describes ways that individual subjectivity influences all experiences, making it impossible to come to \"universally agreed-upon conclusions.\" <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=On Not Being a Victim|journal=Harper's Magazine|date=March 1994|volume=288|issue=1726|page=35}}</ref>\n\nThe film ''[[Secretary (2002 film)|Secretary]]'' (2002) is based on the short story of the same name in ''Bad Behavior'', although the two have little in common.  She characterized the film as \"the ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' version, heavy on the charm (and a little too nice),\" but observed that the \"bottom line is that if [a film adaptation is] made you get some money and exposure, and people can make up their minds from there.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Gaitskill Interview|url=http://failbetter.com/19/GaitskillInterview.php?sxnSrc=ltst|publisher=Failbetter|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe novel ''Two Girls, Fat and Thin'' follows the childhood and adult lives of Justine Shade (thin) and Dorothy Never (fat).  Justine works through her sadomasochistic issues while Dorothy works through her up-and-down commitment to the philosophy of \"Definitism\" and its founder \"Anna Granite\" (thinly veiled satires of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and [[Ayn Rand]]).  When journalist Justine interviews Dorothy for an expos\u00e9 of Definitism, an unusual relationship begins between the two women.  In an interview, Gaitskill discussed what she was trying to convey about Justine via her sadomasochistic impulses:\n\n{{ quote|It's a kind of inward aggression. It seems like self-contempt, but it's really an inverted contempt for everything. That's what I was trying to describe in her. I would say it had to do with her childhood, not because she was sexually abused, but because the world that she was presented with was so inadequate in terms of giving her a full-spirited sense of herself. That inadequacy can make you implode with a lot of disgust. It can become the gestalt of who you are. So the masochism is like \"I'm going to make myself into a debased object because that is what I think of you. This is what I think of your love. I don't want your love. Your love is shit. Your love is nothing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Alexander Laurence (originally at Altx.com) |url=http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |date=1994 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921215639/http://www.altx.com/int2/mary.gaitskill.html |archivedate=2016-09-21 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe novel ''The Mare'', published in 2015, is written from the perspectives of several different characters. The primary characters are named Ginger and Velvet (short for Velveteen). Ginger is a middle-aged woman who meets Velvet, a young adolescent, through [[The Fresh Air Fund]]. Other characters whose perspectives are featured include Paul (Ginger's husband), Silvia (Velvet's mother), Dante (Velvet's younger brother), and Beverly (a horse trainer).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gaitskill|first1=Mary|title=The Mare|date=2015|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-37974-0}}</ref>\n\nGaitskill's honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2002 and a PEN/Faulkner Award nomination for ''Because They Wanted To'' in 1998. ''Veronica'' (2005) was a [[National Book Award]] nominee, as well as a National Book Critics Circle finalist for that year.  The book is centered on the narrator, a former fashion model and her friend Veronica who contracts [[AIDS]].  Gaitskill mentioned working on the novel in a 1994 interview, but that same year she put it aside until 2001.  Writing of ''Veronica'' and Gaitskill's career in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in March 2006, [[Wyatt Mason]] said:\n\n{{ quote|Through four books over eighteen years, Mary Gaitskill has been formulating her fiction around the immutable question of how we manage to live in a seemingly inscrutable world. In the past, she has described, with clarity and vision, the places in life where we sometimes get painfully caught. Until ''Veronica'', however, she had never ventured to show fully how life could also be made a place where, despite all, we find meaningful release.}}\n\nGaitskill's favorite writers have changed over time, as she noted in a 2005 interview,<ref>[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&cid=973021#interview Barnes & Noble.com - Mary Gaitskill - Books: Meet the Writers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but one constant is the author [[Vladimir Nabokov]], whose ''[[Lolita]]'' \"will be on my ten favorites list until the end of my life.\" Another consistently named influence is [[Flannery O'Connor]]. Despite her well-known S/M themes, Gaitskill does not appear to consider the [[Marquis de Sade]] himself an influence, or at least not a literary one:  \"I don't think much of Sade as a writer, although I enjoyed beating off to him as a child.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Alexander Laurence/Portable Infinite (originally at Altx.com)|url=http://portable-infinite.blogspot.com/2006/11/mary-gaitskill-interview.html|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Bad Behavior'' (1988) (stories) {{ISBN|0-671-65871-9}}\n*''Two Girls, Fat and Thin'' (1991) (novel) {{ISBN|0-671-68540-6}}\n*''Because They Wanted To'' (1997) (stories) {{ISBN|0-684-80856-0}}\n*''Veronica'' (2005) (novel, [[National Book Award]] Finalist) {{ISBN|0-375-42145-9}}\n*''Don't Cry'' (2009) (stories) {{ISBN|0-375-42419-9}}\n*''The Mare'' (November 2015) (novel) {{ISBN|978-0307379740}}\n*''Somebody with a Little Hammer'' (2017) (essays) {{ISBN|0-307-37822-5}}\n\n==Awards==\n\n* [[Hopwood Award]]\n* [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for fiction (2002)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womenwriters.as.uky.edu/presenters/mary-gaitskill|title=Mary Gaitskill {{!}} womenwriters.as.uky.edu|website=womenwriters.as.uky.edu|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n* Cullman Research Fellowship at the [[New York Public Library]] (2010)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://womenwriters.as.uky.edu/presenters/mary-gaitskill|title=Mary Gaitskill {{!}} womenwriters.as.uky.edu|website=womenwriters.as.uky.edu|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2010/mary-gaitskill Author interview] (2010) by Suzanne Warren at [http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2010/mary-gaitskill Narrative.com].\n* {{Cite web |url=http://www.collegecrier.com/interviews/int-00351.asp |work=College Crier |first=Carri Anne |last=Yager |title=Mary Gaitskill: Critics line up to praise her work- and don't have a clue |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009042111/http://www.collegecrier.com/interviews/int-00351.asp |archivedate=2007-10-09 }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060421140536/http://www.failbetter.com/19/GaitskillInterview.htm Author interview] (2005?) at [http://www.failbetter.com failbetter.com].\n* [http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&cid=973021#interview Author interview] (2005) for Barnes & Noble's \"Meet the Writers\" website.

Nigro Sansonese was born Joseph Sansonese in [[Buffalo, NY]], where he attended [[Canisius High School]].  He was trained in physics and mathematics at [[Fordham University]] (Sc.B 1968) ([[Bronx, NY]]) and [[Brown University]] ([[Providence, RI]]).  In 1996\u201397, he taught a course in the history of science at [[Stonehill College]] ([[Easton, MA]]) and from 2001\u20132009 courses in mathematics and science on [[St. Croix]] at the [[University of the Virgin Islands]] (Kingshill, VI).  Over the course of 30 years he also taught mathematics and science at various high schools, public and private, in the United States and its territories.  He retired from teaching in 2012.\n\nHis main published work is ''The Body of Myth: Mythology, Shamanic Trance, and the Sacred Geography of the Body,'' {{ISBN|0-89281-409-8}}, a nonfiction work of some 400 pages on the relationship between [[mythology]] and human [[biology]],<ref name=\"Inc.1995\">{{cite book|title=Yoga Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cekDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA136|accessdate=26 February 2013|date=March\u2013April 1995|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|page=136}}</ref> that appeared in 1994.\n\nHe was co-screenwriter of ''Hurricane Festival'', a 1997 feature film, with Chi Y. Lee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/hurricane-festival-v163085/cast-crew|title=Hurricane Festival (1998) - Cast and Crew|publisher=[[AllMovie]]|accessdate=26 February 2013}}</ref>  His plays include ''The House on the Point'', produced at the [[Hult Center for the Performing Arts]], [[Eugene, OR]], November 1985, and ''The Mill at Tour d'Ivoire'', read at the [[Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center]], [[North Portland, OR]], September 1984, and the Greene Street Theater, [[New York City]], April 1986.\n\n==Works==\nIn addition to his work in print Sansonese has discussed his theory of ''[[mythopoesis]]'' (Gk., \"story making\") in a lengthy 1994 video interview with San Francisco psychologist Dr. Jeffrey Mishlove of [[Thinking Allowed (PBS)]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFM2x9uCUP4. |title=  Excerpt from Interview with J. Nigro Sansonese |author= Dr. Jeffrey Mishlove (December 1994) |accessdate= September 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nNigro Sansonese's mythology, elaborated in ''The Body of Myth: Mythology, Shamanic Trance, and the Sacred Geography of the Body'' (1994), might be summarized as follows: Early myth-making (before, say, 1000 BC) among archaic peoples\u2014especially but not exclusively [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speakers\u2014may have originated in an [[esoteric]] oral ''cephelosophy'' or \"skull wisdom\" automatically imparted, primarily to young men at the age of puberty, in secret [[initiation]] rituals, during which a venerated ancestral skull may have been displayed for purposes of illustrating the meaning of a particular [[myth]]. The aboriginal inspiration for myth, Sansonese argues, lay in heightened [[awareness]] (see '''[[proprioception]]''') of certain internal bodily activities important in religiously oriented [[meditation]]. The means of heightening proprioception are closely guarded meditative techniques orally communicated from teacher ([[adept]]) to student, in particular, techniques associated with [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. Subject to numerous cultural contingencies, the techniques likely first appeared in history many thousands of years ago in the [[trance]]-inducing practices of [[shamans]] but became ever more systematized, refined, and clarified over time. Because the activities attended to in many meditative traditions, for example, respiration and heart rate, are physiologically fundamental to ''all'' human bodies everywhere, an explicit argument of the book is that a proprioceptive interpretation probably applies to ''all'' mythologies that are sufficiently archaic in origin, which he defines as no later than approximately 800 BC.  About a quarter of the book focuses on interpreting the biblical narratives of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. A myth, then, according to Sansonese is a veiled, culturally conditioned [[description]] of a trance-inducing technique and resulting proprioceptions.\n\nMyths, therefore, on this view are (very) early attempts at articulating what, in 1945, [[Aldous Huxley]] called [[Perennial Philosophy]], and simultaneously [[mystical]] and [[practical]] in their origins.  Much of the practical aim of a myth is instruction in what Sansonese calls \"the art of dying,\" a narrative prefiguring of the literal experience of [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatic]] [[death]], which is a matter of the practical mastery of an endocrinal event that he suggestively describes as a \"[[pituitary]] catastrophe,\" in the sense that the pituitary gland initiates it.  In Nigro Sansonese's view, death is an event triggered by the [[endocrine system]].<ref>Interviewed by Joshua Schrei on ''The Emerald'', Nos. 12, 23 (2019), 30 (2020). [[http://podbay.fm/show/1465445746/e/1565103600?autostart=1]]</ref> In sum,  Nigro Sansonese defines an \"authentic myth\" as \"an esoteric description of a heightened proprioception,\"<ref>Dr. Georg Feuerstein (Autumn 1995), review: ''The Body of Myth,'' [[Quest (Theosophical magazine)]], 8:3, p. 91.</ref> meaning a verbal description, albeit a necessarily imperfect one, of a literal experience undergone by an adept while in a trance state, which, very critically, ''must'' be distinguished from mere [[symbol]]ism or [[metaphor]].  Understanding religious practice (praxis) eclipses understanding religious belief (dogma) in its importance for understanding both the origin and the meaning of a specific myth of sufficient antiquity (see also his lengthy discussion of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]).\n\nIn deep meditation the region of the cranial sinciput, or forehead, is in emphasis, particularly the [[glabella]], a fissure between the brows esoterically described in myth, Sansonese claims, as a portal or entry such as the Sc\u00e6an Gate into [[Troy]] (see Book VI of ''[[The Iliad]]'' and ''passim'') or the Hellespont on the way to [[Colchis]], mythic locale of the [[Golden Fleece]], to give just two of numerous examples cited. Another vivid illustration is the mythical figure [[Sisyphus]] ({{lang-grc-gre|\u03a3\u03af\u03c3\u03c5\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2}}, ''S\u00edsyphos''), king of [[Corinth]], whose myth Sansonese explores in detail, and whose name, he suggests, is literally an onomatopoetic rendering of the sussurant sound (\"siss phuss\") the moving breath makes in the nostrils, the breath of course being an important object of meditative concentration (a ''bija'' in [[yoga]]).  Repetitive inhalation\u2013exhalation are described esoterically in the myth as an up\u2013down motion of Sisyphus and the boulder on a hill.  As a compendium Sansonese provides five [[axiom]]s to guide the interpretation of archaic mythopoesis. A critical contention of the book is that myths are not so much [[symbol]]s natural to human ideation, as [[Carl Jung]] proposed in 1933, as they are culture-specific, esoteric [[descriptions]] of somatic activity proprioceived during exalted [[trance]] states, for example, those attained through, but not limited to, yoga (see also ''[[samyama]]'' and ''[[pranayama]])''.<ref>http://junginvermont.blogspot.com/2010/02/body-and-archetype-presentation.html. ''Clinical Perspectives: Body and Archetype,'' Luanne Sberna, February 1, 2010 (The C.G. Jung Society of Vermont), Retrieved April 29, 2014.</ref>\n\nNigro Sansonese's work also has relevance to the scientific study of [[consciousness]], specifically, by proposing that an implicit [[epistemology]]\u2014namely, a description of [[knowledge]] that is in its nature, i.e., essentially, ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', also known as '''consciousness'''\u2014unavoidably orders the fundamental [[laws of physics]] differentially, from the (macroscopically) perceived and proprioceived 17th-century [[mechanics]] of [[Isaac Newton]] to the indispensability of mathematics in the 20th-century [[quantum mechanics]] of [[Werner Heisenberg]].  That development is interpreted by Sansonese as one of successively elaborating a physics originally based on [[empirical]] knowledge obtained via proprioception and [[perception]] into a physics that is a [[conformal map]] onto the [[psychodynamics]] of [[cognition]].  A succinct summary of that assertion would be \"[[Ontology]] is epistemology: Every state of [[being]] is ''ipso facto'' a state of knowing.\" On such a view, quantum mechanics arguably might be said to be more \"[[meta]]-physics\" than physics.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/AJP/3683/1774.pdf |title= Book Forum: ''The Body of Myth'' |author= Dr. Michael F.

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites. The Long March 3B also served as the basis for the medium-capacity [[Long March 3C]], which was first launched in 2008.\n\n{{As of|2020|04}}, the Long March 3B and 3B/E have conducted 63<!-- UPDATE after each launch --> successful launches, plus two failures and two partial failures, giving them a success rate of {{percent|63|67|1}}.<!-- UPDATE after each launch -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:CZ-3B.svg|thumb|left|70px|A diagram of the Long March 3B, showing its outboard liquid rocket boosters.]]\n\nThe development of the Long March 3B began in 1986 to meet the needs of the international GEO communications satellite market. During its maiden flight, on 14 February 1996 carrying the [[Intelsat 708]] satellite, the rocket suffered a guidance failure two seconds into the flight and destroyed a nearby town, killing at least six people,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.house.gov/coxreport/body/ch6bod.html |title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|accessdate=23 May 2012|author=Select Committee of the United States House of Representatives|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=3 January 1999|work=U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China}}</ref> but outside estimates suggest that anywhere between 200 and 500 people might have been killed.<ref name=ChenLan>{{cite web|last=Lan |first=Chen|title=Mist around the CZ-3B disaster|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2323/1|work=The Space Review|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> However, the author of the report<ref name=\"ChenLan\"/> later ruled out large casualties, because evidence suggest that the crash site was evacuated before the launch.<ref name=ChenLan2>{{cite web|last=Lan|first=Chen|title=Mist around the CZ-3B disaster (part 2) |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2326/1|work=The Space Review|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Long March 3B and 3B/E rockets conducted ten successful launches between 1997 and 2008.<ref name=\"cgwic.com\"/>\n\nIn 1997, the [[Agila 2]] satellite was forced to use onboard propellant to reach its correct orbit because of poor injection accuracy on the part of its Long March 3B launch vehicle.<ref>''International reference guide to space launch systems''.

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States, since information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles. The U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a [[Ammunition|munition]] and placed it back under the restrictive [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] in 1998.<ref name=\"zenio2006\">{{cite news|last1=Zelnio|first1=Ryan|title=A short history of export control policy|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/528/1|work=The Space Review|date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> No license to launch U.S. spacecraft on Chinese rockets has been approved by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] since then, and an official at the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] emphasized in 2016 that \"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it\u2019s incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China.\"<ref name=\"selding2016\">{{cite news|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=U.S. ITAR satellite export regime's effects still strong in Europe|url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-itar-satellite-export-regimes-effects-still-strong-in-europe/|work=SpaceNews|date=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-D partial launch failure ===\nOn August 31, 2009, during the launch of [[Palapa-D]], the third stage engine under-performed and placed the satellite into a lower than planned orbit. The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16.\nInvestigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine\u2019s gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine\u2019s liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn June 19th, 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying [[ChinaSat_9A|ChinaSat-9A]] ended in partial failure.\nOfficials did not release details regarding the status of the mission for at least 4 hours after liftoff.<ref>http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-3b-zhongxing-9a-launch/</ref> Two weeks later, on July 7th, officials confirmed that the mission had been anomalous, with Space Daily reporting that \"an anomaly was found on the carrier rocket's rolling control thruster, part of the attitude control engine, during the third gliding phase\". The failure in the rocket's third stage left the payload in a lower than intended orbit, and the payload was forced to spend two weeks reaching its intended orbit under its own

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites. The Long March 3B also served as the basis for the medium-capacity [[Long March 3C]], which was first launched in 2008.\n\n{{As of|2020|04}}, the Long March 3B and 3B/E have conducted 63<!-- UPDATE after each launch --> successful launches, plus two failures and two partial failures, giving them a success rate of {{percent|63|67|1}}.<!-- UPDATE after each launch -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:CZ-3B.svg|thumb|left|70px|A diagram of the Long March 3B, showing its outboard liquid rocket boosters.]]\n\nThe development of the Long March 3B began in 1986 to meet the needs of the international GEO communications satellite market.

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States, since information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles.

Over time, additional families were brought into the show to interact with the Hortons and serve as springboards for more dramatic storylines. Originally led by patriarch [[Tom Horton|Dr. Tom Horton]] and his wife, homemaker [[Alice Horton|Alice]], the Hortons remain a prominent fixture in current continuity. One of the longest-running story lines involved the rape of [[Mickey Horton]]'s wife Laura by Mickey's brother [[Bill Horton (character)|Bill]]. Laura confides in her father-in-law Dr. Tom, and the two agree that her husband Mickey should never know. The secret, involving the true parentage of [[Mike Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Michael Horton]] (a product of the rape) and Mickey's subsequent health issues as a result of the revelation, spanned episodes from 1968 to 1975. This plotline was made even more complex with the presence of Linda Patterson (originally [[Margaret Mason]] for many years, later [[Elaine Princi]]) who claimed that her daughter Melissa had been fathered by Mickey. When Mickey married the lovely [[Maggie Simmons]] ([[Suzanne Rogers]]), Linda became even more involved in the story line as the show's main villainess, marrying the wealthy Bob Anderson ([[Mark Tapscott]]) and taking over the running of Anderson Manufacturing when he became ill. The story line involving Mickey, Laura and Bill was the first to bring the show to prominence, and put it near the top of the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] daytime ratings.<ref name=\"soapnet\">{{cite web|title = Unforgettable Stories |last = Bonderoff |first = Jason |url = http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070319004927/http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archivedate = March 19, 2007 |publisher = [[SOAPnet]] |accessdate = June 8, 2007}}</ref> Another love triangle, between lounge singer [[Doug Williams and Julie Olson|Doug Williams]], Tom and Alice's daughter [[Addie Horton|Addie]], and Addie's own daughter, [[Julie Olson|Julie]], proved to be very popular around the same time.

Around the same time, with the help of head writers [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]], and [[Leah Laiman]], action/adventure story lines and [[supercouple]]s such as [[Bo and Hope]], Shane and Kimberly, and [[Patch and Kayla]] reinvigorated the show, previously focused primarily on the domestic troubles of the Hortons. Since the 1990s, with the introduction of writer [[James E. Reilly]], ''Days of Our Lives'' has moved from traditional plots to some supernatural and science-fiction-themed stories, in conjunction with the rivalry of good vs. evil, in a [[Hatfield-McCoy feud|Hatfield/McCoy]] feud style the Bradys versus the DiMeras.  Under the tenure of Reilly, ratings rose to number two, and stayed there until he left in 1999 to start his own creation of ''[[Passions]]''. Despite the introduction of new head writer [[Hogan Sheffer]] in 2006, ratings failed to revive, which led the show's producers to hire a few past fan favorites to stop the ratings hemorrhage.<ref name = \"ratings\"/>\n\n===Best-remembered stories===\n<!-- These were a sampling of the most remembered story lines on Days, as referenced by SOAPnet.

Many head writer changes occurred after Laiman left the series in 1989 and the role would not become stable again until [[James E. Reilly]] joined the show in that role in 1993. His tenure, which lasted for four-and-a-half years and featured several supernatural-themed plotlines (which would later become the centerpiece of fellow NBC soap ''[[Passions (TV series)|Passions]]'', when the Reilly-created series debuted in July 1999), was credited with bringing ratings up to the second place spot in the Nielsens. Other writers who succeeded him, such as [[Sally Sussman Morina]] and [[Tom Langan]], failed to keep the ratings success, and additional head writer turnover continued until Reilly \u2013 who would continue in his role as head writer and consulting producer of ''Passions'' after rejoining ''Days'' \u2013 returned to the series in 2003.\n\nFive-time Daytime Emmy winner [[Hogan Sheffer]] was named head writer with great fanfare in October 2006, but lasted less than 16 months with the show, with his last episode airing in January 2008.

NBC regularly carried ''Days'' as well as its other daytime shows during the duration of its [[Olympic Games]] coverage from [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] until [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]]. Beginning in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], when NBC expanded its Olympics coverage to include additional events during its daytime schedule, the network began preempting ''Days'' (and then-stablemate ''Passions'') for the duration of the Summer Olympics.<ref name=\"wapo-takingdays\">{{cite news|title=Taking 'Days' From Daytime|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2004/08/13/taking-days-from-daytime/874b1b2f-a229-48ef-9656-74fbccd4a1d2/|author=Frank Ahrens|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|date=August 13, 2004|accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nUnder an agreement reached with Sony Pictures Television in March 2004, cable network [[Soapnet]] began airing same-day rebroadcasts of ''Days of Our Lives'' each weeknight at 7:00 and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. (later 8:00 and 10:00&nbsp;p.m. towa) [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]] (with classic episodes sometimes filling the slot during NBC-predetermined preemptions), along with a (usually) five-hour-long weekend block of the past week's episodes; ''Days'' aired on the network until its closure in December 2013.<ref name=\"wapo-takingdays\"/> On August 24, 2015, [[Pop (U.S. TV network)|Pop]] began airing same-day rebroadcasts of the show as part of an early-prime-time soap opera repeat block that included CBS soaps ''The Young and the Restless'' and ''The Bold and the Beautiful''.

However, its ascent to the top was rapid; as the 1968\u201369 television season ended, it became an effective tool of NBC, which attempted to dethrone daytime leader CBS. By 1973, the show \u2013 pitted against CBS's popular ''[[Guiding Light]]'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. (ET)/1:00&nbsp;p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|CT]]) \u2013<ref name=\"daytime\">{{cite web|title=NBC Daytime|url=http://www.curtalliaume.com/nbc_day.html|author=Curt Alliaume|website=Curt Alliaume's Utterly Irrelevant Web Site|accessdate=July 10, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020409024925/http://www.curtalliaume.com/nbc_day.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=April 9, 2002}}</ref> had matched the first-place ratings of ''As the World Turns'' and fellow NBC soap ''Another World''. Due to the success of the program, NBC expanded ''Days'' from a 30-minute timeslot to 60 minutes on April 21, 1975.<ref name=\"dayssummary\"/>  This expansion had followed the lead of ''Another World,'' which became the first hour-long television soap opera 3\u00bd months earlier on January 6. Furthermore, ''Days of Our Lives''{{'}} new starting time of 1:30&nbsp;p.m. (ET)/12:30 (CT)<ref name=\"daytime\"/> finally solved a scheduling problem that began in 1968 when NBC lost the rights to the game show ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' to ABC, and in its wake, eight different shows were placed into the slot (''[[Hidden Faces]]'', ''[[You're Putting Me On]]'', ''[[House Party (radio and TV show)#Television|Life with Linkletter]]'', ''Words & Music'', ''[[Memory Game]]'', ''[[Three on a Match (game show)|Three on a Match]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[How to Survive a Marriage]]'') to little to no success.\n\nHowever, this first golden period for NBC's daytime lineup proved to be short-lived, as viewership for ''Days of Our Lives'' began to decline in 1977. Much of this dropoff was associated with ABC's expansion of its increasingly popular soap ''[[All My Children]]'' to a full hour, the last half of which overlapped with the first half-hour of ''Days of Our Lives'' and CBS' ''As The World Turns'' also airing at 1:30PM since it first premiered in April 1956. By January 1979, the network, in a mode of desperation more than anything else, decided to jump headlong against ''All My Children'' and moved the show ahead to the same 1:00&nbsp;p.m./12 Noon time slot.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> In exchange to its affiliates for taking away the old half-hour access slot at 1:00/Noon, NBC gave them the 4:00&nbsp;p.m./3:00 slot, the offerings of which many (if not most) of the network's stations had been preempting for years anyway.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> By 1986, ABC and CBS followed suit, under the intense pressure of lucrative (and cheap) [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming offered to affiliates.\n\nBy 1980, ''Days of Our Lives'' had displaced ''Another World'' as NBC's highest-rated soap. Overall though, the entire NBC soap lineup had been experiencing trouble maintaining ratings traction against their competitors on CBS and ABC. In fact, by 1982, all of its shows were rated above only one ABC soap (''[[The Edge of Night]]'') and below all four CBS soaps. The \"supercouple\" era of the 1980s, however, helped bring about a ratings revival, and the 1983\u201384 season saw ''Days of Our Lives'' experience a surge in ratings. It held onto its strong numbers for most of the 1980s, only to decline again by 1990, eventually falling back into eighth place. As ''Another World'' underwent its final ratings slump during the second half of the 1990s, many affiliates swapped the time slots of ''Another World'' and ''Days of Our Lives'', which usually aired an hour earlier.\nWhile individual NBC affiliates had the right to air any show whenever they wished, most of the affiliates (almost all of them, in the earlier days of  television) aired the show when it would be transmitted to the network's direct affiliates.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, however, the show experienced a resurgence in popularity and the show reached number two in the ratings, where it remained for several years before experiencing another ratings decline beginning in 1999, the year that ''Days of Our Lives'' became NBC's longest-running daytime program (upon the cancellation of ''Another World''). Throughout the 2000s (decade), ''Days of Our Lives'' and all the other remaining network daytime serials have witnessed a steady erosion of viewers, mainly due to vastly altered viewing habits induced by [[cable television|cable]] networks and alternative genres such as [[reality shows|reality]] and [[talk shows]] on minor network affiliates.\n\nOn January 17, 2007, NBC Universal Television president [[Jeff Zucker]] remarked that ''Days of Our Lives'' would most likely not \"continue past 2009.\"<ref name=\"zucker\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC|last=Levin|first=Gary|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-17-nbc-presstour_x.htm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007 | date=January 17, 2007}}</ref> This contributed to an immediate ratings decline for ''Days of Our Lives''. The show, which was averaging a 2.4 rating prior to the announcement, dropped to a 2.2 average household rating in the months after. In an April 2007 interview with ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'', executive producer Ken Corday commented on the ratings decline of the previous months, \"If I don't pay attention to the ratings and what the viewers are saying, I'm an ostrich. I have not seen a decline in the ratings on the show this precipitous \u2014 ever. I've never seen this much of a percentage decline.\"<ref name=autogenerated3>''Soap Opera Digest''. \"Crisis at ''DAYS''! The Secret Plan to Save It\". April 17, 2007.</ref>\n\n''Days of Our Lives'' had finished the 2008\u20132009 television season with a substantial increase in viewers (3.0 million vs. 2.8 million) and had risen to the #3 spot behind ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', respectively. It was the #2 daytime program behind ''The Young and the Restless'' in the much coveted 18\u201349 demographic. During the first few months of the 2009\u20132010 season, ''Days of Our Lives'' increased its average household rating to 2.4, and averaged consistently over 3,000,000 viewers. It was only one point behind the #2 daytime drama ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', and has beat that soap on several days during the season. In 2010, ''Days of Our Lives'' continued to increase viewership, reaching as high as 3.6 million viewers on several days. A substantial increase in viewership such as ''Days of Our Lives'' has had lately also bucks the viewership trend in daytime dramas, which had declined since the 1990s for all other daytime drama series. ''Days of Our Lives'' was the only daytime drama series to increase in viewers between 2008 and 2010 and had reduced its operating budget, making it a profitable asset to NBC's broadcast line-up.<ref name=\"Days of our Lives Renewed\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC \u2013 Days of our Lives Renewed|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007|date=January 17, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308095643/http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|archivedate=March 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHowever starting in 2011, while ABC canceled both ''All My Children'' and ''One Life to Live'', ''Days of Our Lives'' started to lose ground significantly to the point that it sometimes occupied the last position among all soaps for both total viewership and the 18\u201349 women demographic. The cancellation of ''[[All My Children]]'' on ABC combined with the return of several cast members allowed a brief resurgence of ''Days of Our Lives'' in October 2011, but ratings soon declined again.

Since January 1993, after the cancellation of ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'', [[WPXI-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has aired ''Days of Our Lives'' weekdays at 3:00&nbsp;p.m., while some stations such as [[WJAC-TV]] in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] air the program at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Some [[Central Time Zone]] affiliates carry the program at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. in tandem with NBC's Eastern Time Zone feed; one example is [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]'s [[WGBA-TV]], which uses it as an alternative to programming what would likely be a low-rated [[local news]]cast against long-established local competition. One NBC station, [[KSNV-DT]] in [[Las Vegas]], stopped carrying the show on August 19, 2013 due to a long-term move to an all-news schedule outside of network news and primetime programming; the program moved to the market's [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[KVCW]], where it aired at its traditional 1:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot until an ownership change saw the show return to KSNV in late December 2014 as part of a change in the all-news plans.

Over time, additional families were brought into the show to interact with the Hortons and serve as springboards for more dramatic storylines. Originally led by patriarch [[Tom Horton|Dr. Tom Horton]] and his wife, homemaker [[Alice Horton|Alice]], the Hortons remain a prominent fixture in current continuity. One of the longest-running story lines involved the rape of [[Mickey Horton]]'s wife Laura by Mickey's brother [[Bill Horton (character)|Bill]]. Laura confides in her father-in-law Dr. Tom, and the two agree that her husband Mickey should never know. The secret, involving the true parentage of [[Mike Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Michael Horton]] (a product of the rape) and Mickey's subsequent health issues as a result of the revelation, spanned episodes from 1968 to 1975. This plotline was made even more complex with the presence of Linda Patterson (originally [[Margaret Mason]] for many years, later [[Elaine Princi]]) who claimed that her daughter Melissa had been fathered by Mickey. When Mickey married the lovely [[Maggie Simmons]] ([[Suzanne Rogers]]), Linda became even more involved in the story line as the show's main villainess, marrying the wealthy Bob Anderson ([[Mark Tapscott]]) and taking over the running of Anderson Manufacturing when he became ill. The story line involving Mickey, Laura and Bill was the first to bring the show to prominence, and put it near the top of the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] daytime ratings.<ref name=\"soapnet\">{{cite web|title = Unforgettable Stories |last = Bonderoff |first = Jason |url = http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070319004927/http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archivedate = March 19, 2007 |publisher = [[SOAPnet]] |accessdate = June 8, 2007}}</ref> Another love triangle, between lounge singer [[Doug Williams and Julie Olson|Doug Williams]], Tom and Alice's daughter [[Addie Horton|Addie]], and Addie's own daughter, [[Julie Olson|Julie]], proved to be very popular around the same time.

Around the same time, with the help of head writers [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]], and [[Leah Laiman]], action/adventure story lines and [[supercouple]]s such as [[Bo and Hope]], Shane and Kimberly, and [[Patch and Kayla]] reinvigorated the show, previously focused primarily on the domestic troubles of the Hortons. Since the 1990s, with the introduction of writer [[James E. Reilly]], ''Days of Our Lives'' has moved from traditional plots to some supernatural and science-fiction-themed stories, in conjunction with the rivalry of good vs. evil, in a [[Hatfield-McCoy feud|Hatfield/McCoy]] feud style the Bradys versus the DiMeras.  Under the tenure of Reilly, ratings rose to number two, and stayed there until he left in 1999 to start his own creation of ''[[Passions]]''. Despite the introduction of new head writer [[Hogan Sheffer]] in 2006, ratings failed to revive, which led the show's producers to hire a few past fan favorites to stop the ratings hemorrhage.<ref name = \"ratings\"/>\n\n===Best-remembered stories===\n<!-- These were a sampling of the most remembered story lines on Days, as referenced by SOAPnet.

Many head writer changes occurred after Laiman left the series in 1989 and the role would not become stable again until [[James E. Reilly]] joined the show in that role in 1993. His tenure, which lasted for four-and-a-half years and featured several supernatural-themed plotlines (which would later become the centerpiece of fellow NBC soap ''[[Passions (TV series)|Passions]]'', when the Reilly-created series debuted in July 1999), was credited with bringing ratings up to the second place spot in the Nielsens. Other writers who succeeded him, such as [[Sally Sussman Morina]] and [[Tom Langan]], failed to keep the ratings success, and additional head writer turnover continued until Reilly \u2013 who would continue in his role as head writer and consulting producer of ''Passions'' after rejoining ''Days'' \u2013 returned to the series in 2003.\n\nFive-time Daytime Emmy winner [[Hogan Sheffer]] was named head writer with great fanfare in October 2006, but lasted less than 16 months with the show, with his last episode airing in January 2008.

NBC regularly carried ''Days'' as well as its other daytime shows during the duration of its [[Olympic Games]] coverage from [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] until [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]]. Beginning in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], when NBC expanded its Olympics coverage to include additional events during its daytime schedule, the network began preempting ''Days'' (and then-stablemate ''Passions'') for the duration of the Summer Olympics.<ref name=\"wapo-takingdays\">{{cite news|title=Taking 'Days' From Daytime|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2004/08/13/taking-days-from-daytime/874b1b2f-a229-48ef-9656-74fbccd4a1d2/|author=Frank Ahrens|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Media Group|The Washington Post Company]]|date=August 13, 2004|accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nUnder an agreement reached with Sony Pictures Television in March 2004, cable network [[Soapnet]] began airing same-day rebroadcasts of ''Days of Our Lives'' each weeknight at 7:00 and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. (later 8:00 and 10:00&nbsp;p.m. towa) [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]] (with classic episodes sometimes filling the slot during NBC-predetermined preemptions), along with a (usually) five-hour-long weekend block of the past week's episodes; ''Days'' aired on the network until its closure in December 2013.<ref name=\"wapo-takingdays\"/> On August 24, 2015, [[Pop (U.S. TV network)|Pop]] began airing same-day rebroadcasts of the show as part of an early-prime-time soap opera repeat block that included CBS soaps ''The Young and the Restless'' and ''The Bold and the Beautiful''.

However, its ascent to the top was rapid; as the 1968\u201369 television season ended, it became an effective tool of NBC, which attempted to dethrone daytime leader CBS. By 1973, the show \u2013 pitted against CBS's popular ''[[Guiding Light]]'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. (ET)/1:00&nbsp;p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|CT]]) \u2013<ref name=\"daytime\">{{cite web|title=NBC Daytime|url=http://www.curtalliaume.com/nbc_day.html|author=Curt Alliaume|website=Curt Alliaume's Utterly Irrelevant Web Site|accessdate=July 10, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020409024925/http://www.curtalliaume.com/nbc_day.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=April 9, 2002}}</ref> had matched the first-place ratings of ''As the World Turns'' and fellow NBC soap ''Another World''. Due to the success of the program, NBC expanded ''Days'' from a 30-minute timeslot to 60 minutes on April 21, 1975.<ref name=\"dayssummary\"/>  This expansion had followed the lead of ''Another World,'' which became the first hour-long television soap opera 3\u00bd months earlier on January 6. Furthermore, ''Days of Our Lives''{{'}} new starting time of 1:30&nbsp;p.m. (ET)/12:30 (CT)<ref name=\"daytime\"/> finally solved a scheduling problem that began in 1968 when NBC lost the rights to the game show ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' to ABC, and in its wake, eight different shows were placed into the slot (''[[Hidden Faces]]'', ''[[You're Putting Me On]]'', ''[[House Party (radio and TV show)#Television|Life with Linkletter]]'', ''Words & Music'', ''[[Memory Game]]'', ''[[Three on a Match (game show)|Three on a Match]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[How to Survive a Marriage]]'') to little to no success.\n\nHowever, this first golden period for NBC's daytime lineup proved to be short-lived, as viewership for ''Days of Our Lives'' began to decline in 1977. Much of this dropoff was associated with ABC's expansion of its increasingly popular soap ''[[All My Children]]'' to a full hour, the last half of which overlapped with the first half-hour of ''Days of Our Lives'' and CBS' ''As The World Turns'' also airing at 1:30PM since it first premiered in April 1956. By January 1979, the network, in a mode of desperation more than anything else, decided to jump headlong against ''All My Children'' and moved the show ahead to the same 1:00&nbsp;p.m./12 Noon time slot.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> In exchange to its affiliates for taking away the old half-hour access slot at 1:00/Noon, NBC gave them the 4:00&nbsp;p.m./3:00 slot, the offerings of which many (if not most) of the network's stations had been preempting for years anyway.<ref name=\"daytime\"/> By 1986, ABC and CBS followed suit, under the intense pressure of lucrative (and cheap) [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming offered to affiliates.\n\nBy 1980, ''Days of Our Lives'' had displaced ''Another World'' as NBC's highest-rated soap. Overall though, the entire NBC soap lineup had been experiencing trouble maintaining ratings traction against their competitors on CBS and ABC. In fact, by 1982, all of its shows were rated above only one ABC soap (''[[The Edge of Night]]'') and below all four CBS soaps. The \"supercouple\" era of the 1980s, however, helped bring about a ratings revival, and the 1983\u201384 season saw ''Days of Our Lives'' experience a surge in ratings. It held onto its strong numbers for most of the 1980s, only to decline again by 1990, eventually falling back into eighth place. As ''Another World'' underwent its final ratings slump during the second half of the 1990s, many affiliates swapped the time slots of ''Another World'' and ''Days of Our Lives'', which usually aired an hour earlier.\nWhile individual NBC affiliates had the right to air any show whenever they wished, most of the affiliates (almost all of them, in the earlier days of  television) aired the show when it would be transmitted to the network's direct affiliates.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, however, the show experienced a resurgence in popularity and the show reached number two in the ratings, where it remained for several years before experiencing another ratings decline beginning in 1999, the year that ''Days of Our Lives'' became NBC's longest-running daytime program (upon the cancellation of ''Another World''). Throughout the 2000s (decade), ''Days of Our Lives'' and all the other remaining network daytime serials have witnessed a steady erosion of viewers, mainly due to vastly altered viewing habits induced by [[cable television|cable]] networks and alternative genres such as [[reality shows|reality]] and [[talk shows]] on minor network affiliates.\n\nOn January 17, 2007, NBC Universal Television president [[Jeff Zucker]] remarked that ''Days of Our Lives'' would most likely not \"continue past 2009.\"<ref name=\"zucker\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC|last=Levin|first=Gary|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-17-nbc-presstour_x.htm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007 | date=January 17, 2007}}</ref> This contributed to an immediate ratings decline for ''Days of Our Lives''. The show, which was averaging a 2.4 rating prior to the announcement, dropped to a 2.2 average household rating in the months after. In an April 2007 interview with ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'', executive producer Ken Corday commented on the ratings decline of the previous months, \"If I don't pay attention to the ratings and what the viewers are saying, I'm an ostrich. I have not seen a decline in the ratings on the show this precipitous \u2014 ever. I've never seen this much of a percentage decline.\"<ref name=autogenerated3>''Soap Opera Digest''. \"Crisis at ''DAYS''! The Secret Plan to Save It\". April 17, 2007.</ref>\n\n''Days of Our Lives'' had finished the 2008\u20132009 television season with a substantial increase in viewers (3.0 million vs. 2.8 million) and had risen to the #3 spot behind ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', respectively. It was the #2 daytime program behind ''The Young and the Restless'' in the much coveted 18\u201349 demographic. During the first few months of the 2009\u20132010 season, ''Days of Our Lives'' increased its average household rating to 2.4, and averaged consistently over 3,000,000 viewers. It was only one point behind the #2 daytime drama ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', and has beat that soap on several days during the season. In 2010, ''Days of Our Lives'' continued to increase viewership, reaching as high as 3.6 million viewers on several days. A substantial increase in viewership such as ''Days of Our Lives'' has had lately also bucks the viewership trend in daytime dramas, which had declined since the 1990s for all other daytime drama series. ''Days of Our Lives'' was the only daytime drama series to increase in viewers between 2008 and 2010 and had reduced its operating budget, making it a profitable asset to NBC's broadcast line-up.<ref name=\"Days of our Lives Renewed\">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC \u2013 Days of our Lives Renewed|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=June 8, 2007|date=January 17, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308095643/http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|archivedate=March 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHowever starting in 2011, while ABC canceled both ''All My Children'' and ''One Life to Live'', ''Days of Our Lives'' started to lose ground significantly to the point that it sometimes occupied the last position among all soaps for both total viewership and the 18\u201349 women demographic. The cancellation of ''[[All My Children]]'' on ABC combined with the return of several cast members allowed a brief resurgence of ''Days of Our Lives'' in October 2011, but ratings soon declined again.

Since January 1993, after the cancellation of ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'', [[WPXI-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]] has aired ''Days of Our Lives'' weekdays at 3:00&nbsp;p.m., while some stations such as [[WJAC-TV]] in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] air the program at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Some [[Central Time Zone]] affiliates carry the program at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. in tandem with NBC's Eastern Time Zone feed; one example is [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]'s [[WGBA-TV]], which uses it as an alternative to programming what would likely be a low-rated [[local news]]cast against long-established local competition. One NBC station, [[KSNV-DT]] in [[Las Vegas]], stopped carrying the show on August 19, 2013 due to a long-term move to an all-news schedule outside of network news and primetime programming; the program moved to the market's [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[KVCW]], where it aired at its traditional 1:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot until an ownership change saw the show return to KSNV in late December 2014 as part of a change in the all-news plans.

It is the most populated municipality and historic core city of the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]], which straddles the [[Kansas]]\u2013[[Missouri]] state line and has a CSA population of 2,487,053. Most of the city lies within [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], but portions spill into [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay]], [[Cass County, Missouri|Cass]], and [[Platte County, Missouri|Platte]] counties. The city borders [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]] and [[Kansas City, Kansas]], (KCK/[[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte County]]) in [[Kansas]]. Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a [[Missouri River]] port at its confluence with the [[Kansas River]] coming in from the west. On June 1, 1850, the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the [[Kansas Territory]]. Confusion between the two ensued, and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon after. \n\nSitting on Missouri's western boundary with [[Kansas]], with [[Downtown Kansas City|Downtown]] near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the city encompasses some {{convert|319.03|sqmi|km2}}, making it the [[List of United States cities by area|23rd largest city by total area]] in the United States. Along with [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], one of its major suburbs, it serves as one of the two county seats of Jackson County. Other major suburbs include the Missouri cities of [[Blue Springs, Missouri|Blue Springs]] and [[Lee's Summit, Missouri|Lee's Summit]] and the Kansas cities of [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]], [[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]], and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]].\n\nThe city is composed of several neighborhoods, including the [[River Market, Kansas City|River Market District]] in the north, the 18th and Vine District in the east, and the [[Country Club Plaza]] in the south. Kansas City is known for its long tradition of [[jazz]] music and culture, especially theater \u2013 the city was the center of the [[Vaudevillian]] [[Orpheum circuit]] in the 1920s. It is also noted for its cuisine, including its distinctive [[Kansas City-style barbecue]], and its craft breweries.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of Kansas City, Missouri|History of the Kansas City metropolitan area}}\nKansas City, Missouri, was incorporated as a town on June 1, 1850, and as a city on March 28, 1853. The [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|territory]], straddling the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, was considered a good place to build settlements.\n\nThe [[Antioch Christian Church (Kansas City, Missouri)|Antioch Christian Church]], [[Dr. James Compton House]], and [[Woodneath]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>\n\n===Exploration and settlement===\n[[File:Westport Pioneers Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Kansas City Pioneer Square monument in Westport features [[Pony Express]] founder [[Alexander Majors]], Westport/Kansas City founder [[John Calvin McCoy]], and Mountain-man [[Jim Bridger]] who owned Chouteau's Store.]]\n\nThe first documented European visitor to the eventual site of Kansas City was [[\u00c9tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont]], who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River. Criticized for his response to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] attack on [[Fort D\u00e9troit]], he had deserted his post as fort commander and was avoiding French authorities. Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in a village about {{convert|90|mi|km}} east near [[Brunswick, Missouri]], where he illegally traded [[furs]].\n\nTo clear his name, he wrote ''Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony'' in 1713 followed in 1714 by ''The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River''. In the documents, he describes the junction of the \"Grande Riv[i\u00e8re] des Cansez\" and Missouri River, making him the first to adopt those names. French cartographer [[Guillaume Delisle]] used the descriptions to make the area's first reasonably accurate map.\n\nThe Spanish took over the region in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, but were not to play a major role other than taxing and licensing Missouri River ship traffic. The French continued their [[fur trade]] under Spanish license. The [[Chouteau]] family operated under Spanish license at [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], in the lower [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley]] as early as 1765 and in 1821 the Chouteaus reached Kansas City, where [[Fran\u00e7ois Chouteau]] established Chouteau's Landing.\n\nAfter the 1804 [[Louisiana Purchase]], [[Lewis and Clark]] visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, noting it was a good place to build a fort. In 1831, a group of [[Mormons]] from New York settled in what would become the city. They built the first school within Kansas City's current boundaries, but were forced out by [[mob violence]] in 1833, and their settlement remained vacant.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=Ernest L. |title=Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years |location=Provo |publisher=BYU Press |year=1976 |volume=Vol. 1 |page=7 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1833 [[John Calvin McCoy|John McCoy]], son of [[Baptist]] missionary [[Isaac McCoy]], established [[Westport, Kansas City|West Port]] along the [[Santa Fe Trail]], {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=off|adj=off|sp=us}} away from the river. In 1834 McCoy established [[Westport, Kansas City|Westport Landing]] on a bend in the Missouri to serve as a landing point for West Port. Soon after, the Kansas Town Company, a group of investors, began to settle the area, taking their name from an English spelling of \"Cansez.\" In 1850, the landing area was incorporated as the Town of Kansas.<ref>{{cite web | title=Why is Kansas City located in Missouri instead of Kansas? | url=http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | accessdate=January 2, 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716232838/http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | archivedate=July 16, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy that time, the Town of Kansas, Westport, and nearby [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], had become critical points in the United States' [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|westward expansion]].

The boundary lines at that time extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street, and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes Road and Charlotte Street on the east.<ref>{{cite web | title=Early City Limits | url=http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 | accessdate =September 11, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175946/http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n\nDuring the Civil War, the city and its immediate surroundings were the focus of intense military activity. Although the [[First Battle of Independence]] in August 1862 resulted in a [[Confederate States Army]] victory, the Confederates were unable to leverage their win in any significant fashion, as Kansas City was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified to assault. The [[Second Battle of Independence]], which occurred on October 21\u201322, 1864, as part of [[Sterling Price]]'s [[Price's Raid|Missouri expedition of 1864]], also resulted in a Confederate triumph. Once again their victory proved hollow, as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal [[Battle of Westport]] the next day, effectively ending Confederate efforts to regain Missouri.\n\nGeneral [[Thomas Ewing, Jr.|Thomas Ewing]], in response to a successful raid on nearby [[Lawrence, Kansas]], led by [[William Quantrill]], issued [[General Order No. 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]], forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties \u2013 including Jackson \u2013 except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing.\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nAfter the Civil War, Kansas City grew rapidly, largely losing its Southern identity. The selection of the city over [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], for the [[Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad]] bridge over the Missouri River brought about significant growth. The population exploded after 1869, when the Hannibal Bridge, designed by [[Octave Chanute]], opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889, and the city limits to be extended south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2, 1897. In 1900, Kansas City was the 22nd largest city in the country, with a population of 163,752 residents.<ref name=\"U.S. Census Bureau\">{{cite web|title=Missouri \u2013 Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n[[File:Junction of Main and Delaware Streets, Kansas City, Mo (NYPL b12647398-68704).tiff|thumb|Junction of Main and Delaware Streets in 1898]]\nKansas City, guided by architect [[George Kessler]], became a forefront example of the [[City Beautiful]] movement, offering a network of boulevards and parks.<ref>{{cite web | title=Historic Sanborn Maps of Kansas City | url=http://digital.library.umsystem.edu/image/umcscsanic/title/kansas+city+missouri | publisher = [[University of Missouri]] Digital Library | accessdate =March 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe relocation of [[Kansas City Union Station|Union Station]] to its current location in 1914 and the opening of the [[Liberty Memorial]] in 1923 provided two of the city's most identifiable landmarks. [[Robert A. Long]], president of the Liberty Memorial Association, was a driving force in the funding for construction. Long was a longtime resident and wealthy businessman. He built the [[R.A. Long Building]] for the [[Long-Bell Lumber Company]], his home, [[Corinthian Hall]] (now the [[Kansas City Museum]]) and [[Longview Farm]].\n\nFurther spurring Kansas City's growth was the opening of the innovative [[Country Club Plaza]] development by [[Jesse Clyde Nichols|J.C. Nichols]] in 1925, as part of his [[Country Club District]] plan.\n\n====20th century streetcar system====\n[[Streetcars in Kansas City|The Kansas City streetcar system]] used to have hundreds of miles of streetcars running through the city and was one of the largest systems in the country.<ref> https://www.kcur.org/post/history-kansas-city-streetcar#stream/0</ref> In 1903 an underground  streetcar tunnel was built underneath the city (called the 8th Street Tunnel).

Several important buildings and structures were built during this time, including the [[Kansas City City Hall]] and the Jackson County Courthouse. The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to tax evasion after long federal investigations. His biographers have summed up Pendergast's uniqueness:\n<blockquote>Pendergast may bear comparison to various big-city bosses, but his open alliance with hardened criminals, his cynical subversion of the democratic process, his monarchistic style of living, his increasingly insatiable gambling habit, his grasping for a business empire, and his promotion of Kansas City as a wide-open town with every kind of vice imaginable, combined with his professed compassion for the poor and very real role as city builder, made him bigger than life, difficult to characterize.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lawrence H.

The city's first suburbs were in the neighborhoods of Pendleton Heights and Quality Hill. After [[World War II]], many relatively affluent residents left for suburbs in [[Johnson County, Kansas]], and eastern Jackson County, Missouri. Many also went north of the [[Missouri River]], where Kansas City had incorporated areas between the 1940s and 1970s.\n\n====Troost dividing wall and white flight====\n\n[[Troost Avenue]], once the eastern edge of Kansas City, Mo., and home to millionaires, is now widely seen as one of the city's most prominent racial and economic dividing lines due to urban decay, which was caused by [[white flight]].<ref> https://info.umkc.edu/unews/troost-wall-the-product-of-kansas-citys-long-running-racial-plight/ </ref><ref> https://www.kcur.org/post/how-troost-became-major-divide-kansas-city</ref> During civil rights era  the city blocked people of color from moving to homes west of Troost Avenue causing the areas east of Troost to have one of the worst murder rates in the country.

The assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], was a catalyst for the [[1968 Kansas City riot]]. At this time, slums were forming in the inner city, and many who could afford to do so left for the suburbs and outer edges of the city. The post-World War II idea of suburbs and the \"American Dream\" also contributed to the sprawl of the area. The city's population continued to grow, but the inner city declined.

Gates, opened Gates Bar-B-Q, later [[Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q]] when his son Ollie joined the family business. Bryant's and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants; native Kansas Citian and essayist Calvin Trillin famously called Bryant's \"the single best restaurant in the world\" in an essay he wrote for ''Playboy'' magazine in the 1960s. [[Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue]] is also well regarded. In 1977, [[Rich Davis]], a psychiatrist, test-marketed his own concoction called K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce. He renamed it [[KC Masterpiece]], and in 1986, he sold the recipe to the [[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford]] division of [[Clorox]]. Davis retained rights to operate restaurants using the name and sauce, whose recipe popularized the use of molasses as a sweetener in Kansas City-style barbecue sauces.

The [[Big 12 Women's Basketball Tournament|women's tournament]] is played at [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City)|Municipal Auditorium]].\n\nThe city has one [[NCAA Division I]] program, the [[Kansas City Roos]], representing the [[University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City]] (UMKC). The program, historically known as the UMKC Kangaroos, adopted its current branding after the 2018\u201319 school year.\n\nIn addition to serving as the Chiefs' home stadium, [[Arrowhead Stadium]] serves as the venue for various intercollegiate football games. It has hosted the Big 12 Championship Game five times. On the last weekend in October, the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association|MIAA]] Fall Classic rivalry game between [[Northwest Missouri State Bearcats football|Northwest Missouri State University]] and [[Pittsburg State University]] took place at the stadium.\n\n===Professional rugby===\nKansas City is represented on the [[rugby union|rugby]] pitch by the [[Kansas City Blues RFC]], a former member of the [[Rugby Super League (United States)|Rugby Super League]] and a Division 1 club. The team works closely with Sporting Kansas City and splits home-games between Sporting's training pitch and [[Rockhurst University]]'s stadium.\n\n===Former teams===\nKansas City briefly had four short-term major league baseball teams between 1884 and 1915: the [[Kansas City Cowboys (Union Association)|Kansas City Unions]] of the short-lived [[Union Association]] in 1884, the [[Kansas City Cowboys (National League)|Kansas City Cowboys]] in the [[National League]] in 1886, a team of the [[Kansas City Cowboys (American Association)|same name]] in the then-major league [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in 1888 and 1889, and the [[Kansas City Packers]] in the [[Federal League]] in 1914 and 1915.  The [[Kansas City Monarchs]] of the now-defunct [[Negro National League (1920\u201331)|Negro National]] and [[Negro American League|Negro American]] Leagues represented Kansas City from 1920 through 1955. The city also had a number of minor league baseball teams between 1885 and 1955. From 1903 through 1954, the [[Kansas City Blues (American Association)|Kansas City Blues]] played in the high-level [[American Association (20th Century)|American Association]] minor league. In 1955, Kansas City became a major league city when the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] baseball franchise relocated to the city in 1955. Following the 1967 season, the team relocated to [[Oakland, California]].\n\nKansas City was also represented in the [[National Basketball Association]] by the [[Sacramento Kings|Kansas City Kings]] (called the Kansas City-Omaha Kings from 1972 to 1975), when the former Cincinnati Royals moved to the Midwest. The team left for [[Sacramento]] in 1985.\n\nIn 1974, the [[National Hockey League]] placed an expansion team in Kansas City called the [[Kansas City Scouts]]. The team moved to [[Denver]] in 1976, then to [[New Jersey]] in 1982 where they have remained ever since as the [[New Jersey Devils]].\n\n[[File:Penn Valley Park.jpg|thumb|View of downtown from [[Penn Valley Park]]]]\n[[File:Loose Park Rose Garden.jpg|thumb|The rose garden in [[Loose Park]], Kansas City's third largest public park.]]\n\n==Parks and boulevards==\n[[File:JC Nichols Fountain by Henri-L\u00e9on Gr\u00e9ber Kansas City.jpg|thumb|''J.C.

The city has a council/manager form of government. The role of [[city manager]] has diminished over the years. The non-elective office of city manager was created following excesses during the Pendergast days. The mayor is the head of the [[Kansas City, Missouri City Council|Kansas City City Council]], which has 12 members (one member for each district, plus one at large member per district). The mayor is the presiding member. Kansas City holds city elections in every fourth odd numbered year. The last citywide election was held in May 2015. The officials took office in August 2015 and will hold the position until 2019.\n\nPendergast was the most prominent leader during the machine politics days. The most nationally prominent Democrat associated with the machine was [[Harry S Truman]], who became a Senator, Vice President and then [[President of the United States]] from 1945 to 1953. Kansas City is the seat of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri]], one of two [[United States district courts|federal district courts]] in Missouri.  The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] is in St. Louis. It also is the seat of the Western District of the [[Missouri Court of Appeals]], one of three districts of that court (the Eastern District is in St. Louis and the Southern District is in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]]).\n\nThe Mayor, City Council, and City Manager are listed below:<ref>https://www.kceb.org/useruploads/2019_mayorCC/Election_Summary_Official_6-19.pdf\n\nhttps://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719152736/https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members |date=July 19, 2019 }}\n\n<br /></ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The urban core of Kansas City consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections; however, on the state and local level Republicans often find success, especially in the Northland and other suburban areas of Kansas City.\n\n===Federal representation===\nKansas City is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives]]:\n*[[Missouri's 4th congressional district]] \u2013 the Cass County portion of Kansas City; represented by [[Vicky Hartzler]] (Republican)\n*[[Missouri's 5th congressional district]] \u2013 all of Kansas City proper in Jackson County, plus Independence; represented by [[Emanuel Cleaver]] (Democrat)\n*[[Missouri's 6th congressional district]] \u2013 all of Kansas City proper north of the [[Missouri River]] and plus suburbs in eastern Jackson County beyond Independence; represented by [[Sam Graves]] (Republican)\n\n[[File:Police Respond to Shooting.jpg|thumb|Police respond to a shooting in the [[Crossroads, Kansas City|Crossroads]] area during the early hours of New Years Day 2016.]]\n\n===Crime===\nSome of the earliest organized violence in Kansas City erupted during the [[American Civil War]]. Shortly after the city's incorporation in 1850, so-called [[Bleeding Kansas]] erupted, affecting [[border ruffians]] and [[Jayhawkers]]. During the war, Union troops [[General Order \u2116 11 (1863)|burned all occupied dwellings]] in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas. After the war, the ''[[Kansas City Times]]'' turned outlaw [[Jesse James]] into a folk hero via its coverage. James was born in the Kansas City metro area at [[Kearney, Missouri]], and notoriously robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th Street and Campbell Avenue.\n\nIn the early 20th century under Pendergast, Kansas City became the country's \"most wide open town\". While this would give rise to [[Kansas City Jazz]], it also led to the rise of the [[Kansas City crime family|Kansas City mob]] (initially under [[Johnny Lazia]]), as well as the arrival of [[organized crime]]. In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gang war over control of the [[River Quay]] entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations gained after boss [[Nick Civella]] was recorded discussing gambling bets on [[Super Bowl IV]] (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings). The war and investigation led to the end of mob control of the [[Stardust Casino]], which was the basis for the film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'' (although the production minimizes the Kansas City connections).\n\nAs of November 2012, Kansas City [[United States cities by crime rate|ranked 18th]] on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI)'s annual survey of crime rates for cities with populations over 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |title=FBI: Violent crime drops in Kansas City for first half of 2012 \u2013 Kansas City Business Journal |website=Bizjournals.com |date=February 1, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730054734/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |archive-date=July 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Much of the city's violent crime occurs on the city's lower income East Side.

The ''Star'' sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an [[antitrust]] investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman's behest, following a long-standing feud with the ''Star'') over the newspaper's ownership of television and radio stations.

Between 1931 and 1982 Kansas City was home to the [[Calvin Company]], a large movie production company that specialized in promotional and sales short films and commercials for corporations, as well as educational films for schools and the government. Calvin was an important venue for Kansas City arts, training local filmmakers who went on to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood careers]] and also employing local actors, most of whom earned their main income in fields such as radio and television announcing. Kansas City native [[Robert Altman]] directed movies at the Calvin Company, which led him to shoot his first feature film, ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', in Kansas City using many local players.\n\nThe 1983 television movie ''[[The Day After]]'' was filmed in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas. The 1990s film ''[[Truman (1995 film)|Truman]]'', starring [[Gary Sinise]], was filmed in the city. Other films shot in or around Kansas City include ''[[Article 99]]'', ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Bridge|Mr. & Mrs. Bridge]]'', ''[[Kansas City (film)|Kansas City]]'', ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[Ninth Street]]'', and ''[[Sometimes They Come Back (film)|Sometimes They Come Back]]'' (in and around nearby [[Liberty, Missouri]]). More recently, a scene in the controversial film ''[[Br\u00fcno]]'' was filmed in downtown Kansas City's historic Hotel Phillips.\n\nToday, Kansas City is home to an active independent film community. The [[Independent Filmmaker's Coalition]] is an organization dedicated to expanding and improving independent filmmaking in Kansas City. The city launched the KC Film Office in October 2014 with the goal of better marketing the city for prospective television shows and movies to be filmed there. The City Council passed several film tax incentives in February 2016 to take effect in May 2016; the KC Film Office is coordinating its efforts with the State of Missouri to reinstate film incentives on a statewide level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|title=Tax breaks for films could bring cash to Kansas City|last=Monreal|first=Jane|date=April 2, 2016|website=KSHB|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417155354/http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|archive-date=April 17, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{Main|Kansas City Metropolitan Area#Transportation|Kansas City Metropolitan Area}}\n\nOriginally, Kansas City was the launching point for travelers on the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], and [[California Trail|California]] trails. Later, with the construction of the [[Hannibal Bridge]] across the [[Missouri River]], it became the junction of 11 trunk railroads. More rail tonnage passes through the city than through any other U.S. city. [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) located its headquarters in the city, and had ambitious plans to turn the city into an air hub.\n\n===Highways===\n[[File:Alphamap.gif|left|thumb|Kansas City is a major meeting place for several of the nation's busiest highways.]]\n\n\nMissouri and Kansas were the first states to start building interstates with [[Interstate 70]]. [[Interstate 435]], which encircles the entire city, is the second longest beltway in the nation. ([[Interstate 275 (Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana)|Interstate 275]] around [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] is the longest.) The Kansas City metro area has more limited-access highway lane-miles per capita than any other large US metro area, over 27% more than the second-place [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]], over 50% more than the average American metropolitan area. From 2013 to 2017 the average commuting time was 21.8 minutes. <ref> https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/kansascitycitymissouri/PST045218</ref> The [[Sierra Club]] blames the extensive freeway network for excessive [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] and the decline of central Kansas City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sprawl/report98/kansas_city.asp |title=1998 Sprawl Report- Sprawl \u2013 Sierra Club |publisher=Sierraclub.org |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516193458/http://www.sierraclub.org/sprawl/report98/kansas_city.asp |archive-date=May 16, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> On the other hand, the relatively uncongested road network contributes significantly to Kansas City's position as one of America's largest [[Logistics|logistics]] hubs.<ref>[http://www.kcsmartport.com/sec_news/media/documents/ShippingCentral.pdf Kcsmartport.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325133930/http://www.kcsmartport.com/sec_news/media/documents/ShippingCentral.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Airports===\n[[File:Kci.JPG|thumb|[[Kansas City International Airport]]]]\n\n[[Kansas City International Airport]], airport code MCI (Mid-Continent International Airport) was built to TWA's specifications to make a world hub.<ref>https://flykci.com/newsroom/press-kit/backgrounder/</ref> Its original passenger-friendly design placed each of its gates \n{{convert|100|ft|m}} from the street. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], it required a costly overhaul to conform to the tighter security protocols. [[Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport]] was TWA's original headquarters and houses the [[Airline History Museum]]. It is still used for [[general aviation]] and airshows.\n\n===Public transportation===\nLike most American cities, Kansas City's mass transit system was originally rail-based. From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City's streetcar system was among the top in the country, with over {{convert|300|mi|km}} of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down.\n\n====KCATA- RideKC====\nOn December 28, 1965, the [[Kansas City Area Transportation Authority]] (KCATA) was formed via a bi-state compact created by the Missouri and Kansas legislatures. The compact gave the KCATA responsibility for planning, construction, owning and operating passenger transportation systems and facilities within the seven-county area.\n\n=====RideKC Bus and MAX=====\n[[File:RideKC Bus.jpg|thumb|A newly branded RideKC Bus.]]\nIn July 2005, the KCATA launched Kansas City's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, the [[Metro Area Express]] (MAX). MAX links the River Market, Downtown, [[Kansas City Union Station|Union Station]], Crown Center and the Country Club Plaza.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcata.org/maps_schedules/max/ |title=Maps and Schedules |publisher=KCATA |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420042341/http://www.kcata.org/maps_schedules/max |archive-date=April 20, 2010 |url-status=unfit }}</ref> MAX operates and is marketed more like a rail system than a local bus line. A unique identity was created for MAX, including 13 modern diesel buses and easily identifiable \"stations\". MAX features (real-time [[global positioning system|GPS]] tracking of buses, available at every station), and stoplights automatically change in their favor if buses are behind schedule. In 2010, a second MAX line was added on Troost Avenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/max_and_bus_rapid_transit/ |title=Light Rail and MAX |publisher=KCATA |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115112506/http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/max_and_bus_rapid_transit/ |archive-date=January 15, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The city is planning another MAX line down Prospect Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/prospect_ave_study|title=Prospect Ave. MAX {{!}} Light Rail and MAX {{!}} KCATA|last=Authority|first=Kansas City Area Transportation|website=www.kcata.org|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602120949/http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/prospect_ave_study|archive-date=June 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Prospect MAX line launched in 2019 and Mayor [[Quinton Lucas]] announced the service would be fare-free indefinitely.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.masstransitmag.com/technology/fare-collection/news/21127532/mo-prospect-max-bus-service-will-be-farefree-indefinitely-for-riders|title=MO: Prospect MAX bus service will be fare-free indefinitely for riders|last=Rice|first=Glenn|date=February 28, 2020|website=Mass Transit Magazine|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n[[File:Streetcar 10main.jpg|thumb|upright|KC Streetcar departing the Library stop heading north to the River Market.|left]]\n\n=====RideKC Streetcar=====\nOn December 12, 2012, a ballot initiative to construct a $102 million, 2-mile (3200 m) modern streetcar line in downtown Kansas City was approved by local voters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/12/12/kansas-city-voters-approve-streetcar.html|title=Kansas City voters approve streetcar plan|newspaper=Kansas City Business Journal|accessdate=January 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730051350/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/12/12/kansas-city-voters-approve-streetcar.html|archive-date=July 30, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The streetcar route runs along Main Street from the [[River Market]] to [[Union Station (Kansas City, Missouri)|Union Station]]; it debuted on May 6, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article76034492.html|title=Crowds jam streetcars in Kansas City return|website=kansascity|access-date=May 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507115829/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article76034492.html|archive-date=May 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees \u2013 the [[Kansas City Streetcar Authority]] \u2013 operates and maintains the system.

The buses and other transit options will be branded as: RideKC Bus, RideKC MAX, RideKC Streetcar, and RideKC Bridj. RideKC Bridj is a micro transit service partnership between Ford Bridj and KCATA that began on March 7, 2016. Users download the Bridj app and use the service much like a taxi service.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had an estimated population of 491,918 in 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|title=City and Town Population Totals: 2010\u20132018|website=www.census.gov|access-date=May 27, 2019}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> making it the [[List of United States cities by population|38th most-populous city in the United States]]. It is the most populated municipality and historic core city of the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]], which straddles the [[Kansas]]\u2013[[Missouri]] state line and has a CSA population of 2,487,053. Most of the city lies within [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], but portions spill into [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay]], [[Cass County, Missouri|Cass]], and [[Platte County, Missouri|Platte]] counties. The city borders [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]] and [[Kansas City, Kansas]], (KCK/[[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte County]]) in [[Kansas]]. Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a [[Missouri River]] port at its confluence with the [[Kansas River]] coming in from the west. On June 1, 1850, the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the [[Kansas Territory]]. Confusion between the two ensued, and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon after. \n\nSitting on Missouri's western boundary with [[Kansas]], with [[Downtown Kansas City|Downtown]] near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the city encompasses some {{convert|319.03|sqmi|km2}}, making it the [[List of United States cities by area|23rd largest city by total area]] in the United States. Along with [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], one of its major suburbs, it serves as one of the two county seats of Jackson County. Other major suburbs include the Missouri cities of [[Blue Springs, Missouri|Blue Springs]] and [[Lee's Summit, Missouri|Lee's Summit]] and the Kansas cities of [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]], [[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]], and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]].\n\nThe city is composed of several neighborhoods, including the [[River Market, Kansas City|River Market District]] in the north, the 18th and Vine District in the east, and the [[Country Club Plaza]] in the south. Kansas City is known for its long tradition of [[jazz]] music and culture, especially theater \u2013 the city was the center of the [[Vaudevillian]] [[Orpheum circuit]] in the 1920s. It is also noted for its cuisine, including its distinctive [[Kansas City-style barbecue]], and its craft breweries.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of Kansas City, Missouri|History of the Kansas City metropolitan area}}\nKansas City, Missouri, was incorporated as a town on June 1, 1850, and as a city on March 28, 1853. The [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|territory]], straddling the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, was considered a good place to build settlements.\n\nThe [[Antioch Christian Church (Kansas City, Missouri)|Antioch Christian Church]], [[Dr. James Compton House]], and [[Woodneath]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>\n\n===Exploration and settlement===\n[[File:Westport Pioneers Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Kansas City Pioneer Square monument in Westport features [[Pony Express]] founder [[Alexander Majors]], Westport/Kansas City founder [[John Calvin McCoy]], and Mountain-man [[Jim Bridger]] who owned Chouteau's Store.]]\n\nThe first documented European visitor to the eventual site of Kansas City was [[\u00c9tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont]], who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River. Criticized for his response to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] attack on [[Fort D\u00e9troit]], he had deserted his post as fort commander and was avoiding French authorities. Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in a village about {{convert|90|mi|km}} east near [[Brunswick, Missouri]], where he illegally traded [[furs]].\n\nTo clear his name, he wrote ''Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony'' in 1713 followed in 1714 by ''The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River''. In the documents, he describes the junction of the \"Grande Riv[i\u00e8re] des Cansez\" and Missouri River, making him the first to adopt those names. French cartographer [[Guillaume Delisle]] used the descriptions to make the area's first reasonably accurate map.\n\nThe Spanish took over the region in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, but were not to play a major role other than taxing and licensing Missouri River ship traffic. The French continued their [[fur trade]] under Spanish license. The [[Chouteau]] family operated under Spanish license at [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], in the lower [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley]] as early as 1765 and in 1821 the Chouteaus reached Kansas City, where [[Fran\u00e7ois Chouteau]] established Chouteau's Landing.\n\nAfter the 1804 [[Louisiana Purchase]], [[Lewis and Clark]] visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, noting it was a good place to build a fort. In 1831, a group of [[Mormons]] from New York settled in what would become the city. They built the first school within Kansas City's current boundaries, but were forced out by [[mob violence]] in 1833, and their settlement remained vacant.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=Ernest L. |title=Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years |location=Provo |publisher=BYU Press |year=1976 |volume=Vol. 1 |page=7 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1833 [[John Calvin McCoy|John McCoy]], son of [[Baptist]] missionary [[Isaac McCoy]], established [[Westport, Kansas City|West Port]] along the [[Santa Fe Trail]], {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=off|adj=off|sp=us}} away from the river. In 1834 McCoy established [[Westport, Kansas City|Westport Landing]] on a bend in the Missouri to serve as a landing point for West Port. Soon after, the Kansas Town Company, a group of investors, began to settle the area, taking their name from an English spelling of \"Cansez.\" In 1850, the landing area was incorporated as the Town of Kansas.<ref>{{cite web | title=Why is Kansas City located in Missouri instead of Kansas? | url=http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | accessdate=January 2, 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716232838/http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | archivedate=July 16, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy that time, the Town of Kansas, Westport, and nearby [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], had become critical points in the United States' [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|westward expansion]]. Three major [[Historical roads and trails of the United States|trail]]s \u2013 the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[California Trail|California]], and [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] \u2013 all passed through Jackson County.\n\nOn February 22, 1853, the City of Kansas was created with a newly elected mayor. It had an area of {{convert|0.70|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 2,500. The boundary lines at that time extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street, and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes Road and Charlotte Street on the east.<ref>{{cite web | title=Early City Limits | url=http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 | accessdate =September 11, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175946/http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n\nDuring the Civil War, the city and its immediate surroundings were the focus of intense military activity. Although the [[First Battle of Independence]] in August 1862 resulted in a [[Confederate States Army]] victory, the Confederates were unable to leverage their win in any significant fashion, as Kansas City was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified to assault. The [[Second Battle of Independence]], which occurred on October 21\u201322, 1864, as part of [[Sterling Price]]'s [[Price's Raid|Missouri expedition of 1864]], also resulted in a Confederate triumph. Once again their victory proved hollow, as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal [[Battle of Westport]] the next day, effectively ending Confederate efforts to regain Missouri.\n\nGeneral [[Thomas Ewing, Jr.|Thomas Ewing]], in response to a successful raid on nearby [[Lawrence, Kansas]], led by [[William Quantrill]], issued [[General Order No. 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]], forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties \u2013 including Jackson \u2013 except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing.\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nAfter the Civil War, Kansas City grew rapidly, largely losing its Southern identity. The selection of the city over [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], for the [[Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad]] bridge over the Missouri River brought about significant growth. The population exploded after 1869, when the Hannibal Bridge, designed by [[Octave Chanute]], opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889, and the city limits to be extended south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2, 1897. In 1900, Kansas City was the 22nd largest city in the country, with a population of 163,752 residents.<ref name=\"U.S. Census Bureau\">{{cite web|title=Missouri \u2013 Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n[[File:Junction of Main and Delaware Streets, Kansas City, Mo (NYPL b12647398-68704).tiff|thumb|Junction of Main and Delaware Streets in 1898]]\nKansas City, guided by architect [[George Kessler]], became a forefront example of the [[City Beautiful]] movement, offering a network of boulevards and parks.<ref>{{cite web | title=Historic Sanborn Maps of Kansas City | url=http://digital.library.umsystem.edu/image/umcscsanic/title/kansas+city+missouri | publisher = [[University of Missouri]] Digital Library | accessdate =March 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe relocation of [[Kansas City Union Station|Union Station]] to its current location in 1914 and the opening of the [[Liberty Memorial]] in 1923 provided two of the city's most identifiable landmarks. [[Robert A. Long]], president of the Liberty Memorial Association, was a driving force in the funding for construction. Long was a longtime resident and wealthy businessman. He built the [[R.A. Long Building]] for the [[Long-Bell Lumber Company]], his home, [[Corinthian Hall]] (now the [[Kansas City Museum]]) and [[Longview Farm]].\n\nFurther spurring Kansas City's growth was the opening of the innovative [[Country Club Plaza]] development by [[Jesse Clyde Nichols|J.C. Nichols]] in 1925, as part of his [[Country Club District]] plan.\n\n====20th century streetcar system====\n[[Streetcars in Kansas City|The Kansas City streetcar system]] used to have hundreds of miles of streetcars running though the city and was one of the largest systems in the country.<ref> https://www.kcur.org/post/history-kansas-city-streetcar#stream/0</ref> In 1903 an underground  streetcar tunnel was built underneath the city (called the 8th Street Tunnel). The tunnel still exists today.  The last run of the streetcar was on June 23, 1957. <ref> https://www.kcur.org/post/8th-street-tunnel-gateway-kansas-citys-history-you-probably-cant-get#stream/0</ref>\n\n===Pendergast era===\nAt the start of the 20th century, [[political machines]] gained clout in the city, with the one led by [[Tom Pendergast]] dominating the city by 1925. Several important buildings and structures were built during this time, including the [[Kansas City City Hall]] and the Jackson County Courthouse. The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to tax evasion after long federal investigations. His biographers have summed up Pendergast's uniqueness:\n<blockquote>Pendergast may bear comparison to various big-city bosses, but his open alliance with hardened criminals, his cynical subversion of the democratic process, his monarchistic style of living, his increasingly insatiable gambling habit, his grasping for a business empire, and his promotion of Kansas City as a wide-open town with every kind of vice imaginable, combined with his professed compassion for the poor and very real role as city builder, made him bigger than life, difficult to characterize.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lawrence H. Larsen and Nancy J. Hulston|title=Pendergast!|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=n-Qiu53FCOsC|page=11}}|year=2013|publisher=University of Missouri Press|page=xi}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Post\u2013World War II===\nKansas City's suburban development began with a streetcar system in the early decades of the 20th century. The city's first suburbs were in the neighborhoods of Pendleton Heights and Quality Hill. After [[World War II]], many relatively affluent residents left for suburbs in [[Johnson County, Kansas]], and eastern Jackson County, Missouri. Many also went north of the [[Missouri River]], where Kansas City had incorporated areas between the 1940s and 1970s.\n\n====Troost dividing wall and white flight====\n\n[[Troost Avenue]], once the eastern edge of Kansas City, Mo., and home to millionaires, is now widely seen as one of the city's most prominent racial and economic dividing lines due to urban decay, which was caused by [[white flight]].<ref> https://info.umkc.edu/unews/troost-wall-the-product-of-kansas-citys-long-running-racial-plight/ </ref><ref> https://www.kcur.org/post/how-troost-became-major-divide-kansas-city</ref> During civil rights era  the city blocked people of color from moving to homes west of Troost Avenue causing the areas east of Troost to have one of the worst murder rates in the country.

At this time, slums were forming in the inner city, and many who could afford to do so left for the suburbs and outer edges of the city. The post-World War II idea of suburbs and the \"American Dream\" also contributed to the sprawl of the area. The city's population continued to grow, but the inner city declined.

[[Arthur Bryant's]] took over the Perry restaurant and added [[sugar]] to his sauce to sweeten the recipe a bit. In 1946 one of Perry's cooks, George W. Gates, opened Gates Bar-B-Q, later [[Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q]] when his son Ollie joined the family business. Bryant's and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants; native Kansas Citian and essayist Calvin Trillin famously called Bryant's \"the single best restaurant in the world\" in an essay he wrote for ''Playboy'' magazine in the 1960s. [[Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue]] is also well regarded. In 1977, [[Rich Davis]], a psychiatrist, test-marketed his own concoction called K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce. He renamed it [[KC Masterpiece]], and in 1986, he sold the recipe to the [[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford]] division of [[Clorox]]. Davis retained rights to operate restaurants using the name and sauce, whose recipe popularized the use of molasses as a sweetener in Kansas City-style barbecue sauces.

The city has a council/manager form of government. The role of [[city manager]] has diminished over the years. The non-elective office of city manager was created following excesses during the Pendergast days. The mayor is the head of the [[Kansas City, Missouri City Council|Kansas City City Council]], which has 12 members (one member for each district, plus one at large member per district). The mayor is the presiding member. Kansas City holds city elections in every fourth odd numbered year. The last citywide election was held in May 2015. The officials took office in August 2015 and will hold the position until 2019.\n\nPendergast was the most prominent leader during the machine politics days. The most nationally prominent Democrat associated with the machine was [[Harry S Truman]], who became a Senator, Vice President and then [[President of the United States]] from 1945 to 1953. Kansas City is the seat of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri]], one of two [[United States district courts|federal district courts]] in Missouri.  The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] is in St. Louis. It also is the seat of the Western District of the [[Missouri Court of Appeals]], one of three districts of that court (the Eastern District is in St. Louis and the Southern District is in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]]).\n\nThe Mayor, City Council, and City Manager are listed below:<ref>https://www.kceb.org/useruploads/2019_mayorCC/Election_Summary_Official_6-19.pdf\n\nhttps://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719152736/https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members |date=July 19, 2019 }}\n\n<br /></ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Shortly after the city's incorporation in 1850, so-called [[Bleeding Kansas]] erupted, affecting [[border ruffians]] and [[Jayhawkers]]. During the war, Union troops [[General Order \u2116 11 (1863)|burned all occupied dwellings]] in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas. After the war, the ''[[Kansas City Times]]'' turned outlaw [[Jesse James]] into a folk hero via its coverage. James was born in the Kansas City metro area at [[Kearney, Missouri]], and notoriously robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th Street and Campbell Avenue.\n\nIn the early 20th century under Pendergast, Kansas City became the country's \"most wide open town\". While this would give rise to [[Kansas City Jazz]], it also led to the rise of the [[Kansas City crime family|Kansas City mob]] (initially under [[Johnny Lazia]]), as well as the arrival of [[organized crime]]. In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gang war over control of the [[River Quay]] entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations gained after boss [[Nick Civella]] was recorded discussing gambling bets on [[Super Bowl IV]] (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings). The war and investigation led to the end of mob control of the [[Stardust Casino]], which was the basis for the film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'' (although the production minimizes the Kansas City connections).\n\nAs of November 2012, Kansas City [[United States cities by crime rate|ranked 18th]] on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI)'s annual survey of crime rates for cities with populations over 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |title=FBI: Violent crime drops in Kansas City for first half of 2012 \u2013 Kansas City Business Journal |website=Bizjournals.com |date=February 1, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730054734/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |archive-date=July 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Much of the city's violent crime occurs on the city's lower income East Side.

The ''Star'' sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an [[antitrust]] investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman's behest, following a long-standing feud with the ''Star'') over the newspaper's ownership of television and radio stations.

Between 1931 and 1982 Kansas City was home to the [[Calvin Company]], a large movie production company that specialized in promotional and sales short films and commercials for corporations, as well as educational films for schools and the government. Calvin was an important venue for Kansas City arts, training local filmmakers who went on to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood careers]] and also employing local actors, most of whom earned their main income in fields such as radio and television announcing. Kansas City native [[Robert Altman]] directed movies at the Calvin Company, which led him to shoot his first feature film, ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', in Kansas City using many local players.\n\nThe 1983 television movie ''[[The Day After]]'' was filmed in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas. The 1990s film ''[[Truman (1995 film)|Truman]]'', starring [[Gary Sinise]], was filmed in the city. Other films shot in or around Kansas City include ''[[Article 99]]'', ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Bridge|Mr. & Mrs. Bridge]]'', ''[[Kansas City (film)|Kansas City]]'', ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[Ninth Street]]'', and ''[[Sometimes They Come Back (film)|Sometimes They Come Back]]'' (in and around nearby [[Liberty, Missouri]]). More recently, a scene in the controversial film ''[[Br\u00fcno]]'' was filmed in downtown Kansas City's historic Hotel Phillips.\n\nToday, Kansas City is home to an active independent film community. The [[Independent Filmmaker's Coalition]] is an organization dedicated to expanding and improving independent filmmaking in Kansas City. The city launched the KC Film Office in October 2014 with the goal of better marketing the city for prospective television shows and movies to be filmed there. The City Council passed several film tax incentives in February 2016 to take effect in May 2016; the KC Film Office is coordinating its efforts with the State of Missouri to reinstate film incentives on a statewide level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|title=Tax breaks for films could bring cash to Kansas City|last=Monreal|first=Jane|date=April 2, 2016|website=KSHB|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417155354/http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|archive-date=April 17, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{Main|Kansas City Metropolitan Area#Transportation|Kansas City Metropolitan Area}}\n\nOriginally, Kansas City was the launching point for travelers on the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], and [[California Trail|California]] trails. Later, with the construction of the [[Hannibal Bridge]] across the [[Missouri River]], it became the junction of 11 trunk railroads. More rail tonnage passes through the city than through any other U.S. city.

From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City's streetcar system was among the top in the country, with over {{convert|300|mi|km}} of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down.\n\n====KCATA- RideKC====\nOn December 28, 1965, the [[Kansas City Area Transportation Authority]] (KCATA) was formed via a bi-state compact created by the Missouri and Kansas legislatures. The compact gave the KCATA responsibility for planning, construction, owning and operating passenger transportation systems and facilities within the seven-county area.\n\n=====RideKC Bus and MAX=====\n[[File:RideKC Bus.jpg|thumb|A newly branded RideKC Bus.]]\nIn July 2005, the KCATA launched Kansas City's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, the [[Metro Area Express]] (MAX).

A unique identity was created for MAX, including 13 modern diesel buses and easily identifiable \"stations\". MAX features (real-time [[global positioning system|GPS]] tracking of buses, available at every station), and stoplights automatically change in their favor if buses are behind schedule. In 2010, a second MAX line was added on Troost Avenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/max_and_bus_rapid_transit/ |title=Light Rail and MAX |publisher=KCATA |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115112506/http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/max_and_bus_rapid_transit/ |archive-date=January 15, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The city is planning another MAX line down Prospect Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/prospect_ave_study|title=Prospect Ave. MAX {{!}} Light Rail and MAX {{!}} KCATA|last=Authority|first=Kansas City Area Transportation|website=www.kcata.org|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602120949/http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/prospect_ave_study|archive-date=June 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Prospect MAX line launched in 2019 and Mayor [[Quinton Lucas]] announced the service would be fare-free indefinitely.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.masstransitmag.com/technology/fare-collection/news/21127532/mo-prospect-max-bus-service-will-be-farefree-indefinitely-for-riders|title=MO: Prospect MAX bus service will be fare-free indefinitely for riders|last=Rice|first=Glenn|date=February 28, 2020|website=Mass Transit Magazine|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n[[File:Streetcar 10main.jpg|thumb|upright|KC Streetcar departing the Library stop heading north to the River Market.|left]]\n\n=====RideKC Streetcar=====\nOn December 12, 2012, a ballot initiative to construct a $102 million, 2-mile (3200 m) modern streetcar line in downtown Kansas City was approved by local voters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/12/12/kansas-city-voters-approve-streetcar.html|title=Kansas City voters approve streetcar plan|newspaper=Kansas City Business Journal|accessdate=January 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730051350/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/12/12/kansas-city-voters-approve-streetcar.html|archive-date=July 30, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The streetcar route runs along Main Street from the [[River Market]] to [[Union Station (Kansas City, Missouri)|Union Station]]; it debuted on May 6, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article76034492.html|title=Crowds jam streetcars in Kansas City return|website=kansascity|access-date=May 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507115829/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article76034492.html|archive-date=May 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees \u2013 the [[Kansas City Streetcar Authority]] \u2013 operates and maintains the system.

Attitudes varied among Anglophone Yankees. During a speech in 1891 in Boston, Canadian Prime Minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]] urged a French-Canadian audience, \"One of the things that is absolutely essential is to study the English language, the language of [this] country...most of you, if you are now over a million on this side of the 45th line, you have not come for any other object than that of earning your daily bread. So, while not losing the memory of your origin, remember that you have duties to fulfill as citizens of the Republic and that you must love your adopted homeland.\"<ref name=\"Laurier\"/>{{efn|Original in French:[I]l y a une chose qui est tout a fait indispensable, c'est d'etudier la langue anglaise, la langue du pays...

Ainsi, tout en ne perdant pas le souvenir de votre origine, souvenez-vous que vous avez des devoirs a remplir comme citoyens de la Republique et que vous devez aimer votre patrie d'adoption.}}\n\nWhile a sense of civic solidarity with Americans was expressed by Laurier and other French-American and Canadian leaders, economic discrimination also disfavored New England French speakers.

In a 1983 study by the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|US Commission on Civil Rights]], a Vermont committee found that though the French language was spoken by a large part of its population, they often held disparately lower wealth and educational outcomes than monolingual English-speaking peers, with few resources given to bilingual education. The committee would attribute this in part to the [[Americanization (immigration)|Americanization]] Department of the [[United States Department of Education|US Bureau of Education]] program, begun in 1919, requiring all students to be taught in English alone, prompting laws in Rhode Island, Maine, and New Hampshire prohibiting immersive teaching, requiring only English in classes not specifically dedicated to foreign language.

Some colloquialisms found in New England French are similar to rural Quebec French with the use of words like ''char'' (roughly,  \"chariot\"), compared with the standard French word for car, ''voiture'' (\"vehicle\", \"automobile\"), and represent words regarded as archaic in standardized French or words used in other dialects but of similar, yet distinct, usages. When respondents were presented with more advanced Standard French prompts, however, they generally demonstrated comprehension and [[code switching]]. Some examples of responses provided in the study include:<ref name=\"vocabulary2\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! English !! Standard French !! Laurentian French !!

Many of these words are used as terms of endearment between grandparents referring to their grandchildren, or by their parents, and often picked up by the children themselves, in households of Franco-American families whose youngest generations primarily speak English.\n\nExamples include substitutions as simple as calling grandparents ''m\u00e9m\u00e8re'' (shortened ''m\u00e9m\u00e9'') or ''p\u00e9p\u00e8re'' (''p\u00e9p\u00e9''), while a 1969 study found other more opaque examples, a small sample of which includes:<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Romance Notes|volume=XI|issue=1|date=Autumn 1969|title=New England Franco-American Terms Used in Spoken English|pages=219\u2013225|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|last=Cagnon|first=Maurice}}</ref>\n\n* ''baboune'' (noun), to press one's lips together and outwards in a pouty expression or \"[[duck face]]\". For example- \"Don't make a ''baboune'' like that, your face will stay that way.\"\n* ''p\u00e9p\u00e9te'' (noun), bird, as in \"Do you see the little ''p\u00e9p\u00e9tes''?\"\n* ''quenoeil'' (noun), eye, as in \"Make pretty ''quenoeils'' for ''m\u00e9m\u00e8re''.\"\n* ''s\u00e9ssi'' (verb), sit down, particularly in the context of an exclamation as in \"''S\u00e9ssi!''

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T.

Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

This was also the best performance of any party in the era of proportional elections to the European Parliament in [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|Scotland]].

Although the party suffered a [[North East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|loss]] to the Liberal Democrats, it gained the [[East Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|seat]] of its then UK leader [[Jo Swinson]], along with 7 from the Conservatives and 6 from Labour.

All of the Branches within each Scottish Parliament constituency form a Constituency Association, which coordinates the work of the Branches within the constituency, coordinates the activities of the party in the constituency, and acts as a point of liaison between an MSP or MP and the party. Constituency Associations are composed of delegates from all of the Branches within the constituency.\n\nThe annual National Conference is the supreme governing body of the SNP, and is responsible for determining party policy and electing the National Executive Committee. The National Conference is composed of:\n* delegates from every Branch and Constituency Association\n* the members of the National Executive Committee\n* 15 members elected by the National Conference\n* every SNP MSP and MP (and previously MEPs)\n* a number of SNP local councillors, and\n* delegates from one of the SNP's Affiliated Organisations ([[Young Scots for Independence]], [[SNP Students]], [[SNP Trade Union Group]] and the Association of Nationalist Councillors)\n\nThe National Council serves as the SNP's governing body between National Conferences, and its decisions are binding, unless rescinded or modified by the National Conference. There are also regular meetings of the National Assembly, which provides a forum for detailed discussion of party policy by party members.\n\nThe party has an active youth wing, the [[Young Scots for Independence]], as well as a student wing, the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]]. There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference). The SNP parliamentarians (Holyrood and Westminster) and councillors have representation on the NEC, as do the Trade Union Group, the youth wing and the student wing.\n\n===National Executive Committee===\nThe National Executive Committee is composed of:\n* President: [[Ian Hudghton]]\n* Leader: [[Nicola Sturgeon]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|<small>MSP</small>]] <small>([[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]])</small>\n* Depute Leader: [[Keith Brown (Scottish politician)|Keith Brown]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|<small>MSP</small>]] <small>([[Clackmannanshire and Dunblane (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Clackmannanshire and Dunblane]])</small>\n* National Treasurer: [[Colin Beattie]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|<small>MSP</small>]] <small>([[Midlothian North and Musselburgh (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Midlothian North and Musselburgh]])</small>\n* National Secretary: <small>Dr</small> Angus MacLeod\n* Business Convener: [[Kirsten Oswald]] [[Member of parliament|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[East Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Renfrewshire]])</small>\n* Organisation Convener: Stacy Bradley\n* Member Support Convener: John Clark \n* Policy Development Convener: [[Alyn Smith]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[Stirling (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirling]])</small>\n* Local Government Convener: <small>Cllr</small> Ellen Forson <small>([[Clackmannanshire South]])</small>\n* Women's Convener: <small>Cllr</small> Rhiannon Spear <small>([[Greater Pollok (ward)|Greater Pollok]])</small>\n* Equalities Convener: Fiona Robertson\n* Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Convener: <small>Cllr</small> Graham Campbell <small>([[Springburn/Robroyston (ward)|Springburn/Robroyston]])</small>\n* Disabled Members' Convener: Morag Fulton\n* [[Tommy Sheppard]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[Edinburgh East (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh East]])</small>\n* [[Alison Thewliss]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]])</small>\n* Sixteen regional representatives\n* Representatives from the Association of Nationalist Councillors and affiliated organisations\n\n===Membership===\nSince 18 September 2014 (the day of the Scottish independence referendum), party membership has more than quadrupled (from 25,642), surpassing the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and, briefly, [[Conservatives (UK)|Conservatives]] to become the second-largest political party in the United Kingdom in terms of membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160//|title=New figures show our party is now powered by 125,482 members - making @theSNP the second biggest party in the UK.|access-date=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524143611/https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160|archive-date=24 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As of August 2018, the Party has 125,482 members.\n\n===European affiliation===\nThe SNP retains close links with [[Plaid Cymru]], its counterpart in [[Wales]].

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right.

In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach.

It is also a philosophy that emphasises the election of an SNP government should bring about trust in the Scottish people in the ability of [[Scotland]] to govern herself, thus bringing increased support for independence.\n\nGradualism stands in opposition to the so-called fundamentalist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely in order to achieve it. The argument goes that if the SNP is unprepared to argue for its central policy then it is unlikely ever to persuade the public of its worthiness.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/06/uk.politicalnews1|title=SNP's radical wing threatens to split party|last=Seenan|first=By Gerard|date=1999-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-02|last2=MacAskill|first2=Ewen|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Notable fundamentalists ===\n* [[Kenny MacAskill]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Margo MacDonald]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Notable gradualists ===\n* [[Alex Salmond]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[John Swinney]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/conferences/snp/865888.stm|title=Tussle for the top |website= BBC News |date=21 September 2000 |access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics|United Kingdom|Scotland}}\n* [[Culture of Scotland]]\n* [[Politics of Scotland]]\n* [[History of Scottish devolution]]\n* [[It's Scotland's oil]]\n* [[Radio Free Scotland]]\n* [[Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\n* [[The National (Scotland)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brand, Jack, ''The National Movement in Scotland'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978\n* Brand, Jack, \u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), ''Contemporary Minority Nationalism'', Routledge, 1990\n* [[Winnie Ewing]], [[Michael Russell (politician)|Michael Russell]], ''Stop the World; The Autobiography of Winnie Ewing'' [[Birlinn (publisher)|Birlinn]], 2004\n* [[Richard J.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n[[File:John MacCormick.jpg|left|thumb|201x201px|[[John MacCormick]] split from the party in opposition to outright [[Scottish independence|independence]].]]\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

This policy was followed in 1963 by a motion opposed to [[nuclear weapon]]s: a policy that has remained in place ever since.<ref name=\"Mitchell19961994\">{{cite book|author=James Mitchell|title=Strategies for Self-government: The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament|year=1996|publisher=Polygon|page=194}}</ref> The 1964 policy document, ''SNP & You'', contained a clear centre-left policy platform, including commitments to [[full employment]], government intervention in fuel, power and transport, a state bank to guide economic development, encouragement of [[cooperative]]s and [[credit union]]s, extensive building of [[council house]]s (social housing) by central and local government, pensions adjusted to cost of living, a [[minimum wage]] and an improved [[NHS Scotland|national health service]].<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nThe 1960s also saw the beginnings of the SNP's efforts to establish an industrial organisation and mobilise amongst trade unionists in Scotland, with the establishment of the SNP Trade Union Group, and identifying the SNP with industrial campaigns, such as the [[Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]] and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish ''[[Daily Express]]'' to run as a co-operative.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> For the party manifestos for the two 1974 general elections, the SNP finally self-identified as a social democratic party, and proposed a range of social democratic policies.<ref name=\"Brand199027\">{{cite book|title=\u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=27|author=Jack Brand}}</ref><ref name=\"Hassan2009121\">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=121}}</ref> There was also an unsuccessful proposal at the 1975 party conference to rename the party as the ''Scottish National Party (Social Democrats)''.<ref name=\"Hepburn2013143\">{{cite book|author=Eve Hepburn|title=New Challenges for Stateless Nationalist and Regionalist Parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96596-1|page=143|access-date=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503092815/https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In the UK wide referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the same year as the aforementioned attempted name change, the SNP campaigned for Britain to leave the EEC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Devenney|first=Andrew D.|date=2008|title=Regional Resistance to European Integration: The Case of the Scottish National Party, 1961-1972|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20762312|journal=Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung|volume=33|issue=3 (125)|pages=319\u2013345|issn=0172-6404}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37107148|title=The dilemma facing Scotland's Eurosceptic nationalists|last=Ley|first=Shaun|date=2016-08-18|access-date=2020-01-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThere were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979, with the [[79 Group]] attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a \"social-democratic\" party, to an expressly \"[[socialism|socialist]]\" party. Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n===Current ideology===\nThe SNP's policy base is mostly in the mainstream Western European [[social democracy|social democratic]] tradition.

It is also a philosophy that emphasises the election of an SNP government should bring about trust in the Scottish people in the ability of [[Scotland]] to govern herself, thus bringing increased support for independence.\n\nGradualism stands in opposition to the so-called fundamentalist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely in order to achieve it. The argument goes that if the SNP is unprepared to argue for its central policy then it is unlikely ever to persuade the public of its worthiness.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/may/06/uk.politicalnews1|title=SNP's radical wing threatens to split party|last=Seenan|first=By Gerard|date=1999-05-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-02|last2=MacAskill|first2=Ewen|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Notable fundamentalists ===\n* [[Kenny MacAskill]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Margo MacDonald]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Notable gradualists ===\n* [[Alex Salmond]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[John Swinney]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/conferences/snp/865888.stm|title=Tussle for the top |website= BBC News |date=21 September 2000 |access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics|United Kingdom|Scotland}}\n* [[Culture of Scotland]]\n* [[Politics of Scotland]]\n* [[History of Scottish devolution]]\n* [[It's Scotland's oil]]\n* [[Radio Free Scotland]]\n* [[Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\n* [[The National (Scotland)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Brand, Jack, ''The National Movement in Scotland'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978\n* Brand, Jack, \u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), ''Contemporary Minority Nationalism'', Routledge, 1990\n* [[Winnie Ewing]], [[Michael Russell (politician)|Michael Russell]], ''Stop the World; The Autobiography of Winnie Ewing'' [[Birlinn (publisher)|Birlinn]], 2004\n* [[Richard J.

{"title_page": "Deregulation", "text_new": "'''Deregulation''' is the process of removing or reducing state regulations, typically in the economic sphere.  It is the repeal of governmental [[Economic regulation|regulation of the economy]].  It became common in advanced industrial economies in the 1970s and 1980s, as a result of new trends in economic thinking about the inefficiencies of [[government regulation]], and the risk that regulatory agencies would be controlled by the regulated industry to its benefit, and thereby hurt consumers and the wider economy.\n\nEconomic regulations were promoted during the [[Gilded Age]], in which [[progressive era|progressive]] reforms were touted as necessary to limit [[externalities]] like corporate abuse, unsafe [[child labor]], [[monopolization]], [[pollution]], and to mitigate boom and bust cycles. Around the late 1970s, such reforms were deemed as burdensome on economic growth and many politicians espousing [[neoliberalism]] started promoting deregulation.\n\n[[File:France Telecom Wellington NZ.jpg|thumb|150px|As a result of deregulation, [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] operates phone booths in Wellington, New Zealand.]]\nThe stated rationale for deregulation is often that fewer and simpler regulations will lead to raised levels of competitiveness, therefore higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]], more efficiency and lower prices overall. Opposition to deregulation may usually involve apprehension regarding [[pollution|environmental pollution]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0921-8009(94)90017-5|title=An ecological-economic assessment of deregulation of international commerce under GATT|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=9|pages=73\u201392|year=1994|last1=Daly|first1=Herman|last2=Goodland|first2=Robert}}</ref> and environmental quality standards (such as the removal of regulations on hazardous materials), financial uncertainty, and [[Competition law|constraining monopolies]].\n\n[[Regulatory reform]] is a parallel development alongside deregulation. Regulatory reform refers to organized and ongoing programs to review regulations with a view to minimizing, simplifying, and making them more cost effective.  Such efforts, given impetus by the ''[[Regulatory Flexibility Act]]'' of 1980, are embodied in the United States Office of Management and Budget's [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]], and the United Kingdom's [[Better Regulation Commission]]. [[Cost\u2013benefit analysis]] is frequently used in such reviews. In addition, there have been regulatory innovations, usually suggested by economists, such as [[emissions trading]].\n\nDeregulation can be distinguished from [[privatization]], where privatization can be seen as taking state-owned service providers into the private sector.\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n[[Argentina]] underwent heavy economic deregulation, [[privatization]], and had a [[fixed exchange rate]] during the [[Carlos Menem|Menem]] administration (1989\u20131999).  In December 2001, [[Paul Krugman]] compared [[Enron]] with Argentina, claiming that both were experiencing economic collapse due to excessive deregulation.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Krugman | first = Paul | authorlink = Paul Krugman\n | title = Laissez Not Fair | journal = The New York Times\n | date = December 11, 2001\n | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/opinion/laissez-not-fair.html\n | accessdate = June 10, 2011}}</ref> Two months later, Herbert Inhaber claimed that Krugman [[Correlation does not imply causation|confused correlation with causation]], and neither collapse was due to excessive deregulation.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Inhaber | first = Herbert\n | title = Deregulation and Its Discontents | journal = Ideas in Action\n | date =  February 12, 2002\n | url = http://www.ideasinactiontv.com/tcs_daily/2002/02/deregulation-and-its-discontents.html\n | accessdate = June 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Australia ===\nHaving announced a wide range of deregulatory policies, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] announced the policy of \"Minimum Effective Regulation\" in 1986. This introduced now familiar requirements for \"regulatory impact statements\", but compliance by governmental agencies took many years. The labour market under the Hawke/Keating Labor governments operated under [[Prices and Incomes Accord|an accord]]. [[John Howard]]'s [[Liberal Party of Australia]]  in 1996 [[Workplace Relations Act 1996|began deregulation]] of the labor market, subsequently taken much further in 2005  through their [[WorkChoices]] policy. However, it was reversed under the following [[Rudd Government (2007\u201310)|Rudd Labor government]].\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{See also|Ontario electricity policy}}\n\nNatural gas is deregulated in most of the country, with the exception of some Atlantic provinces and some pockets like Vancouver Island and Medicine Hat.

The other provinces are small markets and have not attracted suppliers.   Customers have the choice of purchasing from a local distribution company (LDC) or a deregulated supplier.   In most provinces the LDC is not allowed to offer a term contract, just a variable price based on the spot market.   LDC prices are changed either monthly or quarterly.\n\nThe province of [[Ontario]] began deregulation of electricity supply in 2002, but pulled back temporarily due to voter and consumer backlash at the resulting price volatility.<ref name=\"PIAC\"/> The government is still searching for a stable working regulatory framework.\n\nThe current status is a partially regulated structure in which consumers have received a capped price for a portion of the publicly owned generation. The remainder of the price has been market price based and there are numerous competitive energy contract providers.  However, Ontario is installing Smart Meters in all homes and small businesses and is changing the pricing structure to Time of Use pricing.   All small volume consumers are to be shifted to the new rate structure by the end of 2012.   There is [[comparison shopping website|price comparison service]] operating in these jurisdictions.\n\nThe province of [[Alberta]] has deregulated their electricity provision. Customers are free to choose which company they sign up with, but there are few companies to choose from and the price of electricity has increased substantially for consumers because the market is too small to support competition.   If they choose they may remain with the utility at the Regulated Rate Option.\n\nFormer Premier Ralph Klein based the entire deregulation scheme on the Enron model, and continued with it even after the highly publicized and disastrous [[Enron#California's deregulation and subsequent energy crisis|California electricity crisis]] (and the collapse of [[Enron scandal|Enron]] because of illegal accounting practices.)\n\n=== European Union ===\n* 2003 Corrections to EU directive about [[software patent]]s\n* Deregulation of the [[aircraft|air industry]] in Europe in 1992 gave carriers from one EU country the right to operate scheduled services between other EU states.\n\n==== Ireland ====\nThe taxi industry was deregulated in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] leading to an influx of new taxis. This was due to the price of a licence dropping overnight. The number of taxis increased dramatically.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2011/0516/primetimeinvestigates.html |work=RT\u00c9 News |title=Prime Time Investigates |date=2011-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628182209/http://www.rte.ie/news/av/2011/0516/primetimeinvestigates.html |archivedate=2012-06-28 }}</ref>\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] started a programme of deregulation and [[privatisation]] after their victory at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]. These included [[Coach transport in the United Kingdom|express coach]] ([[Transport Act 1980]]), [[BT Group|British Telecom]] (completed in 1984), [[privatisation of London bus services]] (1984), [[bus deregulation in Great Britain|local bus services]] ([[Transport Act 1985]]) and [[privatisation of British Rail|the railways]] (1993). The feature of all those privatisations was that their shares were offered to the general public.\n\nFrom 1997\u20132010, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] developed a programme of what they called \"[[Better Regulation Commission|better regulation]]\". This included a general programme for government departments to review, simplify or abolish their existing regulations, and a \"one in, one out\" approach to new regulations. In 1997, Chancellor Brown announced the \"freeing\" of the Bank of England to set monetary policy. They freed the Bank of England from direct government control and removed the power by the Bank of England{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} (and therefore by the government) from controlling the financial activities of banks in the UK{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}. In 2006, new primary legislation (the [[Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006]]) was introduced to establish statutory principles and a code of practice and it permits ministers to make [[Regulatory Reform Order]]s (RROs) to deal with older laws which they deem to be out of date, obscure or irrelevant. This act has often been criticised and called \"The abolition of Parliament Act\".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n[[New Labour]] did not privatise many publicly owned services because most had already been privatised by the previous Conservative government. However, some government-owned businesses such as [[Qinetiq]] were privatised. But a great deal of infrastructure and maintenance work previously carried out by government departments was contracted out (out-sourced) to private enterprise under the [[public\u2013private partnership]], with competitive bidding for contracts within a regulatory framework. This included large projects such as building new hospitals for the [[National Health Service|NHS]], building new state schools, and maintaining the [[London Underground]]. These privatisations were never offered to the general public to buy shares, instead being offered to commercial companies only.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n[[File:Postal deregulation New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|Since the deregulation of the postal sector, different postal operators can install mail collection boxes in New Zealand's streets.]]\n{{See also|Economy of New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand Governments adopted policies of extensive deregulation from 1984 to 1995.

The policies had the goal of liberalising the economy and were notable for their very comprehensive coverage and innovations. Specific policies included: floating the exchange rate; establishing an independent reserve bank; performance contracts for senior civil servants; public sector finance reform based on accrual accounting; tax neutrality; subsidy-free agriculture; and industry-neutral competition regulation.  Economic growth was resumed in 1991. New Zealand was changed from a somewhat closed and centrally controlled economy to one of the most open economies in the OECD.<ref>{{cite journal\n|url= https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jeclit/v34y1996i4p1856-1902.html\n|title=Economic Reform in New Zealand 1984\u201395: The Pursuit of Efficiency\n|first=Lewis\n|last=Evans\n|first2= Arthur\n|last2= Grimes\n|first3= Bryce\n|last3= Wilkinson\n|journal= Journal of Economic Literature\n|volume= 34 | issue = 4\n|pages= 1856\u2013902\n|date=December 1996\n|accessdate=4 October 2012}}</ref> As a result, New Zealand, went from having a reputation as an almost socialist country to being considered one of the most business-friendly countries of the world, next to Singapore. However, critics charge that the deregulation has brought little benefit to some sections of society, and has caused much of New Zealand's economy (including almost all of the banks) to become foreign-owned.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n=== Russia ===\nRussia went through wide-ranging deregulation (and concomitant privatization) efforts in the late 1990s under [[Boris Yeltsin]], now partially reversed under [[Vladimir Putin]]. The main thrust of deregulation has been the electricity sector (see [[RAO UES]]), with railroads and communal utilities tied in second place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Deregulation of the natural gas sector ([[Gazprom]]) is one of the more frequent demands placed upon Russia by the United States and European Union.\n\n=== United States ===\n\n==== History of regulation ====\n\nOne problem that encouraged deregulation was the way in which the regulated industries often controlled the government [[regulation|regulatory agencies]], using them to serve the industries' interests. Even where regulatory bodies started out functioning independently, a process known as [[regulatory capture]] often saw industry interests come to dominate those of the consumer. A similar pattern has been observed with the deregulation process itself, often effectively controlled by the regulated industries through lobbying the legislative process. Such political forces, however, exist in many other forms for other [[Lobby group|special interest groups]]. Some of the examples of deregulation in the United States in the setting of industries are banking, telecommunications, airlines, and natural resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploitation, conservation, preservation : a geographic perspective on natural resource use|last=Cutter|first= Susan L.|authorlink= Susan Cutter |date=2004|publisher=J.

Some of their most prominent reforms are [[trust-busting]] (the destruction and banning of monopolies), the creation of laws protecting the American consumer, the creation of a federal income tax (by the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]]; the income tax used a [[progressive tax|progressive tax structure]] with especially high taxes on the wealthy), the establishment of the [[Federal Reserve]], and the institution of shorter [[working hours]], [[higher wages]], better living conditions, better rights and privileges to trade unions, protection of rights of [[Strike action|strikers]], banning of unfair labor practices, and the delivery of more [[social welfare|social services]] to the working classes and [[social safety net]]s to many unemployed workers, thus helping to facilitate the creation of a [[welfare state]] in the United States and eventually in most [[developed countries]].\n\nDuring the Presidencies of [[Warren Harding]] (1921\u201323) and [[Calvin Coolidge]] (1923\u201329), the federal government generally pursued [[laissez-faire]] economic policies. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] implemented many economic regulations, including the ''[[National Industrial Recovery Act]]'' (which was struck down by the Supreme Court), regulation of trucking, airlines and the communications industry, the institution of the ''[[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]'', and the ''[[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]]'', which was passed in 1933. These 1930s regulations stayed largely in place until [[Richard Nixon]]'s Administration.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-16514254.html{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>  In supporting his competition-limiting regulatory initiatives President Roosevelt blamed the excesses of big business for causing an [[economic bubble]].  However, historians lack consensus in describing the causal relationship between various events and the role of government economic policy in causing or ameliorating the Depression.\n\n==== Deregulation 1970\u20132000 ====\nDeregulation gained momentum in the 1970s, influenced by research by the [[Chicago school of economics]] and the theories of [[George Stigler]], [[Alfred Kahn]]<ref name=\"kahn_obit_2010_12_29_nytimes_com\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/business/29kahn.html\n|title=Alfred E.

(92d Congress, Senate Bill 2842)  The developers of this legislation in this Administration sought to cultivate support from commercial buyers of transportation services, consumer organizations, economists, and environmental organization leaders.{{sfn|Rose|Seely|Barrett|2006|pp=154\u201356}} This 'civil society' coalition became a template for coalitions influential in efforts to deregulate trucking and air transport later in the decade.\n\n===== Ford administration =====\nAfter Nixon left office, the [[Gerald Ford]] presidency, with the allied interests, secured passage of the first significant change in regulatory policy in a pro-competitive direction, in the [[Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976]].\n\n===== Carter administration =====\nPresident [[Jimmy Carter]] -- aided by economic adviser [[Alfred E.

The dominant common theme of these Acts was to lessen [[barriers to entry]] in transport markets and promote more independent, competitive pricing among transport service providers, substituting the freed-up competitive market forces for detailed regulatory control of entry, exit, and price making in transport markets. Thus deregulation arose, though regulations to promote competition were put in place.{{citation needed}}\n\n===== Reagan administration =====\n\nU.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] campaigned on the promise of rolling back environmental regulations. His devotion to the economic\nbeliefs of [[Milton Friedman]] led him to promote the deregulation of finance, agriculture, and transportation.{{sfn|Kleinknecht|2009|p=}} A series of substantial enactments were needed to work out the process of encouraging competition in transportation. Interstate buses were addressed in 1982, in the ''[[Bus Regulatory Reform Act]]'' of 1982. Freight forwarders (freight aggregators) got more freedoms in the ''[[Surface Freight Forwarder Deregulation Act of 1986]]''. As many states continued to regulate the operations of motor carriers within their own state, the intrastate aspect of the trucking and bus industries was addressed in the ''[[Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994]]'', which provided that \"a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of two or more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier.\" {{usc|49|14501}}(c)(1) (Supp. V 1999).\n\nOcean transportation was the last to be addressed. This was done in two acts, the ''[[Ocean Shipping Act of 1984]]'' and the ''[[Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998]]''. These acts were less thoroughgoing than the legislation dealing with U.S. domestic transportation, in that they left in place the \"conference\" system in international ocean liner shipping, which historically embodied cartel mechanisms. However, these acts permitted independent rate-making by conference participants, and the 1998 Act permitted secret contract rates, which tend to undercut collective carrier pricing. According to the [[United States Federal Maritime Commission]], in an assessment in 2001, this appears to have opened up substantial competitive activity in ocean shipping, with beneficial economic results.\n\n==== Energy ====\nThe ''[[Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act]]'' was a regulating law, consisting of a mix of regulations and deregulation, which passed in response to [[OPEC]] price hikes and domestic price controls which affected the [[1973 oil crisis]] in the United States.  After adoption of this federal legislation, numerous state legislation known as [[Natural Gas Choice]] programs have sprung up in several states, as well as the District of Columbia. Natural Gas Choice programs allow residential and small volume natural gas users to compare purchases from natural gas suppliers with traditional utility companies.  There are currently hundreds of federally unregulated natural gas suppliers operating in the US.

The rapid development of computer and communications technology&nbsp;\u2013 particularly the Internet&nbsp;\u2013 have increased the size and variety of communications offerings. Wireless, traditional landline telephone, and cable companies increasingly invade each other's traditional markets and compete across a broad spectrum of activities. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] and Congress appear to be attempting to facilitate this evolution. In mainstream economic thinking, development of this competition would militate against detailed regulatory control of prices and service offerings, and hence favor deregulation of prices and entry into markets.<ref>{{citation\n|last=Crandall\n|first=Robert W.\n|title=Competition and Chaos \u2013 U.S. Telecommunications Since the 1996 Telecom Act\n|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]\n|isbn=978-0-8157-1617-4\n|date=1 December 2004\n}}</ref> On the other hand, there exists substantial concern about concentration of media ownership resulting from relaxation of historic controls on media ownership designed to safeguard diversity of viewpoint and open discussion in the society, and about what some perceive as high prices in cable company offerings at this point.\n\n==== Finance ====\nThe [[financial sector]] in the U.S. has seen considerable deregulation in recent decades, which has allowed for greater [[financial risk|risk]] taking.

However, Ontario is installing Smart Meters in all homes and small businesses and is changing the pricing structure to Time of Use pricing.   All small volume consumers are to be shifted to the new rate structure by the end of 2012.   There is [[comparison shopping website|price comparison service]] operating in these jurisdictions.\n\nThe province of [[Alberta]] has deregulated their electricity provision. Customers are free to choose which company they sign up with, but there are few companies to choose from and the price of electricity has increased substantially for consumers because the market is too small to support competition.   If they choose they may remain with the utility at the Regulated Rate Option.\n\nFormer Premier Ralph Klein based the entire deregulation scheme on the Enron model, and continued with it even after the highly publicized and disastrous [[Enron#California's deregulation and subsequent energy crisis|California electricity crisis]] (and the collapse of [[Enron scandal|Enron]] because of illegal accounting practices.)\n\n=== European Union ===\n* 2003 Corrections to EU directive about [[software patent]]s\n* Deregulation of the [[aircraft|air industry]] in Europe in 1992 gave carriers from one EU country the right to operate scheduled services between other EU states.\n\n==== Ireland ====\nThe taxi industry was deregulated in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] leading to an influx of new taxis. This was due to the price of a licence dropping overnight.

These included [[Coach transport in the United Kingdom|express coach]] ([[Transport Act 1980]]), [[BT Group|British Telecom]] (completed in 1984), [[privatisation of London bus services]] (1984), [[bus deregulation in Great Britain|local bus services]] ([[Transport Act 1985]]) and [[privatisation of British Rail|the railways]] (1993). The feature of all those privatisations was that their shares were offered to the general public.\n\nFrom 1997\u20132010, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] developed a programme of what they called \"[[Better Regulation Commission|better regulation]]\". This included a general programme for government departments to review, simplify or abolish their existing regulations, and a \"one in, one out\" approach to new regulations. In 1997, Chancellor Brown announced the \"freeing\" of the Bank of England to set monetary policy. They freed the Bank of England from direct government control and removed the power by the Bank of England{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} (and therefore by the government) from controlling the financial activities of banks in the UK{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}. In 2006, new primary legislation (the [[Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006]]) was introduced to establish statutory principles and a code of practice and it permits ministers to make [[Regulatory Reform Order]]s (RROs) to deal with older laws which they deem to be out of date, obscure or irrelevant. This act has often been criticised and called \"The abolition of Parliament Act\".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n[[New Labour]] did not privatise many publicly owned services because most had already been privatised by the previous Conservative government. However, some government-owned businesses such as [[Qinetiq]] were privatised. But a great deal of infrastructure and maintenance work previously carried out by government departments was contracted out (out-sourced) to private enterprise under the [[public\u2013private partnership]], with competitive bidding for contracts within a regulatory framework. This included large projects such as building new hospitals for the [[National Health Service|NHS]], building new state schools, and maintaining the [[London Underground]]. These privatisations were never offered to the general public to buy shares, instead being offered to commercial companies only.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n[[File:Postal deregulation New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|Since the deregulation of the postal sector, different postal operators can install mail collection boxes in New Zealand's streets.]]\n{{See also|Economy of New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand Governments adopted policies of extensive deregulation from 1984 to 1995.

The policies had the goal of liberalising the economy and were notable for their very comprehensive coverage and innovations. Specific policies included: floating the exchange rate; establishing an independent reserve bank; performance contracts for senior civil servants; public sector finance reform based on accrual accounting; tax neutrality; subsidy-free agriculture; and industry-neutral competition regulation.  Economic growth was resumed in 1991. New Zealand was changed from a somewhat closed and centrally controlled economy to one of the most open economies in the OECD.<ref>{{cite journal\n|url= https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jeclit/v34y1996i4p1856-1902.html\n|title=Economic Reform in New Zealand 1984\u201395: The Pursuit of Efficiency\n|first=Lewis\n|last=Evans\n|first2= Arthur\n|last2= Grimes\n|first3= Bryce\n|last3= Wilkinson\n|journal= Journal of Economic Literature\n|volume= 34 | issue = 4\n|pages= 1856\u2013902\n|date=December 1996\n|accessdate=4 October 2012}}</ref> As a result, New Zealand, went from having a reputation as an almost socialist country to being considered one of the most business-friendly countries of the world, next to Singapore.

The main thrust of deregulation has been the electricity sector (see [[RAO UES]]), with railroads and communal utilities tied in second place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Deregulation of the natural gas sector ([[Gazprom]]) is one of the more frequent demands placed upon Russia by the United States and European Union.\n\n=== United States ===\n\n==== History of regulation ====\n\nOne problem that encouraged deregulation was the way in which the regulated industries often controlled the government [[regulation|regulatory agencies]], using them to serve the industries' interests. Even where regulatory bodies started out functioning independently, a process known as [[regulatory capture]] often saw industry interests come to dominate those of the consumer. A similar pattern has been observed with the deregulation process itself, often effectively controlled by the regulated industries through lobbying the legislative process. Such political forces, however, exist in many other forms for other [[Lobby group|special interest groups]]. Some of the examples of deregulation in the United States in the setting of industries are banking, telecommunications, airlines, and natural resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exploitation, conservation, preservation : a geographic perspective on natural resource use|last=Cutter|first= Susan L.|authorlink= Susan Cutter |date=2004|publisher=J.

Some of their most prominent reforms are [[trust-busting]] (the destruction and banning of monopolies), the creation of laws protecting the American consumer, the creation of a federal income tax (by the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]]; the income tax used a [[progressive tax|progressive tax structure]] with especially high taxes on the wealthy), the establishment of the [[Federal Reserve]], and the institution of shorter [[working hours]], [[higher wages]], better living conditions, better rights and privileges to trade unions, protection of rights of [[Strike action|strikers]], banning of unfair labor practices, and the delivery of more [[social welfare|social services]] to the working classes and [[social safety net]]s to many unemployed workers, thus helping to facilitate the creation of a [[welfare state]] in the United States and eventually in most [[developed countries]].\n\nDuring the Presidencies of [[Warren Harding]] (1921\u201323) and [[Calvin Coolidge]] (1923\u201329), the federal government generally pursued [[laissez-faire]] economic policies. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] implemented many economic regulations, including the ''[[National Industrial Recovery Act]]'' (which was struck down by the Supreme Court), regulation of trucking, airlines and the communications industry, the institution of the ''[[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]'', and the ''[[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]]'', which was passed in 1933. These 1930s regulations stayed largely in place until [[Richard Nixon]]'s Administration.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-16514254.html{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>  In supporting his competition-limiting regulatory initiatives President Roosevelt blamed the excesses of big business for causing an [[economic bubble]].  However, historians lack consensus in describing the causal relationship between various events and the role of government economic policy in causing or ameliorating the Depression.\n\n==== Deregulation 1970\u20132000 ====\nDeregulation gained momentum in the 1970s, influenced by research by the [[Chicago school of economics]] and the theories of [[George Stigler]], [[Alfred Kahn]]<ref name=\"kahn_obit_2010_12_29_nytimes_com\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/business/29kahn.html\n|title=Alfred E.

The dominant common theme of these Acts was to lessen [[barriers to entry]] in transport markets and promote more independent, competitive pricing among transport service providers, substituting the freed-up competitive market forces for detailed regulatory control of entry, exit, and price making in transport markets. Thus deregulation arose, though regulations to promote competition were put in place.{{citation needed}}\n\n===== Reagan administration =====\n\nU.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] campaigned on the promise of rolling back environmental regulations. His devotion to the economic\nbeliefs of [[Milton Friedman]] led him to promote the deregulation of finance, agriculture, and transportation.{{sfn|Kleinknecht|2009|p=}} A series of substantial enactments were needed to work out the process of encouraging competition in transportation. Interstate buses were addressed in 1982, in the ''[[Bus Regulatory Reform Act]]'' of 1982. Freight forwarders (freight aggregators) got more freedoms in the ''[[Surface Freight Forwarder Deregulation Act of 1986]]''. As many states continued to regulate the operations of motor carriers within their own state, the intrastate aspect of the trucking and bus industries was addressed in the ''[[Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994]]'', which provided that \"a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of two or more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier.\" {{usc|49|14501}}(c)(1) (Supp. V 1999).\n\nOcean transportation was the last to be addressed. This was done in two acts, the ''[[Ocean Shipping Act of 1984]]'' and the ''[[Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998]]''. These acts were less thoroughgoing than the legislation dealing with U.S. domestic transportation, in that they left in place the \"conference\" system in international ocean liner shipping, which historically embodied cartel mechanisms. However, these acts permitted independent rate-making by conference participants, and the 1998 Act permitted secret contract rates, which tend to undercut collective carrier pricing. According to the [[United States Federal Maritime Commission]], in an assessment in 2001, this appears to have opened up substantial competitive activity in ocean shipping, with beneficial economic results.\n\n==== Energy ====\nThe ''[[Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act]]'' was a regulating law, consisting of a mix of regulations and deregulation, which passed in response to [[OPEC]] price hikes and domestic price controls which affected the [[1973 oil crisis]] in the United States.  After adoption of this federal legislation, numerous state legislation known as [[Natural Gas Choice]] programs have sprung up in several states, as well as the District of Columbia. Natural Gas Choice programs allow residential and small volume natural gas users to compare purchases from natural gas suppliers with traditional utility companies.  There are currently hundreds of federally unregulated natural gas suppliers operating in the US. Regulation characteristics of Natural Gas Choice programs vary between the laws of the currently adoptive 21 states (as of 2008).\n\n{{anchor|U.S. electricity}} Deregulation of the electricity sector in the U.S. began in 1992.

The rapid development of computer and communications technology&nbsp;\u2013 particularly the Internet&nbsp;\u2013 have increased the size and variety of communications offerings. Wireless, traditional landline telephone, and cable companies increasingly invade each other's traditional markets and compete across a broad spectrum of activities. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] and Congress appear to be attempting to facilitate this evolution. In mainstream economic thinking, development of this competition would militate against detailed regulatory control of prices and service offerings, and hence favor deregulation of prices and entry into markets.<ref>{{citation\n|last=Crandall\n|first=Robert W.\n|title=Competition and Chaos \u2013 U.S. Telecommunications Since the 1996 Telecom Act\n|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]\n|isbn=978-0-8157-1617-4\n|date=1 December 2004\n}}</ref> On the other hand, there exists substantial concern about concentration of media ownership resulting from relaxation of historic controls on media ownership designed to safeguard diversity of viewpoint and open discussion in the society, and about what some perceive as high prices in cable company offerings at this point.\n\n==== Finance ====\nThe [[financial sector]] in the U.S. has seen considerable deregulation in recent decades, which has allowed for greater [[financial risk|risk]] taking.

Perhaps the most famous economist of all, [[Adam Smith]], argued the benefits of deregulation in his seminal work, ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'':<blockquote>[Without trade restrictions] the obvious and simple system of natural liberty establishes itself of its own accord. Every man...is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest in his own way.... The sovereign is completely discharged from a duty [for which] no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient; the duty of superintending the industry of private people, and of directing it towards the employments most suitable to the interest of the society.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Wealth of Nations|last=Smith|first=Adam|publisher=James Decker|year=1801|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=96}}</ref></blockquote>Scholars who theorize that deregulation is beneficial to society often cite what is known as the Iron Law of Regulation, which states that all regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/f5a55409a1576526dd77e603cde264d6/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=27157|title=Should government force companies to be responsible? - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=J.

Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}[[File:Newport Beach California 6 march 9 2014 photo d ramey logan.jpg|thumb|[[Newport Beach, California]] (United States), March 2014]]The number of motor yachts grows quite significantly each year.

The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid4fiv6dvoAhXAg3IEHR_EAdwQ6AEwCHoECAcQAg#v=onepage&q=Sailing%20yacht&f=false|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|year=|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Sailing yachts==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}{{main|Sailing yacht}}\n[[Image:CS30.jpg|thumb|right|A small [[sailing yacht]]]]\n\nSailing yachts can range in overall length ([[length overall]]\u2014LOA) from about {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} to well over {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}, where the distinction between a yacht and a ship becomes blurred. Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}[[File:Newport Beach California 6 march 9 2014 photo d ramey logan.jpg|thumb|[[Newport Beach, California]] (United States), March 2014]]The number of motor yachts grows quite significantly each year.

In 2010 for a short time, she played a violin by [[Guarneri del Ges\u00f9]] \u201eex-Carrodus\u201c 1741, on loan from the Austrian National Bank.

bows.\n\n===Voice===\n\nKopatchinskaja uses the voice in several compositions, including John Cage's \"Living Room Music\", Jorge Sanchez-Chiong's \"Crin\", [[Michael Hersch]]'s Duo for violin and

career==\nKopatchinskaja was born in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]], in the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (now [[Moldova]]).

Though almost always of a uniform colour, the vertebral shields of its shell sometimes have slightly darker edges \u2013 especially in young specimens. Its colouration makes it especially well camouflaged in its arid rocky Karoo habitat.\n\nLike the closely related [[speckled padloper]] (''Chersobius signatus'') and [[Nama padloper]] (''Chersobius solus'') to the west, it has five clawed toes on its front feet and four on its hind feet. Their weight is generally {{convert|100|to|150|g|oz}}. The average straight [[carapace]] length is {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}, though adult females are larger than males. Adult males can also be distinguished from females by having slightly longer tails, and a concave belly ([[plastron]]).<ref>Baard EHW (1994). ''Cape Tortoises: Their identification and care''. Cape Nature Conservation.</ref>\n\nIt looks superficially similar to the larger [[greater padloper]] (''Homopus femoralis'') of the grasslands in the east. However the Karoo Padloper can be distinguished by its uniform colouration, its having five toes on its front feet versus four toes on its back feet, the smaller scales on its forelimbs, and its nostrils which are level with or above its eyes.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''C. boulengeri'', a small, shy tortoise, occurs at relatively low densities in the succulent and desert shrubland of the central Karoo.\n\nIn its natural environment in the Great Karoo, it usually inhabits rocky outcrops and ridges of shale and ironstone. Here it hides in rock cracks and under ledges (rather than under vegetation, like many other tortoises). It has a very specialised diet (and therefore has a very poor survival rate in captivity). It is known for emerging just before thunderstorms, from which it got its local Afrikaans name of ''\"Donnerweerskilpad\"'' (\"thunder tortoise\").<ref>Boycott R, Bourquin O (1998).
