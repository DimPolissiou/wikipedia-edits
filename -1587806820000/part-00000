The plant consists of the root and a rosette of leaves. Sugar is formed by [[photosynthesis]] in the leaves and is then stored in the root.\n\nThe root of the beet contains 75% water, about 20% sugar, and 5% [[Beet pulp|pulp]].<ref name=respons/> The exact sugar content can vary between 12% and 21% sugar, depending on the cultivar and growing conditions. Sugar is the primary value of sugar beet as a [[cash crop]]. The pulp, [[Solubility|insoluble]] in water and mainly composed of [[cellulose]], hemicellulose, [[lignin]], and [[pectin]], is used in animal feed. The byproducts of the sugar beet crop, such as pulp and [[molasses]], add another 10% to the value of the harvest.<ref name=agrisugar1/>\n\nSugar beets grow exclusively in the [[Temperate climate|temperate]] zone, in contrast to [[sugarcane]], which grows exclusively in the tropical and subtropical zones. The average weight of sugar beet ranges between {{convert|0.5|and|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Sugar beet foliage has a rich, brilliant green color and grows to a height of about {{convert|35|cm|inch|abbr=on}}. The leaves are numerous and broad and grow in a tuft from the crown of the beet, which is usually level with or just above the ground surface.<ref name=gr1/>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Beta vulgaris}}\nModern sugar beets date back to mid-18th century [[Silesia]] where the king of [[Prussia]] subsidised experiments aimed at processes for sugar extraction.<ref name=langer>{{cite book |author1=Hill, G. |author2=Langer, R.

However, because crystallized cane sugar was already available and provided a better taste, this process never caught on. This story characterizes the history of the sugar beet. The competition between beet sugar and sugarcane for control of the sugar market plays out from the first extraction of a sugar syrup from a garden beet into the modern day.\n\nThe use of sugar beets for the extraction of crystallized sugar dates to 1747, when Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, professor of physics in the Academy of Science of Berlin, discovered the existence of a sugar in vegetables similar in its properties to that obtained from sugarcane. He found the best of these vegetable sources for the extraction of sugar was the white beet.<ref name=margg/> Despite Marggraf\u2019s success in isolating pure sugar from beets, their commercial manufacture for sugar did not take off until the early 19th century. Marggraf's student and successor Franz Karl Achard began selectively breeding sugar beet from the 'White Silesian' fodder beet in 1784. By the beginning of the 19th century, his beet was about 5\u20136% sucrose by (dry) weight, compared to around 20% in modern varieties. Under the patronage of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]], he opened the world's first beet [[sugar factory]] in 1801, at Cunern (Polish: Konary) in Silesia.<ref name=gr1/>\n\n===France===\n[[File:French sugar beet mill, 1843.jpg|thumb|French sugar beet mill in operation in the 1840s]]\nThe work of Achard soon attracted the attention of [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who appointed a commission of scientists to go to Silesia to investigate Achard's factory. Upon their return, two small factories were constructed near Paris. Although these factories were not altogether a success, the results attained greatly interested Napoleon. Thus, when two events, the blockade of Europe by the British [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Haitian Revolution]], made the importation of cane sugar untenable, Napoleon seized the opportunity offered by beet sugar to address the shortage. In 1811, Napoleon issued a decree appropriating one million [[franc]]s for the establishment of sugar schools, and compelling the farmers to plant a large acreage to sugar beets the following year. He also prohibited the further importation of sugar from the Caribbean effective in 1813.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/>\n\nThe number of mills increased considerably during the 1820s and 1830s, reaching a peak of 543 in 1837. The number was down to 382 in 1842, producing about 22.5 million kg of sugar during that year.<ref>L'Illustration Journal Universel, 13 May 1843.</ref>\n\n===Western Europe===\nAs a result of the French advances in sugar beet production and processing made during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the beet sugar industry in Europe developed rapidly. A new tax levied in Germany in 1810 prompted the experimentation to increase the sugar content of the beet. This was because the tax assessed the value of the sugar beet crop based on the unprocessed weight of the sugar beet rather than the refined sugar produced from them.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/><ref name=poggi/> By 1812, Frenchman [[Jean-Baptiste Qu\u00e9ruel]], working for the industrialist [[Benjamin Delessert]], devised a process of sugar extraction suitable for industrial application. By 1837, France had become the largest sugar beet producer in the world, a position it continued to hold in the world even into 2010. By 1837,  542 factories in France were producing 35,000 tonnes of sugar. However, by 1880, Germany became the largest producer of sugar from sugar beet in the world, since the German factories processed most of the sugar beets grown in eastern France.<ref name=\"gr1\"/>\n\nBy the 1850s, sugar beet production had reached Russia and Ukraine. This was made possible by the protection of the sugar beet industry by bounties, or subsidies, paid to beet sugar producers upon the export of their sugar by their respective governments.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/><ref name=\"Kenneth Kiple\"/> The protection provided to the sugar beet industry by these bounties caused drastic damage to the cane sugar industry and their grip on the British sugar market. The result was a reduction in the production of cane sugar, molasses and rum until 1915.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/><ref name=tasti/> During World War I, the widespread conflict destroyed large tracts of land that had served as sugar beet producers and repurposed much of the remaining sugar beet land for grain production. This resulted in a shortage that revived the shrinking cane sugar industry.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/>\n\n===United States===\nThe first attempts at sugar beet cultivation were pursued by [[abolitionists]] in New England. The \"Beet Sugar Society of Philadelphia\" was founded in 1836 and promoted home-produced beet sugar as an alternative to the slave-produced cane sugar from the [[West Indies]] or sugar imported from Asia (called \"free sugar\" because it was grown without using slavery), but tasted \"awful\".<ref name=\"Kaufman 2008 95\u2013104\"/> This movement failed, perhaps most due to the unpopularity of abolitionists at the time, at least until the Civil War, when these associations became irrelevant and only the economic feasibility of the industry remained.<ref name=\"Kaufman 2008 95\u2013104\"/>\n\nIn the 1850s an attempt was made in [[Utah]] by the [[LDS Church]]-owned [[Deseret Manufacturing Company]] to grow and process sugar beets, that failed for several reasons. First, the beet seeds they imported from France were not able to produce much sugar in the heavily salinized soil of Utah. Second, the cost of importing the beet seed from France consumed any possibility for profit. Finally, none of the people running the factory knew how to properly use the chemicals to separate the sugar from the beet pulp.<ref name=\"Robert M. Harveson\"/>\n\nThe first successful sugar beet factory was built by [[E. H. Dyer]] at Alvarado, California (now [[Union City, California|Union City]]), in 1870, but was not profitable until 1879. The factory survived on subsidies, since the abolitionist stigma that had held back the development of a sugar beet industry had been erased with the Civil War.<ref name=\"Kaufman 2008 95\u2013104\"/><ref name=\"Robert M. Harveson\"/><ref name=\"Magnuson 1918 68\u201379\"/>\nAfter this first success in Alvarado, the sugar beet industry expanded rapidly. Research done by [[Rachel Lloyd (chemist)|Rachel Lloyd]] at the University of Nebraska in the late 1880s resulted in a large production increase in the state of Nebraska. In 1889, [[Arthur Stayner]] and others were able to convince LDS Church leaders to support a second attempt, leading to the [[Utah-Idaho Sugar Company]].<ref name=\"Arrington\">{{cite book |last= Arrington |first= Leonard J. |authorlink= Leonard J.

In central Colorado<ref>https://www.fcgov.com/historicpreservation/pdf/german-russia-doc.pdf</ref> and western Nebraska, this was provided substantially by [[Germans from Russia]]<ref>[[Germans from Russia]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} who were already expert at sugar beet farming when they immigrated in large numbers circa 1890\u20131905.\n\nBy 1914, the sugar beet industry in the US matched the production of its European counterparts. The largest producers of beet sugar in the US were California, Utah, and Nebraska until the outbreak of World War II.<ref name=\"Magnuson 1918 68\u201379\"/><ref name=tauss/> In California were [[Japanese Americans]]; when they were interned during World War II, California's beet sugar production shifted inland to states such as Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and Utah. In many of the regions where new sugar beet farms were started during the war, farmers were unfamiliar with beet sugar cultivation, so they hired Japanese workers from [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] who were familiar with sugar beet production to work on the farms.<ref name=fiset/>\n\nSugar beets are grown in 11 states and represent 55% of the US sugar production<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://cropwatch.unl.edu/history-sugarbeets | title=History of sugarbeets| date=2015-09-25}}</ref> as compared to sugar cane which is grown in 4 states<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/X0513E/x0513e15.htm | title=The North American Sugar Market}}</ref> and accounts for 45% of US sugar production.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nSugar beets were not grown on a large scale in the United Kingdom until the mid-1920s, when 17 processing factories were built, following war-time shortages of imported cane sugar. Before World War I, with its far-flung empire, the United Kingdom simply imported the sugar from the cheapest market. However, World War I had created a shortage in sugar, prompting the development of a domestic market. The first sugar beet processing factory was built at [[Lavenham]] in [[Suffolk]] in 1860, but failed after a few years without the government support its counterparts on the continent received. The Dutch built the first successful factory at Cantley in Norfolk in 1912, and it was moderately successful since, because of its Dutch backing, it received Dutch bounties.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/>\n\nSugar beet seed from France was listed in the annual catalogues of [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] from that firm's inception in 1898 until the first of their own varieties was introduced in 1909. In 1915, the British Sugar Beet Society was formed to create an example of a domestic sugar beet industry for the purpose of obtaining government financing. Twelve years later, in 1927, they succeeded. The sugar beet industry in the United Kingdom was finally subsidized providing stability to the domestic industry that had experienced volatile shifts in profits and losses in the years since 1915.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/>\n\n===Russia===\nReferences to the sugar manufacturing from beets in Russia are dating back to 1802. [[Jacob Stepanovich Esipov|Jacob Esipov]]  has built a first Russian commercial factory producing sugar from beets in the Tula province.<ref>[https://slovar.wikireading.ru/2456463 \"slovar.wikireading\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.landwirt.ru/2009-12-12-16-06-01/441 \"History of sugar production\"]</ref>\n\nDuring the Soviet period, some particularly impressive advancements were made in seed development, of which the most useful was the development of a frost-resistant sugar beet, further expanding the growing range of the sugar beet.<ref name=buzan/>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Zuckerr\u00fcben Pflug010.jpg|thumb|A sugar beet farm in Switzerland]]\n[[File:Sugarbeetoutput.png|thumb|Worldwide sugar beet production]]\n\nThe sugar beet, like [[sugarcane]], needs a peculiar [[soil]] and a proper climate for its successful cultivation. The most important requirement is the soil must contain a large supply of nutrients, be rich in [[humus]], and be able to contain a great deal of moisture. A certain amount of [[alkali]] is not necessarily detrimental, as sugar beets are not especially susceptible to injury by some alkali. The ground should be fairly level and well-drained, especially where [[irrigation]] is practiced.<ref name=gr1/>\n\nGenerous crops can be grown in both sandy soil and heavy [[loam]]s, but the ideal soil is a sandy loam, i.e., a mixture of organic matter, clay and sand. A subsoil of gravel, or the presence of hard-pan, is not desirable, as cultivation to a depth of from {{convert|12|to|15|in|cm|1}} is necessary to produce the best results.\n\nClimatic conditions, temperature, sunshine, rainfall and winds have an important bearing upon the success of sugar beet agriculture. A temperature ranging from {{convert|15|to|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} during the growing months is most favorable. In the absence of adequate irrigation, {{convert|460|mm|in|1|abbr=in}} of rainfall are necessary to raise an average crop. High winds are harmful, as they generally crust the land and prevent the young beets from coming through the ground. The best results are obtained along the coast of southern California, where warm, sunny days succeeded by cool, foggy nights seem to meet sugar beet's favored growth conditions. Sunshine of long duration but not of great intensity is the most important factor in the successful cultivation of sugar beets. Near the equator, the shorter days and the greater heat of the sun sharply reduce the sugar content in the beet.<ref name=gr1/>\n\nIn high elevation regions such as those of Colorado and Utah, where the temperature is high during the daytime, but where the nights are cool, the quality of the sugar beet is excellent. In [[Michigan]], the long summer days from the relatively high latitude (the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]], where production is concentrated, lies between the 41st and 46th parallels North) and the influence of the Great Lakes result in satisfactory climatic conditions for sugar beet culture. [[Sebewaing, Michigan]] lies in [[the Thumb]] region of Michigan; both the region and state are major sugar beet producers. Sebewaing is home to one of three [[Michigan Sugar Company]] factories.  The town sponsors an annual Michigan Sugar Festival.<ref name=voices/>{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}\n\nTo cultivate beets successfully, the land must be properly prepared. Deep ploughing is the first principle of beet culture. It allows the roots to penetrate the subsoil without much obstruction, thereby preventing the beet from growing out of the ground, besides enabling it to extract considerable nourishment and moisture from the lower soil. If the latter is too hard, the roots will not penetrate it readily and, as a result, the plant will be pushed up and out of the earth during the process of growth. A hard subsoil is impervious to water and prevents proper drainage. It should not be too loose, however, as this allows the water to pass through more freely than is desirable. Ideally, the soil should be deep, fairly fine and easily penetrable by the roots. It should also be capable of retaining moisture and at the same time admit of a free circulation of air and good drainage. Sugar beet crops exhaust the soil rapidly. Crop rotation is recommended and necessary. Normally, beets are grown in the same ground every third year, peas, beans or grain being raised the other two years.<ref name=gr1/>\n\n[[File:Entladung Bunker.JPG|thumb|A sugar beet harvest in progress, Germany]]\nIn most [[temperate]] climates, beets are planted in the spring and harvested in the autumn. At the northern end of its range, growing seasons as short as 100 days can produce commercially viable sugar beet crops. In warmer climates, such as in [[California]]'s [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]], sugar beets are a winter crop, planted in the autumn and harvested in the spring. In recent years, [[Syngenta]] has developed the so-called tropical sugar beet. It allows the plant to grow in tropical and subtropical regions. Beets are planted from a small seed; {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of beet seed comprises 100,000 seeds and will plant over {{convert|1|ha|acre|spell=in}} of ground ({{convert|1|lb|kg|3|spell=in|disp=or}} will plant about {{convert|1|acre|ha|spell=in|disp=or}}.\n\nUntil the latter half of the 20th century, sugar beet production was highly labor-intensive, as weed control was managed by densely planting the crop, which then had to be manually thinned two or three times with a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] during the growing season. Harvesting also required many workers. Although the roots could be lifted by a [[plough]]-like device which could be pulled by a horse team, the rest of the preparation was by hand. One laborer grabbed the beets by their leaves, knocked them together to shake free loose soil, and then laid them in a row, root to one side, greens to the other. A second worker equipped with a beet hook (a short-handled tool between a [[billhook]] and a [[sickle]]) followed behind, and would lift the beet and swiftly chop the crown and leaves from the root with a single action. Working this way, he would leave a row of beets that could be forked into the back of a [[cart]].\n\nToday, mechanical sowing, [[herbicide]] application for weed control, and mechanical harvesting have displaced this reliance on manual farm work. A root beater uses a series of blades to chop the leaf and crown (which is high in nonsugar impurities) from the root. The [[Sugar beet harvester|beet harvester]] lifts the root, and removes excess soil from the root in a single pass over the field. A modern harvester is typically able to cover six rows at the same time. The beets are dumped into trucks as the harvester rolls down the field, and then delivered to the factory. The conveyor then removes more soil.\n\nIf the beets are to be left for later delivery, they are formed into [[storage clamp|clamps]]. Straw bales are used to shield the beets from the weather. Provided the clamp is well built with the right amount of ventilation, the beets do not significantly deteriorate. Beets that freeze and then defrost, produce complex carbohydrates that cause severe production problems in the factory. In the UK, loads may be hand examined at the factory gate before being accepted.\n\nIn the US, the fall harvest begins with the first hard frost, which arrests [[photosynthesis]] and the further growth of the root. Depending on the local climate, it may be carried out over the course of a few weeks or be prolonged throughout the winter months. The harvest and processing of the beet is referred to as \"the campaign\", reflecting the organization required to deliver the crop at a steady rate to processing factories that run 24 hours a day for the duration of the harvest and processing (for the UK, the campaign lasts about five months). In the Netherlands, this period is known as ''de bietencampagne'', a time to be careful when driving on local roads in the area while the beets are being grown, because the naturally high [[clay]] content of the soil tends to cause slippery roads when soil falls from the trailers during transport.\n\n==Production statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Top Ten Sugar Beet Producers\u20142016 [[UN Food and Agriculture Organization|(FAO)]]<ref name=fao/>\n!

Modern tower extraction plants have a processing capacity of up to {{convert|17,000|t|sigfig=3|sp=us|lk=on}} per day.<ref name=bmade/> A less-common design uses a moving belt of cossettes, with water pumped onto the top of the belt and poured through. In all cases, the flow rates of cossettes and water are in the ratio one to two. Typically, cossettes take about 90 minutes to pass through the diffuser, the water only 45 minutes. These [[countercurrent exchange]] methods extract more sugar from the cossettes using less water than if they merely sat in a hot water tank. The liquid exiting the diffuser is called '''raw juice'''. The colour of raw juice varies from black to a dark red depending on the amount of oxidation, which is itself dependent on diffuser design.\n\nThe used cossettes, or '''pulp''', exit the diffuser at about 95% moisture, but low sucrose content. Using [[screw press]]es, the wet pulp is then pressed down to 75% moisture. This recovers additional sucrose in the liquid pressed out of the pulp, and reduces the energy needed to dry the pulp. The pressed pulp is dried and sold as animal feed, while the liquid pressed out of the pulp is combined with the raw juice, or more often introduced into the diffuser at the appropriate point in the countercurrent process. The final byproduct, [[vinasse]], is used as fertilizer or growth substrate for yeast cultures.\n\nDuring diffusion, a portion of the sucrose breaks down into [[invert sugar]]s.  These can undergo further breakdown into acids. These breakdown products are not only losses of sucrose, but also have knock-on effects reducing the final output of processed sugar from the factory. To limit (thermophilic) bacterial action, the feed water may be dosed with [[formaldehyde]] and control of the feed water [[pH]] is also practiced. Attempts at operating diffusion under alkaline conditions have been made, but the process has proven problematic.  The improved sucrose extraction in the diffuser is offset by processing problems in the next stages.\n\n;Carbonatation\n[[File:Suikerbietenrooier zesrijige bunker (Sugarbeet harvester).jpg|thumb|left|A beet harvester]]\n[[Carbonatation]] is a procedure which removes impurities from raw juice before it undergoes crystallization.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=t08wJ9MRSXwC&pg=PA53&dq=Carbonatation+is+a+procedure+which+removes+impurities+from+raw+sugar+beet+juice+before+it+undergoes+crystallization#v=onepage&q=Carbonatation%20is%20a%20procedure%20which%20removes%20impurities%20from%20raw%20sugar%20beet%20juice%20before%20it%20undergoes%20crystallization&f=false|title=Chemical Process Technology and Simulation|last=KOYIKKAL|first=SRIKUMAR|date=2013-04-08|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120347090|language=ar}}</ref> First, the juice is mixed with hot [[milk of lime]] (a suspension of [[calcium hydroxide]] in water). This treatment [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]] a number of impurities, including multivalent [[anion]]s such as [[sulfate]], [[phosphate]], [[citrate]] and [[oxalate]], which precipitate as their calcium salts and large organic molecules such as [[protein]]s, [[saponin]]s and [[pectin]]s, which aggregate in the presence of multivalent [[cation]]s. In addition, the alkaline conditions convert the simple sugars, [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], along with the amino acid [[glutamine]], to chemically stable [[carboxylic acid]]s. Left untreated, these sugars and amines would eventually frustrate crystallization of the sucrose.\n\nNext, [[carbon dioxide]] is bubbled through the alkaline sugar solution, precipitating the lime as [[calcium carbonate]] ([[chalk]]). The chalk particles entrap some impurities and [[absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] others. A recycling process builds up the size of chalk particles and a natural [[flocculation]] occurs where the heavy particles settle out in tanks (clarifiers). A final addition of more carbon dioxide precipitates more calcium from solution; this is filtered off, leaving a cleaner, golden light-brown sugar solution called '''thin juice'''.\n\nBefore entering the next stage, the thin juice may receive [[soda ash]] to modify the pH and sulphitation with a [[sulfur]]-based compound to reduce colour formation due to decomposition of monosaccharides under heat.\n\n;Evaporation\n[[File:Hollogne sur-geer -Sucrerie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A sugar beet farm in Belgium: Beyond the field is the sugar factory.]]\n[[File:BritishSugarAlscottCB.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[sugar refinery]] in [[Allscott]] in [[Shropshire]], England]]\nThe thin juice is concentrated via [[multiple-effect evaporation]] to make a '''thick juice''', roughly 60% sucrose by weight and similar in appearance to [[Maple syrup|pancake syrup]]. Thick juice can be stored in tanks for later processing, reducing the load on the crystallization plant.\n\n;Crystallization\nThick juice is fed to the crystallizers. Recycled sugar is dissolved into it, and the resulting syrup is called [[mother liquor]].  The liquor is concentrated further by boiling under a vacuum in large vessels (the so-called vacuum pans) and seeded with fine sugar crystals. These crystals grow as sugar from the mother liquor forms around them. The resulting sugar crystal and syrup mix is called a ''massecuite'', from \"cooked mass\" in [[French language|French]]. The massecuite is passed to a [[centrifuge]], where the High Green syrup is removed from the massecuite by centrifugal force. After a predetermined\ntime, water is then sprayed into the centrifuge via a spray bar to wash the sugar crystals which produces Low Green syrup. The centrifuge then spins at very high speed to partially dry the crystals the machine then slows down and a plough shaped arm is deployed which ploughs out the sugar from the sides of the centrifuge from the top to the bottom onto conveying plant underneath where it is transported into a rotating granulator where it is dried using warm air.\n\nThe high green syrup is fed to a raw sugar vacuum pan from which a second batch of sugar is produced. This sugar (\"raw\") is of lower quality with more colour and impurities, and is the main source of the sugar dissolved again into the mother liquor. The syrup from the raw (Low green syrup) is boiled for a long time in AP Pans and sent to slowly flow around a series of about eight crystallisers. From this, a very low-quality sugar crystal is produced (known in some systems as \"AP sugar\") that is also redissolved. The syrup separated is [[molasses]], which still contains sugar, but contains too much impurity to undergo further processing economically. The molasses is stored on site and is added to dried beet pulp to make animal feed. Some is also sold in bulk tankers.\n\nActual procedures may vary from the above description, with different recycling and crystallisation processes.\n\n==Other uses==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Tuzemsky.JPG|thumb|upright=0.52|''[[Tuzem\u00e1k]]'', a sugar-beet-based alcohol brand from Czech Republic, is golden red in color.]]\n;Beverages\nIn a number of countries, notably the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], beet sugar is used to make a [[rum]]-like [[distilled spirit]] called ''[[Tuzemak]]''.

This thick, dark syrup is produced by cooking shredded sugar beet for several hours, then pressing the resulting mash and concentrating the juice produced until it has a consistency similar to that of [[honey]]. No other ingredients are used. In Germany, particularly the [[Rhineland]] area, this sugar beet syrup (called ''Zuckerr\u00fcben-Sirup'' or ''Zapp'' in German) is used as a spread for sandwiches, as well as for sweetening sauces, cakes and desserts.\n\nCommercially, if the syrup has a [[Dextrose equivalent|dextrose equivalency (DE)]] above 30, the product has to be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and converted to a high-fructose syrup, much like [[high-fructose corn syrup]], or isoglucose syrup in the EU.\n\nMany road authorities in North America use desugared beet molasses as de-icing or anti-icing products in winter control operations.  The molasses can be used directly,<ref name=\"sugar.ca\"/> combined with liquid chlorides and applied to road surfaces, or used to treat the salt spread on roads.<ref name=\"CAS Article\"/> Molasses can be more advantageous than road salt alone because it reduces corrosion and lowers the freezing point of the salt-brine mix, so the de-icers remain effective at lower temperatures.<ref name=\"sugar.ca\"/> The addition of the liquid to rock salt has the additional benefits that it reduces the bounce and scatter of the rock salt, keeping it where it is needed, and reduces the activation time of the salt to begin the melting process.<ref name=\"CAS Article\"/>\n\n;Betaine\n[[Betaine]] can be isolated from the byproducts of sugar beet processing. Production is chiefly through [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] separation, using techniques such as the \"simulated moving bed\".\n\n;Uridine\n[[Uridine]] can be isolated from sugar beet.\n\n;Alternative fuel\n[[BP]] and [[Associated British Foods]] plan to use agricultural surpluses of sugar beet to produce [[biobutanol]] in [[East Anglia]] in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nThe feedstock-to-yield ratio for sugarbeet is 56:9. Therefore, it takes 6.22&nbsp;kg of sugar beet to produce 1&nbsp;kg of ethanol (approximately 1.27 l at room temperature).\n\n==Agriculture==\n[[File:Dammanbau Zuckerruebe.svg|thumb|Sugar beet farming using dam culture method.  Used in Russia, Germany, France, Ukraine, Turkey, China, Poland, and sometimes Egypt]]\nSugar beets are an important part of a [[crop rotation]] cycle.\n\nSugar beet plants are susceptible to ''[[Beet necrotic yellow vein virus|Rhizomania]]'' (\"root madness\"), which turns the bulbous tap root into many small roots, making the crop economically unprocessable. Strict controls are enforced in European countries to prevent the spread, but it is already present in some areas. It is also susceptible to the [[beet leaf curl virus]], which causes crinkling and stunting of the leaves.\n\nContinual research looks for varieties with resistance, as well as increased sugar yield.  Sugar beet breeding research in the United States is most prominently conducted at various [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] Agricultural Research Stations, including one in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], headed by Linda Hanson and Leonard Panella; one in [[Fargo, North Dakota]], headed by John Wieland; and one at [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan]], headed by J. Mitchell McGrath.\n\nOther economically important members of the subfamily [[Chenopodioideae]]:\n* [[Beetroot]]\n* [[Chard]]\n* ''[[Mangelwurzel]]'' or fodder beet.\n\n===Genetic modification===\n{{Main|Genetically modified sugar beet}}\nIn the United States, genetically modified sugar beets, engineered for resistance to [[glyphosate]], a [[herbicide]] marketed as Roundup, were developed by [[Monsanto]] as a [[genetically modified crop]]. In 2005, the US Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ([[USDA]]-[[APHIS]]) deregulated glyphosate-resistant sugar beets after it conducted an environmental assessment and determined glyphosate-resistant sugar beets were highly unlikely to become a plant pest.<ref name=\"Roundup Ready Sugarbeets\"/><ref name=APHIS-history/> Sugar from glyphosate-resistant sugar beets has been approved for human and animal consumption in multiple countries, but commercial production of biotech beets has been approved only in the United States and Canada.  Studies have concluded the sugar from glyphosate-resistant sugar beets has the same nutritional value as sugar from conventional sugar beets.<ref name=AppealDecision2011 /> After deregulation in 2005, glyphosate-resistant sugar beets were extensively adopted in the United States. About 95% of sugar beet acres in the US were planted with glyphosate-resistant seed in 2011.<ref name=James2011/>\n\nWeeds may be chemically controlled using [[glyphosate]] without harming the crop.  After planting sugar beet seed, weeds emerge in fields and growers apply glyphosate to control them.  Glyphosate is commonly used in field crops because it controls a broad spectrum of weed species<ref name=michsug/> and has a low [[toxicity]].<ref name=usda3/> A study from the UK<ref name=nih/> suggests yields of genetically modified beet were greater than conventional, while another from the North Dakota State University extension service found lower yields.<ref name=nlpw/> The introduction of glyphosate-resistant sugar beets may contribute to the growing number of glyphosate-resistant weeds, so Monsanto has developed a program to encourage growers to use different herbicide modes of action to control their weeds.<ref name=\"New Releases\"/>\n\nIn 2008, the [[Center for Food Safety]], the [[Sierra Club]], the Organic Seed Alliance and High Mowing Seeds filed a lawsuit against [[USDA]]-[[APHIS]] regarding their decision to deregulate glyphosate-resistant sugar beets in 2005.  The organizations expressed concerns regarding glyphosate-resistant sugar beets' ability to potentially [[cross-pollinate]] with conventional sugar beets.<ref name=\"Roundup Ready Sugar Beet Case: Timeline\"/> U.S. District Judge [[Jeffrey White|Jeffrey S.

The plant consists of the root and a rosette of leaves. Sugar is formed by [[photosynthesis]] in the leaves and is then stored in the root.\n\nThe root of the beet contains 75% water, about 20% sugar, and 5% [[Beet pulp|pulp]].<ref name=respons/> The exact sugar content can vary between 12% and 21% sugar, depending on the cultivar and growing conditions. Sugar is the primary value of sugar beet as a [[cash crop]]. The pulp, [[Solubility|insoluble]] in water and mainly composed of [[cellulose]], hemicellulose, [[lignin]], and [[pectin]], is used in animal feed. The byproducts of the sugar beet crop, such as pulp and [[molasses]], add another 10% to the value of the harvest.<ref name=agrisugar1/>\n\nSugar beets grow exclusively in the [[Temperate climate|temperate]] zone, in contrast to [[sugarcane]], which grows exclusively in the tropical and subtropical zones. The average weight of sugar beet ranges between {{convert|0.5|and|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Sugar beet foliage has a rich, brilliant green color and grows to a height of about {{convert|35|cm|inch|abbr=on}}.

The Silesian sugar beet was soon introduced to [[France]], where [[Napoleon]] opened schools specifically for studying the plant. He also ordered that {{convert|28000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} be devoted to growing the new sugar beet.<ref name=langer/> This was in response to British blockades of cane sugar during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which ultimately stimulated the rapid growth of a European sugar beet industry.<ref name=langer/><ref name=\"ucdsugar\"/> By 1840, about 5% of the world's sugar was derived from sugar beets, and by 1880, this number had risen more than tenfold to over 50%.<ref name=langer/> The sugar beet was introduced to North America after 1830, with the first commercial production starting in 1879 at a farm in [[Alvarado, California]].<ref name=\"ucdsugar\"/><ref name=Mansfeld/> The sugar beet was also introduced to [[Chile]] by German settlers around 1850.<ref name=Mansfeld/>\n\n[[File:Inspecting sugar beet plants.jpg|thumb|upright|A geneticist evaluates sugar beet plants, resistant to the fungal disease ''Rhizoctonia'' root rot, for pollen fertility (United States, c. 2013)]]\n{{disputed section|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Creation===\n\"The beet-root, when being boiled, yields a juice similar to syrup of sugar, which is beautiful to look at on account of its vermilion color\"<ref name=worldcat/> (1575).<ref>[https://www.kloranebotanical.foundation/fr/lhistoire-du-sucre L'histoire du sucre] [[Klorane botanical foundation]]</ref> This was written by 16th-century scientist, [[Olivier de Serres]], who discovered a process for preparing sugar syrup from the common red beet. However, because crystallized cane sugar was already available and provided a better taste, this process never caught on. This story characterizes the history of the sugar beet. The competition between beet sugar and sugarcane for control of the sugar market plays out from the first extraction of a sugar syrup from a garden beet into the modern day.\n\nThe use of sugar beets for the extraction of crystallized sugar dates to 1747, when Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, professor of physics in the Academy of Science of Berlin, discovered the existence of a sugar in vegetables similar in its properties to that obtained from sugarcane. He found the best of these vegetable sources for the extraction of sugar was the white beet.<ref name=margg/> Despite Marggraf\u2019s success in isolating pure sugar from beets, their commercial manufacture for sugar did not take off until the early 19th century. Marggraf's student and successor Franz Karl Achard began selectively breeding sugar beet from the 'White Silesian' fodder beet in 1784. By the beginning of the 19th century, his beet was about 5\u20136% sucrose by (dry) weight, compared to around 20% in modern varieties. Under the patronage of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]], he opened the world's first beet [[sugar factory]] in 1801, at Cunern (Polish: Konary) in Silesia.<ref name=gr1/>\n\n===France===\n[[File:French sugar beet mill, 1843.jpg|thumb|French sugar beet mill in operation in the 1840s]]\nThe work of Achard soon attracted the attention of [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who appointed a commission of scientists to go to Silesia to investigate Achard's factory. Upon their return, two small factories were constructed near Paris. Although these factories were not altogether a success, the results attained greatly interested Napoleon. Thus, when two events, the blockade of Europe by the British [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Haitian Revolution]], made the importation of cane sugar untenable, Napoleon seized the opportunity offered by beet sugar to address the shortage. In 1811, Napoleon issued a decree appropriating one million [[franc]]s for the establishment of sugar schools, and compelling the farmers to plant a large acreage to sugar beets the following year. He also prohibited the further importation of sugar from the Caribbean effective in 1813.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/>\n\nThe number of mills increased considerably during the 1820s and 1830s, reaching a peak of 543 in 1837. The number was down to 382 in 1842, producing about 22.5 million kg of sugar during that year.<ref>L'Illustration Journal Universel, 13 May 1843.</ref>\n\n===Western Europe===\nAs a result of the French advances in sugar beet production and processing made during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the beet sugar industry in Europe developed rapidly. A new tax levied in Germany in 1810 prompted the experimentation to increase the sugar content of the beet. This was because the tax assessed the value of the sugar beet crop based on the unprocessed weight of the sugar beet rather than the refined sugar produced from them.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/><ref name=poggi/> By 1812, Frenchman [[Jean-Baptiste Qu\u00e9ruel]], working for the industrialist [[Benjamin Delessert]], devised a process of sugar extraction suitable for industrial application. By 1837, France had become the largest sugar beet producer in the world, a position it continued to hold in the world even into 2010. By 1837,  542 factories in France were producing 35,000 tonnes of sugar. However, by 1880, Germany became the largest producer of sugar from sugar beet in the world, since the German factories processed most of the sugar beets grown in eastern France.<ref name=\"gr1\"/>\n\nBy the 1850s, sugar beet production had reached Russia and Ukraine. This was made possible by the protection of the sugar beet industry by bounties, or subsidies, paid to beet sugar producers upon the export of their sugar by their respective governments.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/><ref name=\"Kenneth Kiple\"/> The protection provided to the sugar beet industry by these bounties caused drastic damage to the cane sugar industry and their grip on the British sugar market. The result was a reduction in the production of cane sugar, molasses and rum until 1915.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/><ref name=tasti/> During World War I, the widespread conflict destroyed large tracts of land that had served as sugar beet producers and repurposed much of the remaining sugar beet land for grain production. This resulted in a shortage that revived the shrinking cane sugar industry.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/>\n\n===United States===\nThe first attempts at sugar beet cultivation were pursued by [[abolitionists]] in New England. The \"Beet Sugar Society of Philadelphia\" was founded in 1836 and promoted home-produced beet sugar as an alternative to the slave-produced cane sugar from the [[West Indies]] or sugar imported from Asia (called \"free sugar\" because it was grown without using slavery), but tasted \"awful\".<ref name=\"Kaufman 2008 95\u2013104\"/> This movement failed, perhaps most due to the unpopularity of abolitionists at the time, at least until the Civil War, when these associations became irrelevant and only the economic feasibility of the industry remained.<ref name=\"Kaufman 2008 95\u2013104\"/>\n\nIn the 1850s an attempt was made in [[Utah]] by the [[LDS Church]]-owned [[Deseret Manufacturing Company]] to grow and process sugar beets, that failed for several reasons. First, the beet seeds they imported from France were not able to produce much sugar in the heavily salinized soil of Utah. Second, the cost of importing the beet seed from France consumed any possibility for profit. Finally, none of the people running the factory knew how to properly use the chemicals to separate the sugar from the beet pulp.<ref name=\"Robert M. Harveson\"/>\n\nThe first successful sugar beet factory was built by [[E. H. Dyer]] at Alvarado, California (now [[Union City, California|Union City]]), in 1870, but was not profitable until 1879. The factory survived on subsidies, since the abolitionist stigma that had held back the development of a sugar beet industry had been erased with the Civil War.<ref name=\"Kaufman 2008 95\u2013104\"/><ref name=\"Robert M. Harveson\"/><ref name=\"Magnuson 1918 68\u201379\"/>\nAfter this first success in Alvarado, the sugar beet industry expanded rapidly. Research done by [[Rachel Lloyd (chemist)|Rachel Lloyd]] at the University of Nebraska in the late 1880s resulted in a large production increase in the state of Nebraska. In 1889, [[Arthur Stayner]] and others were able to convince LDS Church leaders to support a second attempt, leading to the [[Utah-Idaho Sugar Company]].<ref name=\"Arrington\">{{cite book |last= Arrington |first= Leonard J. |authorlink= Leonard J.

In many of the regions where new sugar beet farms were started during the war, farmers were unfamiliar with beet sugar cultivation, so they hired Japanese workers from [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] who were familiar with sugar beet production to work on the farms.<ref name=fiset/>\n\nSugar beets are grown in 11 states and represent 55% of the US sugar production<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://cropwatch.unl.edu/history-sugarbeets | title=History of sugarbeets| date=2015-09-25}}</ref> as compared to sugar cane which is grown in 4 states<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/X0513E/x0513e15.htm | title=The North American Sugar Market}}</ref> and accounts for 45% of US sugar production.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nSugar beets were not grown on a large scale in the United Kingdom until the mid-1920s, when 17 processing factories were built, following war-time shortages of imported cane sugar. Before World War I, with its far-flung empire, the United Kingdom simply imported the sugar from the cheapest market. However, World War I had created a shortage in sugar, prompting the development of a domestic market. The first sugar beet processing factory was built at [[Lavenham]] in [[Suffolk]] in 1860, but failed after a few years without the government support its counterparts on the continent received. The Dutch built the first successful factory at Cantley in Norfolk in 1912, and it was moderately successful since, because of its Dutch backing, it received Dutch bounties.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/>\n\nSugar beet seed from France was listed in the annual catalogues of [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] from that firm's inception in 1898 until the first of their own varieties was introduced in 1909. In 1915, the British Sugar Beet Society was formed to create an example of a domestic sugar beet industry for the purpose of obtaining government financing. Twelve years later, in 1927, they succeeded. The sugar beet industry in the United Kingdom was finally subsidized providing stability to the domestic industry that had experienced volatile shifts in profits and losses in the years since 1915.<ref name=\"Dowling 1928\"/>\n\n===Russia===\nReferences to the sugar manufacturing from beets in Russia are dating back to 1802. [[Jacob Stepanovich Esipov|Jacob Esipov]]  has built a first Russian commercial factory producing sugar from beets in the Tula province.<ref>[https://slovar.wikireading.ru/2456463 \"slovar.wikireading\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.landwirt.ru/2009-12-12-16-06-01/441 \"History of sugar production\"]</ref>\n\nDuring the Soviet period, some particularly impressive advancements were made in seed development, of which the most useful was the development of a frost-resistant sugar beet, further expanding the growing range of the sugar beet.<ref name=buzan/>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Zuckerr\u00fcben Pflug010.jpg|thumb|A sugar beet farm in Switzerland]]\n[[File:Sugarbeetoutput.png|thumb|Worldwide sugar beet production]]\n\nThe sugar beet, like [[sugarcane]], needs a peculiar [[soil]] and a proper climate for its successful cultivation. The most important requirement is the soil must contain a large supply of nutrients, be rich in [[humus]], and be able to contain a great deal of moisture. A certain amount of [[alkali]] is not necessarily detrimental, as sugar beets are not especially susceptible to injury by some alkali. The ground should be fairly level and well-drained, especially where [[irrigation]] is practiced.<ref name=gr1/>\n\nGenerous crops can be grown in both sandy soil and heavy [[loam]]s, but the ideal soil is a sandy loam, i.e., a mixture of organic matter, clay and sand. A subsoil of gravel, or the presence of hard-pan, is not desirable, as cultivation to a depth of from {{convert|12|to|15|in|cm|1}} is necessary to produce the best results.\n\nClimatic conditions, temperature, sunshine, rainfall and winds have an important bearing upon the success of sugar beet agriculture. A temperature ranging from {{convert|15|to|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} during the growing months is most favorable. In the absence of adequate irrigation, {{convert|460|mm|in|1|abbr=in}} of rainfall are necessary to raise an average crop. High winds are harmful, as they generally crust the land and prevent the young beets from coming through the ground. The best results are obtained along the coast of southern California, where warm, sunny days succeeded by cool, foggy nights seem to meet sugar beet's favored growth conditions. Sunshine of long duration but not of great intensity is the most important factor in the successful cultivation of sugar beets. Near the equator, the shorter days and the greater heat of the sun sharply reduce the sugar content in the beet.<ref name=gr1/>\n\nIn high elevation regions such as those of Colorado and Utah, where the temperature is high during the daytime, but where the nights are cool, the quality of the sugar beet is excellent. In [[Michigan]], the long summer days from the relatively high latitude (the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]], where production is concentrated, lies between the 41st and 46th parallels North) and the influence of the Great Lakes result in satisfactory climatic conditions for sugar beet culture. [[Sebewaing, Michigan]] lies in [[the Thumb]] region of Michigan; both the region and state are major sugar beet producers. Sebewaing is home to one of three [[Michigan Sugar Company]] factories.  The town sponsors an annual Michigan Sugar Festival.<ref name=voices/>{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}\n\nTo cultivate beets successfully, the land must be properly prepared. Deep ploughing is the first principle of beet culture. It allows the roots to penetrate the subsoil without much obstruction, thereby preventing the beet from growing out of the ground, besides enabling it to extract considerable nourishment and moisture from the lower soil. If the latter is too hard, the roots will not penetrate it readily and, as a result, the plant will be pushed up and out of the earth during the process of growth. A hard subsoil is impervious to water and prevents proper drainage. It should not be too loose, however, as this allows the water to pass through more freely than is desirable. Ideally, the soil should be deep, fairly fine and easily penetrable by the roots. It should also be capable of retaining moisture and at the same time admit of a free circulation of air and good drainage. Sugar beet crops exhaust the soil rapidly. Crop rotation is recommended and necessary. Normally, beets are grown in the same ground every third year, peas, beans or grain being raised the other two years.<ref name=gr1/>\n\n[[File:Entladung Bunker.JPG|thumb|A sugar beet harvest in progress, Germany]]\nIn most [[temperate]] climates, beets are planted in the spring and harvested in the autumn. At the northern end of its range, growing seasons as short as 100 days can produce commercially viable sugar beet crops. In warmer climates, such as in [[California]]'s [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]], sugar beets are a winter crop, planted in the autumn and harvested in the spring. In recent years, [[Syngenta]] has developed the so-called tropical sugar beet. It allows the plant to grow in tropical and subtropical regions. Beets are planted from a small seed; {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of beet seed comprises 100,000 seeds and will plant over {{convert|1|ha|acre|spell=in}} of ground ({{convert|1|lb|kg|3|spell=in|disp=or}} will plant about {{convert|1|acre|ha|spell=in|disp=or}}.\n\nUntil the latter half of the 20th century, sugar beet production was highly labor-intensive, as weed control was managed by densely planting the crop, which then had to be manually thinned two or three times with a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] during the growing season. Harvesting also required many workers. Although the roots could be lifted by a [[plough]]-like device which could be pulled by a horse team, the rest of the preparation was by hand. One laborer grabbed the beets by their leaves, knocked them together to shake free loose soil, and then laid them in a row, root to one side, greens to the other. A second worker equipped with a beet hook (a short-handled tool between a [[billhook]] and a [[sickle]]) followed behind, and would lift the beet and swiftly chop the crown and leaves from the root with a single action. Working this way, he would leave a row of beets that could be forked into the back of a [[cart]].\n\nToday, mechanical sowing, [[herbicide]] application for weed control, and mechanical harvesting have displaced this reliance on manual farm work. A root beater uses a series of blades to chop the leaf and crown (which is high in nonsugar impurities) from the root. The [[Sugar beet harvester|beet harvester]] lifts the root, and removes excess soil from the root in a single pass over the field. A modern harvester is typically able to cover six rows at the same time. The beets are dumped into trucks as the harvester rolls down the field, and then delivered to the factory. The conveyor then removes more soil.\n\nIf the beets are to be left for later delivery, they are formed into [[storage clamp|clamps]]. Straw bales are used to shield the beets from the weather. Provided the clamp is well built with the right amount of ventilation, the beets do not significantly deteriorate. Beets that freeze and then defrost, produce complex carbohydrates that cause severe production problems in the factory. In the UK, loads may be hand examined at the factory gate before being accepted.\n\nIn the US, the fall harvest begins with the first hard frost, which arrests [[photosynthesis]] and the further growth of the root. Depending on the local climate, it may be carried out over the course of a few weeks or be prolonged throughout the winter months. The harvest and processing of the beet is referred to as \"the campaign\", reflecting the organization required to deliver the crop at a steady rate to processing factories that run 24 hours a day for the duration of the harvest and processing (for the UK, the campaign lasts about five months). In the Netherlands, this period is known as ''de bietencampagne'', a time to be careful when driving on local roads in the area while the beets are being grown, because the naturally high [[clay]] content of the soil tends to cause slippery roads when soil falls from the trailers during transport.\n\n==Production statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Top Ten Sugar Beet Producers\u20142016 [[UN Food and Agriculture Organization|(FAO)]]<ref name=fao/>\n!

In the UK, beets are transported by a hauler, or by a tractor and a trailer by local farmers. Railways and boats are no longer used. Some beets were carried by rail in the [[Republic of Ireland]], until the complete shutdown of [[Irish Sugar]] beet production in 2006.\n\nEach load is weighed and sampled before it gets tipped onto the reception area, typically a flat concrete pad, where it is moved into large heaps. The beet sample is checked for\n* soil tare \u2013 the amount of nonbeet delivered\n* crown tare \u2013 the amount of low-sugar beet delivered\n* sugar content ([[Polarimetry|\"pol\"]]) - amount of sucrose in the crop\n* nitrogen content \u2013 for recommending future fertilizer use to the farmer.\n\nFrom these elements, the actual sugar content of the load is calculated and the grower's payment determined.\n\nThe beet is moved from the heaps into a central channel or gulley, where it is washed towards the processing plant.\n\n;Diffusion\n[[File:Sugar beet cossettes.jpg|thumb|Dried sugar beet cossettes]]\nAfter reception at the processing plant, the beet roots are washed, mechanically sliced into thin strips called '''cossettes''', and passed to a machine called a diffuser to extract the sugar content into a water solution, a process known as [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]].\n\nDiffusers are long vessels of many metres in which the beet slices go in one direction while hot water goes in the opposite direction. The movement may either be caused by a rotating screw or the whole rotating unit, and the water and cossettes move through internal chambers. The three common designs of diffuser are the horizontal rotating 'RT' ''([[Raffinerie Tirlemontoise]]'', manufacturer), inclined screw 'DDS' (''De Danske Sukkerfabrikker''), or vertical screw \"Tower\". Modern tower extraction plants have a processing capacity of up to {{convert|17,000|t|sigfig=3|sp=us|lk=on}} per day.<ref name=bmade/> A less-common design uses a moving belt of cossettes, with water pumped onto the top of the belt and poured through. In all cases, the flow rates of cossettes and water are in the ratio one to two. Typically, cossettes take about 90 minutes to pass through the diffuser, the water only 45 minutes. These [[countercurrent exchange]] methods extract more sugar from the cossettes using less water than if they merely sat in a hot water tank. The liquid exiting the diffuser is called '''raw juice'''. The colour of raw juice varies from black to a dark red depending on the amount of oxidation, which is itself dependent on diffuser design.\n\nThe used cossettes, or '''pulp''', exit the diffuser at about 95% moisture, but low sucrose content. Using [[screw press]]es, the wet pulp is then pressed down to 75% moisture. This recovers additional sucrose in the liquid pressed out of the pulp, and reduces the energy needed to dry the pulp. The pressed pulp is dried and sold as animal feed, while the liquid pressed out of the pulp is combined with the raw juice, or more often introduced into the diffuser at the appropriate point in the countercurrent process. The final byproduct, [[vinasse]], is used as fertilizer or growth substrate for yeast cultures.\n\nDuring diffusion, a portion of the sucrose breaks down into [[invert sugar]]s.  These can undergo further breakdown into acids. These breakdown products are not only losses of sucrose, but also have knock-on effects reducing the final output of processed sugar from the factory. To limit (thermophilic) bacterial action, the feed water may be dosed with [[formaldehyde]] and control of the feed water [[pH]] is also practiced. Attempts at operating diffusion under alkaline conditions have been made, but the process has proven problematic.  The improved sucrose extraction in the diffuser is offset by processing problems in the next stages.\n\n;Carbonatation\n[[File:Suikerbietenrooier zesrijige bunker (Sugarbeet harvester).jpg|thumb|left|A beet harvester]]\n[[Carbonatation]] is a procedure which removes impurities from raw juice before it undergoes crystallization.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=t08wJ9MRSXwC&pg=PA53&dq=Carbonatation+is+a+procedure+which+removes+impurities+from+raw+sugar+beet+juice+before+it+undergoes+crystallization#v=onepage&q=Carbonatation%20is%20a%20procedure%20which%20removes%20impurities%20from%20raw%20sugar%20beet%20juice%20before%20it%20undergoes%20crystallization&f=false|title=Chemical Process Technology and Simulation|last=KOYIKKAL|first=SRIKUMAR|date=2013-04-08|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120347090|language=ar}}</ref> First, the juice is mixed with hot [[milk of lime]] (a suspension of [[calcium hydroxide]] in water). This treatment [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]] a number of impurities, including multivalent [[anion]]s such as [[sulfate]], [[phosphate]], [[citrate]] and [[oxalate]], which precipitate as their calcium salts and large organic molecules such as [[protein]]s, [[saponin]]s and [[pectin]]s, which aggregate in the presence of multivalent [[cation]]s. In addition, the alkaline conditions convert the simple sugars, [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], along with the amino acid [[glutamine]], to chemically stable [[carboxylic acid]]s. Left untreated, these sugars and amines would eventually frustrate crystallization of the sucrose.\n\nNext, [[carbon dioxide]] is bubbled through the alkaline sugar solution, precipitating the lime as [[calcium carbonate]] ([[chalk]]). The chalk particles entrap some impurities and [[absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] others. A recycling process builds up the size of chalk particles and a natural [[flocculation]] occurs where the heavy particles settle out in tanks (clarifiers). A final addition of more carbon dioxide precipitates more calcium from solution; this is filtered off, leaving a cleaner, golden light-brown sugar solution called '''thin juice'''.\n\nBefore entering the next stage, the thin juice may receive [[soda ash]] to modify the pH and sulphitation with a [[sulfur]]-based compound to reduce colour formation due to decomposition of monosaccharides under heat.\n\n;Evaporation\n[[File:Hollogne sur-geer -Sucrerie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A sugar beet farm in Belgium: Beyond the field is the sugar factory.]]\n[[File:BritishSugarAlscottCB.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[sugar refinery]] in [[Allscott]] in [[Shropshire]], England]]\nThe thin juice is concentrated via [[multiple-effect evaporation]] to make a '''thick juice''', roughly 60% sucrose by weight and similar in appearance to [[Maple syrup|pancake syrup]]. Thick juice can be stored in tanks for later processing, reducing the load on the crystallization plant.\n\n;Crystallization\nThick juice is fed to the crystallizers. Recycled sugar is dissolved into it, and the resulting syrup is called [[mother liquor]].  The liquor is concentrated further by boiling under a vacuum in large vessels (the so-called vacuum pans) and seeded with fine sugar crystals. These crystals grow as sugar from the mother liquor forms around them. The resulting sugar crystal and syrup mix is called a ''massecuite'', from \"cooked mass\" in [[French language|French]]. The massecuite is passed to a [[centrifuge]], where the High Green syrup is removed from the massecuite by centrifugal force. After a predetermined\ntime, water is then sprayed into the centrifuge via a spray bar to wash the sugar crystals which produces Low Green syrup. The centrifuge then spins at very high speed to partially dry the crystals the machine then slows down and a plough shaped arm is deployed which ploughs out the sugar from the sides of the centrifuge from the top to the bottom onto conveying plant underneath where it is transported into a rotating granulator where it is dried using warm air.\n\nThe high green syrup is fed to a raw sugar vacuum pan from which a second batch of sugar is produced. This sugar (\"raw\") is of lower quality with more colour and impurities, and is the main source of the sugar dissolved again into the mother liquor. The syrup from the raw (Low green syrup) is boiled for a long time in AP Pans and sent to slowly flow around a series of about eight crystallisers. From this, a very low-quality sugar crystal is produced (known in some systems as \"AP sugar\") that is also redissolved. The syrup separated is [[molasses]], which still contains sugar, but contains too much impurity to undergo further processing economically. The molasses is stored on site and is added to dried beet pulp to make animal feed. Some is also sold in bulk tankers.\n\nActual procedures may vary from the above description, with different recycling and crystallisation processes.\n\n==Other uses==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Tuzemsky.JPG|thumb|upright=0.52|''[[Tuzem\u00e1k]]'', a sugar-beet-based alcohol brand from Czech Republic, is golden red in color.]]\n;Beverages\nIn a number of countries, notably the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], beet sugar is used to make a [[rum]]-like [[distilled spirit]] called ''[[Tuzemak]]''.
