This endeavour was carried out by the [[World Health Organization]] under the [[Smallpox vaccine#Eradication of smallpox|Smallpox Eradication Program]].

Immune responses generated from a vaccinia virus infection protects the person against a lethal [[smallpox]] infection. For this reason, vaccinia virus was, and still is, being used as a live-virus vaccine against smallpox. Unlike vaccines that use weakened forms of the virus being vaccinated against, the vaccinia virus vaccine cannot cause a smallpox infection because it does not contain the smallpox virus. However, certain complications and/or vaccine adverse effects occasionally arise. The chance of this happening is significantly increased in people who are [[immunocompromised]]. Approximately one in one million individuals will develop a fatal response to the [[vaccination]].\n\nCurrently, the vaccine is only administered to health care workers or research personnel who have a high risk of contracting the [[variola]] virus, and to the military personnel of the [[United States]]. Due to the threat of smallpox [[bioterrorism]], there is a possibility the vaccine may have to be widely administered again in the future. Therefore, scientists are currently developing novel vaccine strategies against smallpox which are safer and much faster to deploy during a bioterrorism event.\n\nOn September 1, 2007, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) licensed a new [[vaccine]] [[ACAM2000]] against [[smallpox]] which can be produced quickly upon need. Manufactured by [[Sanofi Pasteur]], the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] stockpiled 192.5 million doses of the new vaccine (see list of common strains below).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/FDA-approves-new-smallpox-vaccine-1833591.php |title=FDA approves new smallpox vaccine |last=Heilprin |first=John |agency=AP |website=Houston Chronicle |date=1 September 2007 |access-date=25 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new smallpox vaccine, [[Imvanex]], which is based on a modified strain of vaccinia; [[Modified vaccinia Ankara]] was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002596/human_med_001666.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 |title=European public assessment report summary: Imvanex|date=2018-09-17}}</ref>\n\n''Vaccinia'' is also used in recombinant [[vaccines]], as a vector for expression of foreign genes within a host, in order to generate an immune response.

(See OED.) Vaccine potency and efficacy prior to the invention of refrigerated methods of transportation was unreliable. The vaccine would be rendered impotent by heat and sunlight, and the method of drying samples on quills and shipping them to countries in need often resulted in an inactive vaccine. Another method employed was the \"arm to arm\" method. This involved vaccinating an individual then transferring it to another as soon as the infectious pustule forms, then to another, etc. This method was used as a form of living transportation of the vaccine, and usually employed orphans as carriers. However, this method was problematic due to the possibility of spreading other blood diseases, such as hepatitis and syphilis. As was the case in 1861, when 41 Italian children contracted syphilis after being vaccinated by the \"arm to arm\" method.<ref>Tucker, Jonathan B. ''Scourge: The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox''.

Immune responses generated from a vaccinia virus infection protects the person against a lethal [[smallpox]] infection. For this reason, vaccinia virus was, and still is, being used as a live-virus vaccine against smallpox. Unlike vaccines that use weakened forms of the virus being vaccinated against, the vaccinia virus vaccine cannot cause a smallpox infection because it does not contain the smallpox virus. However, certain complications and/or vaccine adverse effects occasionally arise. The chance of this happening is significantly increased in people who are [[immunocompromised]]. Approximately one in one million individuals will develop a fatal response to the [[vaccination]].\n\nCurrently, the vaccine is only administered to health care workers or research personnel who have a high risk of contracting the [[variola]] virus, and to the military personnel of the [[United States]]. Due to the threat of smallpox [[bioterrorism]], there is a possibility the vaccine may have to be widely administered again in the future. Therefore, scientists are currently developing novel vaccine strategies against smallpox which are safer and much faster to deploy during a bioterrorism event.\n\nOn September 1, 2007, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) licensed a new [[vaccine]] [[ACAM2000]] against [[smallpox]] which can be produced quickly upon need.

The [[Latin]] term used for Cowpox was ''Variolae vaccinae'',  Jenner's own translation of \"smallpox of the cow\".  That term lent its name to the whole idea of vaccination.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=9987167|year=1999|last1=Baxby|first1=D|title=Edward Jenner's Inquiry; a bicentenary analysis|volume=17|issue=4|pages=301\u2013307|journal=Vaccine|doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(98)00207-2}}</ref>  When it was realized that the virus used in smallpox vaccination was not, or was no longer, the same as cowpox virus, the name 'vaccinia' was used for the virus in smallpox vaccine. (See OED.) Vaccine potency and efficacy prior to the invention of refrigerated methods of transportation was unreliable. The vaccine would be rendered impotent by heat and sunlight, and the method of drying samples on quills and shipping them to countries in need often resulted in an inactive vaccine. Another method employed was the \"arm to arm\" method. This involved vaccinating an individual then transferring it to another as soon as the infectious pustule forms, then to another, etc. This method was used as a form of living transportation of the vaccine, and usually employed orphans as carriers. However, this method was problematic due to the possibility of spreading other blood diseases, such as hepatitis and syphilis. As was the case in 1861, when 41 Italian children contracted syphilis after being vaccinated by the \"arm to arm\" method.<ref>Tucker, Jonathan B. ''Scourge: The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox''.

{"title_page": "Roumoules radio transmitter", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:001pylone.JPG|right|200px]]\nThe '''Roumoules transmitter''' is the main [[broadcasting]] facility for [[longwave]] and [[mediumwave]] broadcasting of [[Radio Monte Carlo]] near [[Roumoules|Roumoules, France]] and is owned by Monaco Media Diffusion. The 1000 and 2000kW transmitters installed are among the most powerful in the world  and can be received well at nighttime throughout Europe.\n\n==Longwave transmitter==\nThe longwave transmitter at Roumoules, which was inaugurated in 1974, transmits at 216&nbsp;kHz (until 1988: 218&nbsp;kHz) with a transmission power of 1400&nbsp;kW (until 1976: 2000&nbsp;kW). It consists of two 1000&nbsp;kW transmitters switched in parallel, which are however run with 700&nbsp;kW output power. A third 1000&nbsp;kW unit has been available since 1983. Although this unit is only used as backup unit, it is possible to switch all three units in parallel, which would allow an operation with a transmission power of 3000&nbsp;kW. Since the 31st of March 2020 the transmitter has ceased transmitting the French programme of Radio Monte Carlo but remains available for contract use.\n\nThe longwave transmitter uses a directional aerial with a maximum strength pointing northwest (azimuth: 309\u00b0). It consists of three {{convert|300|m|adj=on}}-high guyed masts, which are insulated against ground and ground-fed. As a backup a {{convert|330|m|adj=on}}-high guyed, ground-fed lattice steel [[mast radiator]] is available on the site, which only allows an omnidirectional radiation pattern.\n\nThe grounding system of the long wave transmitter is very large. The total length of all wires of the grounding system is {{convert|200|km|-2}}, covering an area of {{convert|150|ha}}. Because the area around the mast is used for agriculture, the ground wires are laid to a depth of {{convert|80|cm}}.\n\n==Medium wave transmitter==\nIn 1987 a switchable directional antenna consisting of five ground-fed guyed masts was built nearby for the 1467&nbsp;kHz medium wave frequency, which was previously transmitted from a transmitter at La Madonne. This antenna allows a switchable directional radiation in the following directions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n! Destination !! Azimuth\n|-\n|Scandinavia || 25\u00b0\n|-\n|Eastern Europe || 85\u00b0\n|-\n|Italy and Greece || 150\u00b0\n|-\n|Spain, Portugal, Northern Africa || 241\u00b0\n|-\n|UK || 325\u00b0\n|}\n\nChanging the signal direction takes only 5 seconds. There are no matching network buildings at the bottom of the masts used for medium wave transmission &ndash; the devices for tuning the masts to the transmission line are placed in the open air, similar to those in the longwave antenna system.\n\nThe medium wave Roumoules transmitter has an output power of 1000&nbsp;kW. It is also used for transmitting the religious programmes of [[Trans World Radio]]. In comparison to the longwave transmitter, which can be received well both at day and night in Southern France, Northern Italy, Switzerland and Southern Germany, this transmitter cannot be normally received well more than {{convert|100|km|-1}} from [[Roumoules]]. However at night its transmissions may have at least the same range as those of the longwave system due to its skywave propagation.\n\n==Power supply==\nThe Roumoules Transmitter consumes significant amounts of power, supplied by two transformers each capable of providing 5000&nbsp;kW. The power is delivered to the transformers by a 150&nbsp;kV and a 220&nbsp;kV power line. The transmitter's power supply is larger than required (an equivalent supply would provide a community of 5000 with its own substation to the 150&nbsp;kV grid supply). This redundant supply ensures reliable power for the transmitter. There is a backup generating set of {{convert|3300|hp|disp=out}} on the site and a possibility to supply the station at reduced power from the local 20&nbsp;kV grid.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of masts]]\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Structurae|id=20010744|title=Roumoules Main Radio Masts}}\n* {{Structurae|id=20010745|title=Roumoules Reserve Radio Mast}}\n* {{Structurae|id=20012622|title=Roumoules Medium Wave Towers}}\n* http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b45468\n* http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b45469\n* http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b45470\n* http://perso.orange.fr/monte-carlo-radiodiffusion/anglais/indexan.htm\n* http://perso.orange.fr/tvignaud/galerie/am/04roumoules.htm\n* http://mcstory.free.fr/antennes.html\n\n{{Coord|43|47|00|N|6|09|00|E|type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Roumoules Radio Transmitter}}\n[[Category:Radio masts and towers in Europe]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]]\n[[Category:Transmitter sites in France]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:001pylone.JPG|right|200px]]\nThe '''Roumoules transmitter''' is the main [[broadcasting]] facility for [[longwave]] and [[mediumwave]] broadcasting of [[Radio Monte Carlo]] near [[Roumoules|Roumoules, France]] and is owned by Monao Media Diffusion.

Believers claim the image depicts [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] and the fabric is the [[burial shroud]] in which he was wrapped after crucifixion, but it was first securely attested in 1390, when a local bishop wrote that an unnamed artist had confessed to the forgery, and [[radiocarbon dating]] of a sample of the fabric is consistent with this.\n\nThe artifact is kept in the [[Cathedral of Turin]], which is located next to a complex of buildings composed of the [[Royal Palace of Turin]], the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]] (located inside the Royal Palace and formerly connected to the Cathedral), and the [[Palazzo Chiablese]] in [[Turin]], [[Piedmont]], northern Italy.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] has neither formally endorsed nor rejected the shroud, but in 1958 [[Pope Pius XII]] approved of the image in association with the [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]].<ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, ''Saintly Men of Modern Times'', Our Sunday Visitor, 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}, p. 200.</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]] called the Shroud \"a mirror of the Gospel\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-francis-and-shroud-turin |title=Pope Francis and the Shroud of Turin - National Catholic Reporter |accessdate=6 June 2016|date=April 2013 }}</ref><ref>Pastoral Visit of His Holiness John Paul II to Vercelli and Turin, Italy, 23\u201324 May 1998 [http://shroudnm.com/docs/JPII05-24-1998.pdf]</ref> Other [[Christian denominations]], such as Anglicans and Methodists, have also shown devotion to the Shroud of Turin.<ref name=\"Dreisbach2001\"/> Diverse arguments have been made in scientific and popular publications claiming to prove, contrary to the scientific consensus, that the cloth is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis.

Prior to 1390 there are some similar images such as the [[Pray Codex]]. However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus.

In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]<ref>John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi</ref>) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.\n\nIn 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] ordered the cloth to be brought from Chamb\u00e9ry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since.<ref>See House of Savoy historian Filiberto Pingone in Filiberto Pingone, ''La Sindone dei Vangeli (Sindon Evangelica).

Among the most prominent portable early ''acheiropoieta'' are the [[Image of Camuliana]] and the [[Mandylion]] or Image of [[Edessa]], both painted icons of Christ held in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and now generally regarded as lost or destroyed, as is the [[Hodegetria]] image of the Virgin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kitzinger |first1=Ernst |title=The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm |journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers |date=1954 |volume=8 |pages=83\u2013150 |doi=10.2307/1291064 |jstor=1291064}}</ref> Other early images in Italy, all heavily and unfortunately restored, that have been revered as ''acheiropoieta'' now have relatively little following, as attention has focused on the Shroud.\n\nProponents for the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin argue that empirical analysis and scientific methods are insufficient for understanding the methods used for image formation on the shroud, believing that the image was miraculously produced at the moment of [[Resurrection of Christ|Resurrection]].<ref>Charles S.

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999</ref><ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, \"Saintly Men of Modern Times\", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}</ref> Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.\n\nIn 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Michael Freze 1993, p. 57\">Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57</ref> However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity.

A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The scientific approaches to the study of the Shroud fall into three groups: ''material analysis'' (both chemical and historical), ''biology and medical forensics'' and ''image analysis''.\n\n===Early studies===\n<!--THIS IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLE AND IS NOT INTENDED TO\nINCLUDE ENTIRE PASSAGES FROM BOOKS AND OTHER REFERENCES.\n\nPLEASE ADD INFORMATION IN A \"CONCISE\" FORM WITHOUT\nQUOTING LARGE SEGMENTS OF TEXT, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE\nARTICLE LENGTH WITHIN WIKIPEDIA LIMITS.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern. A second result of Tamburelli was the electronic removal from the image of the blood that apparently covers the face.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tamburelli |first1=Giovanni |title=Some Results in the Processing of the Holy Shroud of Turin |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |date=November 1981 |volume=PAMI-3 |issue=6 |pages=670\u2013676 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767168|pmid=21868987 }}</ref>\n\n===Material chemical analysis===\n[[File:discyellow.jpg |thumbnail |Phase contrast microscopic view of image-bearing fiber from the Shroud of Turin.

In addition, the rivulets on the front of the image are not consistent with the lines on the lumbar area, even supposing there might have been different episodes of bleeding at different times.

In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body. For comparison, see [[oshiguma]]; the making of face-prints as an artform, in Japan.

To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis,<ref>Allen, Nicholas P. L.

They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, [[Joe Nickell]] noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact? Photograph? |journal=Popular Photography |volume=November 1979 |page=97-147}}</ref>{{efn|For his pigment, Nickell first used the burial spices myrrh and aloes, but changed to red iron oxide (the pigment [[Ochre|red ocher]]) when microanalyst, [[Walter McCrone]] identified it as constituting the shroud\u2019s image. (McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of [[ferric oxide]] and [[gelatine]]. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of {{convert |250 |C |abbr=on}} and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide.<ref name=\"'Ingham\">{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Ingham |title=Turin Shroud Confirmed as Fake |date=21 June 2005 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.physorg.com/news4652.html |work=Physorg.com |pages=|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nInstead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object\u2014thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/scorch-paper-en.pdf |title=The Turin Shroud Body Image: The Scorch Hypothesis Revisited |author=Thibault Heimburger |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fanti and Moroni, after comparing the [[Color histogram|histogram]]s of 256 different grey levels, it was found that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200).<ref name=Fanti2002>{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Moroni |first2=M. |title=Comparison of Luminance Between Face of Turin Shroud Man and Experimental Results |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=1 March 2002 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=142\u2013154 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2002/00000046/00000002/art00009#expand/collapse |accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Maillard reaction====\nThe [[Maillard reaction]] is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar.

Rogers|Raymond Rogers]] and Anna Arnoldi propose that [[amine]]s from a recently deceased human body may have undergone Maillard reactions with this carbohydrate layer within a reasonable period of time, before liquid [[decomposition]] products stained or damaged the cloth.

Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the [[University of Padua]], wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.<ref>G. Fanti, F. Lattarulo, O. Scheuermann, \"[http://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf Body Image Formation Hypotheses Based on Corona Discharge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022011611/https://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf |date=22 October 2016 }}\", 2005</ref> Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample. No such effects can be observed in image fibers from the Shroud of Turin.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.<ref>{{cite web | first1=Paolo|last1=Di Lazzaro|first2=Daniele|last2=Murra|first3=Antonino|last3=Santoni|first4=Enrico|last4=Nichelatti|url=http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |title=The Conservation of the Shroud of Turin: Optical Studies |accessdate=10 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416225452/http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |archivedate=16 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=COLORAZIONE SIMIL\u2013SINDONICA DI TESSUTI DI LINO TRAMITE RADIAZIONE NEL LONTANO ULTRAVIOLETTO |issn=0393-3016 |url=http://opac.bologna.enea.it:8991/RT/2011/2011_14_ENEA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPaolo Di Lazzaro, the lead researcher, indicated in an e-mail interview that \"...&nbsp;it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier\", but their study does not mean the Shroud image was created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection, contrary to how the story was presented in the media, especially on the Web.<ref name=\"lazzaro\">{{cite web |url=http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/22/9636065-was-holy-shroud-created-in-a-flash-italian-researchers-resurrect-claim |title=Was Holy Shroud created in a flash?

Prior to 1390 there are some similar images such as the [[Pray Codex]]. However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus. Critics point out that it may not be a shroud at all, but rather a rectangular tombstone, as seen on other sacred images.<ref>G.M.Rinaldi, \"Il Codice Pray\", http://sindone.weebly.com/pray.html</ref>  The text of the codex also fails to mention a miraculous image on the codex shroud.\n\nThe first possible historical record dates from 1353 or 1357.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=31 January 2005 |title=Turin shroud 'older than thought' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4210369.stm |work=BBC News}}</ref> and the first certain record (in [[Lirey]], [[France]]) in 1390 when Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a [[memorandum]] to [[Antipope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII]] (Avignon Obedience), stating that the shroud was a forgery and that the artist had confessed.<ref name=\"Poulle 2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Poulle |first1=Emmanuel |authorlink=Emmanuel Poulle |title=Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin.

In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]<ref>John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi</ref>) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.\n\nIn 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] ordered the cloth to be brought from Chamb\u00e9ry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since.<ref>See House of Savoy historian Filiberto Pingone in Filiberto Pingone, ''La Sindone dei Vangeli (Sindon Evangelica).

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999</ref><ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, \"Saintly Men of Modern Times\", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}</ref> Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.\n\nIn 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Michael Freze 1993, p. 57\">Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57</ref> However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P.

In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern.

In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body. For comparison, see [[oshiguma]]; the making of face-prints as an artform, in Japan.

He described his results in his PhD thesis,<ref>Allen, Nicholas P. L.

They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, [[Joe Nickell]] noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact? Photograph? |journal=Popular Photography |volume=November 1979 |page=97-147}}</ref>{{efn|For his pigment, Nickell first used the burial spices myrrh and aloes, but changed to red iron oxide (the pigment [[Ochre|red ocher]]) when microanalyst, [[Walter McCrone]] identified it as constituting the shroud\u2019s image. (McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of [[ferric oxide]] and [[gelatine]]. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud.

Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the [[University of Padua]], wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.<ref>G. Fanti, F. Lattarulo, O. Scheuermann, \"[http://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf Body Image Formation Hypotheses Based on Corona Discharge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022011611/https://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf |date=22 October 2016 }}\", 2005</ref> Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample. No such effects can be observed in image fibers from the Shroud of Turin.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.<ref>{{cite web | first1=Paolo|last1=Di Lazzaro|first2=Daniele|last2=Murra|first3=Antonino|last3=Santoni|first4=Enrico|last4=Nichelatti|url=http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |title=The Conservation of the Shroud of Turin: Optical Studies |accessdate=10 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416225452/http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |archivedate=16 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=COLORAZIONE SIMIL\u2013SINDONICA DI TESSUTI DI LINO TRAMITE RADIAZIONE NEL LONTANO ULTRAVIOLETTO |issn=0393-3016 |url=http://opac.bologna.enea.it:8991/RT/2011/2011_14_ENEA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPaolo Di Lazzaro, the lead researcher, indicated in an e-mail interview that \"...&nbsp;it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier\", but their study does not mean the Shroud image was created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection, contrary to how the story was presented in the media, especially on the Web.<ref name=\"lazzaro\">{{cite web |url=http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/22/9636065-was-holy-shroud-created-in-a-flash-italian-researchers-resurrect-claim |title=Was Holy Shroud created in a flash?

Leukaemias are subdivided into [[lymphoid]] and [[myeloid]] neoplasms, depending on which bone marrow cells are cancerous. The myeloid neoplasms contain acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). MPNs are characterised by increased production of myeloid blood cells, with a higher than normal number of mature cells. Unlike MPNs, MDSs have a dysfunctional production of myeloid cells with a reduced number of mature cells. Many of the cells produced in MDS are abnormal looking, known as dysplasia.

A haemoglobin level of <10g/dL has a reduced overall survival. Some cytogenetic abnormalities have implications on the prognosis of CMML. Normal karyotypes or the single loss of the Y chromosome have low risk prognoses. Trisomy 8, chromosome 7 abnormalities and complex karyotypes comprise a high risk group.

It uses the blast percentage, number of cytopenias and bone marrow cytogenetics data to place cases of CMML into these groups. Due to the scoring system being developed for MDS, the more myeloproliferative cases of CMML (WBC >13x10<sup>9</sup>) are excluded from the scoring system.

Leukaemias are subdivided into [[lymphoid]] and [[myeloid]] neoplasms, depending on which bone marrow cells are cancerous. The myeloid neoplasms contain acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). MPNs are characterised by increased production of myeloid blood cells, with a higher than normal number of mature cells. Unlike MPNs, MDSs have a dysfunctional production of myeloid cells with a reduced number of mature cells. Many of the cells produced in MDS are abnormal looking, known as dysplasia. CMML shows characteristics of both groups and thus is a difficult disease to categorise.<ref name=\"isbn4051\">{{cite book |author=Bain, Barbara J. |title=Leukaemia Diagnosis |publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Cambridge, MA |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-1-4051-0661-0 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref><ref name = \"pmid20699489\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bhargava R, Dalal BI |title=Two steps forward, one step back: 4th WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms (2008)|journal=Indian J Pathol Microbiol |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=391\u20134 |year=2010 |pmid=20699489 |doi=10.4103/0377-4929.68240|url=}}</ref>\n\n====FAB classification====\nThe [[French-American-British classification|French-American-British]] (FAB) classification system was published in 1976 to classify the leukaemias.

Myeloproliferative CMML (>13x10<sup>9</sup> monocytes/L) has a reduced survival compared with myelodysplastic CMML. A platelet count of <100 x10<sup>9</sup>/L reduces overall survival. A haemoglobin level of <10g/dL has a reduced overall survival. Some cytogenetic abnormalities have implications on the prognosis of CMML. Normal karyotypes or the single loss of the Y chromosome have low risk prognoses. Trisomy 8, chromosome 7 abnormalities and complex karyotypes comprise a high risk group. Other cytogenetic abnormalities have intermediate prognoses. Somatic mutations in genes such as [[ASXL1]] and [[EZH2]] are associated with poor prognosis.<ref name=\"pmid22160044\"/>\n\nCMML has a 20-30% chance of transformation to AML, a lower rate than other similar diseases.

It uses the blast percentage, number of cytopenias and bone marrow cytogenetics data to place cases of CMML into these groups. Due to the scoring system being developed for MDS, the more myeloproliferative cases of CMML (WBC >13x10<sup>9</sup>) are excluded from the scoring system. Although the IPSS scoring system is used clinically, there is a high variability in each group.
