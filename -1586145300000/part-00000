To protect against the cold, the [[udder]] in females and the [[scrotum]] in males are small and covered in a layer of hair. Females have four [[teat]]s. Both sexes have long shaggy hair with a dense woolly undercoat over the chest, flanks, and thighs for insulation against the cold. In males especially, this undercoat may form a long \"skirt\" that can reach the ground. The tail is long and horse-like rather than tufted like the tails of cattle or bison. The coat is typically black or dark brown covering most of the body, with a grey muzzle, although some wild golden-brown individuals have been reported. Wild yaks with gold coloured hair  are known as the Wild Golden Yak ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u91d1|\u8272|\u91ce|\u7266|\u725b}}|p=j\u012bns\u00e8y\u011b m\u00e1oni\u00fa}}).

In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included \"antimalarials,\" blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly).<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 105&ndash;6.</ref>\n\nAmong the company's more recent pharmaceutical developments are [[cephalosporin]], [[erythromycin]], and [[Prozac]] (fluoxetine), a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) for the treatment of [[clinical depression]]. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] and [[mental health]]-related conditions, including [[clinical depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[narcotic]] addiction, [[insomnia]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Historical ===\nEli Lilly has focused on patent-protected medicines, with generic manufacturers taking over production of earlier drugs whose patents have expired.\n\n====Cialis====\n{{further|Tadalafil}}\nIn 2003, Eli Lilly introduced [[Tadalafil|Cialis]] (tadalafil), a competitor to [[Pfizer]]'s blockbuster [[Viagra]] for [[erectile dysfunction]]. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the \"weekend pill\". Cialis was developed in a partnership with [[biotechnology]] company Icos Corporation. On December 18, 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.<ref>With its television advertisement for Cialis during the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2004 Super Bowl Halftime Show]], Eli Lilly was one of several companies whose costly 2004 [[Super Bowl]] Halftime advertisements were largely overshadowed by the [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Cymbalta====\n{{further|Duloxetine}}\nAnother Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, [[Duloxetine|Cymbalta]], a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history.  It is also used in the treatment of [[fibromyalgia]], [[neuropathy]], [[chronic pain]] and [[osteoarthritis]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Gemzar====\n{{further|Gemcitabine}}\nIn 1996, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[gemcitabine|Gemzar]] for the treatment of [[pancreatic cancer]]. Gemzar is commonly used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, usually in coordination with 5-FU [[chemotherapy]] and radiology.

Eli Lily introduced the drug to the United States in 1947, marketed under the trade name \"Dolophine\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Current |first1=John D. |title=Pharmacology for Anesthetists:Anesthetics and Adjuvants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Du2bfrO9FwC&pg=PA386 |accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Prozac====\n{{further|Fluoxetine}}\nProzac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of [[serotonin]] within the [[human brain]]. Prozac was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression, with generic versions appearing after 2002.\n\n====Secobarbital====\n{{further|Secobarbital}}\nEli Lilly has manufactured [[Secobarbital]], a [[barbiturate]] derivative with [[anaesthetic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[sedative]] and [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of [[epilepsy]], temporary [[insomnia]] and as a pre-operative medication to produce anaesthesia and [[anxiolysis]] in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 1999.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n=====Secobarbital overdoses=====\nSecobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a [[Recreational drug use|recreational drug]]. On September 18, 1970, [[rock music|rock]] guitarist legend [[Jimi Hendrix]] died from a secobarbital overdose. On June 22, 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress [[Judy Garland]]. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1966) by [[Jacqueline Susann]] in which three highly successful [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Thimerosal====\n{{further|Thiomersal}}\nEli Lilly has developed the [[vaccine]] preservative [[thiomersal]] (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to [[Autolysis (biology)|autolyze]]. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that \"had been formulated at the [[University of Maryland]] with support of a Lilly research fellowship.\"<ref name=MLilly65/>\n\n====Zyprexa====\n\nZyprexa ([[Olanzapine]]) (for [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]], as well as [[off-label]] uses) Released in 1996, (see criminal prosecution section) it was the company's best selling drug through 2010, when the [[patent]] expired.<ref>{{cite news | last=Wilson | first=Duff|title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits  | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?pagewanted=all | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\nAfter three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col.

In the 1950s Lilly introduced two new antibiotics: vancomycin and erythromycin. In addition Lilly was heavily involved in production and distribution of [[Jonas Salk]]'s [[Polio vaccine|poliomyelitis (polio) vaccine]].

In 1969, the company opened a new plant in [[Clinton, Indiana]].<ref name=b541/>\n\nAfter a company reorganization and transition to non-family management in 1953, Lilly continued to expand its global presence.

When generic drugs flooded the marketplace after the expiration of patents for drugs discovered in the 1950s and 1960s, Lilly diversified into other areas, most notably agricultural chemicals, animal-health products, cosmetics, and medical instruments.\n\nIn 1971, the company became a component of the [[S&P 500 Index]].\n\nTo further diversify its product line, Lilly made an uncharacteristic, but ultimately profitable move in 1971, when it bought cosmetic manufacturer [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]] for $38 million. Although the subsidiary continued to lose money for five years after Lilly acquired it, executive management changes at Arden helped turn it into a financial success.

Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] and [[mental health]]-related conditions, including [[clinical depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[narcotic]] addiction, [[insomnia]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Historical ===\nEli Lilly has focused on patent-protected medicines, with generic manufacturers taking over production of earlier drugs whose patents have expired.\n\n====Cialis====\n{{further|Tadalafil}}\nIn 2003, Eli Lilly introduced [[Tadalafil|Cialis]] (tadalafil), a competitor to [[Pfizer]]'s blockbuster [[Viagra]] for [[erectile dysfunction]]. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the \"weekend pill\". Cialis was developed in a partnership with [[biotechnology]] company Icos Corporation. On December 18, 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.<ref>With its television advertisement for Cialis during the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2004 Super Bowl Halftime Show]], Eli Lilly was one of several companies whose costly 2004 [[Super Bowl]] Halftime advertisements were largely overshadowed by the [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Cymbalta====\n{{further|Duloxetine}}\nAnother Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, [[Duloxetine|Cymbalta]], a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history.

Eli Lily introduced the drug to the United States in 1947, marketed under the trade name \"Dolophine\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Current |first1=John D. |title=Pharmacology for Anesthetists:Anesthetics and Adjuvants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Du2bfrO9FwC&pg=PA386 |accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Prozac====\n{{further|Fluoxetine}}\nProzac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of [[serotonin]] within the [[human brain]]. Prozac was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression, with generic versions appearing after 2002.\n\n====Secobarbital====\n{{further|Secobarbital}}\nEli Lilly has manufactured [[Secobarbital]], a [[barbiturate]] derivative with [[anaesthetic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[sedative]] and [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of [[epilepsy]], temporary [[insomnia]] and as a pre-operative medication to produce anaesthesia and [[anxiolysis]] in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 1999.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n=====Secobarbital overdoses=====\nSecobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a [[Recreational drug use|recreational drug]]. On September 18, 1970, [[rock music|rock]] guitarist legend [[Jimi Hendrix]] died from a secobarbital overdose. On June 22, 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress [[Judy Garland]]. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1966) by [[Jacqueline Susann]] in which three highly successful [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Thimerosal====\n{{further|Thiomersal}}\nEli Lilly has developed the [[vaccine]] preservative [[thiomersal]] (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to [[Autolysis (biology)|autolyze]]. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that \"had been formulated at the [[University of Maryland]] with support of a Lilly research fellowship.\"<ref name=MLilly65/>\n\n====Zyprexa====\n\nZyprexa ([[Olanzapine]]) (for [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]], as well as [[off-label]] uses) Released in 1996, (see criminal prosecution section) it was the company's best selling drug through 2010, when the [[patent]] expired.<ref>{{cite news | last=Wilson | first=Duff|title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits  | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?pagewanted=all | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Leadership==\nAfter three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col.
