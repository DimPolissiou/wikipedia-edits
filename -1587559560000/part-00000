It runs from [[Llandudno]] via [[Llandudno Junction]] ({{lang-cy|Cyffordd Llandudno}}) to [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]], and was originally part of the [[London and North Western Railway]], being opened in stages to 1879. The primary purpose of the line was to carry slate from the Ffestiniog quarries to a specially built quay at [[Deganwy]] for export by sea. The line also provided goods facilities for the market town of [[Llanrwst]], and via the extensive facilities at Betws-y-Coed on the [[London]] to [[Holyhead]] [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5 turnpike road]] it served many isolated communities in [[Snowdonia]] and also the developing tourist industry.\nAlthough only a little over {{convert|27|mi|km}} between Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog, the journey takes over one hour, largely due to the sinuous and steeply graded nature of the route taken (particularly south of Betws-y-Coed). Most of the stations along the line are treated as [[request stop]]s.\n\n== History ==\nThe first section from Llandudno Junction to Llanrwst (now called [[North Llanrwst railway station|North Llanrwst]]) was built as the [[Conway and Llanrwst Railway]] and opened in 1863. The [[LNWR]] took over in 1863 and opened the extension to Betws-y-Coed in 1868.<ref>Baughan 1980, page 117</ref>\n\nThe next extension was to Blaenau Ffestiniog to access the output of the large [[slate]] quarries there. At first the LNWR proposed a 2' [[narrow gauge]] railway via the steeply graded [[Lledr Valley]] to Blaenau Ffestiniog, this being the 'Bettws & Festiniog Railway'; authorisation was sought in November 1870.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/23680/page/4988|title=Page 4988 &#124; Issue 23680, 18 November 1870 &#124; London Gazette &#124; The Gazette}}</ref><ref>''The Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard'', 26 November 1870</ref> After construction began, it was decided that the extension would be built to [[standard gauge]], allowing through running of trains. Between 1874 and 1879 the [[railway tunnel]] underneath [[Moel Dyrnogydd]] was bored, and in July 1879 a terminus was initially opened by the tunnel entrance. The line was subsequently extended by the best part of a mile to a terminus in the town, which opened 31 March 1881.<ref>Baughan 1980, pages 128-130</ref><ref>''The North Wales Express'', 1 April 1881</ref>\n\nBlaenau Ffestiniog's other [[standard gauge]] railway, the [[Bala and Ffestiniog Railway]], was closed to all traffic in 1961, and a portion was flooded in the creation of the [[Llyn Celyn]] reservoir. A rail connection was desired for the [[nuclear power station]] under construction at [[Trawsfynydd]], and a connecting line was built from Blaenau Ffestiniog North to the site of the demolished Blaenau Ffestiniog Central station for freight use. With the reconstruction of the [[Ffestiniog Railway]], passenger services were relocated to a [[Blaenau Ffestiniog railway station#1982 Central Station|new joint station]] on the site of the old Central station in 1982. Regular freight traffic to [[Trawsfynydd nuclear power station]] ceased in 1995, and the power station is being decommissioned.\n\nThe line's proximity to the [[River Conwy]] at its northern end has led to periodic problems with flooding over the years.  In 2004, 2005 and 2019 floods resulted in prolonged closures whilst the trackbed and embankments were rebuilt - the 2004 floods putting the line out of action from early February until 22 May that year.<ref>[http://www.penmorfa.com/Conwy/floods_Feb_04.html \"Flooding closed the Conwy Valley line for 3 months\"] \u2013 ''The Conway Valley Line'', Penmorfa.com; Retrieved 4 March 2016</ref>\n\nThe line was again closed from 27 December 2015 for seven weeks, after the formation was damaged by floodwater in more than 100 places following heavy rain on Boxing Day.<ref>[http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/conwy-valley-line-1200-tonnes-10865845 Conwy Valley line had 1,200 tonnes of material removed from railway during repair work] Davidson, Tom; ''Daily Post'' article 10 February 2016; Retrieved 4 March 2016</ref>\n\nA further closure occurred between February and April 2017 after [[Storm Doris]], when a tree fell on the track near Pont-y-Pant.

The fully signalled [[passing loop]] at North Llanrwst is the last remaining between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog and trains on the branch must stop at the [[signal box]] there to exchange [[Token (railway signalling)|tokens]] for the single line sections on either side.<ref>[http://www.penmorfa.com/Conwy/two.htm Photos of Llanrwst station, signal box and crossing loop] www.penmorfa.com; Retrieved 2010-06-08</ref>\n\nThe line is currently served by 6 trains per day in both directions from Monday to Saturday between [[Llandudno railway station|Llandudno]] and [[Blaenau Ffestiniog railway station|Blaenau Ffestiniog]] (and vice versa), with the first two southbound services of the day starting (and first northbound service turning back) at [[Llandudno Junction railway station|Llandudno Junction]] and terminating in Blaenau Ffestiniog. The service is reduced to 4 trains per day in both directions on Sundays - this service now operates all year round, rather than in summer only as it did up until the winter 2019 timetable change.<ref>{{NRTimes|December 2019|102}}</ref>\n\nThe train service is operated by [[Transport for Wales Rail]] and is being marketed as the '''Conwy Valley Railway''' ({{lang-cy|Rheilffordd Dyffryn Conwy}}). A feature of the service is the availability on Conwy Valley trains as well as on local buses in Snowdonia of the new \"Tocyn Taith\" day ticket.\n\nFrom 20 May 2007, Concessionary Travel Pass holders resident in Conwy and Gwynedd have been able to travel free of charge on the Conwy Valley Railway line between Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog, as well as between Llandudno Junction and Llandudno on all Transport for Wales Rail services, as a result of funding provided by the [[Welsh Assembly Government]].\n\nThe Office of Rail Regulation says <ref>{{cite web|url=http://orr.gov.uk/statistics/published-stats/station-usage-estimates|title=Estimates of station usage|work=orr.gov.uk|accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> 116,500 passenger journeys were made on the line in 2013/14, excluding exits and entries at the main line stations of [[Llandudno Junction railway station|Llandudno Junction]], [[Deganwy railway station|Deganwy]] and [[Llandudno railway station|Llandudno]]. This was a small increase compared with the figure of 112,134 in 2012/13. Figures show that [[Blaenau Ffestiniog railway station|Blaenau Ffestiniog]] is the busiest of the line's stations with 44,828 passengers in 2013/14, followed by [[Betws-y-Coed railway station|Betws-y-Coed]] with 35,400. Other stations have very low footfall with [[Dolgarrog railway station|Dolgarrog]] attracting just 828 passengers in 2013/14.\n\nThere are plans to upgrade the line to take slate from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coast, sponsored by the Welsh Assembly Government<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/7724225.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Wales - North West Wales - Campaign to improve railway link|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2018 operations transferred to the new franchise holder [[Transport for Wales Rail]] who have announced that they will use a [[British Rail Class 230]] D-Train on the line in late 2019 replacing the [[British Rail Class 150]] currently used on the line.\n\n===Community rail===\nThis is designated as a [[community rail]] partnership.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.acorp.uk.com/Assets/ACoRP%20summary%20map%20v4.pdf |title=ACORP Summary map |publisher=Association of Community Rail Partnerships |date=28 July 2014 |accessdate=28 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118174638/http://www.acorp.uk.com/Assets/ACoRP%20summary%20map%20v4.pdf |archivedate=18 November 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Steam workings==\n[[File:LMS 48151 at Llandudno Junction.JPG|225px|thumb|right|LMS 8F no 48151 waiting to depart from Llandudno Jcn with \"The Welsh Mountaineer\" on Tue 19 August 2014.]]\n[[File:61994 The Great Marquess resting in Blaenau Ffestiniog.jpg|225px|thumb|right|LNER K4 no 61994 The Great Marquess in the loop at Blaenau Ffestiniog after arriving with \"The Welsh Mountaineer\" on Tue 29 July 2014.]]\n\n1998 the first steam working in the preservation era was to run back to [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] from [[London]] behind a [[BR Standard Class 4 2-6-4T|BR Standard 4 Tank]] no 80079. The first attempt up the route on 2 May 1998 ended in disaster as the engine stalled near [[Pont-y-Pant railway station|Pont-y-Pant]] and due to the water supply running low resulted in the train having to be rescued and then returned to [[Llandudno]]. A second attempt the day later, this time with just 4 coaches instead of the previous 6 proved successful, with 80079 becoming the first standard gauge steam locomotive in Blaenau for 31 years.\n\nOn 1 May 1999 [[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0|LMS black 5]] no [[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 5407|45407]] worked \"The Conwy Climber\" tour from Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog, from the lessons learnt with 80079 it was decided that although 45407 was a power class 5 engine (The BR standard being power class 4) 45407 would take a max of 4 coaches up the line while working solo. 45407 first took up 4 coaches to Blaenau without problems and then returned light engine to Llandudno Junction to collect the remaining four coaches, after this the eight coaches were coupled together for the return trip to Llandudno Junction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.penmorfa.com/Conwy/steam1.html|title=Steam to Blaenau|website=www.penmorfa.com}}</ref>\n\nFive months later on 17 October the BR Standard tank no 80079 returned for a rematch on the route, this time she was to haul 4 coaches instead of 6 and she was working the trip with another member of her class no 80098. Once again 80079 slipped to a stand near Pont-y-Pant and 80098, which had been waiting with the second portion of the train at Llanrwst, was detached to bank 80079 up to Blaenau. Thereafter the two engines double-headed the remaining 4 coaches before reforming the train to 8 coaches for the journey back to Llandudno.\n\nIn 2009, after a 10-year gap since the BR Standard tanks had worked up the route, \"The Railway Touring Company\" ran a special under the name \"The Welsh Mountaineer\" from Worcester to Blaenau Ffestiniog with 2 LMS Black 5's working the train from Llandudno Junction for the journey up the route to Blaenau.  The Black 5's chosen for the trip were [[Bert Hitchen]]'s no [[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 5231|45231 The Sherwood Forester]] & Ian Riley's no 45407 The Lancashire Fusilier. The locos' support coaches were left at Llandudno for the journey, leaving them with a load of 9 coaches to take up the line's 1 in 47 gradient. After the success of this trip a number of regular \"Welsh Mountaineer\" trips are run on select Tuesdays from [[Preston]] to Blaenau during the summer months, and today these trips are still running. Unlike the trip with 45231 & 45407 which hauled 9 coaches, steam engines on their own owing to the gradient and curvature of the route are only permitted to haul a max of 6 coaches.\n\nOther than the trip in 2009 which ran from Worcester the majority of trips ran from Preston to Blaenau running via [[Warrington]] and [[Frodsham]] before joining the North Wales Coast Line at [[Chester]] for the journey to Llandudno Junction. From Preston till Chester the engines run in the usual chimney first formation and from Chester after turning on the triangle the engine runs tender first to Llandudno Junction where the tour would reverse direction.\n\n===Storm Gareth damage and reopening special===\n[[File:48151 & 45690 Leander parked up side by side in Blaenau Ffestiniog.jpg|225px|thumb|right|48151 & 45690 Leander parked up side by side after arriving with \"The Conwy Quest\" railtour on Sat 3 August 2019.]]\n[[File:Rheilffordd Dyffryn Conwy headboard.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The headboard that was worn by the [[LMS Stanier Class 8F|LMS 8F]] no [[LMS Stanier Class 8F 8151|48151]] during \"The Conwy Quest\" railtour.]]\nIn March 2019 the route was temporarily closed following multiple washouts along the route inflicted by [[Storm Gareth]]. The damage from the storm had left sections of the line suspended in the air as the embankments had been washed away, and other sections were under water which made the route unsafe for rail traffic.<ref>https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/pictures-show-significant-damage-train-15990628 Photos of damaged line</ref><ref>http://www.conwyvalleyrailway.co.uk/2019/03/22/fascinating-drone-footage-reveals-extensive-damage-on-conwy-valley-line/ Drone footage of damage to Conwy Valley Line</ref> \"[[Transport for Wales|Transport for Wales Rail]]\" services had to cancelled as a result of the damage inflicted and replacement bus services had to run calling at stations along the route while the line was closed to all rail traffic including charter trains.\n\nFollowing repair work, the line from Llandudno Junction to North Llanwrst was re-opened on 24 July 2019; the rest of the route would reopen in August. To mark the full reopening of the line, \"[[Transport for Wales|Transport for Wales Rail]]\" in co-operation with \"[[West Coast Railways]]\" ran a train called \"The Conwy Quest\" which ran from Chester to Blaenau Ffestiniog via Llandudno Junction on Saturday 3 August.<ref>https://tfwrail.wales/the-conwy-quest/ The Conwy Quest Railtour, Sat 3rd Aug 2019</ref>\n\nThe trip was to be worked by two [[steam locomotive]]'s and the two engines chosen for the trip were Chris Beet's [[LMS Jubilee Class]] no [[LMS Jubilee Class 5690 Leander|45690 Leander]] & David Smith's [[LMS Stanier Class 8F|LMS 8F Class]] no [[LMS Stanier Class 8F 8151|48151]].

However, following the closure and removal of a section of the former [[Great Western Railway]] line from [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]], a short section of new railway was built alongside the Ffestiniog Railway Company's narrow gauge line in order to connect the Conwy Valley line with the isolated section of the GWR line, which had been retained to serve the nuclear power station at [[Trawsfynydd]]. Years later a new Blaenau Ffestiniog station was constructed in the centre of the town. Beyond the new station, the line was used only for goods traffic connected with Trawsfynydd, although occasional special passenger trains have been run at times. In recent years, the traffic from Trawsfynydd has ceased completely (the last charter special ran in October 1998) and the line has been disconnected from the Conwy Valley line just outside Blaenau Ffestiniog station.\n\nThere are connections at Llandudno Junction with the [[North Wales Coast Line]] (the main line between [[London]] and [[Holyhead]]) and at Blaenau Ffestiniog with the [[Ffestiniog Railway]] to [[Porthmadog]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{Baughan-Regional-Vol11}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite magazine|title=How green is the valley to Blaenau!|first=John|last=Hunt|magazine=[[RAIL (magazine)|RAIL]]|issue=336|publisher=EMAP Apex Publications|date=29 July \u2013 11 August 1998|pp=24\u201330|issn=0953-4563|oclc=49953699}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.conwyvalleyrailway.co.uk/ Conwy Valley Railway \u2013 official site]\n*[https://www.scenicrailbritain.com/lines/conwy-valley-line// Scenic Rail Britain: Conwy Valley Line]\n\n{{Historical Welsh railway companies}}\n{{Railway lines in Wales}}\n{{Conwy Valley}}\n\n[[Category:Railway lines in Wales]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Gwynedd]]\n[[Category:Transport in Conwy County Borough]]\n[[Category:Community railway lines in Wales]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1879]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2018}}\n{{Short description|Railway line in North Wales}}\n{{Infobox rail line\n|name        = Conwy Valley line\n|image       = Blaenau Ffestiniog railway station 01.jpg\n|image_width = 275px\n|caption     = {{rws|Blaenau Ffestiniog}}, the interchange between Conwy Valley trains and the narrow gauge [[Ffestiniog Railway]]\n|map         = [[File:Conwy Valley Line map de.png|260px]]\n|type        = Heavy Rail\n|locale      = [[Conwy]]<br>[[Gwynedd]]\n|start       = {{rws|Llandudno}}\n|end         = {{rws|Blaenau Ffestiniog}}\n|stations    = 13\n|open        = 1879\n|owner       = [[Network Rail]]\n|operator    = [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]]\n|character   = [[Rural]]\n|stock       = current<br>[[British Rail Class 150|Class 150 \"Sprinter\"]]<br>[[British Rail Class 153|Class 153 \"Super Sprinter\"]]<br>Future<br>[[British Rail Class 197]]\u3001[[British Rail Class 230]]\n|linelength  = {{convert|30.8|mi|km}}\n|tracks      = 2 ({{rws|Llandudno}}\u2013{{rws|Llandudno Junction}})<br>1 ({{rws|Llandudno Junction}}\u2013{{rws|North Llanrwst}})<br>2 (Passing loop at {{rws|North Llanrwst}})<br>1 ({{rws|North Llanrwst}}\u2013{{rws|Blaenau Ffestiniog}})\n|gauge       = {{track gauge|uksg|allk=on}}\n|old_gauge   = \n|speed       = \n}}\n{{Conwy Valley Line}}\nThe '''Conwy Valley line''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Rheilffordd Dyffryn Conwy'') is a [[railway line]] in [[North West Wales|north-west]] [[Wales]]. It runs from [[Llandudno]] via [[Llandudno Junction]] ({{lang-cy|Cyffordd Llandudno}}) to [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]], and was originally part of the [[London and North Western Railway]], being opened in stages to 1879. The primary purpose of the line was to carry slate from the Ffestiniog quarries to a specially built quay at [[Deganwy]] for export by sea. The line also provided goods facilities for the market town of [[Llanrwst]], and via the extensive facilities at Betws-y-Coed on the [[London]] to [[Holyhead]] [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5 turnpike road]] it served many isolated communities in [[Snowdonia]] and also the developing tourist industry.\nAlthough only a little over {{convert|27|mi|km}} between Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog, the journey takes over one hour, largely due to the sinuous and steeply graded nature of the route taken (particularly south of Betws-y-Coed). Most of the stations along the line are treated as [[request stop]]s.\n\n== History ==\nThe first section from Llandudno Junction to Llanrwst (now called [[North Llanrwst railway station|North Llanrwst]]) was built as the [[Conway and Llanrwst Railway]] and opened in 1863. The [[LNWR]] took over in 1863 and opened the extension to Betws-y-Coed in 1868.<ref>Baughan 1980, page 117</ref>\n\nThe next extension was to Blaenau Ffestiniog to access the output of the large [[slate]] quarries there. At first the LNWR proposed a 2' [[narrow gauge]] railway via the steeply graded [[Lledr Valley]] to Blaenau Ffestiniog, this being the 'Bettws & Festiniog Railway'; authorisation was sought in November 1870.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/23680/page/4988|title=Page 4988 &#124; Issue 23680, 18 November 1870 &#124; London Gazette &#124; The Gazette}}</ref><ref>''The Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard'', 26 November 1870</ref> After construction began, it was decided that the extension would be built to [[standard gauge]], allowing through running of trains. Between 1874 and 1879 the [[railway tunnel]] underneath [[Moel Dyrnogydd]] was bored, and in July 1879 a terminus was initially opened by the tunnel entrance. The line was subsequently extended by the best part of a mile to a terminus in the town, which opened 31 March 1881.<ref>Baughan 1980, pages 128-130</ref><ref>''The North Wales Express'', 1 April 1881</ref>\n\nBlaenau Ffestiniog's other [[standard gauge]] railway, the [[Bala and Ffestiniog Railway]], was closed to all traffic in 1961, and a portion was flooded in the creation of the [[Llyn Celyn]] reservoir. A rail connection was desired for the [[nuclear power station]] under construction at [[Trawsfynydd]], and a connecting line was built from Blaenau Ffestiniog North to the site of the demolished Blaenau Ffestiniog Central station for freight use. With the reconstruction of the [[Ffestiniog Railway]], passenger services were relocated to a [[Blaenau Ffestiniog railway station#1982 Central Station|new joint station]] on the site of the old Central station in 1982. Regular freight traffic to [[Trawsfynydd nuclear power station]] ceased in 1995, and the power station is being decommissioned.\n\nThe line's proximity to the [[River Conwy]] at its northern end has led to periodic problems with flooding over the years.  In 2004, 2005 and 2019 floods resulted in prolonged closures whilst the trackbed and embankments were rebuilt - the 2004 floods putting the line out of action from early February until 22 May that year.<ref>[http://www.penmorfa.com/Conwy/floods_Feb_04.html \"Flooding closed the Conwy Valley line for 3 months\"] \u2013 ''The Conway Valley Line'', Penmorfa.com; Retrieved 4 March 2016</ref>\n\nThe line was again closed from 27 December 2015 for seven weeks, after the formation was damaged by floodwater in more than 100 places following heavy rain on Boxing Day.<ref>[http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/conwy-valley-line-1200-tonnes-10865845 Conwy Valley line had 1,200 tonnes of material removed from railway during repair work] Davidson, Tom; ''Daily Post'' article 10 February 2016; Retrieved 4 March 2016</ref>\n\nA further closure occurred between February and April 2017 after [[Storm Doris]], when a tree fell on the track near Pont-y-Pant.

The first attempt up the route on 2 May 1998 ended in disaster as the engine stalled near [[Pont-y-Pant railway station|Pont-y-Pant]] and due to the water supply running low resulted in the train having to be rescued and then returned to [[Llandudno]]. A second attempt the day later, this time with just 4 coaches instead of the previous 6 proved successful, with 80079 becoming the first standard gauge steam locomotive in Blaenau for 31 years.\n\nOn 1 May 1999 [[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0|LMS black 5]] no [[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 5407|45407]] worked \"The Conwy Climber\" tour from Llandudno Junction to Blaenau Ffestiniog, from the lessons learnt with 80079 it was decided that although 45407 was a power class 5 engine (The BR standard being power class 4) 45407 would take a max of 4 coaches up the line while working solo. 45407 first took up 4 coaches to Blaenau without problems and then returned light engine to Llandudno Junction to collect the remaining four coaches, after this the eight coaches were coupled together for the return trip to Llandudno Junction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.penmorfa.com/Conwy/steam1.html|title=Steam to Blaenau|website=www.penmorfa.com}}</ref>\n\nFive months later on 17 October the BR Standard tank no 80079 returned for a rematch on the route, this time she was to haul 4 coaches instead of 6 and she was working the trip with another member of her class no 80098. Once again 80079 slipped to a stand near Pont-y-Pant and 80098, which had been waiting with the second portion of the train at Llanrwst, was detached to bank 80079 up to Blaenau. Thereafter the two engines double-headed the remaining 4 coaches before reforming the train to 8 coaches for the journey back to Llandudno.\n\nIn 2009, after a 10-year gap since the BR Standard tanks had worked up the route, \"The Railway Touring Company\" ran a special under the name \"The Welsh Mountaineer\" from Worcester to Blaenau Ffestiniog with 2 LMS Black 5's working the train from Llandudno Junction for the journey up the route to Blaenau.  The Black 5's chosen for the trip were [[Bert Hitchen]]'s no [[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 5231|45231 The Sherwood Forester]] & Ian Riley's no 45407 The Lancashire Fusilier. The locos' support coaches were left at Llandudno for the journey, leaving them with a load of 9 coaches to take up the line's 1 in 47 gradient. After the success of this trip a number of regular \"Welsh Mountaineer\" trips are run on select Tuesdays from [[Preston]] to Blaenau during the summer months, and today these trips are still running. Unlike the trip with 45231 & 45407 which hauled 9 coaches, steam engines on their own owing to the gradient and curvature of the route are only permitted to haul a max of 6 coaches.\n\nOther than the trip in 2009 which ran from Worcester the majority of trips ran from Preston to Blaenau running via [[Warrington]] and [[Frodsham]] before joining the North Wales Coast Line at [[Chester]] for the journey to Llandudno Junction. From Preston till Chester the engines run in the usual chimney first formation and from Chester after turning on the triangle the engine runs tender first to Llandudno Junction where the tour would reverse direction.\n\n===Storm Gareth damage and reopening special===\n[[File:48151 & 45690 Leander parked up side by side in Blaenau Ffestiniog.jpg|225px|thumb|right|48151 & 45690 Leander parked up side by side after arriving with \"The Conwy Quest\" railtour on Sat 3 August 2019.]]\n[[File:Rheilffordd Dyffryn Conwy headboard.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The headboard that was worn by the [[LMS Stanier Class 8F|LMS 8F]] no [[LMS Stanier Class 8F 8151|48151]] during \"The Conwy Quest\" railtour.]]\nIn March 2019 the route was temporarily closed following multiple washouts along the route inflicted by [[Storm Gareth]].

However, following the closure and removal of a section of the former [[Great Western Railway]] line from [[Bala, Gwynedd|Bala]], a short section of new railway was built alongside the Ffestiniog Railway Company's narrow gauge line in order to connect the Conwy Valley line with the isolated section of the GWR line, which had been retained to serve the nuclear power station at [[Trawsfynydd]]. Years later a new Blaenau Ffestiniog station was constructed in the centre of the town. Beyond the new station, the line was used only for goods traffic connected with Trawsfynydd, although occasional special passenger trains have been run at times. In recent years, the traffic from Trawsfynydd has ceased completely (the last charter special ran in October 1998) and the line has been disconnected from the Conwy Valley line just outside Blaenau Ffestiniog station.\n\nThere are connections at Llandudno Junction with the [[North Wales Coast Line]] (the main line between [[London]] and [[Holyhead]]) and at Blaenau Ffestiniog with the [[Ffestiniog Railway]] to [[Porthmadog]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{Baughan-Regional-Vol11}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite magazine|title=How green is the valley to Blaenau!|first=John|last=Hunt|magazine=[[RAIL (magazine)|RAIL]]|issue=336|publisher=EMAP Apex Publications|date=29 July \u2013 11 August 1998|pp=24\u201330|issn=0953-4563|oclc=49953699}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://www.conwyvalleyrailway.co.uk/ Conwy Valley Railway \u2013 official site]\n*[https://www.scenicrailbritain.com/lines/conwy-valley-line// Scenic Rail Britain: Conwy Valley Line]\n\n{{Historical Welsh railway companies}}\n{{Railway lines in Wales}}\n{{Conwy Valley}}\n\n[[Category:Railway lines in Wales]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Gwynedd]]\n[[Category:Transport in Conwy County Borough]]\n[[Category:Community railway lines in Wales]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1879]]\n", "name_user": "Gim67gb", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eModern services", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conwy_Valley_line"}

The remnants of the Italian forces in the region surrendered after the [[Battle of Gondar]] in November 1941, except for small groups that fought a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war in Ethiopia]] against the British until the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] in September 1943, which ended the war between Italy and the Allies. The East African campaign was the first Allied strategic victory in the war; few Italian forces escaped the region to be used in other campaigns and the Italian defeat greatly eased the flow of supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt.

In July 1939, Wavell devised a strategy to defend and then dominate the Mediterranean as a base to attack Germany, through eastern and south-east Europe. The conquest of Italian East Africa came second only to the defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal and in August Wavell ordered plans to be made quickly to gain control of the Red Sea. Wavell specified a concept of offensive operations from Djibouti to Harar and then Addis Ababa or Kassala to Asmara then Massawa, preferably on both lines simultaneously. Wavell reconnoitred East Africa in January 1940 and the theatre was formally added to his responsibilities; he expected that the Somalilands could be defended with minor reinforcement. If Italy joined the war Ethiopia would be invaded as soon as there were sufficient troops; Wavell also co-ordinated plans with South Africa in March.

On the northern front, Platt was to attack Gallabat and vicinity and on the southern front, Cunningham was to advance northwards from Kenya, through Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia. At the start of November 1940, Cunningham had taken over the East African Force from Major-General D. P. Dickinson, who was in poor health. While Platt advanced from the north and Cunningham from the south, Wavell planned for a third force to be landed in British Somaliland by amphibious assault to re-take the colony, prior to advancing into Ethiopia; the three forces were to rendezvous at Addis Ababa. The conquest of the AOI would remove the land threat to supplies and reinforcements coming from Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and British East Africa via the Suez Canal for the [[Western Desert campaign]] and re-open the land route from [[Cape Town]] to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=168\u2013173}}\n\n====East Africa Force====\n[[File:Africa (Eastern region).png|thumb|{{centre|General definition of East Africa (2005)}}]]\nIn 1940, [[East Africa Force]] (Major-General D.

The suggestion was accepted by the British government but because of the concessions granted to the Vichy regime in Syria, proposals were made to invade the colony instead. In June, Nouailhetas was given an ultimatum, the blockade was tightened and the Italian garrison at Assab was defeated by an operation from Aden. For six months, Nouailhetas remained willing to grant concessions over the port and railway but would not tolerate Free French interference. In October the blockade was reviewed but the beginning of the war with Japan in December, led to all but two blockade ships being withdrawn.

In December 1940, Clarke constructed a model operation for Italian military intelligence to discover and set up administration offices at Aden. Clarke arranged for the Italian defences around Berbera to be softened up by air and sea raids from Aden and distributed maps and pamphlets on the climate, geography and population of British Somaliland; \"Sibs\" (''sibilare'', hisses or whistles), were circulated among civilians in Egypt. Bogus information was planted on the Japanese consul at Port Said and indiscreet wireless messages were transmitted. The operation began on 19 December 1940 and was to mature early in January 1941; the deception was a success. The plot backfired when the Italians began to evacuate British Somaliland instead of sending reinforcements. Troops were sent north into Eritrea, where the real attack was coming, instead of to the east.

On 15 March, after several days of bombing, the 4th Indian Division attacked on the north and west side of the road to capture ground on the left flank, ready for the 5th Indian Division to attack on the east side.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=439}}\n\nThe Indians met a determined defence and made limited progress but during the night the 5th Indian Division captured Fort Dologorodoc, {{cvt|1475|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the valley.

Afmadu was captured on 11 February and three days later, the port of Kismayu the first objective was captured. North of Kismayu and beyond the river was the main Italian position at Jelib.

The division pushed up the Juba River in Italian Somaliland towards the Ethiopian border town of [[Dolo, Ethiopia|Dolo]]. After a pause, caused by the lack of equipment to sweep Mogadishu harbour of British magnetic mines dropped earlier, the 11th (African) Division began a fighting pursuit of the retreating Italian forces north from Mogadishu on 1 March. The division pursued the Italians towards the Ogaden Plateau. By 17 March, the 11th (African) Division completed a 17-day dash along the Italian ''Strada Imperiale'' (Imperial Road) from Mogadishu to [[Jijiga]] in the [[Somali region]] of Ethiopia.

The remaining Italian troops were no threat to Sudan or Eritrea but could trouble the British hold on the AOI. The 1st South African Division was needed in Egypt and Cunningham was ordered to send it north to capture the main road to Massawa and Port Sudan so the ports could be used for embarkation. Amba Alagi obstructed the road north and the 5th Indian Division advanced from southwards as the South Africans moved northwards in a pincer movement.

Bolla disclosed the positions of three minefields in the approaches to the harbour and said that the channel to the east, north of Ras Fatma, was clear. The 3/15th Punjabis took {{nowrap|547 prisoners}} along with the two generals and {{nowrap|35 Germans.}} On 13 June, the Indian trawler ''Parvati'' struck a magnetic mine near Assab and became the last naval casualty of the campaign.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=64\u201365, 58\u201359}}\n\n===Kulkaber (Culqualber)===\n{{main article|Battle of Culqualber|Siege of Sa\u00efo}}\n\n[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|{{centre|{{lang|fr|[[Force Publique]]}} soldiers leaving the Congo to participate in the East African campaign}}]]\nA force under General [[Pietro Gazzera]], the Governor of Galla-Sidama and the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI was faced with a growing irregular force of ''Arbegnoch'' and many local units melted away. On 21 June 1941, Gazzera abandoned Jimma and about {{nowrap|15,000 men}} surrendered. On 3 July, the Italians were cut off by the [[Free Belgian forces]] (Major-General [[Auguste Gilliaert]]) who had defeated the Italians at [[Asosa]] and [[Dembidolo|Sa\u00efo]].{{sfn|Weller|2010|p=117}} On 6 July, Gazzera and {{nowrap|2,944 Italian,}} {{nowrap|1,535 African}} and {{nowrap|2,000 ''bande''}} formally surrendered; the 79th Colonial Battalion changed sides and was renamed the 79th Foot as did a company of banda as the Wollo Banda.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=309\u2013314}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=217\u2013219}}\n\nWolchefit Pass was a position whose control was needed to launch the final attack on Gondar, was defended by a garrison of about {{nowrap|4,000 men}} (Colonel Mario Gonella) in localities distributed in depth for about {{cvt|3|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The stronghold had been besieged by irregular Ethiopian forces, led by Major B. J. Ringrose, since May and on 5 May the Italians retreated from Amba Giorgis. The besieging force was later augmented by the arrival of the 3/14th Punjab Battalion from the Indian Army and part of the 12th African Division. Several attacks, counter-attacks and sorties were launched between May and August 1941. On 28 September 1941, after losing {{nowrap|950 casualties}} and running out of provisions, Gonella surrendered with {{nowrap|1,629 Italian}} and {{nowrap|1,450 Ethiopian}} soldiers to the 25th East African Brigade (Brigadier W. A. L. James). Work began to repair the road to Gondar during the autumn rains.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=314\u2013317}}\n\n===Battle of Gondar===\n{{Main article|Battle of Gondar}}\nGondar, the capital of [[Begemder]] Province in north-west Ethiopia, was about {{cvt|120|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Amba Alagi. After Gazzera surrendered, Nasi, the acting Governor of Amhara, became the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI. At Gondar, Nasi faced the British and a growing number of Ethiopian Patriots but held out for almost seven months. While the ''Regia Aeronautica'' in East Africa had been worn down quickly by attrition, the Italian pilots fought on to the end.{{sfn|Mollo|McGregor|Turner|1981|p=91}} After the death of his commander Tenente Malavolti on 31 October, Sergente Giuseppe Mottet became the last Italian fighter pilot in the AOI and on 20 November, flew the last ''Regia Aeronautica'' sortie, a ground-attack operation in the last CR.42 (MM4033) against British artillery positions at Culqualber. Mottet fired one burst and killed Lieutenant-Colonel Ormsby, the CRA.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=319}} On landing, Mottet destroyed the CR.42, joined the Italian troops and fought on until the surrender.{{sfn|Gustavsson|2014|nopp=y}} On 27 November, Nasi surrendered with {{nowrap|10,000 Italian}} and {{nowrap|12,000 African}} troops, British losses being {{nowrap|32 men}} killed, {{nowrap|182 wounded,}} six men missing and {{nowrap|15 aircraft}} shot down since 7 April.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=321}} In 1949, Maravigna recorded Italian casualties of {{nowrap|4,000 killed}} and {{nowrap|8,400 sick}} and wounded.{{sfn|Maravigna|1949|p=191}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\nIn 2016, A. Stewart wrote that due to the British defeats in Greece and Crete the East African campaign has been overshadowed, although it was the first victory for the Allies in the Second World War.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=ix}} In 2004, the American historian [[Douglas Porch]] wrote that the \"pearl of the fascist regime\" had lasted only five years, the performance of the Italian army exceeded that in North Africa but there had still been a high ratio of prisoners to casualties. Mass defections by local forces suggested that Fascist imperialism had made little impression on the East African public. The Italian navy at Massawa had shown a \"stunning\" lack of energy and failed to challenge British access to Mombasa and Port Sudan or the landing at Berbera. The army had failed to exploit British supply difficulties and had left stores behind for the British to use. The British had withdrawn the 4th Indian Division and RAF squadrons for North Africa in February 1941, despite the Italian forces remaining at Amba Alagi, which from 20 April to 15 May, were steadily pressed back until they surrendered on 19 May.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nEthiopia, the Somalilands and Eritrea had been conquered by the British and the end of organised Italian resistance, led to the East Africa Force and Air Headquarters East Africa being reduced by the transfer of the South African and the two Indian divisions to Egypt, along with three fighter, three bomber and a reconnaissance squadron, followed by two more in late May. The 11th and 12th (African) divisions remained, supported by six RAF and SAAF squadrons.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=449\u2013450}} The Italians at Galla-Sidom and Gondar were mopped up and the final surrender was taken by the Belgian contingent from Congo. Mussolini blamed the disaster on the \"deficiency of the Italian race\" but the Fascist regime survived and the British victory had little influence on Japanese strategy in the Far East.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}} With the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden cleared of [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces, Roosevelt declared that the areas were no longer combat zones on 11 April 1941. Ships of the United States were able to proceed to the Suez Canal, which helped to relieve the strain on British shipping resources.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===Signals intelligence===\nThe Italians had replaced their ciphers in the AOI in November 1940 but by the end of the month, the GC&CS in England and the Cipher Bureau Middle East (CBME) in Cairo had broken the new {{lang|it|Regio Esercito}} and {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} ciphers. By 1941, sufficient low-grade ciphers had been broken to reveal the Italian order of battle and the supply situation, by the time that the British offensive began on 19 January 1941. Italian dependence on wireless communication, using frequencies on which it was easy for the British to eavesdrop, led to a flood of information, from the daily report from the Viceroy, to the operational plans of the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} and {{lang|it|Regia Esercito}} on the retreat from Keren.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}} On occasion, British commanders had messages before the recipients and it was reported later by the Deputy Director Military Intelligence in Cairo, that\n\n{{quote|...he could not believe that any army commander in the field had [ever] been better served by his intelligence....|DDMI (ME){{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}}}}\n\n===Casualties===\nOn 16 April 1941, the authorities in the AOI signalled to Rome that {{nowrap|426 officers}} had been killed, {{nowrap|703 wounded}} and {{nowrap|315 captured,}} during military operations before the surrender. Casualties among NCOs and other ranks were {{nowrap|4,785 killed,}} {{nowrap|6,244 wounded}} and {{nowrap|15,871 captured}} (inclusive). Casualties among locally recruited soldiers were {{nowrap|11,755 dead,}} {{nowrap|18,151 wounded}} and {{nowrap|3,076 captured}} before the surrender; the {{lang|it|Truppi coloniale}} figures did not include forces on the Giuba and eastern fronts.{{sfn|Rovighi|1988|p=476}} By May 1941, of the {{circa|350,000}} men in the AOI available for military operations in June 1940, only the {{circa|80,000 men}} in the garrisons near Gondar and the seven colonial divisions in Galla-Sidamo remained to be taken prisoner.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=423, 447}}{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=303}} More casualties among the Italian and colonial troops occurred after April 1941, in the operations against Amba Alagi (3,500 casualties), Kulkaber/Culqualber (1,003 killed and 804 wounded) and Gondar (4,000 killed and 8,400 sick and wounded).{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=187}}{{sfn|Maravigna|1949|p=191}} In 1954, I. S. O. Playfair, the British official historian, recorded that from June 1940 to May 1941, the East African Force had {{nowrap|1,154 battle}} casualties and {{nowrap|74,550 sickness}} or accident cases, including {{nowrap|10,000 dysentery}} and {{nowrap|10,000 malaria}} cases of which {{nowrap|744 were}} fatal. The RAF lost {{nowrap|138 aircraft}} and the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} {{nowrap|250 of}} the {{nowrap|325 aeroplanes}} in the AOI when the war began and the {{nowrap|75 flown}} to the region during the campaign. The Belgian {{lang|fr|[[Force Publique]]}} suffered {{nowrap|462 fatalities}} from all causes.{{sfn|BIC|1941|p=22}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n====Guerrilla warfare====\n\n{{main article|Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia}}\n\n[[File:Cartolina Ritorneremo.jpg|thumb|{{centre|1941 propaganda poster calling on Italians to avenge the defeat in East Africa}}]]\nUntil 27 November 1941, two African divisions mopped up pockets of resistance until the last formed Italian units surrendered.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=183}} From the end of 1941 to September 1943, {{circa|7,000}} men in scattered Italian units fought a guerrilla war from the deserts of Eritrea and Somalia to the forests and mountains of Ethiopia.{{sfn|Cernuschi|1994|pp=5, 36}} They supposedly did so in the hope of holding out until the Germans and Italians in Egypt (or even possibly the Japanese in India) intervened. [[Amedeo Guillet]] was one of the Italian officers who fought with the Italian guerrillas in Ethiopia. Another notable guerrilla leader was [[Hamid Idris Awate]], a father of the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]].{{sfn|Roselli|2007|p=58}}\n\nOther Italian officers were Captain [[Francesco De Martini]] in Eritrea, Colonel Calderari in western Ethiopia/Somalia, Colonel Di Marco in Ogaden/British Somaliland \"blackshirt centurion\" De Varda in Somalia/Ethiopia and Major Lucchetti in Ethiopia. Civilians participated and in August 1942, forces led by Dr. [[Rosa Dainelli]] sabotaged the main British ammunition dump in Addis Ababa.{{sfn|Roselli|2007|p=58}} Hostilities in East Africa officially ceased on 9 September 1943, when the Italian government signed the [[Armistice with Italy]]. Some three thousand Italian soldiers continued the guerrilla war until October 1943, as they were unaware of the agreement when Italy surrendered to the Allies.{{sfn|Cernuschi|1994|p=74}}\n\n====Post-war====\nIn January 1942, with the final official surrender of the Italians, the British, under American pressure, signed an interim [[Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement]] with Selassie, acknowledging Ethiopian sovereignty. [[Makonnen Endelkachew]] was named as Prime Minister and on 19 December 1944, the final Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement was signed. Eritrea was placed under British military administration for the duration and in 1950, it became part of Ethiopia. After 1945, Britain controlled both Somalilands, as [[protectorate]]s. In November 1949, during the [[Potsdam Conference]], the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland under close supervision, on condition that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.{{sfn|Zolberg|Aguayo|Suhrke|1992|p=106}} British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the [[State of Somaliland]], the [[Trust Territory of Somalia]] (ex-Italian Somaliland) became independent on 1 July 1960 and the territories united as the [[Somali Republic]].{{sfn|NEB|2002|p=835}}\n\n==Victoria Cross==\nThe following is a list of recipients of the Victoria Cross during this campaign:\n* [[Eric Charles Twelves Wilson]] (captain, Somaliland Camel Corps) \u2013 Received during the Italian invasion of British Somaliland.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=177}}\n* [[Premindra Singh Bhagat]] (second lieutenant, Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners) \u2013 Received during fighting on the Northern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=401}}\n* [[Richhpal Ram]] (Subedar in 6th Rajputana Rifles) \u2013 Received posthumously during fighting on the Northern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=435}}\n* [[Nigel Leakey]] (sergeant in the 1/6 Battalion King's African Rifles and cousin of the paleoanthropologist [[Louis Leakey]]) \u2013 Received posthumously during fighting on the Southern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=308}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia]]\n* [[Italian Empire]]\n* [[Colonial heads of Italian East Africa]]\n* [[Military history of Ethiopia]]\n* [[Military production during World War II]]\n* [[Military history of Italy during World War II]]\n* [[North African campaign]]\n* [[Western Desert campaign]]\n* [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]]\n* [[West Africa campaign (World War II)|West Africa campaign]]\n* [[Battle of Madagascar]]\n* [[German Motorized Company]]\n* [[MVSN Colonial Militia]]\n* [[South African Irish Regiment]]\n* [[81st (West Africa) Division]]\n* [[82nd (West Africa) Division]]\n* [[Royal Corps of Colonial Troops]]\n* [[Dubats]]\n* [[Zaptie]]\n* [[Armoured car regiment]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Barker|1971}}\n|first=A.

The remnants of the Italian forces in the region surrendered after the [[Battle of Gondar]] in November 1941, except for small groups that fought a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war in Ethiopia]] against the British until the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] in September 1943, which ended the war between Italy and the Allies. The East African campaign was the first Allied strategic victory in the war; few Italian forces escaped the region to be used in other campaigns and the Italian defeat greatly eased the flow of supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt.

When the Mediterranean route was closed to Allied merchant ships in April 1940, the Italian naval bases in East Africa were well placed for attacks on convoys en route to Suez up the east coast of Africa and through the Red Sea.

In July 1939, Wavell devised a strategy to defend and then dominate the Mediterranean as a base to attack Germany, through eastern and south-east Europe. The conquest of Italian East Africa came second only to the defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal and in August Wavell ordered plans to be made quickly to gain control of the Red Sea. Wavell specified a concept of offensive operations from Djibouti to Harar and then Addis Ababa or Kassala to Asmara then Massawa, preferably on both lines simultaneously. Wavell reconnoitred East Africa in January 1940 and the theatre was formally added to his responsibilities; he expected that the Somalilands could be defended with minor reinforcement. If Italy joined the war Ethiopia would be invaded as soon as there were sufficient troops; Wavell also co-ordinated plans with South Africa in March. On 1 May 1940, Wavell ordered British Troops Egypt to discreetly mobilise for military operations in western Egypt but after the June {{lang|fr|debacle}} in France, Wavell had to follow a defensive strategy.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=169\u2013170, 67}}\n\nAfter Italian operations in Sudan at Kassala and Gallabat in June, Churchill blamed Wavell for a \"static policy\".

On the northern front, Platt was to attack Gallabat and vicinity and on the southern front, Cunningham was to advance northwards from Kenya, through Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia. At the start of November 1940, Cunningham had taken over the East African Force from Major-General D. P. Dickinson, who was in poor health. While Platt advanced from the north and Cunningham from the south, Wavell planned for a third force to be landed in British Somaliland by amphibious assault to re-take the colony, prior to advancing into Ethiopia; the three forces were to rendezvous at Addis Ababa. The conquest of the AOI would remove the land threat to supplies and reinforcements coming from Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and British East Africa via the Suez Canal for the [[Western Desert campaign]] and re-open the land route from [[Cape Town]] to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=168\u2013173}}\n\n====East Africa Force====\n[[File:Africa (Eastern region).png|thumb|{{centre|General definition of East Africa (2005)}}]]\nIn 1940, [[East Africa Force]] (Major-General D.

In March 1941, the British enforcement of a strict contraband regime to prevent supplies being passed on to the Italians, lost its point after the conquest of the AOI. The British changed policy, with encouragement from the Free French, to \"rally French Somaliland to the Allied cause without bloodshed\".

Wavell preferred to let the propaganda continue and provided a small amount of supplies under strict control. When the policy had no effect, Wavell suggested negotiations with the Vichy governor Louis Nouailhetas, to use the port and railway. The suggestion was accepted by the British government but because of the concessions granted to the Vichy regime in Syria, proposals were made to invade the colony instead. In June, Nouailhetas was given an ultimatum, the blockade was tightened and the Italian garrison at Assab was defeated by an operation from Aden. For six months, Nouailhetas remained willing to grant concessions over the port and railway but would not tolerate Free French interference. In October the blockade was reviewed but the beginning of the war with Japan in December, led to all but two blockade ships being withdrawn. On 2 January 1942, the Vichy government offered the use of the port and railway, subject to the lifting of the blockade but the British refused and ended the blockade unilaterally in March.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=323\u2013324}}\n\n==Northern front, 1941==\n===Operation Camilla===\n[[Operation Camilla]] was a deception concocted by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Dudley Clarke]], to deceive the Italians, making them believe that the British planned to re-conquer British Somaliland with the 4th and 5th Indian divisions, transferred from Egypt to [[Al Qadarif|Gedaref]] and Port Sudan. In December 1940, Clarke constructed a model operation for Italian military intelligence to discover and set up administration offices at Aden. Clarke arranged for the Italian defences around Berbera to be softened up by air and sea raids from Aden and distributed maps and pamphlets on the climate, geography and population of British Somaliland; \"Sibs\" (''sibilare'', hisses or whistles), were circulated among civilians in Egypt. Bogus information was planted on the Japanese consul at Port Said and indiscreet wireless messages were transmitted. The operation began on 19 December 1940 and was to mature early in January 1941; the deception was a success.

Bolla disclosed the positions of three minefields in the approaches to the harbour and said that the channel to the east, north of Ras Fatma, was clear. The 3/15th Punjabis took {{nowrap|547 prisoners}} along with the two generals and {{nowrap|35 Germans.}} On 13 June, the Indian trawler ''Parvati'' struck a magnetic mine near Assab and became the last naval casualty of the campaign.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=64\u201365, 58\u201359}}\n\n===Kulkaber (Culqualber)===\n{{main article|Battle of Culqualber|Siege of Sa\u00efo}}\n\n[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|{{centre|{{lang|fr|[[Force Publique]]}} soldiers leaving the Congo to participate in the East African campaign}}]]\nA force under General [[Pietro Gazzera]], the Governor of Galla-Sidama and the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI was faced with a growing irregular force of ''Arbegnoch'' and many local units melted away. On 21 June 1941, Gazzera abandoned Jimma and about {{nowrap|15,000 men}} surrendered. On 3 July, the Italians were cut off by the [[Free Belgian forces]] (Major-General [[Auguste Gilliaert]]) who had defeated the Italians at [[Asosa]] and [[Dembidolo|Sa\u00efo]].{{sfn|Weller|2010|p=117}} On 6 July, Gazzera and {{nowrap|2,944 Italian,}} {{nowrap|1,535 African}} and {{nowrap|2,000 ''bande''}} formally surrendered; the 79th Colonial Battalion changed sides and was renamed the 79th Foot as did a company of banda as the Wollo Banda.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=309\u2013314}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=217\u2013219}}\n\nWolchefit Pass was a position whose control was needed to launch the final attack on Gondar, was defended by a garrison of about {{nowrap|4,000 men}} (Colonel Mario Gonella) in localities distributed in depth for about {{cvt|3|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The stronghold had been besieged by irregular Ethiopian forces, led by Major B. J. Ringrose, since May and on 5 May the Italians retreated from Amba Giorgis. The besieging force was later augmented by the arrival of the 3/14th Punjab Battalion from the Indian Army and part of the 12th African Division. Several attacks, counter-attacks and sorties were launched between May and August 1941. On 28 September 1941, after losing {{nowrap|950 casualties}} and running out of provisions, Gonella surrendered with {{nowrap|1,629 Italian}} and {{nowrap|1,450 Ethiopian}} soldiers to the 25th East African Brigade (Brigadier W.

After Gazzera surrendered, Nasi, the acting Governor of Amhara, became the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI. At Gondar, Nasi faced the British and a growing number of Ethiopian Patriots but held out for almost seven months. While the ''Regia Aeronautica'' in East Africa had been worn down quickly by attrition, the Italian pilots fought on to the end.{{sfn|Mollo|McGregor|Turner|1981|p=91}} After the death of his commander Tenente Malavolti on 31 October, Sergente Giuseppe Mottet became the last Italian fighter pilot in the AOI and on 20 November, flew the last ''Regia Aeronautica'' sortie, a ground-attack operation in the last CR.42 (MM4033) against British artillery positions at Culqualber. Mottet fired one burst and killed Lieutenant-Colonel Ormsby, the CRA.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=319}} On landing, Mottet destroyed the CR.42, joined the Italian troops and fought on until the surrender.{{sfn|Gustavsson|2014|nopp=y}} On 27 November, Nasi surrendered with {{nowrap|10,000 Italian}} and {{nowrap|12,000 African}} troops, British losses being {{nowrap|32 men}} killed, {{nowrap|182 wounded,}} six men missing and {{nowrap|15 aircraft}} shot down since 7 April.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=321}} In 1949, Maravigna recorded Italian casualties of {{nowrap|4,000 killed}} and {{nowrap|8,400 sick}} and wounded.{{sfn|Maravigna|1949|p=191}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\nIn 2016, A. Stewart wrote that due to the British defeats in Greece and Crete the East African campaign has been overshadowed, although it was the first victory for the Allies in the Second World War.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=ix}} In 2004, the American historian [[Douglas Porch]] wrote that the \"pearl of the fascist regime\" had lasted only five years, the performance of the Italian army exceeded that in North Africa but there had still been a high ratio of prisoners to casualties. Mass defections by local forces suggested that Fascist imperialism had made little impression on the East African public. The Italian navy at Massawa had shown a \"stunning\" lack of energy and failed to challenge British access to Mombasa and Port Sudan or the landing at Berbera. The army had failed to exploit British supply difficulties and had left stores behind for the British to use. The British had withdrawn the 4th Indian Division and RAF squadrons for North Africa in February 1941, despite the Italian forces remaining at Amba Alagi, which from 20 April to 15 May, were steadily pressed back until they surrendered on 19 May.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nEthiopia, the Somalilands and Eritrea had been conquered by the British and the end of organised Italian resistance, led to the East Africa Force and Air Headquarters East Africa being reduced by the transfer of the South African and the two Indian divisions to Egypt, along with three fighter, three bomber and a reconnaissance squadron, followed by two more in late May. The 11th and 12th (African) divisions remained, supported by six RAF and SAAF squadrons.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|pp=449\u2013450}} The Italians at Galla-Sidom and Gondar were mopped up and the final surrender was taken by the Belgian contingent from Congo. Mussolini blamed the disaster on the \"deficiency of the Italian race\" but the Fascist regime survived and the British victory had little influence on Japanese strategy in the Far East.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}} With the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden cleared of [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces, Roosevelt declared that the areas were no longer combat zones on 11 April 1941. Ships of the United States were able to proceed to the Suez Canal, which helped to relieve the strain on British shipping resources.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===Signals intelligence===\nThe Italians had replaced their ciphers in the AOI in November 1940 but by the end of the month, the GC&CS in England and the Cipher Bureau Middle East (CBME) in Cairo had broken the new {{lang|it|Regio Esercito}} and {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} ciphers. By 1941, sufficient low-grade ciphers had been broken to reveal the Italian order of battle and the supply situation, by the time that the British offensive began on 19 January 1941. Italian dependence on wireless communication, using frequencies on which it was easy for the British to eavesdrop, led to a flood of information, from the daily report from the Viceroy, to the operational plans of the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} and {{lang|it|Regia Esercito}} on the retreat from Keren.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}} On occasion, British commanders had messages before the recipients and it was reported later by the Deputy Director Military Intelligence in Cairo, that\n\n{{quote|...he could not believe that any army commander in the field had [ever] been better served by his intelligence....|DDMI (ME){{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}}}}\n\n===Casualties===\nOn 16 April 1941, the authorities in the AOI signalled to Rome that {{nowrap|426 officers}} had been killed, {{nowrap|703 wounded}} and {{nowrap|315 captured,}} during military operations before the surrender.

[[Makonnen Endelkachew]] was named as Prime Minister and on 19 December 1944, the final Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement was signed. Eritrea was placed under British military administration for the duration and in 1950, it became part of Ethiopia. After 1945, Britain controlled both Somalilands, as [[protectorate]]s.

This was a result after Jio complained to TRAI and [[Department of Telecom]] (DoT) about other operators not honoring their commercial agreements to let Jio use their network resources. The company further added that the operators are trying to sabotage its entry into the telecom scene. However, DoT dismissed the request and directed TRAI to help settle the dispute amicably. Moreover, the [[Cellular Operators Association of India]] (COAI) requested TRAI to include all the operators in the discussion instead of the three.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/truce-in-sight-trai-summons-airtel-vodafone-and-idea-to-settle-fight-with-reliance-jio/articleshow/54170767.cms|title=Truce in sight?

So, we are waiting. These are all great companies. They have their own reputations to protect.

This was a result after Jio complained to TRAI and [[Department of Telecom]] (DoT) about other operators not honoring their commercial agreements to let Jio use their network resources. The company further added that the operators are trying to sabotage its entry into the telecom scene. However, DoT dismissed the request and directed TRAI to help settle the dispute amicably.

So, we are waiting. These are all great companies. They have their own reputations to protect.
