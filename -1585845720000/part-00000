The first lineup of the band also featured Lazar Male\u0161evi\u0107 (bass guitar) and Sini\u0161a Lu\u010di\u0107 (drums). In the beginning, the band had several lineup changes, before the first consistent lineup was formed. It featured Mumin, Medan, Vladimir Jovanov (also known as Menadner Protector, a former Necrophobic member, bass guitar), Mario Kalin (guitar), and Robert Radi\u0107 (a former [[Kontraritam]], [[La Strada (band)|La Strada]] and [[Obojeni Program]] member, drums).\n\nInitially, the band was [[punk blues]]-oriented. As the band's songs featured [[English language]] lyrics, and as their first releases were released through [[independent record label]]s, the band initially did not manage to break through mainstream media. They released their debut [[audio cassette]] entitled ''There no Centuries'' in 1988 through Mr Montenegro Records. In 1993, they released their second album ''Everclassic'' through Music Yuser,<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Love-Hunters-Everclassic/release/1185055 ''Everclassic'' at Discogs]</ref> and, in 1995, ''Oh, Evolution'' through the same record label. After these three releases the band gained a cult status in Novi Sad.\n\nDuring the spring of 1996 the band released the album ''Donau'' (through Music Yuser) which featured almost all songs from the previous two albums.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Love-Hunters-Donau/release/1083619 ''Donau'' at Discogs]</ref> At the same time, the album ''Total Rickvertzzo'', which featured demo recordings made during the 1987-1991 period, was released.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Love-Hunters-Total-Rickverzzo/release/1033859 ''Total Rickvertzzo'' at Discogs]</ref> The various artists live album ''\u010cetiri godine na Golom otoku'' (trans.

As theatrical booths, circus acts, and menageries were once a common part of European fairs, it is likely that the roots of Polari/Parlyaree lie in the period before both theatre and circus became independent of the fairgrounds. The Parlyaree spoken on fairgrounds tends to borrow much more from Romany, as well as other languages and [[argot]]s spoken by travelling people, such as [[cant (language)|cant]] and [[backslang]].\n\n[[Henry Mayhew]] gave a verbatim account of Polari as part of an interview with a [[Punch and Judy]] showman in the 1850s.

There was some interchange between the two.\n\n==Usage==\nSince the 19th century, Polari was used in London fishmarkets, the theatre, fairgrounds, and circuses, hence the many borrowings from [[Romani language|Romani]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=It's not unusual : a history of lesbian and gay Britain in the twentieth century|last=1957-|first=Jivani, Alkarim|isbn=0253333482|location=Bloomington|oclc=37115577|date = January 1997}}</ref> As many homosexual men worked in theatrical entertainment it was also used among the gay subculture, at a time when homosexual activity was illegal, to disguise homosexuals from hostile outsiders and [[undercover police]]men. It was also used extensively in the British [[Merchant navy|Merchant Navy]], where many gay men joined [[ocean liner]]s and [[cruise ships]] as waiters, stewards, and entertainers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/visit/floor-plan/life-at-sea/gaylife/ |title=Gay men in the Merchant Marine |publisher=[[Liverpool Maritime Museum]] |accessdate=9 May 2018 }}</ref>\n\n[[William Shakespeare]] used the term ''bona'' (good, attractive) in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', part of the expression ''bona roba'' (a lady wearing an attractive outfit).<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/dec/10/life1.lifemagazine3 |author=Beverley D'Silva |work=[[The Observer]] |title=Mind your language |date=10 December 2000 |accessdate=9 May 2018 }}</ref> However, \"there's little written evidence of Polari before the 1890s,\" according to [[Peter Gilliver]], associate editor of the ''Oxford English Dictionary''. The dictionary's entry for rozzer (policeman), for example, includes this quote from an 1893 book (P. H. Emerson's ''Signor Lippo \u2013 Burnt Cork Artiste''):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://word-ancestry.livejournal.com/71450.html#/71450.html|title=Historical Origins of English Words and Phrases|website=[[Live Journal]]|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> \"If the rozzers was to see him in bona clobber they'd take him for a gun.\" (If the police were to see him dressed in this fine manner, they would know that he is a thief).<ref name=guardian/>\n\nThe almost identical '''Parlyaree''' has been spoken in fairgrounds since at least the 17th century<ref>Partridge, Eric (1937) ''Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English''</ref> and continues to be used by show travellers in England and Scotland. As theatrical booths, circus acts, and menageries were once a common part of European fairs, it is likely that the roots of Polari/Parlyaree lie in the period before both theatre and circus became independent of the fairgrounds. The Parlyaree spoken on fairgrounds tends to borrow much more from Romany, as well as other languages and [[argot]]s spoken by travelling people, such as [[cant (language)|cant]] and [[backslang]].\n\n[[Henry Mayhew]] gave a verbatim account of Polari as part of an interview with a [[Punch and Judy]] showman in the 1850s. The discussion he recorded references the arrival of Punch in England, crediting these early shows to a performer from Italy called Porcini ([[John Payne Collier]]'s account calls him Porchini).<ref>''Punch and Judy''. [[John Payne Collier]]; with Illustrations by George Cruickshank. London: Thomas Hailes Lacey, 1859.</ref> Mayhew provides the following:\n<blockquote>\n''Punch Talk''<br />\n\"'{{lang|pld|Bona Parle}}' means language; name of patter. '{{lang|pld|Yeute munjare}}' \u2013 no food. '{{lang|pld|Yeute lente}}' \u2013 no bed. '{{lang|pld|Yeute bivare}}' \u2013 no drink.

This is better than the costers' talk, because that ain't no slang and all, and this is a broken Italian, and much higher than the costers' lingo. We know what o'clock it is, besides.\"<ref name=\"Mayhew\"/></blockquote>\nThere are additional accounts of particular words that relate to puppet performance: \"'{{lang|pld|Slumarys}}' \u2013 figures, frame, scenes, properties. '{{lang|pld|Slum}}' \u2013 call, or unknown tongue\"<ref name=\"Mayhew\"/> (\"unknown\" is a reference to the \"[[swazzle]]\", a voice modifier used by Punch performers, the structure of which was a longstanding trade secret).\n\n==Decline in use==\nPolari had begun to fall into disuse amongst the gay subculture by the late 1960s. The popularity of the [[Julian and Sandy]], played by [[Hugh Paddick]] and [[Kenneth Williams]], (introduced in the radio programme ''[[Round the Horne]]'' in the 1960s) ensured that some of this secret language became public knowledge.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/17/gayrights.comment|title=Colin Richardson: Polari, the gay slang, is being revived.|first=Colin|last=Richardson|date=17 January 2005|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref> The need for a secret subculture code declined with the partial decriminalization of adult homosexual acts in England and Wales under the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Bona Togs shop Jersey.jpg|thumb|Bona Togs clothes shop in [[Saint Helier]], [[Jersey]]]]\n\nPolari was popularised in the 1960s on the popular BBC radio show ''[[Round the Horne]]'' starring [[Kenneth Horne]].

Following the mixed reception of his previous two albums, Snoop began to work again with [[Dr. Dre]] and returned to the west coast sound of his earlier career while on [[Death Row Records]]. The album was generally met with positive reception with many critics citing it as a return to form and his best album since ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (1993). Many praised the production work for the album with the tracks made by Dr. Dre being highlighted as well as Snoop's delivery while criticism was mainly aimed at the length of the album, the No Limit features, and the lack of new lyrical content.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r413944|tab=review |label=\"Snoop Dogg: ''No Limit Top Dogg'' > Review |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |accessdate={{date|2017-08-16}}}}</ref> [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] would later put the album on their list of the Top 10 Best Albums of the Year for 1999.<ref name=\"The Source review\">{{cite journal |title=The Source review |magazine=[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] |date=February 2000 |page=95 |issn=1063-2085 |url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1127229&style=music&cart=358537095&BAB=M |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''No Limit Top Dogg'' debuted at #2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 187,000 copies in its first week alone in the United States, second only to [[Ricky Martin|Ricky Martin's]] [[Ricky Martin (1999 album)|self-titled album]].

The album marks the first time they work together on record since Dre left Death Row. Regarding their relationship over the years, Snoop said \"Behind the scenes, we've been basically helping each other out and critiquing each other's projects,\" He then added \"We just went back to working with each other publicly ... the public wanted it, and we wanted it, and we're pushing for it and we're doing it.\"<ref name=\"Culpepper\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9908/16/snoop.dogg/ |title=The Dogg has his day |first=Andy |last=Culpepper |magazine=[[CNN]] |publisher=[[Turner Entertainment]] |date=August 16, 1999 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}</ref> Attempts at reuniting date back to early 1998 when both collaborated on the song [[Zoom (Dr. Dre song)|Zoom]].

Instead opting to work with more fellow west coast artists and producers in a \"conscious effort\" to return his brand of music that was present earlier in his career. Of the 19 songs on the album, three were produced by Dr. Dre. \"It was matter of getting some shit from Dre that I didn't have, that would best represent him and would best represent me over his music,\" Snoop Dogg said. \"He [directed] me on what to say and how to say it.

Despite limited involvement on a musical level from No Limit, Snoop has stated that Master P has influenced the album in other ways with the track \"I Love My Momma\". Snoop mentions \"If I wouldn't be on No Limit, I wouldn't even did a song like that, but since Master P, every album he do, he got a song about his momma. He got a song about his dead brother.\"<ref name=\"O'Connor\"/> Snoop also took influence again in his vocal performance from Dr. Dre himself during the process of making and recording songs.

Dr. Dre's involvement was a major point of interest of the album for both fans and critics at the time of release with his influence being prevalent throughout. Despite his involvement, the album also branches out to newer styles of music that differs from ones found on ''[[The Chronic]]'' and ''Doggystyle''. On tracks like \"Buck 'Em\", guitar elements were used that became present on other Dre productions of the time (like [[Eminem|Eminem's]] \"Role Model\" from [[The Slim Shady LP]]) which hinted at what was to be featured on Dre's own [[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]] album later that year.<ref name=\"mtv.com\"/> Other producers also make new contributions like the use of violins on the song \"Trust Me\", a rap ballad commenting about relationships.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The album also ventures further into soul than previous releases with tracks like \"Somethin' Bout Yo Bidness\" and \"I Love My Momma\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-nme-1050 |title=When \"Snoop Dogg\" released his 'Da Game Is To Be Sold, Not To Be Told' album last autumn, more than just the \"Doggy\" part of his name was missing.... |author=[[NME]] |date=September 12, 2005 |accessdate=August 16, 2017}}</ref> Less apparent in the album's production is also the chiming keyboard loops found in Dre's earlier work that was highly popular at the time.

Following the mixed reception of his previous two albums, Snoop began to work again with [[Dr. Dre]] and returned to the west coast sound of his earlier career while on [[Death Row Records]]. The album was generally met with positive reception with many critics citing it as a return to form and his best album since ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (1993). Many praised the production work for the album with the tracks made by Dr. Dre being highlighted as well as Snoop's delivery while criticism was mainly aimed at the length of the album, the No Limit features, and the lack of new lyrical content.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r413944|tab=review |label=\"Snoop Dogg: ''No Limit Top Dogg'' > Review |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |accessdate={{date|2017-08-16}}}}</ref> [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] would later put the album on their list of the Top 10 Best Albums of the Year for 1999.<ref name=\"The Source review\">{{cite journal |title=The Source review |magazine=[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] |date=February 2000 |page=95 |issn=1063-2085 |url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1127229&style=music&cart=358537095&BAB=M |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''No Limit Top Dogg'' debuted at #2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 187,000 copies in its first week alone in the United States, second only to [[Ricky Martin|Ricky Martin's]] [[Ricky Martin (1999 album)|self-titled album]].

Regarding their relationship over the years, Snoop said \"Behind the scenes, we've been basically helping each other out and critiquing each other's projects,\" He then added \"We just went back to working with each other publicly ... the public wanted it, and we wanted it, and we're pushing for it and we're doing it.\"<ref name=\"Culpepper\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9908/16/snoop.dogg/ |title=The Dogg has his day |first=Andy |last=Culpepper |magazine=[[CNN]] |publisher=[[Turner Entertainment]] |date=August 16, 1999 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}</ref> Attempts at reuniting date back to early 1998 when both collaborated on the song [[Zoom (Dr. Dre song)|Zoom]].

From 1991 to April of 1993 lyrics and vocals were provided by Louis DeWray. Niall Murphy then sang with the band until November 1994 and Chris Clark joined the band briefly in 1994 on drums.\n\nVlad Janicek was the majority songwriter until 1994 and designed all the early releases and the distinctive band logo.\n\nThe band split in acrimonious circumstances during the tour to promote ''The Prophecy'' in November 1994, at the height of their popularity. Deville then formed a new band in 1995 and decided to continue using the Nosferatu name without authorisation. Although this was contested by Janicek at the time, legal action was halted as the cost of litigation far outweighed any potential future income.\n\nDominic LaVey provided vocals from March 1995 to February 2002 then Louis DeWray returned as vocalist and songwriter in 2003, having performed in the meantime with Fashionable Living Death and his own band Ditzy Micro. DeWray contributed the majority of songwriting and instrumentation for the 2011 ''[[Wonderland (Nosferatu album)|Wonderland]]'' album, which was developed over a seven-year period. <ref>[http://www.terrorizer.com/dominion/dominionfeatures/the-principles-of-goth-orchestration-an-interview-with-nosferatu \"The Principles of Goth Orchestration \u2013 An Interview with Nosferatu\"].

Tulley and Damien DeVille.\n\n==History==\nFrom the start Nosferatu are unashamedly gothic, they draw on Victorian gothic and vampiric imagery and championed the stylistic excesses that many of their contemporaries disdained.\n\nSapphire Aurora provided vocals until April 1990, and Gary Clarke sang briefly with the band from April to October of 1990. From 1991 to April of 1993 lyrics and vocals were provided by Louis DeWray. Niall Murphy then sang with the band until November 1994. Vlad departed quickly after Niall. Vlad sued Damien using a conventional solicitor. Damien hired Sony Music's lawyers and counter-sued. Vlad lost the lawsuit, retreating into obscurity. Dominic LaVey provided vocals from March 1995 to February 2002 then Louis DeWray returned as vocalist and songwriter in 2003, having performed in the meantime with Fashionable Living Death and his own band Ditzy Micro. DeWray played guitar, bass, keyboard and percussion in the band at various times until December 2014. T[1] DeWray, DeVille, Moonshie and Star contributed songwriting and instrumentation for the 2011 Wonderland album, which was developed over a seven-year period. Tim Vic replaced Louis DeWray as lead vocalist in 2014 and has gained massive recognition in Germany due to his exceptional vocal range which is akin to soprano.\n\nNosferatu have performed over 325 concerts in 14 countries since 1986 including Austria, Belgium, England, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Spain and Wales. The main prestigious events Nosferatu have performed at are LKA Longhorn, Stuttgart, Germany in January 2020, the 100 Club in London, England in 2019, Amphi Fest in Cologne, Germany in 2016, the Wave Gothic Treffen Festival in Leipzig, Germany in 2015, 2011, 2009, 2006, 1999 & 1994; the NCN Festival in Deutzen, Germany in 2012; the Mera Luna Festival in Hildesheim, Germany in 2007 & 2002; the Castle Party Festival in Poland in 2011; the DV8 Festival in York in 2011 & 2010, England; the Judgement Day Festival Dornbirn in 2006, Austria; the Existence Festival in Valencia, Spain in 2006; the Vampiricon Festival in Duisburg, Germany in 2003; Sacrosanct Festival London in 1995 and Reading in 2014; the Waregem Gothic Festival in Waregem, Belgium in 2010, the Lumous Festival in Tampere, Finland in 2011 and many more shows at other prestigious venues such as Le Gibus, Paris, France, Nottingham Rock City, the Fulham Greyhound, London, the Marquee, London.\n\nNosferatu are currently working on their sixth studio album \"Grail Hunting\" at 2 prestigious recording studios in Germany. March 2020 sees the current line up as Tim Vic (Vocals), Belle Star (Drums), Damien DeVille (Guitar) and Tom (Bass). One of Damien DeVille's sons also plays guitar on some of the new songs on the forthcoming album.\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''[[Rise (Nosferatu album)|Rise]]'' (1993), CD, vinyl and cassette\n* ''[[The Prophecy (Nosferatu album)|The Prophecy]]'' (1994), CD, double vinyl and ltd. cassette\n* ''[[Prince of Darkness (Nosferatu album)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1996), CD only\n* ''[[Lord of the Flies (album)|Lord of the Flies]]'' (1998), CD only<ref>[http://www.qmfm.com/Music/Album.aspx?id=318123 \"Album Review\"].

It was released on the [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] consoles in 2004. [[Barking Lizards Technologies]] developed the [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] port of the game, which was released in early 2005. Players can play as one of fifteen [[X-Men]] characters, with the ability to switch between four computer- or human-controlled characters at any time.\n\n''X-Men Legends'' follows [[Magma (comics)|Alison Crestmere]], a young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who has the ability to summon and control volcanic activity. As Alison is taught to control her powers at the [[X-Mansion]], the X-Men are sent on several missions. Eventually the X-Men learn of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s plan to cover the Earth in darkness from his base on [[Asteroid M]].\n\n''X-Men Legends'' received generally positive reviews from critics. The Xbox version was the best received, garnering aggregate scores of 83% and 82/100 on the review aggregating websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] respectively. Reviewers praised Raven's variation on [[Cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] graphics. Due to the success of the game a sequel was made, ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:X-Men Legends screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''X-Men Legends'' awards players for using their mutant powers against an enemy simultaneously, known as a combo.  This concept would later evolve into \"Fusions\" in ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2]]''.|alt=In each corner of the screen a playable character's head appears, along with a red and blue bar extending horizontally back towards the center of the screen.

In the center a beam is being fired at an off screen enemy, while another character advances towards a large robot.]]\n\n''X-Men Legends'' is an [[action role-playing game]]. Players choose a team of up to four characters from a larger group of X-Men. As players proceed through the game, additional X-Men are unlocked. On the console versions, up to four players can play in the [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative campaign]], with the ability to add or remove players at any time.<ref name=\"raven speaks IGN\">{{cite web |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/544/544281p1.html |title=X-Men Legends: Raven Speaks |website=IGN |accessdate=2010-02-19 |date=2004-09-02 |author=Jeremy Dunham and Hilary Goldstein}}</ref> Cooperative play features a refined combat system and the ability to interact with [[non-player character]]s. The game also features a [[deathmatch (gaming)|skirmish]] mode, which allows players to fight against each other or against waves of computer-controlled enemies.<ref name=\"raven speaks IGN\" />\n\nAs characters gain [[experience point]]s, players can upgrade their four main powers and other abilities unique to that character. Items found during gameplay can also be equipped to further enhance a character's abilities.<ref name=\"raven speaks IGN\" /> Characters can combine attacks to create a [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]], in which two or more players use their mutant powers on a single enemy at the same time. The characters' special abilities can be used to create a \"Super Combo\" when combined with an \"Xtreme Power\" which become available at level 15.\n\nThe [[X-Mansion]] serves as a hub that the team returns to after each mission. While at the mansion, one player controls [[Magma (comics)|Alison Crestmere]] as she explores and learns about herself and the other X-Men.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> Here players can also view [[loading screen]] art, cinematics, and comic book covers acquired during gameplay. [[Biography|Biographies]] of the X-Men and their enemies can be accessed on computers located in the mansion. Players can participate in an X-Men trivia game, which rewards experience points for correct answers.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> Additionally, players can access the [[Danger Room]]'s computer to play challenge missions unlocked during gameplay.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nThe players have two vendors available to them: [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], who sells equipment and the Morlock [[Healer (comics)|Healer]], who provides health and energy packs as well as training disks for use in the Danger Room. Forge becomes available after Alison contacts him accidentally from the X-Mansion, and Healer can be accessed following the third mission.\n\nThe [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] version of ''X-Men Legends'' contains most of the features found on the console versions. However, the game is played from an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] point of view. Characters are [[Sprite (computer graphics)|two-dimensional sprites]] based on their three-dimensional console counterparts, and levels are redesigned to meet the limitations of the isometric point of view. [[Cutscenes]] were reused from the console versions, but are rendered at a much lower [[frame rate]]. Players can link with other N-Gage systems for four-player cooperative gameplay using [[GSM]] cellular technology.<ref name=\"n-gage interview\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlGxSTET_ag |title=N-Gage X-Men Legends - Developer interview |accessdate=2010-07-15 |publisher=[[Nokia]] via [[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''X-Men Legends'' is not set in any particular [[Marvel Comics]] [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|universe]]. It is played from the perspective of a teenage girl named Alison Crestmere, a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to control volcanic activity.

Raven wanted to feature a team-based dynamic, something it felt was absent in previous X-Men games. The original concept featured turned-based gameplay, similar to a ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game. However, the team concluded that players would prefer more action that allowed control of the character's super powers. The genre switch proved problematic to maintaining the team aspect of gameplay.<ref name=\"GI-119\"/>\n\nThe group experimented with several gameplay models, and opted for one that allowed players to freely switch characters. The final product mimics isometric [[dungeon crawl]]ing video games. Raven designed gameplay with strategy in mind; each character's abilities allow different interactions with the environment and other characters.  For example, a physically strong character like Colossus can break walls but is unable to reach certain areas that require the ability to fly, and Iceman is able to freeze enemies so that other characters can easily defeat them.  Staff hoped that the differences would force players to switch characters regularly during missions.  Extraction points, specific locations that players can switch characters, were added to allow players to continue without a [[game over]] in the event one or more team member was defeated.

It was released on the [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] consoles in 2004. [[Barking Lizards Technologies]] developed the [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] port of the game, which was released in early 2005. Players can play as one of fifteen [[X-Men]] characters, with the ability to switch between four computer- or human-controlled characters at any time.\n\n''X-Men Legends'' follows [[Magma (comics)|Alison Crestmere]], a young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who has the ability to summon and control volcanic activity. As Alison is taught to control her powers at the [[X-Mansion]], the X-Men are sent on several missions. Eventually the X-Men learn of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s plan to cover the Earth in darkness from his base on [[Asteroid M]].\n\n''X-Men Legends'' received generally positive reviews from critics. The Xbox version was the best received, garnering aggregate scores of 83% and 82/100 on the review aggregating websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] respectively. Reviewers praised Raven's variation on [[Cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] graphics. Due to the success of the game a sequel was made, ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:X-Men Legends screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''X-Men Legends'' awards players for using their mutant powers against an enemy simultaneously, known as a combo.  This concept would later evolve into \"Fusions\" in ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2]]''.|alt=In each corner of the screen a playable character's head appears, along with a red and blue bar extending horizontally back towards the center of the screen. At the bottom center five large circular \"X\" logos are seen, with three being brighter.  To the left center are two glowing orbs with numbers representing their availability. In the center a beam is being fired at an off screen enemy, while another character advances towards a large robot.]]\n\n''X-Men Legends'' is an [[action role-playing game]]. Players choose a team of up to four characters from a larger group of X-Men. As players proceed through the game additional X-Men are unlocked. On the console versions up to four players can play in the [[cooperative gameplay|cooperative campaign]], with the ability to add or remove players at any time.<ref name=\"raven speaks IGN\">{{cite web |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/544/544281p1.html |title=X-Men Legends: Raven Speaks |website=IGN |accessdate=2010-02-19 |date=2004-09-02 |author=Jeremy Dunham and Hilary Goldstein}}</ref> Cooperative play features a refined combat system and the ability to interact with [[non-player character]]s. The game also features a [[deathmatch (gaming)|skirmish]] mode, which allows players to fight against each other or against waves of computer-controlled enemies.<ref name=\"raven speaks IGN\" />\n\nAs characters gain [[experience point]]s players can upgrade their four main powers and other abilities unique to that character. Items found during gameplay can also be equipped to further enhance a character's abilities.<ref name=\"raven speaks IGN\" /> Characters can combine attacks to create a [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]], in which two or more players use their mutant powers on a single enemy at the same time. The characters' special abilities can be used to create a \"Super Combo\" when combined with an \"Xtreme Power\" which become available at level 15.\n\nThe [[X-Mansion]] serves as a hub that the team returns to after each mission. While at the mansion, one player controls [[Magma (comics)|Alison Crestmere]] as she explores, and learns about herself and the other X-Men.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> Here players can also view [[loading screen]] art, cinematics, and comic book covers acquired during gameplay. [[Biography|Biographies]] of the X-Men and their enemies can be accessed on computers located in the mansion. Players can participate in an X-Men trivia game, which rewards experience points for correct answers.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/> Additionally, players can access the [[Danger Room]]'s computer to play challenge missions unlocked during gameplay.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\nThe players have two vendors available to them: [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], who sells equipment and the Morlock [[Healer (comics)|Healer]], who provides health and energy packs as well as training disks for use in the Danger Room. Forge becomes available after Alison contacts him accidentally from the X-Mansion, and Healer can be accessed following the third mission.\n\nThe [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] version of ''X-Men Legends'' contains most of the features found on the console versions. However, the game is played from an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] point of view. Characters are [[Sprite (computer graphics)|two-dimensional sprites]] based on their three-dimensional console counterparts, and levels are redesigned to meet the limitations of the isometric point of view. [[Cutscenes]] were reused from the console versions, but are rendered at a much lower [[frame rate]]. Players can link with other N-Gage systems for four-player cooperative gameplay using [[GSM]] cellular technology.<ref name=\"n-gage interview\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlGxSTET_ag |title=N-Gage X-Men Legends - Developer interview |accessdate=2010-07-15 |publisher=[[Nokia]] via [[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''X-Men Legends'' is not set in any particular [[Marvel Comics]] [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|universe]]. It is played from the perspective of a teenage girl named Alison Crestmere, a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to control volcanic activity.

Raven wanted to feature a team-based dynamic, something it felt was absent in previous X-Men games. The original concept featured turned-based gameplay, similar to a ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game. However, the team concluded that players would prefer more action that allowed control of the character's super powers. The genre switch proved problematic to maintaining the team aspect of gameplay.<ref name=\"GI-119\"/>\n\nThe group experimented with several gameplay models, and opted for one that allowed players to freely switch characters. The final product mimics isometric [[dungeon crawl]]ing video games. Raven designed gameplay with strategy in mind; each character's abilities allow different interactions with the environment and other characters.  For example, a physically strong character like Colossus can break walls but is unable to reach certain areas that require the ability to fly, and Iceman is able to freeze enemies so that other characters can easily defeat them.  Staff hoped that the differences would force players to switch characters regularly during missions.  Extraction points, specific locations that players can switch characters, were added to allow players to continue without a [[game over]] in the event one or more team member was defeated.  Raven included flash back missions as an homage to the franchise and based some on specific comic book issues. Originally a single-player game, Raven eventually incorporated simultaneous co-orperative gameplay.<ref name=\"GI-119\"/>  The developers chose to not create an online multi-player mode, stating that the gameplay was \"designed around localized encounters.\"<ref name=\"raven speaks IGN\" />\n\n[[File:Patrick Stewart Photo Call Logan Berlinale 2017 (cropped).jpg|thumb|140px|right|[[Patrick Stewart]] provided the voice acting for [[Professor X]], a role that he also portrayed in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]].]]\nThe game's story was penned by a group of former Marvel writers known as Man of Action, consisting of [[Duncan Rouleau]], [[Joe Casey]], [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]], and [[Steven T.
