This album, along with Iglesias' next two, was released by the Mexican label Fonovisa. The record sold half a million copies in its first week, a rare accomplishment then for an album recorded in a language other than English, going Gold in Portugal within the first week of release, and sold over a million copies in the next three months.\n\nHis song \"[[Por Amarte]]\" was included in [[Televisa]]'s [[telenovela]] ''Marisol'', but with a twist: instead of ''Por amarte dar\u00eda mi vida'' (To love you, I'd give my life), the words were ''Por amarte Marisol, morir\u00eda'' (To love you, Marisol, I'd die). The CD also yielded Italian and Portuguese editions, with most of the songs translated into those languages.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, such as \"Por Amarte\", \"[[No Llores Por M\u00ed]]\", and \"[[Trapecista]]\", which topped the ''Billboard''{{'}}s Latin charts. The album went on to win Iglesias the [[Grammy Award]] for Best Latin Pop Performance.\n\n===1997\u20131998: ''Vivir'' and ''Cosas del Amor''===\n\nIn 1997, Iglesias' stardom continued to rise with the release of ''[[Vivir (Enrique Iglesias album)|Vivir]]'' (''To Live''), which put him up with other English-language music superstars in sales for that year. The album also included a cover version of the [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]] song \"[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]\", translated into Spanish as \"Solo en T\u00ed\".\n\nThree singles were released from ''Vivir'': \"[[Enamorado Por Primera Vez]]\", \"[[Solo en ti|S\u00f3lo en Ti]]\", and \"[[Miente]]\", which topped the Latin singles chart as well as those in several Spanish-speaking countries. Along with his father and [[Luis Miguel]], Iglesias was nominated for an [[American Music Award]] in the first-ever awarded category of Favorite Latin Artist. Iglesias lost out to his father, but performed the song \"[[Lluvia Cae]]\" at the event.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nInsisting on playing stadiums for his first concert tour, that summer, Iglesias, backed by [[sidemen]] for [[Elton John]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], and [[Billy Joel]], played to sold-out audiences in sixteen countries. Beginning in [[Odessa, Texas]], the tour went on to play three consecutive nights in Mexico's [[Plaza de toros M\u00e9xico|Plaza de Toros]], two consecutive nights at [[Monterrey]]'s [[Auditorio Coca-Cola]], and two at the Estadio River Plate in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, to over 130,000 people, as well as 19 arenas in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ondanet.com/latinos/Enrique.Iglesias/vivir-eng.html|title=Enrique Iglesias begins his worldwide tour Vivir|publisher=Ondanet|date=31 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Iglesias released his third album, ''[[Cosas del Amor (Enrique Iglesias album)|Cosas del Amor]]'' (''Things of Love''). Taking a more mature musical direction, the album, aided by the popular singles \"[[Esperanza (Enrique Iglesias song)|Esperanza]]\" and \"[[Nunca Te Olvidar\u00e9]]\", both of which topped the Latin singles chart, helped cement his status in the [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music scene]].\n\nIglesias did a short tour of smaller venues to accompany the release of the album, with one show being televised from [[Acapulco]], Mexico. This was followed by a larger world tour of over eighty shows in even bigger venues. The ''Cosas del Amor'' Tour was the first ever concert tour sponsored by [[McDonald's]].\n\nHe won an American Music Award in the category of Favorite Latin Artist against [[Ricky Martin]] and [[Chayanne]]. The song \"Nunca te Olvidar\u00e9\" was also used as the theme music for a Spanish soap opera of the same name and he sang the song himself on the last episode of the series.\n\n===1999\u20132001: ''Enrique'' and ''Escape''===\nBy 1999, Iglesias had begun a successful crossover career into the English-language music market. Thanks to other successful crossover acts, most notably [[Ricky Martin]] and [[Gloria Estefan]], Latino artists and music had a great surge in popularity in mainstream music. After attending one of his concerts in March 1999, [[Will Smith]] asked Iglesias to contribute to the soundtrack of his movie ''[[Wild Wild West]]''. His contribution \"Bailamos\" was released as a single and became a number one hit in the US.\n\nAfter the success of \"[[Bailamos]]\", several mainstream record labels were eager to sign Iglesias. Signing a multi-album deal after weeks of negotiations with [[Interscope]], Iglesias recorded and released his first full CD in English, ''Enrique''. The pop album, with some Latin influences, took two months to complete. It contained the song \"[[Rhythm Divine]]\", a duet with [[Whitney Houston]] entitled \"[[Could I Have This Kiss Forever]]\", and a cover of the [[Bruce Springsteen]] song \"[[Sad Eyes (Bruce Springsteen song)|Sad Eyes]]\".\n\nIn 2000, Iglesias performed at the [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] halftime show alongside [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Phil Collins]]. Shock jock [[Howard Stern]] repeatedly played a tape of a supposedly very off-key Iglesias on his radio show and accused him of not being able to sing live. On 8 June 2000, Iglesias sang the song live on Stern's show with just a guitar accompanying him. After the performance, Stern remarked, \"I respect you for coming in here; you really can sing\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Editor |first=Contributing |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/971810/20000608/index.jhtml |title=Enrique Iglesias Proves He Really Can Sing \u2013 Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV.com |publisher=Vh1.com |date=8 June 2000 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> Iglesias noted that the recording could have been him , but that it was probably a recording made during a television taping where he was required to [[lip sync]] and not sing properly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/971810/enrique-iglesias-proves-he-really-can-sing/ |title=Enrique Iglesias Proves He Really Can Sing |publisher=MTV |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> He would remark that the controversy was the best promotion he could have. The album's single \"[[Be with You (Enrique Iglesias song)|Be with You]]\" became Iglesias' second number-one single on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100.\n\nIn 2001, Iglesias released his second English-language album, ''[[Escape (Enrique Iglesias album)|Escape]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011124150422/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2001/11/0601.cfm \"ENRIQUE IGLESIAS Escape\"]. ''Chart Attack'', Review by Brian Pascual, 6 November 2001.</ref> Where most of the Latin crossover acts of the previous year experienced some difficulty matching the record sales of their first English-language albums, Iglesias actually went on to sell even more. The album's first single, \"[[Hero (Enrique Iglesias song)|Hero]]\", became a number-one hit in the United Kingdom, and in many other countries. The entire album was co-written by Iglesias.\n\n''Escape'' is his biggest commercial success to date. The singles \"[[Escape (Enrique Iglesias song)|Escape]]\" and \"[[Don't Turn Off the Lights]]\" became radio staples, placing highly or topping various charts both in North America and elsewhere. A second edition of the album was released internationally and contained a new version of one of Iglesias' favorite tracks, \"[[Maybe (Enrique Iglesias song)|Maybe]]\", as well as a duet with [[Lionel Richie]] called \"[[To Love a Woman]]\".\n\nIglesias capitalized on the album's success with his \"One-Night Stand World Tour\" consisting of fifty sold-out shows in sixteen countries. Including [[Radio City Music Hall]] and three consecutive nights in London's [[Royal Albert Hall]], the tour ended with a big show at [[Lia Manoliu Stadium]] in [[Bucharest]], Romania. The concert launched MTV Romania, with the video for \"[[Love to See You Cry]]\" being the first to be shown on the channel.\n\nThe second leg of the tour, \"Don't Turn Off the Lights\", was completed in the summer of 2002, with two sold-out nights in [[Madison Square Garden]] and another two in Mexico's [[National Auditorium]]. The tour finished with a single show in the [[Roberto Clemente Coliseum]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].\n\n===2002\u20132004: ''Quiz\u00e1s'' and ''7''===\n[[File:Enrique Iglesias 2007.11.29 5.jpg|thumb|right|Enrique Iglesias, [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]]]\nIn 2002, Iglesias decided to release a fourth Spanish-language album titled ''[[Quiz\u00e1s (album)|Quiz\u00e1s]]'' (''Perhaps''). A more polished musical production than his previous Spanish albums and containing more introspective songs, the album's title track is a song about the strained relationship Iglesias has with his famous father.\n\nThe album debuted at number twelve on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, the highest placement of a Spanish-language album on the chart at that period. ''Quiz\u00e1s'' sold a million copies in a week, making it the fastest-selling album in Spanish in five years. The three singles released from the album all ended up topping the Latin chart, giving Iglesias a total of sixteen number ones on the chart. He currently holds the record for the most number-one singles on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]{{'}}s Latin Chart. His last single from the album, \"[[Para Qu\u00e9 La Vida]]\", reached a million spins on U.S. radio, the only Spanish-language song to do so.\n\nThe video to the song \"[[Quiz\u00e1s (Enrique Iglesias song)|Quiz\u00e1s]]\" was the first Spanish-language music video to be added to the selection on one of [[MTV]]'s popular shows, ''[[Total Request Live]]''. Iglesias performed the song on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', becoming the first to sing a Spanish song on the show, and opening doors for other artists such as [[Ricky Martin]], [[Juanes]], and [[Jorge Drexler]] to perform their Spanish material. Iglesias included songs from ''Quiz\u00e1s'' in his \"Don't Turn Off the Lights Tour\", and the album went on to win the [[Latin Grammy Awards|Latin Grammy Award]] for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, Male|Best Pop Vocal Album]].\n\nBy 2003, Iglesias released his seventh album, which he called ''[[7 (Enrique Iglesias album)|7]]'', the second to be co-written by him. Among its more 1980s-inspired material, it features the song \"Roamer\", which he wrote with his friend and longtime guitarist, [[Tony Bruno]]. The CD also contained the song \"Be Yourself\", a song about independence (the chorus talks about how Iglesias' own parents did not believe he'd ever succeed in his singing career). The first single was the song \"[[Addicted (Enrique Iglesias song)|Addicted]]\", and was followed closely by a remix of the song \"[[Not in Love (Enrique Iglesias song)|Not in Love]]\", featuring [[Kelis]].\n\nWith this album, Iglesias went on his biggest world tour to date. The highly publicised tour started with twelve shows in the United States ending with Iglesias playing at [[Houston Rodeo]], and continued on to several countries, most of which he'd never previously visited, playing to sold-out arenas and stadiums in Australia, India, Egypt, and Singapore, before ending his tour in [[South Africa]].\n\n===2007\u20132009: ''Insomniac'', ''95/08 \u00c9xitos'' and ''Greatest Hits''===\nAfter a two-year hiatus, Iglesias released his new album ''[[Insomniac (Enrique Iglesias album)|Insomniac]]'' on 12 June 2007. The album was so named due to it being recorded mainly at night. The record had a more contemporary pop style than that of his previous albums. Its highlights include the songs \"[[Push (Enrique Iglesias song)|Push]]\", with rapper [[Lil Wayne]], as well as \"Ring My Bells\", and a cover of [[Ringside (band)|Ringside]]'s \"[[Tired of Being Sorry]]\".\n\nThe album's first single, \"[[Do You Know? (The Ping Pong Song)]]\", was released on 10 April 2007. It was Iglesias's highest-charting song on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] since \"[[Escape (Enrique Iglesias song)|Escape]]\". The song was also a hit throughout Europe, peaking in the top 10 in many countries. The Spanish version of the song, entitled \"[[Do You Know? (The Ping Pong Song)|D\u00edmelo]]\", was number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart for eleven weeks, becoming his second best performing song on that chart at the time.\n\nIglesias followed up with the ballad \"[[Somebody's Me]]\", which was released as a single in North America. The song was played extensively on AC radio and peaked high on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Hot AC]]. In Europe, the second single was \"Tired of Being Sorry\", which performed well in many countries; he recorded a version of the song with French singer [[N\u00e2diya]], which was number one in France for eleven weeks.\n\nOn 4 July 2007, Enrique Iglesias became the first Western artist to play a concert in Syria in three decades when he performed for a sold-out crowd of ten thousand in the capital [[Damascus]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} and in the same week, he performed on [[Live Earth]] in [[Hamburg]].\n\nThe Insomniac World Tour was launched at the [[Coca-Cola Dome]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, the same venue he ended his last world tour, and took him to sold-out arenas throughout Europe. It was his first arena tour of the UK, with him playing venues such as Manchester's [[MEN Arena]] and [[Wembley Arena]]. The tour ended with Iglesias performing at the newly opened [[L.A. Live]]. A second leg of the tour took him throughout Latin America, from Mexico to Argentina.\n\nA solo version of \"Push\" was added to the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Step Up 2 the Streets]]''. The song was regarded as the third single from the album. A music video was shot, which features the film's lead actors. Despite never being officially added to radio, the song has charted in several countries and is one of his most highly rated songs amongst fans.\n\nIglesias's song \"[[Can You Hear Me (Enrique Iglesias song)|Can You Hear Me]]\" was chosen as the official song of the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] football tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.euro2008.uefa.com/countries/organisation/marketing/kind=16384/newsid=698320.html#iglesias+star+uefa+euro+2008|title=Iglesias to Star at UEFA Euro 2008|work=UEFA Euro 2008|date=22 May 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405204048/http://en.euro2008.uefa.com/countries/organisation/marketing/kind%3D16384/newsid%3D698320.html#iglesias+star+uefa+euro+2008|archivedate=5 April 2009}}</ref> He performed the song live at the 29 June 2008 final in Vienna, Austria.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://socialitelife.celebuzz.com/20En08/05/20/enrique_iglesias_to_sing_to_soccer_fans.php |title=Enrique Iglesias to Sing to Soccer Fans |work=A Socialite's Life |date=20 May 2008 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=Jennica |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The song featured on a re-issue of ''Insomniac'' , which was released in certain countries.\n\n[[File:Robin_Wong_Enrique_013.JPG|thumbnail|right|Iglesias in 2007]]\n\nIglesias released a Spanish greatest hits album named ''[[Enrique Iglesias: 95/08 \u00c9xitos|95/08 \u00c9xitos]]'' on 25 March 2008, which included his seventeen number-one songs on the ''Billboard'' Hot Latin Songs chart plus two new songs. The first single was the song \"[[\u00bfD\u00f3nde Est\u00e1n Coraz\u00f3n?]]\", which was written by Argentine star [[Coti]], and became Iglesias's eighteenth number-one single on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot Latin Songs. The album debuted at number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top Latin Albums]] chart and number eighteen on the overall [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. It was Iglesias's second Spanish album to debut in the top 20 of the ''Billboard'' 200 (''[[Quiz\u00e1s (album)|Quiz\u00e1s]]'' debuted at number twelve in 2002). The album was certified double Platinum (Latin field) in the U.S. and in some Latin American countries.\n\nThe record's second single, \"[[Lloro Por Ti]]\", also reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart and had an official remix featuring [[Wisin & Yandel]]. Iglesias did a tour of the US to promote the compilation. Beginning in [[Laredo, Texas]], and ending at the [[Izod Center]] in [[New Jersey]], he was accompanied through most of the tour with [[Bachata (music)|bachata]] band [[Aventura (band)|Aventura]], who also performed \"Lloro Por Ti\" with him at the [[2008 Premios Juventud]].\n\nIglesias was a surprise performer at the 2008 [[Lo Nuestro]] Awards, opening the show with a medley of \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde Est\u00e1n Coraz\u00f3n?\" and \"D\u00edmelo\".

This album, along with Iglesias' next two, was released by the Mexican label Fonovisa. The record sold half a million copies in its first week, a rare accomplishment then for an album recorded in a language other than English, going Gold in Portugal within the first week of release, and sold over a million copies in the next three months.\n\nHis song \"[[Por Amarte]]\" was included in [[Televisa]]'s [[telenovela]] ''Marisol'', but with a twist: instead of ''Por amarte dar\u00eda mi vida'' (To love you, I'd give my life), the words were ''Por amarte Marisol, morir\u00eda'' (To love you, Marisol, I'd die). The CD also yielded Italian and Portuguese editions, with most of the songs translated into those languages.\n\nFive singles were released from the album, such as \"Por Amarte\", \"[[No Llores Por M\u00ed]]\", and \"[[Trapecista]]\", which topped the ''Billboard''{{'}}s Latin charts. The album went on to win Iglesias the [[Grammy Award]] for Best Latin Pop Performance.\n\n===1997\u20131998: ''Vivir'' and ''Cosas del Amor''===\n\nIn 1997, Iglesias' stardom continued to rise with the release of ''[[Vivir (Enrique Iglesias album)|Vivir]]'' (''To Live''), which put him up with other English-language music superstars in sales for that year. The album also included a cover version of the [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]] song \"[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]\", translated into Spanish as \"Solo en T\u00ed\".\n\nThree singles were released from ''Vivir'': \"[[Enamorado Por Primera Vez]]\", \"[[Solo en ti|S\u00f3lo en Ti]]\", and \"[[Miente]]\", which topped the Latin singles chart as well as those in several Spanish-speaking countries. Along with his father and [[Luis Miguel]], Iglesias was nominated for an [[American Music Award]] in the first-ever awarded category of Favorite Latin Artist. Iglesias lost out to his father, but performed the song \"[[Lluvia Cae]]\" at the event.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nInsisting on playing stadiums for his first concert tour, that summer, Iglesias, backed by [[sidemen]] for [[Elton John]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], and [[Billy Joel]], played to sold-out audiences in sixteen countries. Beginning in [[Odessa, Texas]], the tour went on to play three consecutive nights in Mexico's [[Plaza de toros M\u00e9xico|Plaza de Toros]], two consecutive nights at [[Monterrey]]'s [[Auditorio Coca-Cola]], and two at the Estadio River Plate in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, to over 130,000 people, as well as 19 arenas in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ondanet.com/latinos/Enrique.Iglesias/vivir-eng.html|title=Enrique Iglesias begins his worldwide tour Vivir|publisher=Ondanet|date=31 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Iglesias released his third album, ''[[Cosas del Amor (Enrique Iglesias album)|Cosas del Amor]]'' (''Things of Love''). Taking a more mature musical direction, the album, aided by the popular singles \"[[Esperanza (Enrique Iglesias song)|Esperanza]]\" and \"[[Nunca Te Olvidar\u00e9]]\", both of which topped the Latin singles chart, helped cement his status in the [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music scene]].\n\nIglesias did a short tour of smaller venues to accompany the release of the album, with one show being televised from [[Acapulco]], Mexico. This was followed by a larger world tour of over eighty shows in even bigger venues. The ''Cosas del Amor'' Tour was the first ever concert tour sponsored by [[McDonald's]].\n\nHe won an American Music Award in the category of Favorite Latin Artist against [[Ricky Martin]] and [[Chayanne]]. The song \"Nunca te Olvidar\u00e9\" was also used as the theme music for a Spanish soap opera of the same name and he sang the song himself on the last episode of the series.\n\n===1999\u20132001: ''Enrique'' and ''Escape''===\nBy 1999, Iglesias had begun a successful crossover career into the English-language music market. Thanks to other successful crossover acts, most notably [[Ricky Martin]] and [[Gloria Estefan]], Latino artists and music had a great surge in popularity in mainstream music. After attending one of his concerts in March 1999, [[Will Smith]] asked Iglesias to contribute to the soundtrack of his movie ''[[Wild Wild West]]''. His contribution \"Bailamos\" was released as a single and became a number one hit in the US.\n\nAfter the success of \"[[Bailamos]]\", several mainstream record labels were eager to sign Iglesias. Signing a multi-album deal after weeks of negotiations with [[Interscope]], Iglesias recorded and released his first full CD in English, ''Enrique''. The pop album, with some Latin influences, took two months to complete. It contained the song \"[[Rhythm Divine]]\", a duet with [[Whitney Houston]] entitled \"[[Could I Have This Kiss Forever]]\", and a cover of the [[Bruce Springsteen]] song \"[[Sad Eyes (Bruce Springsteen song)|Sad Eyes]]\".\n\nIn 2000, Iglesias performed at the [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] halftime show alongside [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Phil Collins]]. Shock jock [[Howard Stern]] repeatedly played a tape of a supposedly very off-key Iglesias on his radio show and accused him of not being able to sing live. On 8 June 2000, Iglesias sang the song live on Stern's show with just a guitar accompanying him. After the performance, Stern remarked, \"I respect you for coming in here; you really can sing\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Editor |first=Contributing |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/971810/20000608/index.jhtml |title=Enrique Iglesias Proves He Really Can Sing \u2013 Music, Celebrity, Artist News &#124; MTV.com |publisher=Vh1.com |date=8 June 2000 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> Iglesias noted that the recording could have been him , but that it was probably a recording made during a television taping where he was required to [[lip sync]] and not sing properly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/971810/enrique-iglesias-proves-he-really-can-sing/ |title=Enrique Iglesias Proves He Really Can Sing |publisher=MTV |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> He would remark that the controversy was the best promotion he could have. The album's single \"[[Be with You (Enrique Iglesias song)|Be with You]]\" became Iglesias' second number-one single on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100.\n\nIn 2001, Iglesias released his second English-language album, ''[[Escape (Enrique Iglesias album)|Escape]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011124150422/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2001/11/0601.cfm \"ENRIQUE IGLESIAS Escape\"]. ''Chart Attack'', Review by Brian Pascual, 6 November 2001.</ref> Where most of the Latin crossover acts of the previous year experienced some difficulty matching the record sales of their first English-language albums, Iglesias actually went on to sell even more. The album's first single, \"[[Hero (Enrique Iglesias song)|Hero]]\", became a number-one hit in the United Kingdom, and in many other countries. The entire album was co-written by Iglesias.\n\n''Escape'' is his biggest commercial success to date. The singles \"[[Escape (Enrique Iglesias song)|Escape]]\" and \"[[Don't Turn Off the Lights]]\" became radio staples, placing highly or topping various charts both in North America and elsewhere. A second edition of the album was released internationally and contained a new version of one of Iglesias' favorite tracks, \"[[Maybe (Enrique Iglesias song)|Maybe]]\", as well as a duet with [[Lionel Richie]] called \"[[To Love a Woman]]\".\n\nIglesias capitalized on the album's success with his \"One-Night Stand World Tour\" consisting of fifty sold-out shows in sixteen countries. Including [[Radio City Music Hall]] and three consecutive nights in London's [[Royal Albert Hall]], the tour ended with a big show at [[Lia Manoliu Stadium]] in [[Bucharest]], Romania. The concert launched MTV Romania, with the video for \"[[Love to See You Cry]]\" being the first to be shown on the channel.\n\nThe second leg of the tour, \"Don't Turn Off the Lights\", was completed in the summer of 2002, with two sold-out nights in [[Madison Square Garden]] and another two in Mexico's [[National Auditorium]]. The tour finished with a single show in the [[Roberto Clemente Coliseum]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].\n\n===2002\u20132004: ''Quiz\u00e1s'' and ''7''===\n[[File:Enrique Iglesias 2007.11.29 5.jpg|thumb|right|Enrique Iglesias, [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]]]\nIn 2002, Iglesias decided to release a fourth Spanish-language album titled ''[[Quiz\u00e1s (album)|Quiz\u00e1s]]'' (''Perhaps''). A more polished musical production than his previous Spanish albums and containing more introspective songs, the album's title track is a song about the strained relationship Iglesias has with his famous father.\n\nThe album debuted at number twelve on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, the highest placement of a Spanish-language album on the chart at that period. ''Quiz\u00e1s'' sold a million copies in a week, making it the fastest-selling album in Spanish in five years. The three singles released from the album all ended up topping the Latin chart, giving Iglesias a total of sixteen number ones on the chart. He currently holds the record for the most number-one singles on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]{{'}}s Latin Chart. His last single from the album, \"[[Para Qu\u00e9 La Vida]]\", reached a million spins on U.S. radio, the only Spanish-language song to do so.\n\nThe video to the song \"[[Quiz\u00e1s (Enrique Iglesias song)|Quiz\u00e1s]]\" was the first Spanish-language music video to be added to the selection on one of [[MTV]]'s popular shows, ''[[Total Request Live]]''. Iglesias performed the song on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', becoming the first to sing a Spanish song on the show, and opening doors for other artists such as [[Ricky Martin]], [[Juanes]], and [[Jorge Drexler]] to perform their Spanish material. Iglesias included songs from ''Quiz\u00e1s'' in his \"Don't Turn Off the Lights Tour\", and the album went on to win the [[Latin Grammy Awards|Latin Grammy Award]] for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, Male|Best Pop Vocal Album]].\n\nBy 2003, Iglesias released his seventh album, which he called ''[[7 (Enrique Iglesias album)|7]]'', the second to be co-written by him. Among its more 1980s-inspired material, it features the song \"Roamer\", which he wrote with his friend and longtime guitarist, [[Tony Bruno]]. The CD also contained the song \"Be Yourself\", a song about independence (the chorus talks about how Iglesias' own parents did not believe he'd ever succeed in his singing career). The first single was the song \"[[Addicted (Enrique Iglesias song)|Addicted]]\", and was followed closely by a remix of the song \"[[Not in Love (Enrique Iglesias song)|Not in Love]]\", featuring [[Kelis]].\n\nWith this album, Iglesias went on his biggest world tour to date. The highly publicised tour started with twelve shows in the United States ending with Iglesias playing at [[Houston Rodeo]], and continued on to several countries, most of which he'd never previously visited, playing to sold-out arenas and stadiums in Australia, India, Egypt, and Singapore, before ending his tour in [[South Africa]].\n\n===2007\u20132009: ''Insomniac'', ''95/08 \u00c9xitos'' and ''Greatest Hits''===\nAfter a two-year hiatus, Iglesias released his new album ''[[Insomniac (Enrique Iglesias album)|Insomniac]]'' on 12 June 2007. The album was so named due to it being recorded mainly at night. The record had a more contemporary pop style than that of his previous albums. Its highlights include the songs \"[[Push (Enrique Iglesias song)|Push]]\", with rapper [[Lil Wayne]], as well as \"Ring My Bells\", and a cover of [[Ringside (band)|Ringside]]'s \"[[Tired of Being Sorry]]\".\n\nThe album's first single, \"[[Do You Know? (The Ping Pong Song)]]\", was released on 10 April 2007. It was Iglesias's highest-charting song on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] since \"[[Escape (Enrique Iglesias song)|Escape]]\". The song was also a hit throughout Europe, peaking in the top 10 in many countries. The Spanish version of the song, entitled \"[[Do You Know?

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. This also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to a [[desert]] and the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite image showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

As early as 1861, trees were becoming scarce, and in 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. This also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to a [[desert]] and the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite image showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.
