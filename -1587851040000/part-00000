{"title_page": "Jesse Evans Gang", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe '''Jesse Evans Gang''', also known as '''The Boys''', was a gang of [[cattle rustler|rustler]]s and robbers led by [[outlaw]] and [[gunfighter|gunman]] [[Jesse Evans (outlaw)|Jesse Evans]], which lasted from 1876 until 1880. The gang was formed after Evans broke with the [[John Kinney Gang]]. After breaking away, he brought along with him Billy Morton, Frank Baker, Tom Hill, Dolly Graham, George Davis, Jim McDaniels, Buffalo Bill Spawn, Bob Martin, Manuel \"Indian\" Segovia and Nicholas Provencio.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe gang initiated numerous acts of [[robbery]] and [[cattle rustling]] from 1876 through 1880, most committed in [[New Mexico]]. Sometime in the spring of 1876 Evans and other gang members killed Pancho Cruz, Roman Mes and Tomas Cuerele at Shedd's ranch at [[San Augustin Mountains|San Augustin, Dona Ana County]]. They then shifted their domain to [[Lincoln County, New Mexico]]. They raided [[John Chisum|John Chisum's]] ranch, whom Evans had once worked for, and the [[Mescalero Apache]] reservation. Sometime around the 1877 mark it is believed that [[Billy the Kid]] rode with them.\n\n===Lincoln County War===\nThe gang was hired in late 1877 by the \"[[Lawrence Murphy|Murphy-Dolan Faction]]\", to harass the latter's opposition in [[Lincoln County, New Mexico]]. They began by rustling the cattle and horses of the Tunstall-McSween Faction. In February 1878, a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] was dispatched by Sheriff [[William J. Brady|Brady]] to arrest rancher [[John Tunstall]]. That posse included Jesse Evans, William Morton, Frank Baker, Tom Hill and Dolly Graham, all members of Evans' gang. They ambushed and murdered Tunstall on February 18, 1878, which ignited the [[Lincoln County War]]. Several days later, on March 9, 1878, the [[Lincoln County Regulators]], a [[vigilante]] posse formed by Tunstall and McSween supporters and at the time led by [[Richard M. Brewer|Dick Brewer]] caught Morton and Baker, and executed both men. On that same day Jesse Evans was injured and Tom Hill was killed while attempting to raid a ranch near Tularosa. Evans was arrested but managed to break out of jail. Evans returned and was present at the five-day siege at McSween's house, known as the Battle of Lincoln.\n\n===After the Lincoln County War===\nAfter the war he and Billy Mathews are said to have attempted to make peace with Billy The Kid, but the two killed lawyer Huston Chapman, putting them on the run from law enforcement. The gang fled down to [[Texas]], but [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] began pursuing them relentlessly, and killed several gang members including Dolly Graham. The Rangers caught up with the gang, including Evans, in Presidio del Norte, [[Mexico]], on July 3, 1880. The gunfight that followed would mark the end of the Jesse Evans Gang.\n\nThe Rangers engaged them in a shootout, during which Evans shot and killed [http://www.odmp.org/officer/18651-private-george-r.-(red)-bingham Ranger George Bingham], and Ranger D.T. Carson was wounded by other gang members. In turn, Ranger Carson and Ranger Ed Sieker shot and killed gang member George Davis, and shot and wounded gang member John Gross. The remaining members were captured. Gross was sentenced to a long prison term, but spent less than four years. Evans was sentenced to ten years.\n\nBut in 1882 the outlaw walked out of prison a free man, and decided jail was not for him. His debt paid to society he was never heard from again. In 1948, however, almost seventy years after he disappeared, Jesse's brother died and his estate needed to be settled. It was then that Jesse Evans re-appeared and revealed that he had been living in Florida under the alias Joe Hines. Joe Hines was able to prove to the satisfaction of a court of law that he was the one and only Jesse Evans of legend.<ref>Billy the Kid: An Autobiography</ref> {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n==Known members==\nThis is a list of all the known members of the Jesse Evans gang:\n\n*Jesse Evans, disappeared after being released from prison.

They play in the [[Belarusian Second League]], the 3rd division in Belarusian football. Their home stadium is [[City Stadium (Molodechno)|Molodechno City Stadium]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early history===\nThe city of Molodechno was represented in the Belarusian SSR League since 1949 by various teams attached to local industries and organizations and thus having different names and loose continuity: ''Dinamo Molodechno'' (1949\u20131955), [[Molodechno Region|Molodechno Oblast]] team (1956, 1959), Molodechno city team (1957\u20131958), ''Spartak Molodechno'' (1960\u20131963, 1970\u20131971), ''Naroch Molodechno'' (1964\u20131965), ''Krasnoye Znamya Molodechno'' (1966), ''Volna Molodecno'' (1967\u20131969), ''Selena Molodechno'' (1972\u20131980), ''Metallist Molodechno'' (1981\u20131982), ''Trud Molodechno'' (1983\u20131985), ''Stankostroitel Molodechno'' (1986).<ref>[http://infootball.by/post/16400795400680 History of FC Molodechno]</ref> Spartak Molodechno won the Belarusian SSR league in 1963. The modern FC Molodechno logo retroactively displays 1949 as the club's year of foundation.\n\n===Modern club===\n''Metallurg Molodechno'' was formed in 1989 and in 1991, the young team won the Belarusian SSR Top League championship as well as the [[Soviet Amateur Cup]]. Since 1992, the team started playing in the [[Belarusian Premier League]]. In 1993, they were renamed to ''FC Molodechno''. Their best result came in the 1994\u201395 season, when Molodechno finished 4th. In 1999, they finished 15th and relegated to the [[Belarusian First League|First League]], but after winning the First League in 2000, they quickly came back to the top level in 2001. To celebrate the win, they changed their name to ''Molodechno-2000''. They finished last and relegated to the First League again in 2003 and went further down to the Second League one season later. In 2006, they changed their name back to ''Molodechno''. In 2011, the name was changed to ''Zabudova Molodechno'' after a merger with [[FC Chist|Zabudova Chist]]. In 2013, the merger was dissolved and the club was renamed to ''Molodechno-2013'' and later to ''Molodechno-DYuSSh-4'' in 2015. The club changed its name again in 2019 back to ''FC Molodechno''.\n\n====Name changes====\n*1989: FC Metallurg Molodechno\n*1993: FC Molodechno\n*2001: FC Molodechno-2000\n*2006: FC

They play in [[Belarusian Second League]], the 3rd division in Belarusian football. Their home stadium is [[City Stadium (Molodechno)|Molodechno City Stadium]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early history===\nThe city of Molodechno was represented in Belarusian SSR League since 1949 by various teams attached to local industries and organizations and thus having different names and loose continuity: ''Dinamo Molodechno'' (1949\u20131955), [[Molodechno Region|Molodechno Oblast]] team (1956, 1959), Molodechno city team (1957\u20131958), ''Spartak Molodechno'' (1960\u20131963, 1970\u20131971), ''Naroch Molodechno'' (1964\u20131965), ''Krasnoye Znamya Molodechno'' (1966), ''Volna Molodecno'' (1967\u20131969), ''Selena Molodechno'' (1972\u20131980), ''Metallist Molodechno'' (1981\u20131982), ''Trud Molodechno'' (1983\u20131985), ''Stankostroitel Molodechno'' (1986).<ref>[http://infootball.by/post/16400795400680 History of FC Molodechno]</ref> Spartak Molodechno won Belarusian SSR league in 1963. The modern FC Molodechno logo retroactively displays 1949 as the club's year of foundation.\n\n===Modern club===\n''Metallurg Molodechno'' was formed in 1989 and in 1991 the young team won the Belarusian SSR Top League championship as well as [[Soviet Amateur Cup]]. Since 1992, the team started playing in [[Belarusian Premier League]]. In 1993 they were renamed to ''FC Molodechno''. Their best result came in 1994\u201395 season, when Molodechno finished 4th. In 1999, they finished 15th and relegated to the [[Belarusian First League|First League]], but after winning the First League in 2000 quickly came back to the top level in 2001. To celebrate the win they changed their name to ''Molodechno-2000''. They finished last and relegated to the First League again in 2003 and went further down to the Second League one season later. In 2006, they changed their name back to ''Molodechno''. In 2011, the name was changed to ''Zabudova Molodechno'' after a merger with [[FC Chist|Zabudova Chist]]. In 2013 the merger was dissolved and the club was renamed to ''Molodechno-2013'' and later to ''Molodechno-DYuSSh-4'' in 2015. The club changed its name again in 2019 back to ''FC Molodechno''.\n\n====Name changes====\n*1989: FC Metallurg Molodechno\n*1993: FC Molodechno\n*2001: FC Molodechno-2000\n*2006: FC
