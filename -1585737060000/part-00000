{"title_page": "Hopi time controversy", "text_new": "The '''Hopi time controversy''' is the academic debate about how the [[Hopi language]] grammaticalizes the concept of time, and about whether the differences between the ways the English and Hopi languages describe time are an example of [[linguistic relativity]] or not. In popular discourse the debate is often framed as a question about whether the [[Hopi people|Hopi]] \"had a concept of time\", despite it now being well established that they do.\n\nThe debate originated in the 1940s when American linguist [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] argued that the Hopi conceptualized time differently from the [[Standard Average European]] speaker, and that this difference correlated with grammatical differences between the languages.{{sfn|Carroll|1956}} Whorf argued that Hopi has \"no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time'\", and concluded that the Hopi had \"no general notion or intuition of time as a smooth flowing continuum in which everything in the universe proceeds at equal rate, out of a future, through the present, into a past\".{{sfn|Whorf|1956b|p=57}} Whorf used the Hopi concept of time as a primary example of his concept of linguistic relativity, which posits that the way in which individual languages encode information about the world, influences and correlates with the cultural [[world view]] of the speakers.  Whorf's relativist views fell out of favor in [[linguistics]] and [[anthropology]] in the 1960s, but Whorf's statement lived on in the popular literature often in the form of an [[urban myth]] that \"the Hopi have no concept of time\". In 1983 linguist [[Ekkehart Malotki]] published a 600-page study of the [[grammatical tense|grammar of time]] in the Hopi language, concluding that he had finally refuted Whorf's claims about the language.{{sfn|Malotki|1983}} Malotki's treatise gave hundreds of examples of Hopi words and grammatical forms referring to temporal relations. Malotki's central claim was that the Hopi do indeed conceptualize time as structured in terms of an ego-centered spatial progression from past, through present into the future. He also demonstrated that the Hopi language grammaticalizes tense using a distinction between future and non-future tenses, as opposed to the English tense system, which is usually analyzed as being based on a past/non-past distinction. Many took Malotki's work as a definitive refutation of the linguistic relativity hypothesis.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}} Linguist and specialist in the linguistic typology of tense [[Bernard Comrie]] concluded that \"Malotki's presentation and argumentation are devastating\".{{sfn|Comrie|1984|p=132}} Psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], a well-known critic of Whorf and the concept of linguistic relativity, accepted Malotki's claims as having demonstrated Whorf's complete ineptitude as a linguist.{{sfn|Pinker|1994|p=63}}\n\nSubsequently, the study of linguistic relativity was revived using new approaches in the 1990s,{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}{{sfn|Reines|Prinze|2009}} and Malotki's study came under criticism from relativist linguists and anthropologists, who did not consider that the study invalidated Whorf's claims.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}}{{sfn|Lee|1996}}{{sfn|Lee|1991}}{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|p=180-88}} The main issue of contention is the interpretation of Whorf's original claims about Hopi, and what exactly it was that he was claiming made Hopi different from what Whorf called \"[[Standard Average European]]\" languages.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}} Some consider that the Hopi language may be best described as a [[tenseless language]], and that the distinction between non-future and future posited by Malotki may be better understood as a distinction between ''realis'' and ''irrealis'' [[grammatical mood|moods]].{{sfn|Comrie|1984}} Regardless of exactly how the Hopi concept of time is best analyzed, most specialists agree with Malotki that all humans conceptualize time by an analogy with space, although some recent studies have also questioned this.{{sfn|Evans|2004}}{{sfn|Sinha|Sinha|Zinken|Sampaio|2011}}\n\n==The Hopi language==\nThe [[Hopi language]] is a [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American language]] of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language family]], which is spoken by some 5,000 [[Hopi people]] in the [[Hopi Reservation]] in Northeastern [[Arizona]], US.\n\nIn the large ''[[Hopi Dictionary: Hop\u00ecikwa Lav\u00e0ytutuveni|Hopi dictionary]]'' there is no word exactly corresponding to the English noun \"time\". Hopi employs different words to refer to \"a duration of time\" (''p\u00e0asa''' \"for that long\"), to a point in time (''p\u00e0asat'' \"at that time\"), and time as measured by a clock (''pah\u00e0ntawa''), as an occasion to do something (''hisat'' or ''qeni''), a turn or the appropriate time for doing something (''qeniptsi'' (noun)), and to have time for something (''aw n\u00e1naptsiwta'' (verb)).{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=854}}\n\nTime reference can be marked on verbs using the suffix ''-ni''\n:''Momoyam piktota'' \"The women are/were making ''[[piki]]''\"\n: Women piki-make\n:''Momoyam piktota-ni''''' \"The women will be making ''piki''\"{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=878}}\n:Women piki-make-NI\n\nThe -ni suffix is also used in the word ''naato'''ni'''qa'' which means \"that which will happen yet\" in reference to the future.

He corresponded with many of the greatest scholars of his time, such as [[Alfred Tozzer]] at Harvard and Herbert Spinden of the American Museum of Natural History. They were impressed with his work on the linguistics of the [[Nahuatl language]] and encouraged him to participate professionally and to undertake field research in Mexico. In 1931 [[Edward Sapir]], the foremost expert on Native American languages, started teaching at [[Yale University|Yale]], close to where Whorf lived, and Whorf signed up for graduate-level classes with Sapir, becoming one of his most respected students.{{sfn|Carroll|1956|p=''passim''}} Whorf took a special interest in the [[Hopi language]] and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village on the [[Second Mesa]] of the [[Hopi Reservation]] in [[Arizona]], who was living in the [[Manhattan]] borough of New York City. At this time it was common for linguists to base their descriptions of a language on data from a single speaker. Whorf credited Naquayouma as the source of most of his information on the Hopi language, although in 1938 he took a short field trip to the village of Mishongnovi on the [[Second Mesa]], collecting some additional data.<ref name=\"Dinwoodie\">{{harvcoltxt|Dinwoodie|2006|p=346}}</ref>\n\nWhorf published several articles on Hopi grammar, focusing particularly on the ways in which the grammatical categories of Hopi encoded information about events and processes, and how this correlated with aspects of Hopi culture and behavior. After his death his full sketch of Hopi grammar was published by his friend the linguist [[Harry Hoijer]], and some essays on Native American linguistics, many of which had been previously published in academic journals, were published in 1956 in the anthology ''Language, Thought, and Reality'' by his friend psychologist [[John Bissell Carroll]].{{sfn|Carroll|1956}}\n\n===Whorf on Hopi time===\nWhorf's most frequently cited statement regarding Hopi time is the strongly worded introduction of his 1936 paper \"An American Indian model of the Universe\", which was first published posthumously in Carroll's edited volume. Here he writes that\n\n{{quote|I find it gratuitous to assume that a Hopi who knows only the Hopi language and the cultural ideas of his own society has the same notions, often supposed to be intuitions, of time and space as we have, and that are generally assumed to be universal. In particular he has no notion or intuition of {{Smallcaps|time}} as a smooth flowing continuum in which everything in the universe proceeds at an equal rate, out of a future into a present and into a past&nbsp;.... After a long and careful analysis the Hopi language is seen to contain no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time', or to past, present or future ...|{{harvcoltxt|Whorf|1956b|p=57}}}}\n\nWhorf argues that in Hopi units of time are not represented by nouns, but by adverbs or verbs. Whorf argues that all Hopi nouns include the notion of a boundary or outline, and that consequently the Hopi language does not refer to abstract concepts with nouns. This, Whorf argues, is encoded in Hopi grammar, which does not allow durations of time to be counted in the same way objects are. So instead of saying, for example, \"three days\", Hopi would say the equivalent of \"on the third day\", using ordinal numbers. Whorf argues that the Hopi do not consider the process of time passing to produce another new day, but merely as bringing back the daylight aspect of the world.{{sfn|Whorf|1956e|pp=148-52}}\n\n====Hopi as a tenseless language====\nWhorf gives slightly different analyses of the grammatical encoding of time in Hopi in his different writings. His first published writing on Hopi grammar was the paper \"The punctual and segmentative aspects of verbs in Hopi\", published in 1936 in ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', the journal of the [[Linguistic Society of America]].{{sfn|Whorf|1956a}} Here Whorf analyzed Hopi as having a tense system with a distinction between three tenses: one used for past or present events (which Whorf calls the ''Factual'' tense or ''present-past''); one for future events; and one for events that are generally or universally true (here called ''usitative''). This analysis was repeated in a 1937 letter to J. B. Carroll, who later published it as part of his selected writings under the title \"Discussion of Hopi Linguistics\".{{sfn|Whorf|1956c|p=103|quote=\"There are three tenses: past (i.e. past up to and including the present), future and generalized (that which is generally, universally or timelessly true), all of which are mutually exclusive\"}}\n\nIn the 1938 paper \"Some verbal categories of Hopi\", also published in ''Language'', Whorf abandoned the word \"tense\" in the description of Hopi and described the distinction previously called \"tense\" with the label \"assertions\". Whorf described assertions as a system of categories that describe the speaker's claim of [[epistemic]] validity of his own statement. The three \"assertions\" of Hopi described by Whorf are the ''Reportive'', ''Expective'' and ''Nomic'' forms of the Hopi verb. Whorf acknowledges that these \"translate more or less [as] the English tenses\", but maintains that these forms do not refer to time or duration, but rather to the speaker's claim of the validity of the statement.{{sfn|Whorf|1938|p=276|quote=\"What we call present tense (not counting our present form which corresponds to the nomic) is from the Hopi standpoint simply a report to others concerning a situation shared with them, this report being either redundant information, or used to call attention to, or tell about some fragment of the situation not fully shared. Thus to the Hopi 'he is running'\nneed not be different from 'he was running', for if both the speaker and listener can see the runner then the 'is' of the former sentence means merely that the listener can see for himself what he is being told; he is being given redundant information, and this is the only difference from the latter sentence.\"}} The reportive form is unmarked, whereas the expective form is marked with the verbal suffix ''-ni'', and the nomic form with the suffix ''-\u014b\u02b7i''. In Whorf's analysis, by using the reportive form the speaker claims that the event has in fact occurred or is still occurring, whereas by using the expective form the speaker describes an expectation of a future event. Whorf says that the expective can be used to describe events in the past, giving the meaning of \"was going to\" or \"would\".{{sfn|Whorf|1938|pp=276-278}}\n\nIn the 1940 article \"Science and Linguistics\", Whorf gave the same three-way classification based on the speaker's assertion of the validity of his statement: \"The timeless Hopi verb does not distinguish between the present, past and future of the event itself but must always indicate what type of validity the {{smallcaps|speaker}} intends the statement to have: a. report of an event .. b. expectation of an event ..; generalization or law about events.\"{{sfn|Whorf|1956f|p=217}}\n\nIn his full sketch of Hopi grammar published posthumously in 1946, Whorf also described how adverbial particles contributed to the linguistic description of time in Hopi.{{sfn|Whorf|1946}} He posited two subclasses of adverbs called ''temporals'' and ''tensors'', which were used in sentences to locate events in time. A central claim in Whorf's work on linguistic relativity was that for the Hopi units of time were not considered objects that can be counted like most of the comparable English words that are described by [[noun]]s (''a day'', ''an hour'' etc.). He argued that only the Hopi word for \"year\" was a noun, the words for days and nights were ambivalent between noun and verbs, but that all other cyclic events and periods were described by adverbial particles used as modifiers for the sentence {{sfn|Whorf|1946|p=165|quote=\"Names of cyclic events and time periods, like summer, morning, full moon are in the class of temporals, a kind of adverbs. They mean e.g. \"when it is summer\" and are used to qualify predicates. They are not used as subjects, objects or at all as nouns.\"}}\n<!--(temporals and tensors are a subclass of the analytic word class (adverbial particles))\naspect (Add to this that these aspects may compound together, and that all but the durative and continuative handle ideas that are utterly strange, to English or indeed Indo-European...{{sfn|Whorf|1946|p=175}}): ingressive punctual or punctualizing (moment of completion, passage from latency into manifestation), and tensive or tensivizing, durative, segmentative (repeating), -->\n\n===Whorf's inspiration from Einsteinian physics===\nIn his interpretation of Hopi time Whorf was influenced by [[Einstein]]'s theory of relativity, which was developed in the first decades of the century and impacted the general Zeitgeist.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heynick | first1 = Frank | year = 1983 | title = From Einstein to Whorf: space, time, matter and reference frames in physical and linguistic relativity | url = | journal = Semiotica | volume = 45 | issue = 1\u20132 | doi = 10.1515/semi.1983.45.1-2.35 }}</ref>  Whorf, an engineer by profession, in fact made occasional reference to physical relativity, and he adopted the term \"linguistic relativity,\" reflecting the general concept of the different but equally valid interpretations of some aspects of physical reality by different observers due to differences in their (for Einstein) physical circumstances or (for Whorf) their psychological-linguistic circumstances.\n\nThe most salient points involve the concepts of ''simultaneity'' and ''spacetime''. In his [[Annus Mirabilis Papers#Special relativity|1905 Special Relativity]] paper, Einstein maintained that two given events can legitimately be called simultaneous if and only if they take place at the same point in time '''and''' in the same point in space. No two events which take place at a spatial distance from one another can legitimately be declared to be simultaneous in any absolute sense, for the judgement of simultaneity or non-simultaneity will depend on the physical circumstances (to be exact: the relative motion) of the observers. This difference is no artifact; each of the observers is correct (and is wrong only to the extent he or she insists that another observer is incorrect).\n\n[[Hermann Minkowski]], in his seminal 1908 address to the Congress of German Physicists, translated Einstein's 1905 mathematical equations into geometric terms. Minkowski famously declared:\n\n<blockquote>\"Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.\"<ref>Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.43.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpatial distance and temporal distance between any two events was now replaced by a single absolute distance in spacetime.\n\nHeynick points to several passages in Whorf's writings on the Hopis which parallel Einsteinian concepts such as:\n\n<blockquote>\"time varies with each observer and does not permit of simultaneity\" (1940)<ref>Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.42.</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"The Hopi metaphysics does not raise the question whether the things at a distant village exist at the same moment as those in one's own village, for it ... says that any 'events' in the distant village can be compared to any events in one's own village only by an interval of magnitude that has both time and space forms in it.\" (c.1936) <ref>Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.42. Heynick is careful to point out that he has selectively cited such passages and that in the broader context of Whorf's writing it would be inaccurate to assume that Whorf simply presents the Hopis as pre-Einstein Einsteins in their conception of time.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe concept of a \"simultaneous now\" throughout the cosmos was formulated by [[Aristotle]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and most succinctly in [[John Locke]]'s ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1690):\n\n<blockquote>\"For this moment is common to all things that are now in being ... they all exist in the same moment of time.\"</blockquote>\n\nWhorf saw this notion as derived from the Standard Average European languages in which these thinkers thought: \"Newtonian space, time, and matter are no intuitions. They are recepts from culture and language. That is where Newton got them.\"<ref>Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.46.</ref>\n\nHeynick, who claimed no personal knowledge of the Hopi language, posits alternative weaker and stronger interpretations of the influence of Einsteinian relativity on Whorf's analysis of the Hopi language and the Hopi concept of time. In the weaker version, the (then) new questioning of the nature of time and space brought about by the Einsteinian revolution in physics enabled Whorf to approach the Hopis and their language unburdened by traditional Western concepts and presumptions. The stronger version is that Whorf under the influence of Einstein tended inadvertently to \"read into\" his linguistic and cultural data relativistic concepts where they perhaps were not.<ref>Heynick also analyzes Whorf's concepts of \"eventing\" and the nature of matter in the language of the Hopis (and the Nooktas), and their parallels in modern physics. These relate only peripherally to the Hopi time controversy.</ref>\n\n==The myth of the timeless Hopi==\nWhorf died in 1941, but his ideas took on their own life in academia and in the popular discourse on Native Americans. In 1958 [[Stuart Chase]]\u2014an economist and engineer at MIT who had followed Whorf's ideas with great interest, but whom Whorf himself considered utterly incompetent and incapable of understanding the nuances of his ideas{{sfn|Lee|1996|p=16}}\u2014published \"Some things worth knowing: a generalist's guide to useful knowledge\". Here he repeated Whorf's claim about Hopi time, but arguing that because of the Hopi view of time as a process, they were better able to understand the concept of time as a [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]].{{sfn|Deutscher|2010|p=141-43}} Similarly, even scientists were intrigued by the thought that the idea of spatio-temporal unity that had taken [[Albert Einstein]] seven years to ponder, was readily available to the Hopi, simply because of the grammar of their language.{{sfn|Livingston|1963|p=16}}\n\nIn 1964 [[John Greenway (folklorist)|John Greenway]] published a humorous portrait of American culture, ''The Inevitable Americans'', in which he wrote: \"You have a watch, because Americans are obsessed with time. If you were a Hopi Indian, you would have none, the Hopi have no concept of time\".{{sfn|Greenway|1964|p=9}} And even the 1971 ethnography of the Hopi by Euler and Dobyns claimed that \"The English concept of time is nearly incomprehensible to the Hopi\".{{sfn|Euler|Dobyns|1971|p=21}} The myth quickly became a staple element of [[New Age]] conceptualizations of the Hopi.{{sfn|Geertz|1994}}\n\n==Max Black and Helmut Gipper==\nIn 1959 philosopher [[Max Black]] published a critique of Whorf's arguments in which he argued that the principle of linguistic relativity was obviously wrong because translation between languages is always possible, even when there are no exact correspondences between the single words or concepts in the two languages.{{sfn|Black|1959}}\n\nGerman linguist and philosopher Helmut Gipper had studied with the neo-[[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldtian]] linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] and had a basically Kantian understanding of the relation between language and thought. [[Immanuel Kant]] considered the categories of time and space to be universals underlying all human thinking.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|pp=179-180, 186-87}} Whorf's argument that the Hopi do not conceive of time and space as speakers of [[Indo-European languages]] do clashed with this basic understanding of cognition. Gipper went to the Hopi reservation to collect data for a general critique of Whorf's principle of linguistic relativity published in 1972. His critique included a refutation of Whorf's Hopi arguments. Gipper showed that the Hopi could refer to time, by juxtaposing Hopi phrases with their German equivalents that used words referring to units of time and to distinctions between past and present. Gipper also argued that several time intervals were described by nouns, and that these nouns could take the role of syntactic subject or object, in contradiction of Whorf's explicit statement. He argues that Whorf's assertion that intervals of time are not counted in the same way as objects is \"questionable\".{{sfn|Gipper|1972}}\n\n==Ekkehart Malotki==\n[[Ekkehart Malotki]] studied with Gipper at the [[University of M\u00fcnster|Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t]] at [[M\u00fcnster]] and his work was a continuation of his mentor's, spurred on by the frequent claims in the popular literature that \"the Hopi have no concept of time\". Malotki conducted four years of research on the [[Third Mesa]], studying Hopi spatial and temporal reference. He published two large volumes, one in German, ''Hopi-Raum''{{sfn|Malotki|1979}} [Hopi space] and one in English, ''Hopi Time''.{{sfn|Malotki|1983}} For Malotki it was imperative to demonstrate two facts in contradiction of Whorf's claims: 1. that the Hopi language has an abundance of terms, words and constructions that refer to time. 2. that the Hopi do cognitively conceptualize time in analogy with physical space, using spatial metaphors to describe durations and units of time. He also wanted to demonstrate that Whorf misanalyzed several particularities regarding specific Hopi words and expressions. Malotki states that a main goal is to present \"actual Hopi language data\", since when he was writing very little textual data in Hopi had been published, and Whorf's publications were largely without text examples.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=629}} ''Hopi Time'' opens with a quotation drawn from his extensive field work, which directly challenges Whorf's claim of a lack of temporal terms in the Hopi language: \"Then [''pu\u2019''] indeed, the following day, quite early in the morning at the hour when people pray to the sun, around that time then [''pu\u2019''] he woke up the girl again.\"{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=[vii]}}\n\n===''Hopi Time'' (1983)===\nMost of ''Hopi Time'' is dedicated to the detailed description of the Hopi usage of words and constructions related to time. Malotki describes in detail the usage of a large amount of linguistic material:  temporal adverbs, time units, time counting practices such as the Hopi calendar, the way that days are counted and time is measured.\n\nThe first part of the book describes \"spatio-temporal metaphors\"; in it he shows several deictic adverbs that are used both to reference distance in space and in time, such as the word ''ep'' that means both \"there\" and \"then\". In the second chapter he describes the way in which the Hopi talk about units of time. He argues that in some contexts, specifically those of the ceremonial cycle, the Hopi do count days, using compound words such as ''payistala'' \"the third day (of a ceremony)\" composed of the morphemes ''paayo'' \"three\", ''s'' \"times\" and ''taala''' \"day/light\", meaning literally \"three-times-day\".{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=246}} He also shows that the Hopi reckon time through the movement of the sun, having distinct words for the different degrees of light during the dawn and dusk periods. He also notes that the feeling of time passing can be described by saying \"the sun moves slowly/quickly\". Parts 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe Hopi time-keeping practices using the sun relative to the horizon, using the stars, the ceremonial calendar and the use of time-keeping devices such as knotted strings or notched sticks with a mark or knot for every day, sun-hole alignment and shadow observation. The eighth chapter describes the temporal particles that Whorf defined as temporals and tensors. He argues that Whorf's descriptions are vague and alienating.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=531}}\n\n====Malotki on tense in Hopi====\nThe concept of Hopi tense is covered in the last part of chapter 9, titled \"miscellaneous\", and in the conclusion. Malotki follows Gipper in arguing that time is a natural category and that it is naturally experienced in terms of past, present and future, even though many languages do not necessarily grammaticalize all of these distinctions.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=625}} He analyzes the Hopi ''-ni'' suffix as marking the future tense. He argues that since there is no grammatical distinction between past and present, Hopi has a future-nonfuture tense system. Malotki distinguishes between primary and secondary functions of the -ni suffix, arguing that its primary function is temporal reference and that its many modal functions such as [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[hortative]] and [[desiderative]] are of secondary importance. {{quote|text=As it turns out from among the numerous suffixes that the Hopi verb can select to mark the grammatical categories of aspect, mode and tense, one is specifically reserved to refer to time, or rather the sequential ordering of events or states. This temporal marker is ''-ni'' whose referential force is futurity. Its temporal function is primary; however, in many contexts i-''ni'' also takes on a number of secondary, atemporal functions which essentially belong to the modal category (imperative, hortative, desiderative, etc.). Since no markers exist to point out present or past time, Hopi, like many other languages, can be said to be endowed with a future-nonfuture tense system.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=624}}}} Malotki does admit that the English and Hopi systems of tense are different since the English system distinguishes past from non-past, whereas Hopi distinguishes future from non-future.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=666}}\n\n==Further debates==\nSubsequent descriptions of Hopi grammar have maintained Malotki's distinction between an unmarked non-future tense and a future tense marked with the -''ni'' suffix, and a habitual aspect marked by the suffix -''ngwu''.{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=878}} The review by [[Bernard Comrie]], a well-known authority on the [[linguistic typology]] of [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], accepts that Malotki's work demonstrates that the Hopi do have a concept of time and that it is devastating for Whorf's strong claims. But Comrie also notes that Malotki's \"Claim that Hopi has a tense system based on the opposition of future and non-future&nbsp;... strikes me as questionable: given the wide range of modal uses of the so-called future, it is at least plausible that this is a modal rather than temporal distinction, with the result that Hopi would have no tense distinction.\"{{sfn|Comrie|1984|p=132}}\n\nLinguists and psychologists who work in the universalist tradition such as [[Steven Pinker]] and [[John McWhorter]], have seen Malotki's study as being the final proof that Whorf was an inept linguist and had no significant knowledge or understanding of the Hopi language.{{sfn|Pinker|1994}}{{sfn|Pinker|2007}}{{sfn|McWhorter|2009}}{{sfn|McWhorter|2010}} This interpretation has been criticized by relativist scholars as unfounded and based on a lack of knowledge of Whorf's work.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}{{sfn|Lee|1996}}\n\nIn spite of Malotki's refutation, the myth that \"the Hopi have no concept of time\" lived on in the popular literature. For example, in her 1989 novel ''[[Sexing the Cherry]]'', [[Jeanette Winterson]] wrote of the Hopi: \"...their language has no grammar in the way we recognize it. And most bizarre of all, they have no tenses for past, present and future. They do not sense time in that way. For them time is one.\"{{sfn|Winterson|1989|p=140}} And the myth continues to be an integral part of [[New Age]] thinking that draws on stereotypical depictions of \"timeless Hopi culture\".{{sfn|Geertz|1994}}<ref>See for example {{harvcoltxt|Braden|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Griscom|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Pinchbeck|2007}}</ref>\n\nSome linguists working on Universals of [[semantics]], such as [[Anna Wierzbicka]] and [[Cliff Goddard]], argue that there is a [[Natural Semantic Metalanguage]] that has a basic vocabulary of semantic ''primes'' including concepts such as {{smallcaps|time, when, before, after}}. They have argued that Malotki's data show that the Hopi share these primes with English and all other languages, even though it is also clear that the precise way in which these concepts fit into the larger pattern of culture and language practices is different in each language, as illustrated by the differences between Hopi and English.{{sfn|Goddard|Wierzbicka|2002|pp=18-19}}\n\nSome investigators of Puebloan [[Ethnoastronomy|astronomical knowledge]] have taken a compromise position, noting that while Malotki's study of Hopi temporal concepts and timekeeping practices \"has clearly refuted Whorf's assertion that Hopi is a 'timeless' language, and in doing so has destroyed Whorf's strongest example for linguistic relativity, he presents no naively [[positivist]] assertion of the total independence of language and thought.\"{{sfn|McCluskey|1985|p= 155}}\n\nMalotki's work has been criticized by relativist scholars for failing to engage with Whorf's actual argument. [[John A. Lucy]] argues that Malotki's critique misses the fact that Whorf's point was exactly that the way in which the Hopi language grammatically structurates the representation of time leads to a different conception of time than the English one, not that they do not have one.{{sfn|Lucy|1996}} Lucy notes that when Whorf makes his strong claim about what it is that Hopi lacks, he consistently puts the word \"time\" in scare quotes, and uses the qualifier \"what we call\".{{sfn|Lucy1992b|p=286}} Lucy and others take this as evidence that Whorf was implying specifically that what the Hopi lacked was a concept that corresponds entirely to that denoted by the English word, i.e. he was making a point of showing that the concepts of time were different. Malotki himself acknowledges that the conceptualizations are different, but because he ignores Whorf's use of scare quotes, takes Whorf to be arguing that the Hopi have no concept of time at all.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|p=180}}{{sfn|Levinson|2012|p=xii}}\n\nIn 1991 Penny Lee published a comparison of Malotki and Whorf's analyses of the adverbial word class that Whorf had called \"tensors\". She argues that Whorf's analysis captured aspects of Hopi grammar that were not captured by simply describing tensors as falling within the class of temporal adverbs.{{sfn|Lee|1991}}\n\nIn 2006 anthropologist [[David Dinwoodie]] published a severe critique of Malotki's work, questioning his methods and his presentation of data as well as his analysis. Dinwoodie argues that Malotki fails to adequately support his claim of having demonstrated that the Hopi have a concept of time \"as we know it\".{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006|p=341}} He provides ethnographic examples of how some Hopi speakers explain the way they experience the difference between a traditional Hopi way of experiencing time as tied closely to cycles of ritual and natural events, and the Anglo-American concept of clock-time or school-time.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}}\n\n===Language, time and cognition===\nSparked by the Hopi debate about time a number of studies about how different languages grammaticalize tense and conceptualize time have been carried out. Some of these studies in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[cognitive linguistics]] have found some evidence that there may be significant differences in how speakers of different languages conceptualize time, although not necessarily in the way Whorf claimed for the Hopi. Specifically, it has been shown that some cultural groups conceptualize the flow of time in a direction opposite to what is usual for speakers of English and other [[Indo-European languages]], i.e. that the future is in front of the speaker and the past behind.{{sfn|N\u00fa\u00f1ez|Sweetser|2006}}{{sfn|Dahl|1995}} It has also been found that not all languages have a grammatical category of tense: some instead use combinations of adverbs and grammatical aspect to locate events in time.{{sfn|Bittner|2005}}{{sfn|Smith|2008}}{{sfn|Tonhauser|2011}}\nLooked at from the perspective of the [[History of Science]], Hopi conceptions of time and space, which underlie their well-developed observational solar calendar, raise the question of how to translate Hopi conceptions into terms intelligible to Western ears.{{sfn|McCluskey|1987|p= 210}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Language and thought]]\n* [[Linguistic determinism]]\n* [[Linguistic relativity]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes|colwidth=30em}}\n:{{cite journal|last=Bittner|first=Maria|year=2005|title=Future discourse in a tenseless language|journal=Journal of Semantics |volume=12|pages=339\u2013388|doi=10.1093/jos/ffh029|issue=4|ref=harv}}\n:{{cite journal|last=Boroditsky|first=L.|year=2000|title=Metaphoric structuring: Understanding time through spatial metaphors|journal=Cognition|volume=75|issue=1|pages=1\u201328|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(99)00073-6|pmid=10815775|citeseerx=10.1.1.11.5402}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Black|first=Max|authorlink=Max Black|year=1959|title=Linguistic Relativity: The Views of Benjamin Lee Whorf|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=68|issue=2|pages=228\u2013238 | ref = harv | doi = 10.2307/2182168 |jstor=2182168}}\n: {{cite book|last=Braden|first=Gregg|year=2009|title=Fractal Time: The Secret of 2012 and a New World Age|url=https://archive.org/details/fractaltimesecre00brad|url-access=registration|publisher=Hay House|ref=harv}}\n:{{cite book|last=Bybee|first=J.

In popular discourse the debate is often framed as a question about whether the [[Hopi people|Hopi]] \"had a concept of time\", despite it now being well established that they do.\n\nThe debate originated in the 1940s when American linguist [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] argued that the Hopi conceptualized time differently from the [[Standard Average European]] speaker, and that this difference correlated with grammatical differences between the languages.{{sfn|Carroll|1956}} Whorf argued that Hopi has \"no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time'\", and concluded that the Hopi had \"no general notion or intuition of time as a smooth flowing continuum in which everything in the universe proceeds at equal rate, out of a future, through the present, into a past\".{{sfn|Whorf|1956b|p=57}} Whorf used the Hopi concept of time as a primary example of his concept of linguistic relativity, which posits that the way in which individual languages encode information about the world, influences and correlates with the cultural [[world view]] of the speakers.  Whorf's relativist views fell out of favor in [[linguistics]] and [[anthropology]] in the 1960s, but Whorf's statement lived on in the popular literature often in the form of an [[urban myth]] that \"the Hopi have no concept of time\". In 1983 linguist [[Ekkehart Malotki]] published a 600-page study of the [[grammatical tense|grammar of time]] in the Hopi language, concluding that he had finally refuted Whorf's claims about the language.{{sfn|Malotki|1983}} Malotki's treatise gave hundreds of examples of Hopi words and grammatical forms referring to temporal relations. Malotki's central claim was that the Hopi do indeed conceptualize time as structured in terms of an ego-centered spatial progression from past, through present into the future. He also demonstrated that the Hopi language grammaticalizes tense using a distinction between future and non-future tenses, as opposed to the English tense system, which is usually analyzed as being based on a past/non-past distinction. Many took Malotki's work as a definitive refutation of the linguistic relativity hypothesis.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}} Linguist and specialist in the linguistic typology of tense [[Bernard Comrie]] concluded that \"Malotki's presentation and argumentation are devastating\".{{sfn|Comrie|1984|p=132}} Psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], a well-known critic of Whorf and the concept of linguistic relativity, accepted Malotki's claims as having demonstrated Whorf's complete ineptitude as a linguist.{{sfn|Pinker|1994|p=63}}\n\nSubsequently, the study of linguistic relativity was revived using new approaches in the 1990s,{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}{{sfn|Reines|Prinze|2009}} and Malotki's study came under criticism from relativist linguists and anthropologists, who did not consider that the study invalidated Whorf's claims.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}}{{sfn|Lee|1996}}{{sfn|Lee|1991}}{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|p=180-88}} The main issue of contention is the interpretation of Whorf's original claims about Hopi, and what exactly it was that he was claiming made Hopi different from what Whorf called \"[[Standard Average European]]\" languages.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}} Some consider that the Hopi language may be best described as a [[tenseless language]], and that the distinction between non-future and future posited by Malotki may be better understood as a distinction between ''realis'' and ''irrealis'' [[grammatical mood|moods]].{{sfn|Comrie|1984}} Regardless of exactly how the Hopi concept of time is best analyzed, most specialists agree with Malotki that all humans conceptualize time by an analogy with space, although some recent studies have also questioned this.{{sfn|Evans|2004}}{{sfn|Sinha|Sinha|Zinken|Sampaio|2011}}\n\n==The Hopi language==\nThe [[Hopi language]] is a [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American language]] of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language family]], which is spoken by some 5,000 [[Hopi people]] in the [[Hopi Reservation]] in Northeastern [[Arizona]], US.\n\nIn the large ''[[Hopi Dictionary: Hop\u00ecikwa Lav\u00e0ytutuveni|Hopi dictionary]]'' there is no word exactly corresponding to the English noun \"time\". Hopi employs different words to refer to \"a duration of time\" (''p\u00e0asa''' \"for that long\"), to a point in time (''p\u00e0asat'' \"at that time\"), and time as measured by a clock (''pah\u00e0ntawa''), as an occasion to do something (''hisat'' or ''qeni''), a turn or the appropriate time for doing something (''qeniptsi'' (noun)), and to have time for something (''aw n\u00e1naptsiwta'' (verb)).{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=854}}\n\nTime reference can be marked on verbs using the suffix ''-ni''\n:''Momoyam piktota'' \"The women are/were making ''[[piki]]''\"\n: Women piki-make\n:''Momoyam piktota-ni''''' \"The women will be making ''piki''\"{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=878}}\n:Women piki-make-NI\n\nThe -ni suffix is also used in the word ''naato'''ni'''qa'' which means \"that which will happen yet\" in reference to the future. This word is formed from the adverb ''naato'' \"yet\", the ''-ni'' suffix and the clitic -qa that forms a [[relative clause]] with the meaning \"that which...\".{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=281}}\n\nThe -''ni'' suffix is also obligatory on the main verb in [[Conditional mood|conditional]] clauses:{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=155}}\n\n:''Kur nu' pam tuwa nu' wuuvata-ni''''' \"if I see him I'll run away\"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=155}}\n:If I him see I run-NI\n\nThe suffix is also used in conditional{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=157}} clauses referring to a past context then often combined with the particle ''as'' that carries past tense or [[Counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] meaning, or describes unachieved intent:{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=143}}\n:''Pam nuy tuw\u00e1q nu' so'on as wayaa'''ni''''' \"If he had seen me I wouldn't have run\"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=157}}\n:he me see I Neg Past/Counterfact. run-NI\n\n:''Nu' sayti'''ni''''' \"I will smile\"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=143}}\n:I smile-NI\n\n:''Nu' as sayti'''ni''''' \"I tried to smile/I should smile/I wanted to smile/I was going to smile\"{{sfn|Kalectaca|1978|p=143}}\n:I Past/Counterfact. smile\n\nThe suffix ''-ngwu'' describes actions taking place habitually or as a general rule.\n:''T\u00f6m\u00f6' taawa tatkyaqw y\u00e1ma'''ngwu''''' \"In the winter the sun rises in the southeast\"{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=878}}\n\n==Benjamin Lee Whorf==\nBenjamin Lee Whorf (1897\u20131941), a fire prevention engineer by profession, studied Native American linguistics from an early age. He corresponded with many of the greatest scholars of his time, such as [[Alfred Tozzer]] at Harvard and Herbert Spinden of the American Museum of Natural History. They were impressed with his work on the linguistics of the [[Nahuatl language]] and encouraged him to participate professionally and to undertake field research in Mexico. In 1931 [[Edward Sapir]], the foremost expert on Native American languages, started teaching at [[Yale University|Yale]], close to where Whorf lived, and Whorf signed up for graduate-level classes with Sapir, becoming one of his most respected students.{{sfn|Carroll|1956|p=''passim''}} Whorf took a special interest in the [[Hopi language]] and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village on the [[Second Mesa]] of the [[Hopi Reservation]] in [[Arizona]], who was living in the [[Manhattan]] borough of New York City. At this time it was common for linguists to base their descriptions of a language on data from a single speaker. Whorf credited Naquayouma as the source of most of his information on the Hopi language, although in 1938 he took a short field trip to the village of Mishongnovi on the [[Second Mesa]], collecting some additional data.<ref name=\"Dinwoodie\">{{harvcoltxt|Dinwoodie|2006|p=346}}</ref>\n\nWhorf published several articles on Hopi grammar, focusing particularly on the ways in which the grammatical categories of Hopi encoded information about events and processes, and how this correlated with aspects of Hopi culture and behavior. After his death his full sketch of Hopi grammar was published by his friend the linguist [[Harry Hoijer]], and some essays on Native American linguistics, many of which had been previously published in academic journals, were published in 1956 in the anthology ''Language, Thought, and Reality'' by his friend psychologist [[John Bissell Carroll]].{{sfn|Carroll|1956}}\n\n===Whorf on Hopi time===\nWhorf's most frequently cited statement regarding Hopi time is the strongly worded introduction of his 1936 paper \"An American Indian model of the Universe\", which was first published posthumously in Carroll's edited volume. Here he writes that\n\n{{quote|I find it gratuitous to assume that a Hopi who knows only the Hopi language and the cultural ideas of his own society has the same notions, often supposed to be intuitions, of time and space as we have, and that are generally assumed to be universal. In particular he has no notion or intuition of {{Smallcaps|time}} as a smooth flowing continuum in which everything in the universe proceeds at an equal rate, out of a future into a present and into a past&nbsp;.... After a long and careful analysis the Hopi language is seen to contain no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time', or to past, present or future ...|{{harvcoltxt|Whorf|1956b|p=57}}}}\n\nWhorf argues that in Hopi units of time are not represented by nouns, but by adverbs or verbs. Whorf argues that all Hopi nouns include the notion of a boundary or outline, and that consequently the Hopi language does not refer to abstract concepts with nouns. This, Whorf argues, is encoded in Hopi grammar, which does not allow durations of time to be counted in the same way objects are. So instead of saying, for example, \"three days\", Hopi would say the equivalent of \"on the third day\", using ordinal numbers. Whorf argues that the Hopi do not consider the process of time passing to produce another new day, but merely as bringing back the daylight aspect of the world.{{sfn|Whorf|1956e|pp=148-52}}\n\n====Hopi as a tenseless language====\nWhorf gives slightly different analyses of the grammatical encoding of time in Hopi in his different writings. His first published writing on Hopi grammar was the paper \"The punctual and segmentative aspects of verbs in Hopi\", published in 1936 in ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', the journal of the [[Linguistic Society of America]].{{sfn|Whorf|1956a}} Here Whorf analyzed Hopi as having a tense system with a distinction between three tenses: one used for past or present events (which Whorf calls the ''Factual'' tense or ''present-past''); one for future events; and one for events that are generally or universally true (here called ''usitative''). This analysis was repeated in a 1937 letter to J. B. Carroll, who later published it as part of his selected writings under the title \"Discussion of Hopi Linguistics\".{{sfn|Whorf|1956c|p=103|quote=\"There are three tenses: past (i.e. past up to and including the present), future and generalized (that which is generally, universally or timelessly true), all of which are mutually exclusive\"}}\n\nIn the 1938 paper \"Some verbal categories of Hopi\", also published in ''Language'', Whorf abandoned the word \"tense\" in the description of Hopi and described the distinction previously called \"tense\" with the label \"assertions\". Whorf described assertions as a system of categories that describe the speaker's claim of [[epistemic]] validity of his own statement. The three \"assertions\" of Hopi described by Whorf are the ''Reportive'', ''Expective'' and ''Nomic'' forms of the Hopi verb. Whorf acknowledges that these \"translate more or less [as] the English tenses\", but maintains that these forms do not refer to time or duration, but rather to the speaker's claim of the validity of the statement.{{sfn|Whorf|1938|p=276|quote=\"What we call present tense (not counting our present form which corresponds to the nomic) is from the Hopi standpoint simply a report to others concerning a situation shared with them, this report being either redundant information, or used to call attention to, or tell about some fragment of the situation not fully shared. Thus to the Hopi 'he is running'\nneed not be different from 'he was running', for if both the speaker and listener can see the runner then the 'is' of the former sentence means merely that the listener can see for himself what he is being told; he is being given redundant information, and this is the only difference from the latter sentence.\"}} The reportive form is unmarked, whereas the expective form is marked with the verbal suffix ''-ni'', and the nomic form with the suffix ''-\u014b\u02b7i''. In Whorf's analysis, by using the reportive form the speaker claims that the event has in fact occurred or is still occurring, whereas by using the expective form the speaker describes an expectation of a future event. Whorf says that the expective can be used to describe events in the past, giving the meaning of \"was going to\" or \"would\".{{sfn|Whorf|1938|pp=276-278}}\n\nIn the 1940 article \"Science and Linguistics\", Whorf gave the same three-way classification based on the speaker's assertion of the validity of his statement: \"The timeless Hopi verb does not distinguish between the present, past and future of the event itself but must always indicate what type of validity the {{smallcaps|speaker}} intends the statement to have: a. report of an event .. b. expectation of an event ..; generalization or law about events.\"{{sfn|Whorf|1956f|p=217}}\n\nIn his full sketch of Hopi grammar published posthumously in 1946, Whorf also described how adverbial particles contributed to the linguistic description of time in Hopi.{{sfn|Whorf|1946}} He posited two subclasses of adverbs called ''temporals'' and ''tensors'', which were used in sentences to locate events in time. A central claim in Whorf's work on linguistic relativity was that for the Hopi units of time were not considered objects that can be counted like most of the comparable English words that are described by [[noun]]s (''a day'', ''an hour'' etc.). He argued that only the Hopi word for \"year\" was a noun, the words for days and nights were ambivalent between noun and verbs, but that all other cyclic events and periods were described by adverbial particles used as modifiers for the sentence {{sfn|Whorf|1946|p=165|quote=\"Names of cyclic events and time periods, like summer, morning, full moon are in the class of temporals, a kind of adverbs. They mean e.g. \"when it is summer\" and are used to qualify predicates. They are not used as subjects, objects or at all as nouns.\"}}\n<!--(temporals and tensors are a subclass of the analytic word class (adverbial particles))\naspect (Add to this that these aspects may compound together, and that all but the durative and continuative handle ideas that are utterly strange, to English or indeed Indo-European...{{sfn|Whorf|1946|p=175}}): ingressive punctual or punctualizing (moment of completion, passage from latency into manifestation), and tensive or tensivizing, durative, segmentative (repeating), -->\n\n===Whorf's inspiration from Einsteinian physics===\nIn his interpretation of Hopi time Whorf was influenced by [[Einstein]]'s theory of relativity, which was developed in the first decades of the century and impacted the general Zeitgeist.<ref>Frank Heynick 1983 \"From Einstein to Whorf: space, time, matter and reference frames in physical and linguistic relativity.\" Semiotica, 45 (1-2).</ref>  Whorf, an engineer by profession, in fact made occasional reference to physical relativity, and he adopted the term \"linguistic relativity,\" reflecting the general concept of the different but equally valid interpretations of some aspects of physical reality by different observers due to differences in their (for Einstein) physical circumstances or (for Whorf) their psychological-linguistic circumstances.\n\nThe most salient points involve the concepts of ''simultaneity'' and ''spacetime''. In his [[Annus Mirabilis Papers#Special relativity|1905 Special Relativity]] paper, Einstein maintained that two given events can legitimately be called simultaneous if and only if they take place at the same point in time '''and''' in the same point in space. No two events which take place at a spatial distance from one another can legitimately be declared to be simultaneous in any absolute sense, for the judgement of simultaneity or non-simultaneity will depend on the physical circumstances (to be exact: the relative motion) of the observers. This difference is no artifact; each of the observers is correct (and is wrong only to the extent he or she insists that another observer is incorrect).\n\n[[Hermann Minkowski]], in his seminal 1908 address to the Congress of German Physicists, translated Einstein's 1905 mathematical equations into geometric terms. Minkowski famously declared:\n\n<blockquote>\"Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.\"<ref>Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.43.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSpatial distance and temporal distance between any two events was now replaced by a single absolute distance in spacetime.\n\nHeynick points to several passages in Whorf's writings on the Hopis which parallel Einsteinian concepts such as:\n\n<blockquote>\"time varies with each observer and does not permit of simultaneity\" (1940)<ref>Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.42.</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"The Hopi metaphysics does not raise the question whether the things at a distant village exist at the same moment as those in one's own village, for it ... says that any 'events' in the distant village can be compared to any events in one's own village only by an interval of magnitude that has both time and space forms in it.\" (c.1936) <ref>Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.42. Heynick is careful to point out that he has selectively cited such passages and that in the broader context of Whorf's writing it would be inaccurate to assume that Whorf simply presents the Hopis as pre-Einstein Einsteins in their conception of time.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe concept of a \"simultaneous now\" throughout the cosmos was formulated by [[Aristotle]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and most succinctly in [[John Locke]]'s ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1690):\n\n<blockquote>\"For this moment is common to all things that are now in being ... they all exist in the same moment of time.\"</blockquote>\n\nWhorf saw this notion as derived from the Standard Average European languages in which these thinkers thought: \"Newtonian space, time, and matter are no intuitions. They are recepts from culture and language. That is where Newton got them.\"<ref>Quoted in Heynick 1983, p.46.</ref>\n\nHeynick, who claimed no personal knowledge of the Hopi language, posits alternative weaker and stronger interpretations of the influence of Einsteinian relativity on Whorf's analysis of the Hopi language and the Hopi concept of time. In the weaker version, the (then) new questioning of the nature of time and space brought about by the Einsteinian revolution in physics enabled Whorf to approach the Hopis and their language unburdened by traditional Western concepts and presumptions. The stronger version is that Whorf under the influence of Einstein tended inadvertently to \"read into\" his linguistic and cultural data relativistic concepts where they perhaps were not.<ref>Heynick also analyzes Whorf's concepts of \"eventing\" and the nature of matter in the language of the Hopis (and the Nooktas), and their parallels in modern physics. These relate only peripherally to the Hopi time controversy.</ref>\n\n==The myth of the timeless Hopi==\nWhorf died in 1941, but his ideas took on their own life in academia and in the popular discourse on Native Americans. In 1958 [[Stuart Chase]]\u2014an economist and engineer at MIT who had followed Whorf's ideas with great interest, but whom Whorf himself considered utterly incompetent and incapable of understanding the nuances of his ideas{{sfn|Lee|1996|p=16}}\u2014published \"Some things worth knowing: a generalist's guide to useful knowledge\". Here he repeated Whorf's claim about Hopi time, but arguing that because of the Hopi view of time as a process, they were better able to understand the concept of time as a [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]].{{sfn|Deutscher|2010|p=141-43}} Similarly, even scientists were intrigued by the thought that the idea of spatio-temporal unity that had taken [[Albert Einstein]] seven years to ponder, was readily available to the Hopi, simply because of the grammar of their language.{{sfn|Livingston|1963|p=16}}\n\nIn 1964 [[John Greenway (folklorist)|John Greenway]] published a humorous portrait of American culture, ''The Inevitable Americans'', in which he wrote: \"You have a watch, because Americans are obsessed with time. If you were a Hopi Indian, you would have none, the Hopi have no concept of time\".{{sfn|Greenway|1964|p=9}} And even the 1971 ethnography of the Hopi by Euler and Dobyns claimed that \"The English concept of time is nearly incomprehensible to the Hopi\".{{sfn|Euler|Dobyns|1971|p=21}} The myth quickly became a staple element of [[New Age]] conceptualizations of the Hopi.{{sfn|Geertz|1994}}\n\n==Max Black and Helmut Gipper==\nIn 1959 philosopher [[Max Black]] published a critique of Whorf's arguments in which he argued that the principle of linguistic relativity was obviously wrong because translation between languages is always possible, even when there are no exact correspondences between the single words or concepts in the two languages.{{sfn|Black|1959}}\n\nGerman linguist and philosopher Helmut Gipper had studied with the neo-[[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldtian]] linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] and had a basically Kantian understanding of the relation between language and thought. [[Immanuel Kant]] considered the categories of time and space to be universals underlying all human thinking.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|pp=179-180, 186-87}} Whorf's argument that the Hopi do not conceive of time and space as speakers of [[Indo-European languages]] do clashed with this basic understanding of cognition. Gipper went to the Hopi reservation to collect data for a general critique of Whorf's principle of linguistic relativity published in 1972. His critique included a refutation of Whorf's Hopi arguments. Gipper showed that the Hopi could refer to time, by juxtaposing Hopi phrases with their German equivalents that used words referring to units of time and to distinctions between past and present. Gipper also argued that several time intervals were described by nouns, and that these nouns could take the role of syntactic subject or object, in contradiction of Whorf's explicit statement. He argues that Whorf's assertion that intervals of time are not counted in the same way as objects is \"questionable\".{{sfn|Gipper|1972}}\n\n==Ekkehart Malotki==\n[[Ekkehart Malotki]] studied with Gipper at the [[University of M\u00fcnster|Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t]] at [[M\u00fcnster]] and his work was a continuation of his mentor's, spurred on by the frequent claims in the popular literature that \"the Hopi have no concept of time\". Malotki conducted four years of research on the [[Third Mesa]], studying Hopi spatial and temporal reference. He published two large volumes, one in German, ''Hopi-Raum''{{sfn|Malotki|1979}} [Hopi space] and one in English, ''Hopi Time''.{{sfn|Malotki|1983}} For Malotki it was imperative to demonstrate two facts in contradiction of Whorf's claims: 1. that the Hopi language has an abundance of terms, words and constructions that refer to time. 2. that the Hopi do cognitively conceptualize time in analogy with physical space, using spatial metaphors to describe durations and units of time. He also wanted to demonstrate that Whorf misanalyzed several particularities regarding specific Hopi words and expressions. Malotki states that a main goal is to present \"actual Hopi language data\", since when he was writing very little textual data in Hopi had been published, and Whorf's publications were largely without text examples.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=629}} ''Hopi Time'' opens with a quotation drawn from his extensive field work, which directly challenges Whorf's claim of a lack of temporal terms in the Hopi language: \"Then [''pu\u2019''] indeed, the following day, quite early in the morning at the hour when people pray to the sun, around that time then [''pu\u2019''] he woke up the girl again.\"{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=[vii]}}\n\n===''Hopi Time'' (1983)===\nMost of ''Hopi Time'' is dedicated to the detailed description of the Hopi usage of words and constructions related to time. Malotki describes in detail the usage of a large amount of linguistic material:  temporal adverbs, time units, time counting practices such as the Hopi calendar, the way that days are counted and time is measured.\n\nThe first part of the book describes \"spatio-temporal metaphors\"; in it he shows several deictic adverbs that are used both to reference distance in space and in time, such as the word ''ep'' that means both \"there\" and \"then\". In the second chapter he describes the way in which the Hopi talk about units of time. He argues that in some contexts, specifically those of the ceremonial cycle, the Hopi do count days, using compound words such as ''payistala'' \"the third day (of a ceremony)\" composed of the morphemes ''paayo'' \"three\", ''s'' \"times\" and ''taala''' \"day/light\", meaning literally \"three-times-day\".{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=246}} He also shows that the Hopi reckon time through the movement of the sun, having distinct words for the different degrees of light during the dawn and dusk periods. He also notes that the feeling of time passing can be described by saying \"the sun moves slowly/quickly\". Parts 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe Hopi time-keeping practices using the sun relative to the horizon, using the stars, the ceremonial calendar and the use of time-keeping devices such as knotted strings or notched sticks with a mark or knot for every day, sun-hole alignment and shadow observation. The eighth chapter describes the temporal particles that Whorf defined as temporals and tensors. He argues that Whorf's descriptions are vague and alienating.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=531}}\n\n====Malotki on tense in Hopi====\nThe concept of Hopi tense is covered in the last part of chapter 9, titled \"miscellaneous\", and in the conclusion. Malotki follows Gipper in arguing that time is a natural category and that it is naturally experienced in terms of past, present and future, even though many languages do not necessarily grammaticalize all of these distinctions.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=625}} He analyzes the Hopi ''-ni'' suffix as marking the future tense. He argues that since there is no grammatical distinction between past and present, Hopi has a future-nonfuture tense system. Malotki distinguishes between primary and secondary functions of the -ni suffix, arguing that its primary function is temporal reference and that its many modal functions such as [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[hortative]] and [[desiderative]] are of secondary importance. {{quote|text=As it turns out from among the numerous suffixes that the Hopi verb can select to mark the grammatical categories of aspect, mode and tense, one is specifically reserved to refer to time, or rather the sequential ordering of events or states. This temporal marker is ''-ni'' whose referential force is futurity. Its temporal function is primary; however, in many contexts i-''ni'' also takes on a number of secondary, atemporal functions which essentially belong to the modal category (imperative, hortative, desiderative, etc.). Since no markers exist to point out present or past time, Hopi, like many other languages, can be said to be endowed with a future-nonfuture tense system.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=624}}}} Malotki does admit that the English and Hopi systems of tense are different since the English system distinguishes past from non-past, whereas Hopi distinguishes future from non-future.{{sfn|Malotki|1983|p=666}}\n\n==Further debates==\nSubsequent descriptions of Hopi grammar have maintained Malotki's distinction between an unmarked non-future tense and a future tense marked with the -''ni'' suffix, and a habitual aspect marked by the suffix -''ngwu''.{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=878}} The review by [[Bernard Comrie]], a well-known authority on the [[linguistic typology]] of [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], accepts that Malotki's work demonstrates that the Hopi do have a concept of time and that it is devastating for Whorf's strong claims. But Comrie also notes that Malotki's \"Claim that Hopi has a tense system based on the opposition of future and non-future&nbsp;... strikes me as questionable: given the wide range of modal uses of the so-called future, it is at least plausible that this is a modal rather than temporal distinction, with the result that Hopi would have no tense distinction.\"{{sfn|Comrie|1984|p=132}}\n\nLinguists and psychologists who work in the universalist tradition such as [[Steven Pinker]] and [[John McWhorter]], have seen Malotki's study as being the final proof that Whorf was an inept linguist and had no significant knowledge or understanding of the Hopi language.{{sfn|Pinker|1994}}{{sfn|Pinker|2007}}{{sfn|McWhorter|2009}}{{sfn|McWhorter|2010}} This interpretation has been criticized by relativist scholars as unfounded and based on a lack of knowledge of Whorf's work.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}{{sfn|Lee|1996}}\n\nIn spite of Malotki's refutation, the myth that \"the Hopi have no concept of time\" lived on in the popular literature. For example, in her 1989 novel ''[[Sexing the Cherry]]'', [[Jeanette Winterson]] wrote of the Hopi: \"...their language has no grammar in the way we recognize it. And most bizarre of all, they have no tenses for past, present and future. They do not sense time in that way. For them time is one.\"{{sfn|Winterson|1989|p=140}} And the myth continues to be an integral part of [[New Age]] thinking that draws on stereotypical depictions of \"timeless Hopi culture\".{{sfn|Geertz|1994}}<ref>See for example {{harvcoltxt|Braden|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Griscom|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Pinchbeck|2007}}</ref>\n\nSome linguists working on Universals of [[semantics]], such as [[Anna Wierzbicka]] and [[Cliff Goddard]], argue that there is a [[Natural Semantic Metalanguage]] that has a basic vocabulary of semantic ''primes'' including concepts such as {{smallcaps|time, when, before, after}}. They have argued that Malotki's data show that the Hopi share these primes with English and all other languages, even though it is also clear that the precise way in which these concepts fit into the larger pattern of culture and language practices is different in each language, as illustrated by the differences between Hopi and English.{{sfn|Goddard|Wierzbicka|2002|pp=18-19}}\n\nSome investigators of Puebloan [[Ethnoastronomy|astronomical knowledge]] have taken a compromise position, noting that while Malotki's study of Hopi temporal concepts and timekeeping practices \"has clearly refuted Whorf's assertion that Hopi is a 'timeless' language, and in doing so has destroyed Whorf's strongest example for linguistic relativity, he presents no naively [[positivist]] assertion of the total independence of language and thought.\"{{sfn|McCluskey|1985|p= 155}}\n\nMalotki's work has been criticized by relativist scholars for failing to engage with Whorf's actual argument. [[John A. Lucy]] argues that Malotki's critique misses the fact that Whorf's point was exactly that the way in which the Hopi language grammatically structurates the representation of time leads to a different conception of time than the English one, not that they do not have one.{{sfn|Lucy|1996}} Lucy notes that when Whorf makes his strong claim about what it is that Hopi lacks, he consistently puts the word \"time\" in scare quotes, and uses the qualifier \"what we call\".{{sfn|Lucy1992b|p=286}} Lucy and others take this as evidence that Whorf was implying specifically that what the Hopi lacked was a concept that corresponds entirely to that denoted by the English word, i.e. he was making a point of showing that the concepts of time were different. Malotki himself acknowledges that the conceptualizations are different, but because he ignores Whorf's use of scare quotes, takes Whorf to be arguing that the Hopi have no concept of time at all.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011|p=180}}{{sfn|Levinson|2012|p=xii}}\n\nIn 1991 Penny Lee published a comparison of Malotki and Whorf's analyses of the adverbial word class that Whorf had called \"tensors\". She argues that Whorf's analysis captured aspects of Hopi grammar that were not captured by simply describing tensors as falling within the class of temporal adverbs.{{sfn|Lee|1991}}\n\nIn 2006 anthropologist [[David Dinwoodie]] published a severe critique of Malotki's work, questioning his methods and his presentation of data as well as his analysis. Dinwoodie argues that Malotki fails to adequately support his claim of having demonstrated that the Hopi have a concept of time \"as we know it\".{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006|p=341}} He provides ethnographic examples of how some Hopi speakers explain the way they experience the difference between a traditional Hopi way of experiencing time as tied closely to cycles of ritual and natural events, and the Anglo-American concept of clock-time or school-time.{{sfn|Dinwoodie|2006}}\n\n===Language, time and cognition===\nSparked by the Hopi debate about time a number of studies about how different languages grammaticalize tense and conceptualize time have been carried out. Some of these studies in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[cognitive linguistics]] have found some evidence that there may be significant differences in how speakers of different languages conceptualize time, although not necessarily in the way Whorf claimed for the Hopi. Specifically, it has been shown that some cultural groups conceptualize the flow of time in a direction opposite to what is usual for speakers of English and other [[Indo-European languages]], i.e. that the future is in front of the speaker and the past behind.{{sfn|N\u00fa\u00f1ez|Sweetser|2006}}{{sfn|Dahl|1995}} It has also been found that not all languages have a grammatical category of tense: some instead use combinations of adverbs and grammatical aspect to locate events in time.{{sfn|Bittner|2005}}{{sfn|Smith|2008}}{{sfn|Tonhauser|2011}}\nLooked at from the perspective of the [[History of Science]], Hopi conceptions of time and space, which underlie their well-developed observational solar calendar, raise the question of how to translate Hopi conceptions into terms intelligible to Western ears.{{sfn|McCluskey|1987|p= 210}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Language and thought]]\n* [[Linguistic determinism]]\n* [[Linguistic relativity]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes|colwidth=30em}}\n:{{cite journal|last=Bittner|first=Maria|year=2005|title=Future discourse in a tenseless language|journal=Journal of Semantics |volume=12|pages=339\u2013388|doi=10.1093/jos/ffh029|issue=4|ref=harv}}\n:{{cite journal|last=Boroditsky|first=L.|year=2000|title=Metaphoric structuring: Understanding time through spatial metaphors|journal=Cognition|volume=75|issue=1|pages=1\u201328|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(99)00073-6|pmid=10815775|citeseerx=10.1.1.11.5402}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Black|first=Max|authorlink=Max Black|year=1959|title=Linguistic Relativity: The Views of Benjamin Lee Whorf|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=68|issue=2|pages=228\u2013238 | ref = harv | doi = 10.2307/2182168 |jstor=2182168}}\n: {{cite book|last=Braden|first=Gregg|year=2009|title=Fractal Time: The Secret of 2012 and a New World Age|url=https://archive.org/details/fractaltimesecre00brad|url-access=registration|publisher=Hay House|ref=harv}}\n:{{cite book|last=Bybee|first=J.

Ethiopia reacquired a coastline on the [[Red Sea]] in 1950 and created the [[Ethiopian Navy]] in 1955. [[Eritrea]]'s independence in 1991 left Ethiopia landlocked again, but the Ethiopian Navy continued to operate from foreign ports until it finally was disbanded in 1996.\n\n==History of the Army==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2009}}\nThe Ethiopian army's origins and military traditions date back to the earliest [[history of Ethiopia]]. Due to Ethiopia's location between the Middle East and Africa, it has long been in the middle of Eastern and Western politics, and has been subject to foreign invasion and aggression. In 1579, the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s attempt to expand from a coastal base at [[Massawa]] was defeated.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rising Tide of Cultural Pluralism: The Nation-State at Bay?|last=Rothchild|first=Donald|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=139}}</ref> The [[Army of the Ethiopian Empire]] was also able to defeat the Egyptians in 1876 at [[Battle of Gura|Gura]], led by Ethiopian Emperor [[Yohannes IV]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethiopiantreasures.co.uk/pages/yohannes.htm|title=Emperor Yohannes IV (1872-1889)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Clapham wrote in the 1980s that the \"Abyssinians [had suffered] from a 'superiority complex' which may be traced to Gundet, Gura and Adwa\".<ref>Clapham, Christopher 1987.

Leontiev formed the first regular battalion, the kernel of which became the company of volunteers from the former [[Senegal]] shooters, which he chose and invited from Western Africa, with training of the Russian and French officers.

It maintained Ethiopia's existence as an independent state. Fought on 1 March 1896 against the Kingdom of Italy near the town of [[Adwa]], it was the decisive battle of the First Italo\u2013Ethiopian War.

The Ethiopian army became more effective against British colonial forces. The numerous expeditions of Ethiopian forces stopped colonial expansion. As the Russian [[Alexander Bulatovich]], one of the Russian military advisers and a participant in the expedition of the legendary army of Ras Wolde Giyorgis, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"Many consider the Abyssinian army to be undisciplined. They think that it is not in any condition to withstand a serious fight with a well-organized European army, claiming that the recent war with Italy doesn't prove anything. I will not begin to guess the future, and will say only this. Over the course of four months, I watched this army closely. It is unique in the world. And I can bear witness to the fact that it is not quite so chaotic as it seems at first glance, and that on the contrary, it is profoundly disciplined, though in its own unique way. For every Abyssinian, war is normal business, and military skills and rules of army life in the field enter in the flesh and blood of each of them, just as do the main principles of tactics. On the march, each soldier knows how to arrange necessary comforts for himself and to conserve his strength; but on the other hand, when necessary, he shows such endurance and is capable of action in conditions which are difficult even to imagine.\nYou see remarkable expediency in all the actions and skills of this army; and each soldier has an amazingly intelligent attitude toward managing the mission of the battle.\nDespite such qualities, because of its impetuousness, it is much more difficult to control this army than a well-drilled European army, and I can only marvel at and admire the skill of its leaders and chiefs, of which there is no shortage.\"<ref name=\"samizdat.com\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn obedience to the agreement with Russia and the order of Menelik II, First Ethiopian officers began to be trained at the First Russian cadet school in 1901. 30 to 40 Ethiopian officers were trained in Russia from 1901 until 1913.\n\n===Under Haile Selassie I===\n[[File:Ethiopian camel troops.jpg|thumb|right|Ethiopian troops transporting supplies by camel through vegetation during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].]]\n{{Further|Ethiopian Order of Battle Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nModernization of the army took place under the regency of Tafari Mekonnen, who later reigned as Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]]. He created an [[Imperial Bodyguard]], the ''[[Kebur Zabagna]]'', in 1917 from the earlier ''[[Mahal Safari]]'' who had traditionally attended the Ethiopian Emperor. Its elite were trained at the French [[military academy]] at [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] or by Belgian military advisers. He also created his own military school at [[Oletta Military Academy|Holeta]] in January 1935.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=273}}\n\nEthiopian military aviation efforts were initiated in 1929, when Tafari Mekonnen hired two French pilots and purchased four French biplanes.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=279}} By the time of the Italian invasion of 1935, the air force had four pilots and thirteen aircraft.\n\nHowever, these efforts were not sufficient nor instituted in enough time to stop the rising tide of [[Italian fascism]]. Ethiopia lost its independence in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] of 1935-36, marked for the first time Ethiopia was colonized by a foreign power. The country regained its independence after the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|1941 East African Campaign]] of [[World War II]] with the intervention of British and British imperial forces. After the Italians had been driven from the country, a British Military Mission to Ethiopia (BMME), under Major General Stephen Butler, was established to reorganise the Ethiopian Army.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=7}} The Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 1944 removed the BMME from the jurisdiction of [[East Africa Command]] at Nairobi and made it responsible to the Ethiopian Minister of War.<ref>Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay, 2006, 148.

A U.S. [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] was dispatched to Ethiopia, and began its work by reorganising the army into three divisions.

The US Army Handbook for Ethiopia notes that each service was provided with training and equipped from different foreign countries \"to assure reliability and retention of power.\"<ref name=\"Ottaway-45\">Cited in Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 45.</ref> The military consisted of the following: Imperial Bodyguard (also known as the \"First Division\", 8,000 men); three army divisions; services which included the Airborne, Engineers, and Signal Corps; the Territorial Army (5,000 men); and the police (28,000 men).<ref name=\"Ottaway-45\"/>\n\nAmong reported U.S. equipment deliveries to Ethiopia were 120 [[M59 armored personnel carrier|M59]] and 39 [[M75 armored personnel carrier|M75]] armoured personnel carriers.\n\n==Seizure of power by the Derg 1974 and aftermath==\nThe Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, Police, and Territorial Army, or the [[Derg]] ([[Amharic language|Amharic]] \"Committee\"), was officially announced 28 June 1974 by a group of military officers to maintain law and order due to the powerlessness of the civilian government following widespread [[mutiny]] in the armed forces of Ethiopia earlier that year. Its members were not directly involved in those mutinies, nor was this the first military committee organized to support the administration of Prime Minister [[Endelkachew Makonnen]]: [[Alem Zewde Tessema]] had established the [[Armed Forces Coordinated Committee]] on 23 March. However, over the following months radicals in the Ethiopian military came to believe he was acting on behalf of the hated aristocracy, and when a group of notables petitioned for the release of a number of government ministers and officials who were under arrest for corruption and other crimes, three days later the Derg was announced.<ref>Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 52</ref>\n\nThe Derg, which originally consisted of soldiers at the capital, broadened its membership by including representatives from the 40 units of the [[Ethiopian Army]], [[Ethiopian Air Force|Air Force]], [[Ethiopian Navy|Navy]], [[Kebur Zabagna]] (Imperial Guard), [[Territorial Army (Ethiopia)|Territorial Army]] and [[Law enforcement in Ethiopia|Police]]: each unit was expected to send three representatives, who were supposed to be privates, NCOs and junior officers up to the rank of major. According to Bahru Zewde, \"senior officers were deemed too compromised by close association to the regime.\"<ref name=\"Bahru-234\">Bahru Zewde, 2000, p. 234</ref>\n\nThe committee elected Major [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its chairman and Major [[Atnafu Abate]] as its vice-chairman.  The Derg was initially supposed to study the grievances of various military units, and investigate abuses by senior officers and staff, and to root out corruption in the military. In the months following its founding, the power of the Derg steadily increased. In July 1974 the Derg obtained key concessions from the Emperor, [[Haile Selassie]], which included the power to arrest not only military officers, but government officials at every level.  Soon both former Prime Ministers [[Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte-Wold]], and [[Endelkachew Makonnen]], along with most of their cabinets, most regional governors, many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court found themselves imprisoned.\n\nWhen the Derg gained control of Ethiopia, they lessened their reliance on the West. Instead they began to draw their equipment and their sources for organisational and training methods from the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Comecon]] countries, especially [[Cuba]]. During this period, Ethiopian forces were often locked in [[counter-insurgency]] campaigns against various [[guerrilla]] groups. They honed both conventional and guerrilla tactics during campaigns in Eritrea, and by repelling an invasion launched by [[Somalia]] in the 1977\u20131978 [[Ogaden War]].<ref>See Gebru Tareke, The Ethiopia-Somalia War of 1977 Revisited, [[The International Journal of African Historical Studies]], Vol. 33, No. 3 (2000), pp. 635-667.</ref>\n\nThe Ethiopian army grew considerably under the Derg (1974\u20131987), and the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] under Mengistu (1987\u20131991), especially during the latter regime. The [[Library of Congress]] estimated forces under arms in 1974 at 41,000.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} By July 1975 the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] was listing a mechanised division in addition to three infantry divisions.<ref>IISS 75-76, p.&nbsp;42</ref> Ayele writes that in November 1975, the \"Nabalbal\" (\"Flame\") force was created, subdivided into battalion-sized units of 400. Each battalion-sized unit was known as a ''hayl'' (force), and 20 were created within sixteen months.{{sfn|Ayele|2014p=55}} The \"Nabalbal\" units entered combat in 1977. When Ethiopian intelligence sources discovered Somali planning to seize the Ogaden, militia brigades were also created; first 30, then a total of 61 brigades totalling 143,350 by 1977-78.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=29-30}} It appears that there were five regular line divisions active by the time of the 1977 Ogaden War, and the [[Library of Congress]] estimated the force size at the time as 53,500. With significant Soviet assistance, after that point the army's size grew rapidly; in 1979 it was estimated at 65,000.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} The 18th and 19th Mountain Infantry Divisions were then established in 1979-80 originally to seize [[Nakfa, Eritrea|Nakfa]], in the [[Sahel (Eritrea)|Sahel Mountains]], one of the remaining strongholds of the Eritrean insurgents.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=31}} By the beginning of 1981 recruitment for the 21st and 22nd Mountain Infantry Divisions was underway; soon afterwards, preparations for the large [[Operation Red Star]] were stepping up.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=32-33}}\n\nIn April 1988 the Derg reorganised the army. The restoration of relations with Somalia meant that forces could be transferred from the First Revolutionary Army in the Ogaden, to the Second and [[Third Revolutionary Army|Third Revolutionary Armies]], the Third (TRA) being responsible for the provinces of Assab, Tigray, [[Wello]], [[Gondar]], and [[Gojjam]]. The very small Fourth Revolutionary Army became responsible not only for protecting the border with Kenya, but also those with Somalia and Sudan. In the place of the previous commands, thirteen [[corps]] were established instead, distributed amongst the army headquarters. Intensive efforts were made to enlist additional personnel. Total manpower after the reorganisation reached a reported 388,000.{{sfn|Fontanellaz|Cooper|2018|p=9}}\n\nIn May 1988 the Derg decided that before it could concentrate on destroying the EPLF, it would have to first eliminate the TPLF.{{sfn|Fontanellaz|Cooper|2018|p=13}} Thus Operation Adwa was devised to seize the main TPLF base at [[Adi Ramets]] in [[Gondar Province]]. The [[Third Revolutionary Army]]'s 603rd and 604th Corps were to play the main role, while the 605th Corps secured the rear, in [[Wello]]. The TRA's command structure was disrupted when Major General Mulatu Negash, the army commander, was supplanted by the arrival of Mengistu's favorite, Captain [[Lagesse Asfaw]].\n\nCuba provided a significant influx of military advisors and troops over this period, with the largest escalation during the Ogaden War with Somalia, supported by a Soviet airlift:{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=297-8}}\n* 1977\u20131978: 17,000 ([[Ogaden War]])\n* 1978: 12,000\n* 1984: 3,000\n* 1989: All forces withdrawn\n\n===1990-91 Order of Battle===\nGebru Tareke listed Ethiopian ground forces in 1990 as comprising four revolutionary armies organized as task forces, eleven corps, twenty-four infantry divisions, and four mountain divisions, reinforced by five mechanised divisions, two airborne divisions, and ninety-five brigades, including four mechanised brigades, three artillery brigades, four tank brigades, twelve special commando and paracommando brigades&nbsp;&ndash; including the Spartakiad, which became operational in 1987 under the preparation and guidance of North Koreans&nbsp;&ndash; seven [[Multiple rocket launcher|BM-rocket]] battalions, and ten brigades of paramilitary forces.<ref>Gebru Tareke, ''The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 120</ref>\n\nForces under arms were estimated at 230,000 in early 1991.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} Mengistu's People's Militia had also grown to about 200,000 members.

The war was fought over the disputed region of [[Badme]]. During the course of the war, some commanders and pilots from the former army and air force were recalled to duty. These officers helped turn the tide decisively against Eritrea in 2000. Following the war's end, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission, a body founded by the UN, established that the Badme region had in fact belonged to Eritrea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/NewLinks/eebcarbitration/ |title=Recent Additions |accessdate=27 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130110233/http://www.un.org/NewLinks/eebcarbitration/ |archivedate=January 30, 2011 }}</ref> Although the two countries are now at peace, Ethiopia rejected the results of the international court's decision, and continued to occupy Badme. Most observers agree that Ethiopia's rejection of international law, coupled with the high numbers of soldiers maintained on the border by each side&nbsp;&ndash; a debilitatingly high number, particularly for the Eritrean side&nbsp;&ndash; means that the two countries are effectively still in conflict.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the Ethiopian army began to train with the U.S. [[Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) established in [[Djibouti]]. Ethiopia allowed the US to station military advisors at [[Camp Hurso]].<ref name=\"US-TRAINERS-PREPARE-ETHIOPIANS-TO-FIGHT\">{{cite news|url=http://stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=41429&archive=true|title=U.S. trainers prepare Ethiopians to fight|newspaper=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|date=2006-12-30|accessdate=2007-01-14 }}</ref> Part of the training at Camp Hurso has included U.S. Army elements, including 4th Battalion, [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry]], training the 12th, 13th and 14th Division Reconnaissance Companies, which from July 2003 were being formed into a new Ethiopian anti-terrorism battalion.<ref>Memo: Meritorious Unit Commendation for 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry, 2d Brigade, 10th Mountain Division (LI), Fort Drum, NY 13602, from 2nd Brigade, 10th MD(LI), 21 January 2004, downloaded from Internet and accessed mid September 2007.</ref>\n\n====Somalia====\nEthiopian troops helped drive the [[Islamic Courts Union]] out of Mogadishu in Somalia. In December 2006, the ENDF entered Somalia to confront the Islamic Courts Union, initially winning the [[Battle of Baidoa]]. This led to the seizure of Mogadishu by Ethiopian troops and TFG militias, and subsequent heavy fighting there. After the Islamists split into two groups, moderate Islamists led by Sheikh Ahmed signed a UN backed peace deal with the TFG and established a larger government in Mogadishu. Ethiopian troops withdrew as part of the terms of the peace deal. Government forces have been engaged in battle against Ogaden insurgents led by the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]].\n\n[[Gabre Heard]] commanded the forces in Somalia. As of 2014, the Ethiopian troops in Somalia are being integrated into the [[AMISOM]] peacekeeping force. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201311131037.html|title=Somalia: Ethiopia Decides to Join Amisom Force in Somalia|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiiraan.com/news4/2013/Nov/52023/somali_war_expertise_and_superior_combat_kits_to_boost_anti_terror_campaign.aspx|title=Hiiraan Online: Somali war expertise and superior combat kits to boost anti-terror campaign|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Peacekeeping==\n\nEthiopia has served in various [[United Nations]] and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions.

Many of its major weapons systems stem from the Communist era and are of Soviet and Eastern bloc design. The [[United States]] was Ethiopia's major [[arms industry|arms supplier]] from the end of the Second World War until 1977, when Ethiopia began receiving massive arms shipments from the Soviet Union.<ref>[[Library of Congress Country Studies]], [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+et0175%29 Ethiopia: Foreign Military Assistance]</ref> These shipments, including armored patrol boats, transport and jet fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks, trucks, missiles, artillery, and small arms have incurred an unserviced Ethiopian debt to the former Soviet Union estimated at more than $3.5 billion.\n\nEthiopia made significant purchases of arms from Russia in late 1999 and early 2000 before the May 2000 United Nations arms embargo went into effect.<ref name=LOCEth2005 /> It is likely that much of that equipment suffered battle damage in the war with Eritrea. Thus, raw numbers alone will probably overstate the capacity of the ENDF.\n\n===Modern ground forces equipment===\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

The current minister of defense is Lemma Megersa.\n\nThe size of the ENDF has fluctuated significantly since the end of the [[Ethiopia-Eritrea war]] in 2000. In 2002 the Ethiopian Defense Forces had a strength of approximately 400,000 troops.<ref name=\"Ethiopian armed forces\">\n{{cite web|title=Ethiopia Armed Forces|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Ethiopia-ARMED-FORCES.html|publisher=Nations Encyclopedia}}</ref> This was roughly the same number maintained during the [[Derg]] regime that fell to the rebel forces in 1991.

Ethiopia reacquired a coastline on the [[Red Sea]] in 1950 and created the [[Ethiopian Navy]] in 1955. [[Eritrea]]'s independence in 1991 left Ethiopia landlocked again, but the Ethiopian Navy continued to operate from foreign ports until it finally was disbanded in 1996.\n\n==History of the Army==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2009}}\nThe Ethiopian army's origins and military traditions date back to the earliest [[history of Ethiopia]]. Due to Ethiopia's location between the Middle East and Africa, it has long been in the middle of Eastern and Western politics, and has been subject to foreign invasion and aggression. In 1579, the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s attempt to expand from a coastal base at [[Massawa]] was defeated.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rising Tide of Cultural Pluralism: The Nation-State at Bay?|last=Rothchild|first=Donald|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=139}}</ref> The [[Army of the Ethiopian Empire]] was also able to defeat the Egyptians in 1876 at [[Battle of Gura|Gura]], led by Ethiopian Emperor [[Yohannes IV]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethiopiantreasures.co.uk/pages/yohannes.htm|title=Emperor Yohannes IV (1872-1889)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Clapham wrote in the 1980s that the \"Abyssinians [had suffered] from a 'superiority complex' which may be traced to Gundet, Gura and Adwa\".<ref>Clapham, Christopher 1987.

Crabites, Pierre.</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the order of the emperor of Ethiopia, Directly [[Nikolay Leontiev]] organized the first battalion of the regular Ethiopian army in February 1899. Leontiev formed the first regular battalion, the kernel of which became the company of volunteers from the former [[Senegal]] shooters, which he chose and invited from Western Africa, with training of the Russian and French officers. The first Ethiopian military orchestra was organized at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proza.ru/2011/06/29/667|title= Count Leontiev is spy or adventurer...|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_biography/71087/%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2|title= Nikolay Stepanovich Leontiev|work=\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u0438 \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0435|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of Adwa===\nThe [[Battle of Adowa]] is the best known victory of Ethiopian forces over invaders. It maintained Ethiopia's existence as an independent state. Fought on 1 March 1896 against the Kingdom of Italy near the town of [[Adwa]], it was the decisive battle of the First Italo\u2013Ethiopian War.

The Ethiopian army became more effective against British colonial forces. The numerous expeditions of Ethiopian forces stopped colonial expansion. As the Russian [[Alexander Bulatovich]], one of the Russian military advisers and a participant in the expedition of the legendary army of Ras Wolde Giyorgis, wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"Many consider the Abyssinian army to be undisciplined. They think that it is not in any condition to withstand a serious fight with a well-organized European army, claiming that the recent war with Italy doesn't prove anything. I will not begin to guess the future, and will say only this. Over the course of four months, I watched this army closely. It is unique in the world. And I can bear witness to the fact that it is not quite so chaotic as it seems at first glance, and that on the contrary, it is profoundly disciplined, though in its own unique way. For every Abyssinian, war is normal business, and military skills and rules of army life in the field enter in the flesh and blood of each of them, just as do the main principles of tactics. On the march, each soldier knows how to arrange necessary comforts for himself and to conserve his strength; but on the other hand, when necessary, he shows such endurance and is capable of action in conditions which are difficult even to imagine.\nYou see remarkable expediency in all the actions and skills of this army; and each soldier has an amazingly intelligent attitude toward managing the mission of the battle.\nDespite such qualities, because of its impetuousness, it is much more difficult to control this army than a well-drilled European army, and I can only marvel at and admire the skill of its leaders and chiefs, of which there is no shortage.\"<ref name=\"samizdat.com\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn obedience to the agreement with Russia and the order of Menelik II, First Ethiopian officers began to be trained at the First Russian cadet school in 1901. 30 to 40 Ethiopian officers were trained in Russia from 1901 until 1913.\n\n===Under Haile Selassie I===\n[[File:Ethiopian camel troops.jpg|thumb|right|Ethiopian troops transporting supplies by camel through vegetation during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].]]\n{{Further|Ethiopian Order of Battle Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nModernization of the army took place under the regency of Tafari Mekonnen, who later reigned as Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]]. He created an [[Imperial Bodyguard]], the ''[[Kebur Zabagna]]'', in 1917 from the earlier ''[[Mahal Safari]]'' who had traditionally attended the Ethiopian Emperor. Its elite were trained at the French [[military academy]] at [[\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]] or by Belgian military advisers. He also created his own military school at [[Oletta Military Academy|Holeta]] in January 1935.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=273}}\n\nEthiopian military aviation efforts were initiated in 1929, when Tafari Mekonnen hired two French pilots and purchased four French biplanes.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=279}} By the time of the Italian invasion of 1935, the air force had four pilots and thirteen aircraft.\n\nHowever, these efforts were not sufficient nor instituted in enough time to stop the rising tide of [[Italian fascism]]. Ethiopia lost its independence in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] of 1935-36, marked for the first time Ethiopia was colonized by a foreign power. The country regained its independence after the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|1941 East African Campaign]] of [[World War II]] with the intervention of British and British imperial forces. After the Italians had been driven from the country, a British Military Mission to Ethiopia (BMME), under Major General Stephen Butler, was established to reorganise the Ethiopian Army.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=7}} The Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 1944 removed the BMME from the jurisdiction of [[East Africa Command]] at Nairobi and made it responsible to the Ethiopian Minister of War.<ref>Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay, 2006, 148.

A U.S. [[Military Assistance Advisory Group]] was dispatched to Ethiopia, and began its work by reorganising the army into three divisions.

Its members were not directly involved in those mutinies, nor was this the first military committee organized to support the administration of Prime Minister [[Endelkachew Makonnen]]: [[Alem Zewde Tessema]] had established the [[Armed Forces Coordinated Committee]] on 23 March. However, over the following months radicals in the Ethiopian military came to believe he was acting on behalf of the hated aristocracy, and when a group of notables petitioned for the release of a number of government ministers and officials who were under arrest for corruption and other crimes, three days later the Derg was announced.<ref>Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 52</ref>\n\nThe Derg, which originally consisted of soldiers at the capital, broadened its membership by including representatives from the 40 units of the [[Ethiopian Army]], [[Ethiopian Air Force|Air Force]], [[Ethiopian Navy|Navy]], [[Kebur Zabagna]] (Imperial Guard), [[Territorial Army (Ethiopia)|Territorial Army]] and [[Law enforcement in Ethiopia|Police]]: each unit was expected to send three representatives, who were supposed to be privates, NCOs and junior officers up to the rank of major. According to Bahru Zewde, \"senior officers were deemed too compromised by close association to the regime.\"<ref name=\"Bahru-234\">Bahru Zewde, 2000, p. 234</ref>\n\nThe committee elected Major [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] as its chairman and Major [[Atnafu Abate]] as its vice-chairman.  The Derg was initially supposed to study the grievances of various military units, and investigate abuses by senior officers and staff, and to root out corruption in the military. In the months following its founding, the power of the Derg steadily increased. In July 1974 the Derg obtained key concessions from the Emperor, [[Haile Selassie]], which included the power to arrest not only military officers, but government officials at every level.  Soon both former Prime Ministers [[Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte-Wold]], and [[Endelkachew Makonnen]], along with most of their cabinets, most regional governors, many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court found themselves imprisoned.\n\nWhen the Derg gained control of Ethiopia, they lessened their reliance on the West. Instead they began to draw their equipment and their sources for organisational and training methods from the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Comecon]] countries, especially [[Cuba]]. During this period, Ethiopian forces were often locked in [[counter-insurgency]] campaigns against various [[guerrilla]] groups. They honed both conventional and guerrilla tactics during campaigns in Eritrea, and by repelling an invasion launched by [[Somalia]] in the 1977\u20131978 [[Ogaden War]].<ref>See Gebru Tareke, The Ethiopia-Somalia War of 1977 Revisited, [[The International Journal of African Historical Studies]], Vol. 33, No. 3 (2000), pp. 635-667.</ref>\n\nThe Ethiopian army grew considerably under the Derg (1974\u20131987), and the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] under Mengistu (1987\u20131991), especially during the latter regime. The [[Library of Congress]] estimated forces under arms in 1974 at 41,000.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} By July 1975 the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] was listing a mechanised division in addition to three infantry divisions.<ref>IISS 75-76, p.&nbsp;42</ref> Ayele writes that in November 1975, the \"Nabalbal\" (\"Flame\") force was created, subdivided into battalion-sized units of 400. Each battalion-sized unit was known as a ''hayl'' (force), and 20 were created within sixteen months.{{sfn|Ayele|2014p=55}} The \"Nabalbal\" units entered combat in 1977. When Ethiopian intelligence sources discovered Somali planning to seize the Ogaden, militia brigades were also created; first 30, then a total of 61 brigades totalling 143,350 by 1977-78.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=29-30}} It appears that there were five regular line divisions active by the time of the 1977 Ogaden War, and the [[Library of Congress]] estimated the force size at the time as 53,500. With significant Soviet assistance, after that point the army's size grew rapidly; in 1979 it was estimated at 65,000.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} The 18th and 19th Mountain Infantry Divisions were then established in 1979-80 originally to seize [[Nakfa, Eritrea|Nakfa]], in the [[Sahel (Eritrea)|Sahel Mountains]], one of the remaining strongholds of the Eritrean insurgents.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=31}} By the beginning of 1981 recruitment for the 21st and 22nd Mountain Infantry Divisions was underway; soon afterwards, preparations for the large [[Operation Red Star]] were stepping up.{{sfn|Ayele|2014|p=32-33}}\n\nIn April 1988 the Derg reorganised the army. The restoration of relations with Somalia meant that forces could be transferred from the First Revolutionary Army in the Ogaden, to the Second and [[Third Revolutionary Army|Third Revolutionary Armies]], the Third (TRA) being responsible for the provinces of Assab, Tigray, [[Wello]], [[Gondar]], and [[Gojjam]]. The very small Fourth Revolutionary Army became responsible not only for protecting the border with Kenya, but also those with Somalia and Sudan. In the place of the previous commands, thirteen [[corps]] were established instead, distributed amongst the army headquarters. Intensive efforts were made to enlist additional personnel. Total manpower after the reorganisation reached a reported 388,000.{{sfn|Fontanellaz|Cooper|2018|p=9}}\n\nIn May 1988 the Derg decided that before it could concentrate on destroying the EPLF, it would have to first eliminate the TPLF.{{sfn|Fontanellaz|Cooper|2018|p=13}} Thus Operation Adwa was devised to seize the main TPLF base at [[Adi Ramets]] in [[Gondar Province]]. The [[Third Revolutionary Army]]'s 603rd and 604th Corps were to play the main role, while the 605th Corps secured the rear, in [[Wello]]. The TRA's command structure was disrupted when Major General Mulatu Negash, the army commander, was supplanted by the arrival of Mengistu's favorite, Captain [[Lagesse Asfaw]].\n\nCuba provided a significant influx of military advisors and troops over this period, with the largest escalation during the Ogaden War with Somalia, supported by a Soviet airlift:{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=297-8}}\n* 1977\u20131978: 17,000 ([[Ogaden War]])\n* 1978: 12,000\n* 1984: 3,000\n* 1989: All forces withdrawn\n\n===1990-91 Order of Battle===\nGebru Tareke listed Ethiopian ground forces in 1990 as comprising four revolutionary armies organized as task forces, eleven corps, twenty-four infantry divisions, and four mountain divisions, reinforced by five mechanised divisions, two airborne divisions, and ninety-five brigades, including four mechanised brigades, three artillery brigades, four tank brigades, twelve special commando and paracommando brigades&nbsp;&ndash; including the Spartakiad, which became operational in 1987 under the preparation and guidance of North Koreans&nbsp;&ndash; seven [[Multiple rocket launcher|BM-rocket]] battalions, and ten brigades of paramilitary forces.<ref>Gebru Tareke, ''The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 120</ref> \n\nForces under arms were estimated at 230,000 in early 1991.{{sfn|Ofcansky|Berry|1993|p=278}} Mengistu's People's Militia had also grown to about 200,000 members.

This process entailed the creation of a new professional army and officer class and the demobilization of many of the irregulars who had fought against the military government. With the collapse of the Soviet Union Ethiopia again turned to the Western powers for alliance and assistance. However, many Tigrayan officers remained in command positions. This transformation was still underway when war with [[Eritrea]] broke out in 1998, a development that saw the ranks of the armed forces swell along with defense expenditures.\n\nAlthough the armed forces have significant battlefield experience, their militia orientation has complicated the transition to a structured, integrated military.<ref name=LOCEth2005 /> Ranks and conventional units were only adopted in 1996.

These officers helped turn the tide decisively against Eritrea in 2000. Following the war's end, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission, a body founded by the UN, established that the Badme region had in fact belonged to Eritrea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/NewLinks/eebcarbitration/ |title=Recent Additions |accessdate=27 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130110233/http://www.un.org/NewLinks/eebcarbitration/ |archivedate=January 30, 2011 }}</ref> Although the two countries are now at peace, Ethiopia rejected the results of the international court's decision, and continued to occupy Badme. Most observers agree that Ethiopia's rejection of international law, coupled with the high numbers of soldiers maintained on the border by each side&nbsp;&ndash; a debilitatingly high number, particularly for the Eritrean side&nbsp;&ndash; means that the two countries are effectively still in conflict.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the Ethiopian army began to train with the U.S. [[Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) established in [[Djibouti]].

In December 2006, the ENDF entered Somalia to confront the Islamic Courts Union, initially winning the [[Battle of Baidoa]]. This led to the seizure of Mogadishu by Ethiopian troops and TFG militias, and subsequent heavy fighting there. After the Islamists split into two groups, moderate Islamists led by Sheikh Ahmed signed a UN backed peace deal with the TFG and established a larger government in Mogadishu. Ethiopian troops withdrew as part of the terms of the peace deal. Government forces have been engaged in battle against Ogaden insurgents led by the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]].\n\n[[Gabre Heard]] commanded the forces in Somalia. As of 2014, the Ethiopian troops in Somalia are being integrated into the [[AMISOM]] peacekeeping force. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201311131037.html|title=Somalia: Ethiopia Decides to Join Amisom Force in Somalia|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiiraan.com/news4/2013/Nov/52023/somali_war_expertise_and_superior_combat_kits_to_boost_anti_terror_campaign.aspx|title=Hiiraan Online: Somali war expertise and superior combat kits to boost anti-terror campaign|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Peacekeeping==\n\nEthiopia has served in various [[United Nations]] and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions.

Many of its major weapons systems stem from the Communist era and are of Soviet and Eastern bloc design. The [[United States]] was Ethiopia's major [[arms industry|arms supplier]] from the end of the Second World War until 1977, when Ethiopia began receiving massive arms shipments from the Soviet Union.<ref>[[Library of Congress Country Studies]], [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+et0175%29 Ethiopia: Foreign Military Assistance]</ref> These shipments, including armored patrol boats, transport and jet fighter aircraft, helicopters, tanks, trucks, missiles, artillery, and small arms have incurred an unserviced Ethiopian debt to the former Soviet Union estimated at more than $3.5 billion.\n\nEthiopia made significant purchases of arms from Russia in late 1999 and early 2000 before the May 2000 United Nations arms embargo went into effect.<ref name=LOCEth2005 /> It is likely that much of that equipment suffered battle damage in the war with Eritrea. Thus, raw numbers alone will probably overstate the capacity of the ENDF.\n\n===Modern ground forces equipment===\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.
