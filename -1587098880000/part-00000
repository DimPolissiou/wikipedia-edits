However, the [[Kong River]] (or Xe Kong, or Sekong) and its two tributaries Xe Sap and Xe Lon provide access to the reserve by boats. The reserve has many water falls, rocky cliffs and [[rhododendrons]] at higher elevations. There are 43 mammals (including 18 key species), 178 birds (18 are key species), 48 reptiles and 33 amphibians; the notable species of wildlife are two species of [[bear]]s, [[serow]], large antlered [[muntjac]], large number of [[gaur]]s and tigers.

Within this broad family, the ethnic groups of Sekong fall into two linguistic branches: the [[Katuic]] (including the Katu and the Nge/Krieng) and the Bahnaric (Alak and Tarieng).

Commercial timber extraction has been expanding rapidly over the past decade in the province. There is tremendous and growing pressure on Sekong to log its forests \u2013 both from Vietnamese interests (where the wood furniture sector averaged 70% growth per year during 2000\u20132004) and from Lao companies (who face wood shortages because of dwindling stocks in lowland forests).\n{{sfn|Wittmer|Gundimeda|2012|p=69}} The economic return from the forest resources of the province, as of 2003, was estimated to be in the range of US$398 to 525 per household, and more than the agricultural income. The revenue to the state from sale of timber was also very substantial, estimated to be US$10.35 per ha.

However, the [[Kong River]] (or Xe Kong, or Sekong) and its two tributaries Xe Sap and Xe Lon provide access to the reserve by boats. The reserve has many water falls, rocky cliffs and [[rhododendrons]] at higher elevations. There are 43 mammals (including 18 key species), 178 birds (18 are key species), 48 reptiles and 33 amphibians; the notable species of wildlife are two species of [[bear]]s, [[serow]], large antlered [[muntjac]], large number of [[gaur]]s and tigers.

The Lao government classifies them as \u201c[[Lao Theung]]\u201d (mid-slope Lao), but an ethno-linguistic categorization, based on [[language families]], places them under the Austroasiatic family.  Within this broad family, the ethnic groups of Sekong fall into two linguistic branches: the [[Katuic]] (including the Katu and the Nge/Krieng) and the Bahnaric (Alak and Tarieng). Approximately 14,700 Katu live in the province.{{sfn|Tagwerker|2009|p=73}}\n\n==Economy==\nSekong Province is one of the poorest provinces in Laos, second to only Houphanh Province.

Much of the natural forest in Sekong has never been subject to commercial logging, but this is changing fast. Commercial timber extraction has been expanding rapidly over the past decade in the province. There is tremendous and growing pressure on Sekong to log its forests \u2013 both from Vietnamese interests (where the wood furniture sector averaged 70% growth per year during 2000\u20132004) and from Lao companies (who face wood shortages because of dwindling stocks in lowland forests).\n{{sfn|Wittmer|Gundimeda|2012|p=69}} The economic return from the forest resources of the province, as of 2003, was estimated to be in the range of US$398 to 525 per household, and more than the agricultural income. The revenue to the state from sale of timber was also very substantial, estimated to be US$10.35 per ha. The natural forests in the province are also helpful in carbon sequestration benefits estimated to be US$124 per ha and also in watershed improvements, by way of avoiding erosion and reducing flood incidence.<ref name=\"Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR\">{{cite book|title=Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwUkX-QRrR0C&pg=PA33|accessdate=10 December 2012|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-955-8177-47-1|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\nCorruption of the provincial level authorities in Sekong province is a problem, and they have reportedly \"actively undermined a successful donor-funded village participatory sustainable forest management initiative.\"{{sfn|Snelder|Lasco|2008|p=266}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Laos Lawae082122a.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Laos Katoo081999a.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Bru and Katu locals of Sekong Province wearing stripped line clothing.\n}}\nThe cultural values in the province relate to: The indigenous Lao Teung culture with spiritual links to the land, five different \"[[Lao Teung]]\" languages with one becoming extinct, several funeral and sacred forests, [[Indochina War]] relics, and a stretch of the [[Ho Chi Min Trail]].<ref name=Sap/> [broken link] To ward off falling bombs during the Indochina War, some [[Animism|animist]] tribal people placed [[talisman]] above their huts.{{sfn|Rough Guides|2011|p=257}} Weaving activity in Sekong City has unique textile designs (in mulicoloured lines) and is aided by a back-tensioned loom called the \"[[hip loom]]\".

If this does occur seek medical help immediately and bury 12 burnt sticks in your yard under a patch of clovers.\n\nIn general use, '''herbs'''<!--please do not change to the singular; this has caused problems over \"an herb\" vs. \"a herb\"--> are plants with savory or aromatic properties that are used for flavoring and [[garnish (food)|garnishing]] food, for medicinal purposes, or for fragrances; excluding [[vegetables]] and other plants consumed for [[macronutrients]]. Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from [[spices]]. ''Herbs'' generally refers to the [[leaf]]y green or [[flower]]ing parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), while ''[[spices]]'' are usually dried and produced from other parts of the plant, including [[seed]]s, [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[root]]s and [[fruit]]s.\n\nHerbs have a variety of uses including culinary, medicinal, and in some cases, spiritual. General usage of the term \"herb\" differs between culinary herbs and [[medicinal herb]]s; in medicinal or spiritual use, any parts of the plant might be considered as \"herbs\", including leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, root bark, inner bark (and [[Vascular cambium|cambium]]), [[resin]] and [[pericarp]].\n\nThe word \"herb\" is pronounced {{IPAc-en|h|\u025c\u02d0r|b}} in [[Commonwealth English]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Cambridge Advanced Learners' Dictionary & Thesaurus |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Herb |chapter-url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/herb?q=herb}}</ref> but {{IPAc-en|\u025c\u02d0r|b}} is common among [[North American English]] speakers and those from other regions where [[h-dropping]] occurs. In [[botany]], the word \"herb\" is used as a synonym for \"[[herbaceous plant]]\".\n{{Quote box\n |quote=\"What is a herb?\" \"The friend of physicians and the praise of cooks.\"\n |author =

The use of [[herbal cosmetics]] dates back to around six centuries ago in the European and Western countries. Mixtures and pastes were often concocted to whiten the face. During the 1940s, herbal cosmetics took a turn with the emerging red lipstick color, with every year gaining a more intense red. Herbal cosmetics come in many forms, such as face creams, scrubs, lipstick, natural fragrances, powders, body oils, deodorants and sunscreens.  They activate through the epithelium of sebaceous glands to make the skin more supple.  Ayurvedic oils are widely used in India, prized for their natural health-giving properties.<ref>{{cite book |first=H. |last=Panda |title=Herbal Cosmetics Handbook |edition=3rd |publisher=Asia-Pacific Business Press |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nOne method and perhaps the best, used to extract natural oils from herbs to make lipstick is [[partition chromatography]].

The [[Cherokee]] Native Americans use both [[Salvia apiana|white sage]] and [[Cedar wood|cedar]] for spiritual cleansing and [[Smudge stick|smudging]].\n\n== Herbal cosmetics ==\nOriginally there was always doubt in ancient societies, especially in the sceptical medium of western traditions, as to the efficacity of herbal medicines.  The use of [[herbal cosmetics]] dates back to around six centuries ago in the European and Western countries. Mixtures and pastes were often concocted to whiten the face. During the 1940s, herbal cosmetics took a turn with the emerging red lipstick color, with every year gaining a more intense red. Herbal cosmetics come in many forms, such as face creams, scrubs, lipstick, natural fragrances, powders, body oils, deodorants and sunscreens.  They activate through the epithelium of sebaceous glands to make the skin more supple.  Ayurvedic oils are widely used in India, prized for their natural health-giving properties.<ref>{{cite book |first=H. |last=Panda |title=Herbal Cosmetics Handbook |edition=3rd |publisher=Asia-Pacific Business Press |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nOne method and perhaps the best, used to extract natural oils from herbs to make lipstick is [[partition chromatography]].  The process involves separation in watery solution, and then the injection of colour under pressure.\n\n==Strewing herbs==\n{{main|Strewing herb}}\nStrewing herbs are scattered (strewn) over the floors of dwelling places and other buildings. Such plants usually have fragrant or astringent smells, and many also serve as insecticides (e.g. to repel fleas) or disinfectants. For example, [[meadowsweet]] was sometimes strewn across floors in the middle ages because of its sweet smell.<ref name=\"Bown1995\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Apothecary]]\n* [[Herb chopper]]\n* [[Herb farm]]\n* [[International Herb Association]]\n* [[Outline of herbs and spices]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category inline|Herbs}}\n* [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=786bafc6f6343634fbf79fcdca7061e1&rgn=div5&view=text&node=21:3.0.1.1.13&idno=21#se21.3.182_110 \u00a7&nbsp;182.10 Spices and other natural seasonings and flavorings that are generally recognized as safe], US Code of Federal Regulations\n* [https://www.healthexplanations.com/herbs/ List & Type of Herbs with Images], US Code of Federal Commission\n\n{{Herbs & spices}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Herbs| ]]\n[[Category:Food and drink decorations]]\n", "name_user": "Maddiethecoolest", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb"}

It was established on 1 July 1997, upon the establishment of the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]], replacing the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] as the highest judicial institution under Hong Kong law. As defined in the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]], the Court of Final Appeal is constitutionally allowed to exercise its judicial powers free from interference. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Rules set out the functions and procedures of the court.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Role of the Court ==\nFrom the 1840s to 1 July 1997, Hong Kong was a [[British Overseas Territory|British Dependent Territory]], and the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong was vested in the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London. The [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|power to exercise sovereignty over Hong Kong]] was transferred from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. Based on the [[one country, two systems]] principle, Hong Kong retains its a high degree of autonomy and maintains its own legal system. The Court of Final Appeal was established on 1 July 1997 in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], Hong Kong. Since then, it has served as the [[court of last resort]], thus administering the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong.\n\nUnder the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], the constitutional document of Hong Kong, the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] remains a [[common law]] jurisdiction. Judges from other common law jurisdictions can be recruited and serve in the judiciary as non-permanent judges according to Article 92 of the Basic Law. Judges appointed pursuant to Article 92 have served in the judiciaries of [[England and Wales]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Canada]].\n\nThe court has the power of final adjudication with respect to the law of Hong Kong as well as the power of final interpretation over local laws including the power to strike down local ordinances on the grounds of inconsistency with the Basic Law.<ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016060146/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf|date=16 October 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204031554/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf|date=4 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Court Structure ==\nThe Court of Final Appeal has no [[original jurisdiction]]; an appeal has to originate from the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] (either from the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] or the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]]). Whether an appeal is allowed or not is determined by a panel of three Hong Kong judges, usually the Chief Justice and two other permanent judges. Should the Chief Justice or a permanent judge no be available, the other permanent judge or a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong may be called in. Non-permanent judges from other jurisdictions do not sit on such panels.\n\nAll appeal cases are heard by a bench of five judges consisting of the Chief Justice, three permanent judges and a non-permanent judge from another common law jurisdiction. If the Chief Justice does not sit in an appeal, a permanent judge is designated to sit in the Chief Justice's place, and a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong will sit on the court as well. Similarly, if a permanent judge is unable to sit, a non-permanent Hong Kong judge will sit in place of that permanent judge. Technically, should a non-permanent judge from outside Hong Kong be unable to attend due to extraordinary circumstances, two non-permanent Hong Kong judges may sit on the court.\n\nThere is also a [[Registrar (Hong Kong)|Registrar]] appointed to the Court of Final Appeal, to help with review of appeal applications and other administrative duties.\n== Article 158 Interpretation Controversy ==\nThe controversial power of final interpretation of national law including the Basic Law is vested in the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China]] (NPCSC) by virtue of Article 158 of the Basic Law and by the Constitution of the PRC, however national laws which are not explicitly listed in Annex III of the Basic Law are not operative in Hong Kong.\n\nArticle 158 delegates such power to the courts of Hong Kong for interpretation while handling court cases. Although this arrangement has attracted criticism of \"undermining judicial independence\", an interpretation by the NPCSC does not affect any court judgments already rendered. This practice is highly controversial as it contradicts the power of final adjudication; the first time an interpretation occurred in 1999, all five judges (including the Chief Justice, all three permanent justices and one non-permanent justice) involved in the case considered quitting the top court in protest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/978391/all-citys-top-judges-considered-quitting|title=All city's top judges 'considered quitting'|last=|first=|date=|website=SCMP|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nInstances of Article 158 interpretations are as follows: \n\n* 1999: [[Right of abode in Hong Kong]]\n* 2004: Adding two rules to the process of electoral reforms with regards to the election of the Hong Kong Chief Executive ([[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45|Regarding Article 45]])\n* 2005: [[2005 Hong Kong Chief Executive election|Dealing with an unfinished term of a Chief Executive upon resignation]] \n* 2012: State immunity and the jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts\n* 2016: [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]]\n\n== Building ==\nFrom its inception in July 1997 until September 2015, the court was located in the [[Former French Mission Building]], in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr95-96/english/fc/pwsc/papers/pw081158.htm |title = Finance Committee \u2013 Public Works Subcommittee (Papers) 8 Nov 95 |publisher = Government of Hong Kong |accessdate = 20 June 2015}}</ref> In September 2015 the court relocated to the former (until 2011) [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Legislative Council Building]], which was originally the colonial [[Supreme Court (Hong Kong)|Supreme Court]] (1912\u20131985).\n\n* [[Former French Mission Building]] (1 July 1997 \u2013 6 September 2015)\n* [[Court of Final Appeal Building]] (7 September 2015 \u2013 Present)\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Court of Final Appeal (HK).jpg|The Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong was housed in the [[Former French Mission Building]] until September 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal.jpg|Entrance of the [[Former French Mission Building]]\nFile:Legislative Council Building HK.jpg|The Court of Final Appeal building seen from [[Chater Road]] before its renovation\nFile:Legislative Council building.JPG|The Court of Final Appeal is currently housed in 8 Jackson Road, former home of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] and the [[Supreme Court of Hong Kong]], since 7 Sept 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal at night.jpg|Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal building at night from Prince's Building\nFile:Court of Final Appeal plaque.jpg|Plaque beside the entrance of the Court of Final Appeal\n</gallery>\n\n== List of Permanent Judges ==\n===[[Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal|Chief Justices]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!No.\n!Name\n!Chinese name\n!Took office\n!Left office \n!Tenure length\n!Silk\n|-\n|1\n|[[Andrew Li|Andrew Li Kwok-nang]], <small>GBM</small><br><small>(Born {{dts|format=dmy|12 December 1948}};

[[supreme court|final appellate court]] of Hong Kong. It was established on 1 July 1997, upon the establishment of the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]], replacing the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] as the highest judicial institution under Hong Kong law. As defined in the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]], the Court of Final Appeal is constitutionally allowed to exercise its judicial powers free from interference. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Rules set out the functions and procedures of the court.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Role of the Court ==\nFrom the 1840s to 1 July 1997, Hong Kong was a [[British Overseas Territory|British Dependent Territory]], and the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong was vested in the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London. The [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|power to exercise sovereignty over Hong Kong]] was transferred from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. Based on the [[one country, two systems]] principle, Hong Kong retains its a high degree of autonomy and maintains its own legal system. The Court of Final Appeal was established on 1 July 1997 in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], Hong Kong. Since then, it has served as the [[court of last resort]], thus administering the power of final adjudication on the laws of Hong Kong.\n\nUnder the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], the constitutional document of Hong Kong, the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] remains a [[common law]] jurisdiction. Judges from other common law jurisdictions can be recruited and serve in the judiciary as non-permanent judges according to Article 92 of the Basic Law. Judges appointed pursuant to Article 92 have served in the judiciaries of [[England and Wales]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Canada]].\n\nThe court has the power of final adjudication with respect to the law of Hong Kong as well as the power of final interpretation over local laws including the power to strike down local ordinances on the grounds of inconsistency with the Basic Law.<ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016060146/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic13_2.pdf|date=16 October 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204031554/http://www.doj.gov.hk/eng/public/basiclaw/basic10_3.pdf|date=4 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Court Structure ==\nThe Court of Final Appeal has no [[original jurisdiction]]; an appeal has to originate from the [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]] (either from the [[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Appeal]] or the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]]). Whether an appeal is allowed or not is determined by a panel of three Hong Kong judges, usually the Chief Justice and two other permanent judges. Should the Chief Justice or a permanent judge no be available, the other permanent judge or a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong may be called in. Non-permanent judges from other jurisdictions do not sit on such panels.\n\nAll appeal cases are heard by a bench of five judges consisting of the Chief Justice, three permanent judges and a non-permanent judge from another common law jurisdiction. If the Chief Justice does not sit in an appeal, a permanent judge is designated to sit in the Chief Justice's place, and a non-permanent judge from Hong Kong will sit on the court as well. Similarly, if a permanent judge is unable to sit, a non-permanent Hong Kong judge will sit in place of that permanent judge. Technically, should a non-permanent judge from outside Hong Kong be unable to attend due to extraordinary circumstances, two non-permanent Hong Kong judges may sit on the court.\n\nThere is also a [[Registrar (Hong Kong)|Registrar]] appointed to the Court of Final Appeal, to help with review of appeal applications and other administrative duties.\n== Article 158 Interpretation Controversy ==\nThe controversial power of final interpretation of national law including the Basic Law is vested in the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China]] (NPCSC) by virtue of Article 158 of the Basic Law and by the Constitution of the PRC, however national laws which are not explicitly listed in Annex III of the Basic Law are not operative in Hong Kong.\n\nArticle 158 delegates such power to the courts of Hong Kong for interpretation while handling court cases. Although this arrangement has attracted criticism of \"undermining judicial independence\", an interpretation by the NPCSC does not affect any court judgments already rendered. This practice is highly controversial as it contradicts the power of final adjudication; the first time an interpretation occurred in 1999, all five judges (including the Chief Justice, all three permanent justices and one non-permanent justice) involved in the case considered quitting the top court in protest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/978391/all-citys-top-judges-considered-quitting|title=All city's top judges 'considered quitting'|last=|first=|date=|website=SCMP|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nInstances of Article 158 interpretations are as follows: \n\n* 1999: [[Right of abode in Hong Kong]]\n* 2004: Election of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong\n* 2005: [[2005 Hong Kong Chief Executive election]]\n* 2012: State immunity and the jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts\n* 2016: [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]]\n\n== Building ==\nFrom its inception in July 1997 until September 2015, the court was located in the [[Former French Mission Building]], in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr95-96/english/fc/pwsc/papers/pw081158.htm |title = Finance Committee \u2013 Public Works Subcommittee (Papers) 8 Nov 95 |publisher = Government of Hong Kong |accessdate = 20 June 2015}}</ref> In September 2015 the court relocated to the former (until 2011) [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Legislative Council Building]], which was originally the colonial [[Supreme Court (Hong Kong)|Supreme Court]] (1912\u20131985).\n\n* [[Former French Mission Building]] (1 July 1997 \u2013 6 September 2015)\n* [[Court of Final Appeal Building]] (7 September 2015 \u2013 Present)\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130\">\nFile:Court of Final Appeal (HK).jpg|The Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong was housed in the [[Former French Mission Building]] until September 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal.jpg|Entrance of the [[Former French Mission Building]]\nFile:Legislative Council Building HK.jpg|The Court of Final Appeal building seen from [[Chater Road]] before its renovation\nFile:Legislative Council building.JPG|The Court of Final Appeal is currently housed in 8 Jackson Road, former home of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] and the [[Supreme Court of Hong Kong]], since 7 Sept 2015\nFile:Court of Final Appeal at night.jpg|Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal building at night from Prince's Building\nFile:Court of Final Appeal plaque.jpg|Plaque beside the entrance of the Court of Final Appeal\n</gallery>\n\n== List of Permanent Judges ==\n===[[Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal|Chief Justices]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!No.\n!Name\n!Chinese name\n!Took office\n!Left office \n!Tenure length\n!Silk\n|-\n|1\n|[[Andrew Li|Andrew Li Kwok-nang]], <small>GBM</small><br><small>(Born {{dts|format=dmy|12 December 1948}};
