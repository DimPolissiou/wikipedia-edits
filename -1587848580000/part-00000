[[Euripides]]' use of the mechane in ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'' (431 BC) is a notable use of the machine for a non-divine character. It was also often used by [[Aeschylus]]. It was used to allow actors playing gods to fly through the air.\n\n==Use in Ancient Rome==\nStage machines were also used in ancient [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], e.g. during the sometimes highly dramatic performances at [[Roman funerals and burial|funerals]]. For [[Julius Caesar]]'s funeral service, [[Appian]] reports a mechane that was used to present a blood-stained wax [[effigy]] of the deceased [[Roman dictator|dictator]] to the funeral crowd.
