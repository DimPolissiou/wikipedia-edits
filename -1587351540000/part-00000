The average household size was 2.60 and the average family size was 3.01.\n\nIn the borough the population was spread out, with 27.1% under the age of 18, 8.6% from 18 to 24, 27.9% from 25 to 44, 23.0% from 45 to 64, and 13.4% who were 65 years of age or older.

In December 1753, at age 21, Washington was asked by [[Robert Dinwiddie|Governor Dinwiddie]] to carry a British ultimatum to the [[New France|French]] on the [[Ohio]] frontier. Washington delivered the message at [[Fort Le Boeuf]] in present-day Waterford. The message, which went unheeded because he delivered it to the wrong person, called for the French to abandon their development of the [[Ohio Country]] to the south. The two colonial powers were heading toward worldwide conflict, the [[Seven Years' War]], known as the [[French and Indian War]] in North America.<ref>Grizzard, Frank E., Jr. ''George Washington: A Biographical Companion.''

In December 1753, at age 21, Washington was asked by [[Robert Dinwiddie|Governor Dinwiddie]] to carry a British ultimatum to the [[New France|French]] on the [[Ohio]] frontier. Washington delivered the message at [[Fort Le Boeuf]] in present-day Waterford. The message, which went unheeded because he delivered it to the wrong person, called for the French to abandon their development of the [[Ohio Country]] to the south. The two colonial powers were heading toward worldwide conflict, the [[Seven Years' War]], known as the [[French and Indian War]] in North America.<ref>Grizzard, Frank E., Jr. ''George Washington: A Biographical Companion.''
