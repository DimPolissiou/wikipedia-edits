The excitement of the role and the admiration of the public are so strong that reality and fiction begin to mix. Finally, reaching the limits of stage-acting, the actor himself believes that he is Bol\u00edvar.\n\n== Plot == \nSantiago Miranda ([[Robinson D\u00edaz]]) is a famous actor in a popular Colombian soap opera, depicting the role of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, \u201cThe Libertador\u201d, a Venezuelan soldier who played a major piece in the independence of South America and became their president. He speaks briefly of [[Don Quixote]], an old novel where an old man wants to be a chivalrous knight of old and the local villagers secretly go along with it to humor him. As he stands, giving a motivational and deep speech before he is to be killed off, he exclaims for the director to cut. He declares that he will not have Bol\u00edvar die this way. He leaves the set, still wearing the costume, and heads home to his mother.\n\nHis co-star and ex-girlfriend, Manuela/Alejandra Baberini ([[Amparo Grisales]]), is then sent by the director to reign him in after they speak with his mental health doctors. While she goes to find him, many people are playfully mistaking Santiago as Bol\u00edvar. He seems to start believing he is Bol\u00edvar as we see his health slowly deteriorate with each fan's reaction to him. When the mental health doctors finally catch him, they have him placed in a ward/clinic with a straight jacket as if he is a danger to himself. When he is let out by Manuela, they go to the beach together and spend alone time finally to themselves. They talk things out, everything is going well until he pretends he has drowned and upsets her by trying to scare her after she runs to check on him. \n\nHe later attends what appears to be a publicity stunt, which goes haywire. He loses himself as time progresses, going as far as kidnapping a government official and making demands. He seems to think he can change their world, as Bol\u00edvar was supposed to. Him having a small binge drinking episode does not help, either. Santiago brings the government official onto a boat, where \u2018his\u2019 revolutionaries take over when they do not like a command given by \u2018Bol\u00edvar\u2019. By this time, Manuela has found him and is also taken captive. She tells him that the director will allow him to rewrite the ending for Bol\u00edvar, which he seems to no longer care about.\n\nManuela even plays along, wanting to reach out to Santiago. However, she starts to believe that he thinks he is Bol\u00edvar. He asks her, \u201cDo you really believe that I think I\u2019m Bol\u00edvar?\u201d. Santiago has written an official declaration for the government official he kidnapped to legalize, had they not been interrupted. It causes confusion of whether or not he really does believe it. Together, Santiago and Manuela plan to rescue the other government officials from the revolutionaries, in which they die from afterwards. Then, at the very last moment, there is clapper board that cuts the scene.\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0257282|title=Bolivar soy yo}}\n\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Robinson D\u00edaz]]...

Camping can also refer to continuously waiting in a tactically advantageous position for others to come to them; this is sometimes considered griefing because if all players do it, the game stalls, but this is now more commonly considered a game design issue.\n*Acting [[out-of-character]] in a [[role-play]] setting to disrupt the serious gameplay of others.\n*Luring many monsters or a single larger monster to chase the griefer, before moving to where other players are. The line of monsters in pursuit looks like a train, and hence this is sometimes called \"training\" or \"[[wikt:aggro|aggroing]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/2491|title=The Griefer Future|access-date=16 June 2015}}</ref>\n*Blocking other players so they cannot move to or from a particular area, or access an in-game resource (such as a [[non-player character]]); the game [[Tom Clancy's The Division|The Division]] was found to have a serious problem with this at launch, where griefers could stand in the doorway out of the starting area, trapping players in the spawn room.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/the-division-trolls-are-blocking-other-players-progress-1763511809|title=The Division Trolls Are Blocking Other Players' Progress By Standing In A Doorway|website=Kotaku|access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n*Intentionally attempting to crash a server through [[lag]] or other means (such as spawning large amounts of resource-demanding objects), in order to cause interference among players.\n*Smurfing, the process of creating extra accounts and deliberately losing games to enter a lower skill rank than is appropriate, before playing at full skill against lower-ranked opponents, thus defeating them easily.\n*High-skill players deliberately losing in matches against low-skill players (usually due to shortage of players), causing the low-skill player's skill rating to artificially rise, so that they will be routinely pitted against opponents they have no chance against in the future.\n*Impersonating an enemy to trick someone into attacking the griefer so that a player is flagged as having attacked the griefer. A notable example of this is early on in [[Ultima Online]], where players had a scroll that could change their appearance to that of a monster, with the only way to tell the difference between them and a real monster being to click on them and read their name. Attacking a monster disguised griefer would flag the player as a murderer causing the town guard to kill the player.\n\nThe term is sometimes applied more generally<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=6r-pcB5WL8wC&pg=PA9&dq=best+technology+writing+2009+Julian+Dibbell&cd=1#v=onepage&q=|first=Julian|last=Dibbell|editor1-first=Steven|editor1-last=Johnson|chapter=Mutilated Furries, Flying Phalluses: Put the Blame on Griefers, the Sociopaths of the Virtual World|title=The Best Technology Writing 2009|year=2009|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=978-0-300-15410-8|accessdate=10 February 2010|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bestoftechnology0000unse_m3l6/page/9 9\u201319]|url=https://archive.org/details/bestoftechnology0000unse_m3l6/page/9}}</ref> to refer to a person who uses the internet to cause distress to others as a prank,<ref>Nick Douglas, [http://gawker.com/231320/internets-most-wanted-a-rogues-gallery Internet's Most Wanted: A Rogue's Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716195738/http://gawker.com/231320/internets-most-wanted-a-rogues-gallery|date=2009-07-16}}, Jan 25 2007,</ref><ref>[http://techdirt.com/articles/20090418/1728344551.shtml Craigslist Griefer Ordered To Pay Up Over Both Copyright And Privacy Violations] (accessed April 26, 2009)</ref> or to intentionally inflict harm, as when it was used to describe an incident in March 2008, when malicious users posted [[seizure]]-inducing animations on [[epilepsy]] forums.<ref>Kevin Poulsen, March 28, 2008, [https://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/03/epilepsy \"Hackers Assault Epilepsy Patients via Computer\"], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]].''</ref><ref>[[Cory Doctorow]], March 31, 2008, [http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/31/griefers-deface-epil.html \"Griefers deface epilepsy message-board with seizure-inducing animations\"], ''[[Boing Boing]].''</ref><ref>See also [[:wikt:lulz|\"lulz\"]], for griefer slang referring to enjoyment at others' expense.</ref>\n\n==Industry response==\nMany subscription-based games actively oppose griefers, since their behavior can drive away business.<ref name=\"bullies\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gamegirladvance.com/mmog/archives/2002/10/21/online_bullies_give_grief_to_games.html|title=Online Bullies Give Grief to Gamers|last=Pham|first=Alex|date=2 September 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009161333/http://www.gamegirladvance.com/mmog/archives/2002/10/21/online_bullies_give_grief_to_games.html|archive-date=2007-10-09|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|department=Main News|page=1}}</ref> It is common for developers to release server-side upgrades and patches to annul griefing methods.

Others implemented separate servers.\n\nWhen ''[[EverQuest]]'' was released, Sony included a [[Player versus player|PvP]] switch where people could fight each other only if they had enabled that option. This was done in order to prevent the player-killing that was driving people away from ''Ultima Online'', which at that time had no protection on any of its servers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Darktide Rising|author=Glenn Barnett|date=April 1, 2000|url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/492/492325p1.html}}</ref>\n\n''[[Second Life]]'' bans players for harassment (defined as being rude or threatening, making unwelcome sexual advances, or performing activities likely to annoy or alarm somebody) and assault (shooting, pushing, or shoving in a safe area, or creating scripted objects that target another user and hinder their enjoyment of the game) in its community standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/cs.php|title=Community Standards|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> Sanctions include warnings, suspension from ''Second Life'', or being banned altogether.\n\nSome space simulators, like ''[[Eve Online]],'' have incorporated activities typically considered griefing as part of the gameplay mechanism.

The player's name is omitted during the replay, as well as those of the other 9 players in the game. In October 2016, Valve implemented a change that will permanently ban a player if he/she receives two penalties for griefing.\n\nMany ''[[Minecraft]]'' servers have rules against griefing. In ''Minecraft'' freebuild servers, griefing is often the destruction of another player's build, and in other servers the definition ranges, but almost all servers recognize harassment as griefing. Most servers use temporary bans for minor and/or first-time incidents, and indefinite bans from the server for more serious and/or repeat offences.\n\nIn recent years, ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'' has experienced a drastic increase in griefing due in part to the emergence of bugs and better money-making opportunities. Common griefing techniques within the game include abusing game mechanics such as \"passive mode\", and abuse of weaponized vehicles. [[Rockstar North|Rockstar]] have implemented measures such as a longer cool-down on passive mode, patching invincibility glitches, and removing passive mode from weaponized vehicles in recent updates. In addition, the game also features a reputation system that, in effect, after excessive \"bad sport point\" accumulation, will mark players as \"bad sports\", allowing them to only play in lobbies with other \"bad sports\". Such points are either accumulated over time or gained within a certain time frame and are acquired by actions such as destroying another player's personal vehicle, or quitting jobs early.

A notable example of this is early on in [[Ultima Online]], where players had a scroll that could change their appearance to that of a monster, with the only way to tell the difference between them and a real monster being to click on them and read their name.

Others implemented separate servers.\n\nWhen ''[[EverQuest]]'' was released, Sony included a [[Player versus player|PvP]] switch where people could fight each other only if they had enabled that option.

The player's name is omitted during the replay, as well as those of the other 9 players in the game. In October 2016, Valve implemented a change that will permanently ban a player if he/she receives two penalties for griefing.\n\nMany ''[[Minecraft]]'' servers have rules against griefing. In ''Minecraft'' freebuild servers, griefing is often the destruction of another player's build, and in other servers the definition ranges, but almost all servers recognize harassment as griefing. Most servers use temporary bans for minor and/or first-time incidents, and indefinite bans from the server for more serious and/or repeat offences.\n\nIn recent years, ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'' has experienced a drastic increase in griefing due in part to the emergence of bugs and better money-making opportunities. Common griefing techniques within the game include abusing game mechanics such as \"passive mode\", and abuse of weaponized vehicles. [[Rockstar North|Rockstar]] have implemented measures such as a longer cool-down on passive mode, patching invincibility glitches, and removing passive mode from weaponized vehicles in recent updates. In addition, the game also features a reputation system that, in effect, after excessive \"bad sport point\" accumulation, will mark players as \"bad sports\", allowing them to only play in lobbies with other \"bad sports\". Such points are either accumulated over time or gained within a certain time frame and are acquired by actions such as destroying another player's personal vehicle, or quitting jobs early.

While the uprising was part of a larger one that included other provinces opposed to the regime of President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], the Mexican government believed the United States had instigated the Texas insurrection with the goal of annexation. The Mexican Congress passed the [[Tornel Decree]], declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops \"will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag.\" Only the province of Texas succeeded in breaking with Mexico, establishing the [[Republic of Texas]], and eventually being annexed by the [[United States]].\n\nThe revolution began in October 1835, after a decade of political and cultural clashes between the Mexican government and the increasingly large population of American settlers in Texas. The Mexican government had become increasingly [[centralized government|centralized]] and the rights of its citizens had become increasingly curtailed, particularly regarding immigration from the United States. Colonists and Tejanos disagreed on whether the ultimate goal was independence or a return to the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution of 1824]].  While delegates at the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]] (provisional government) debated the war's motives, [[Texians]] and a flood of volunteers from the United States defeated the small garrisons of Mexican soldiers by mid-December 1835. The Consultation declined to declare independence and installed an interim government, whose infighting led to political paralysis and a dearth of effective governance in Texas.  An ill-conceived proposal to [[Matamoros Expedition|invade Matamoros]] siphoned much-needed volunteers and provisions from the fledgling [[Texian Army]].  In March 1836, a second [[convention of 1836|political convention]] declared independence and appointed leadership for the new [[Republic of Texas]].\n\nDetermined to avenge Mexico's honor, Santa Anna vowed to personally retake Texas.  His Army of Operations entered Texas in mid-February 1836 and found the Texians completely unprepared. Mexican General [[Jos\u00e9 de Urrea]] led a contingent of troops on the [[Goliad Campaign]] up the Texas coast, defeating all Texian troops in his path and executing most of those who surrendered. Santa Anna led a larger force to [[San Antonio|San Antonio de B\u00e9xar]] (or B\u00e9xar), where his troops defeated the Texian garrison in the [[Battle of the Alamo]], killing almost all of the defenders. \n\nA newly created Texian army under the command of [[Sam Houston]] was constantly on the move, while terrified civilians fled with the army, in a melee known as the [[Runaway Scrape]]. On March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing on the [[Brazos River]], and for the next two weeks, the Texians received rigorous military training. Becoming complacent and underestimating the strength of his foes, Santa Anna further subdivided his troops. On April 21, Houston's army staged a surprise assault on Santa Anna and his vanguard force at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. The Mexican troops were quickly routed, and vengeful Texians executed many who tried to surrender.  Santa Anna was taken hostage; in exchange for his life, he ordered the Mexican army to retreat south of the [[Rio Grande]].  Mexico refused to recognize the Republic of Texas, and intermittent conflicts between the two countries continued into the 1840s.  The [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] as the 28th state of the United States, in 1845, led directly to the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Main article|Mexican Texas}}\nAfter a failed attempt by France to [[French colonization of Texas|colonize Texas]] in the late 17th century, Spain developed a plan to settle the region.<ref>Weber (1992), pp. 149\u2013154.</ref> On its southern edge, along the [[Medina River|Medina]] and [[Nueces River]]s, [[Spanish Texas]] was bordered by the province of [[Coahuila]].<ref name=edmondson6>Edmondson (2000), p. 6.</ref>  On the east, Texas bordered [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=edmonson10>Edmondson (2000), p. 10.</ref>  Following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, the United States also claimed the land west of the [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]], all the way to the Rio Grande.<ref name=weber291>Weber (1992), p. 291.</ref> From 1812 to 1813 anti-Spanish republicans and U.S. [[filibuster (military)|filibusters]] rebelled against the [[Spanish Empire]] in what is known today as the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]] during the [[Mexican War of Independence]].

The new Texas government and army met their doom in the [[Battle of Medina]] in August 1813, 20 miles south of [[San Antonio]], where 1,300 of the 1,400 rebel army were killed in battle or executed shortly afterwards by royalist soldiers. It was the deadliest single battle in Texas history. 300 republican government officials in San Antonio were captured and executed by the Spanish royalists shortly after the battle. What is significant is a Spanish royalist lieutenant named [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] fought in this battle and followed his superiors' orders to take no prisoners. Another interesting note is two founding fathers of the [[Republic of Texas]] and future signers of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] in 1836, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Navarro]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz]], took part in the Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition.<ref>https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfm01 .

On April 16, they came to a crossroads; one road led north towards Nacogdoches, the other went to Harrisburg.

While the uprising was part of a larger one that included other provinces opposed to the regime of President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], the Mexican government believed the United States had instigated the Texas insurrection with the goal of annexation. The Mexican Congress passed the [[Tornel Decree]], declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops \"will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag.\" Only the province of Texas succeeded in breaking with Mexico, establishing the [[Republic of Texas]], and eventually being annexed by the [[United States]].\n\nThe revolution began in October 1835, after a decade of political and cultural clashes between the Mexican government and the increasingly large population of American settlers in Texas. The Mexican government had become increasingly [[centralized government|centralized]] and the rights of its citizens had become increasingly curtailed, particularly regarding immigration from the United States. Colonists and Tejanos disagreed on whether the ultimate goal was independence or a return to the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution of 1824]].  While delegates at the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]] (provisional government) debated the war's motives, [[Texians]] and a flood of volunteers from the United States defeated the small garrisons of Mexican soldiers by mid-December 1835. The Consultation declined to declare independence and installed an interim government, whose infighting led to political paralysis and a dearth of effective governance in Texas.  An ill-conceived proposal to [[Matamoros Expedition|invade Matamoros]] siphoned much-needed volunteers and provisions from the fledgling [[Texian Army]].  In March 1836, a second [[convention of 1836|political convention]] declared independence and appointed leadership for the new [[Republic of Texas]].\n\nDetermined to avenge Mexico's honor, Santa Anna vowed to personally retake Texas.  His Army of Operations entered Texas in mid-February 1836 and found the Texians completely unprepared. Mexican General [[Jos\u00e9 de Urrea]] led a contingent of troops on the [[Goliad Campaign]] up the Texas coast, defeating all Texian troops in his path and executing most of those who surrendered. Santa Anna led a larger force to [[San Antonio|San Antonio de B\u00e9xar]] (or B\u00e9xar), where his troops defeated the Texian garrison in the [[Battle of the Alamo]], killing almost all of the defenders. \n\nA newly created Texian army under the command of [[Sam Houston]] was constantly on the move, while terrified civilians fled with the army, in a melee known as the [[Runaway Scrape]]. On March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing on the [[Brazos River]], and for the next two weeks, the Texians received rigorous military training. Becoming complacent and underestimating the strength of his foes, Santa Anna further subdivided his troops. On April 21, Houston's army staged a surprise assault on Santa Anna and his vanguard force at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. The Mexican troops were quickly routed, and vengeful Texians executed many who tried to surrender.  Santa Anna was taken hostage; in exchange for his life, he ordered the Mexican army to retreat south of the [[Rio Grande]].  Mexico refused to recognize the Republic of Texas, and intermittent conflicts between the two countries continued into the 1840s.  The [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] as the 28th state of the United States, in 1845, led directly to the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Main article|Mexican Texas}}\nAfter a failed attempt by France to [[French colonization of Texas|colonize Texas]] in the late 17th century, Spain developed a plan to settle the region.<ref>Weber (1992), pp. 149\u2013154.</ref> On its southern edge, along the [[Medina River|Medina]] and [[Nueces River]]s, [[Spanish Texas]] was bordered by the province of [[Coahuila]].<ref name=edmondson6>Edmondson (2000), p. 6.</ref>  On the east, Texas bordered [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=edmonson10>Edmondson (2000), p. 10.</ref>  Following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, the United States also claimed the land west of the [[Sabine River (Texas\u2013Louisiana)|Sabine River]], all the way to the Rio Grande.<ref name=weber291>Weber (1992), p. 291.</ref> From 1812 to 1813 anti-Spanish republicans and U.S. [[filibuster (military)|filibusters]] rebelled against the [[Spanish Empire]] in what is known today as the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]] during the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. They won battles in the beginning and captured many Texas cities from the Spanish that led to a declaration of independence of the state of Texas as part of the Mexican Republic on April 17, 1813. The new Texas government and army met their doom in the [[Battle of Medina]] in August 1813, 20 miles south of [[San Antonio]], where 1,300 of the 1,400 rebel army were killed in battle or executed shortly afterwards by royalist soldiers. It was the deadliest single battle in Texas history. 300 republican government officials in San Antonio were captured and executed by the Spanish royalists shortly after the battle. What is significant is a Spanish royalist lieutenant named [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] fought in this battle and followed his superiors' orders to take no prisoners. Another interesting note is two founding fathers of the [[Republic of Texas]] and future signers of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] in 1836, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Navarro]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ruiz]], took part in the Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition.<ref>https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qfm01 .
