With elements of [[hard rock]], [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], and [[pop music|pop]], it is one of Cream's best known and most popular songs.  Cream bassist and vocalist [[Jack Bruce]] based it on a distinctive bass [[Ostinato#Riff|riff]] he developed after attending a [[Jimi Hendrix]] concert. Guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] and lyricist [[Pete Brown]] later contributed to the song.  Recording engineer [[Tom Dowd]] suggested the rhythm arrangement in which drummer [[Ginger Baker]] plays a distinctive [[tom-tom drum]] rhythm, although Baker claimed it was his idea.\n\nThe song was included on Cream's best-selling second album ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' in November 1967. [[Atco Records]], the group's American label, was initially unsure of the song's potential. After recommendations by other label-affiliated artists, it released an edited single version in December 1967.{{efn|name=\"Release date\"|Although several music writers indicate a January 1968 or 1968 release, including Bobby Owsinski, Riley Haas, [[Chris Welch]], and Bob Leszczak, the single entered the ''Cash Box'' Looking Ahead chart dated 30 December 1967, precluding the possibility of a January 1968 release.<ref name=\"Spotlight\">\n{{cite journal\n| author = Cash Box\n| date = 30 December 1967\n| title = Looking Ahead\n| journal = [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]\n| volume = 29\n| issue = 23\n| issn = \n| page = 18\n| ref = harv\n}}</ref>}} The song became Cream's first and highest charting American single and one of the most popular singles of 1968. In September 1968, it became a modest chart hit after being released in the UK.\n\nCream performed \"Sunshine of Your Love\" regularly in concert and several live recordings have been issued, including on the ''[[Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005]]'' reunion album and video. Hendrix performed faster instrumental versions of the song, which he often dedicated to Cream. Several rock journals have placed the song on their greatest song lists, such as ''Rolling Stone'', ''Q'' magazine, and VH1.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it on its list of the \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\".\n\n==Composition==\n{{Listen\n| filename = Sunshine.ogg \n| title = Cream's \"Sunshine of Your Love\"\n| description = First 20 seconds of intro\n| pos = right\n| type = music\n}}\nIn early 1967, Cream were writing and rehearsing songs for their second album.

Cream attended a concert on 29 January 1967 by [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] at the [[Saville Theatre]] in London.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=137}}  Cream guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] elaborated in a 1988 [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|''Rolling Stone'']] magazine interview:\n{{quote|He [Hendrix] played this gig that was blinding.  I don't think Jack [Bruce] had really taken him in before{{nbsp}}... and when he did see it that night, after the gig he went home and came up with the riff.  It was strictly a dedication to Jimi.  And then we wrote a song on top of it.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=137}}}}\nMusic writers Covach and Boone describe the riff as blues-derived, which uses a minor blues pentatonic scale with an added flattened fifth note (or common [[blues scale]]).{{sfn|Covach|Boone|1997|p=84}}  The song follows a [[Twelve-bar blues|blues chord progression]] (I\u2013IV\u2013I) during the first eight bars.{{sfn|Covach|Boone|1997|p=84}}  Brown had a difficult time writing lyrics that fit the riff.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=89}}  After an all-night session, Bruce played it on a [[Double bass|standup bass]] while lyricist [[Pete Brown]] was staring out the window.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=89}}  Slowly, he started to write \"It's getting near dawn and lights close their tired eyes\", which is used in the first verse.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=97}}  Later, to break up the rhythm, Clapton wrote a refrain which also yielded the song's title.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=97}}{{sfn|Covach|Boone|1997|p=84}}  It consists of eight-[[Bar (music)|bar]] sections using three chords, when the [[Key (music)|key]] shifts to the V chord (I = V):{{sfn|Covach|Boone|1997|pp=84\u201385}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:500px;\"\n|width=12%|I\n|width=12%|{{music|flat}}III\u2013{{music|flat}}VII\n|width=12%|I\n|width=12%|{{music|flat}}III\u2013{{music|flat}}VII\n|width=12%|I\n|width=12%|{{music|flat}}III\u2013{{music|flat}}VII\n|width=12%|I\n|width=12%|I\n|-\n|}\nA [[bootleg recording]] from the [[Ricky-Tick]] club in London before Cream recorded the song in the studio, shows \"Sunshine of Your Love\" with a beat common to rock for the period.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=97}}  Cream drummer [[Ginger Baker]] compared it to the uptempo \"Hey Now, Princess\", another Bruce/Brown composition Cream recorded in March.{{sfn|Brewer|2005|loc=DVD}}  He said that he advised Bruce to slow it down and came up with the distinctive drum pattern which emphasises [[Beat (music)#On-beat and off-beat|beats one and three]]{{sfn|Brewer|2005|loc=DVD}}{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=89}} (typical rock drumming favours beats two and four and is known as the [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]]).{{sfn|Birnbaum|2012|pp=127\u2013128}}  However, Bruce and [[Audio engineer|recording engineer]] [[Tom Dowd]] dispute Baker's claim, which they say he only made much later.{{sfn|Brewer|2005|loc=DVD}}{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=97}}  Dowd later explained\n{{quote|Where all the other songs that they [Cream] played were prepared, [but] this one song, they never found a pocket, they were never comfortable{{nbsp}}...

[[Robert Stigwood]], the group's manager, booked them for a [[Murray the K]] package show at the [[RKO General|RKO]] Manhattan Theatre from 25 March to 2 April 1967.{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=41}}  When it was finished, Stigwood arranged for a recording session with [[Ahmet Ertegun]] at [[Atlantic Studios]].{{sfn|Brewer|2005|loc=DVD}}  Bruce and Brown had a number of new songs{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=98}} in various stages of development and entered the studio on 3 April.{{sfn|Brewer|2005|loc=DVD}}  Initially, Ertegun assigned Dowd to work with the trio.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|pp=87\u201388}}    Dowd had worked with many of the biggest [[jazz]] and [[rhythm and blues]] musicians in the 1950s and 1960s.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|pp=87\u201388}}  However, Cream was his first exposure to extreme volume levels.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=88}}  The group arrived at Atlantic with their concert setup of multiple [[Marshall 1959|Marshall]] amplifiers (each 100 watts).{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=88}}{{efn|Cream's equipment was painted in psychedelic designs and colours by the Dutch design collective [[the Fool (design collective)|the Fool]] and was first used at the Murray the K shows.

For his guitar solo, Clapton used a sound known as the \"woman tone\" on his 1964 [[Gibson SG]] Standard.{{sfn|Oxman|2011|pp=62\u201366}}  Author Mitch Gallagher describes it as a \"smooth, dark, singing, sustaining sound\".{{sfn|Gallagher|2012|p=278}} It is one of the best-known examples of the woman tone and quotes the melody from the perennial pop standard \"[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]\". {{sfn|Gallagher|2012|p=278}}{{sfn|Adelt|2007|p=71}} By using the song's [[Pentatonic scale#Major pentatonic scale|major pentatonic scale]], Clapton provides a contrast with the riff's blues scale.{{sfn|Munro|2005|p=30}}  A writer for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] describes this as \"creating a balance between the sun and the moon\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://rockhall.com/blog/post/performances-cream-reunion-sunshine-of-your-love/\n| last = Morrison\n| first = Shelby\n| title = Rare Performances: Cream in 1993 \u2013 \"Sunshine of Your Love\"\n| website = The Story of Rock\n| publisher = [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]\n| year = 1993\n| accessdate = 21 February 2015\n}}</ref>  Baker plays much of the song on the tom-toms,{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=106}} described as sounding [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|African]] (Schumacher){{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=89}} and [[Native American music#Native American drums|Native American]] (Shapiro).{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=97}}  Covach and Boone note he \"concentrates on the lower tom sounds and uses an articulation and sound reminiscent of the jazz drumming in the Woody Herman or Benny Goodman bands\".{{sfn|Covach|Boone|1997|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n==Releases and charts==\n\"Sunshine of Your Love\" was included as the second track on ''Disraeli Gears'', which was released in November 1967 by [[Reaction Records]] in the UK and [[Atco Records]] in the US.{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=40}} At first, Atco did not see the song as a single (\"Strange Brew\", backed with \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" had been released as a single in June 1967).{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=40}} However, in December 1967, the label issued an edited version of the song as the second single from the album, backed with \"[[SWLABR]]\"{{efn|name=\"Release date\"}} (the running time was trimmed from 4:08 to 3:03).<ref>\n{{cite AV media notes\n| title = Sunshine of Your Love\n| others = [[Cream (band)|The Cream]]{{sic}}\n| year = 1968\n| type = Single label\n| publisher = [[Atco Records]]\n| id = 45-6544\n| OCLC = 642983575\n| ref = harv\n}}</ref>\nIt entered [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine's [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart on 13 January 1968, reaching number 36 during its initial 14-week run.{{sfn|Whitburn|2015|p=137}}  The record re-entered the chart on 6 July 1968 and reached number five on 31 August 1968.{{sfn|Whitburn|2015|p=137}} In the UK, the single was not released until September 1968,{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=40}} after Cream had announced their impending breakup.

Your Love'''\" is a 1967 song by the British [[rock music|rock]] band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. With elements of [[hard rock]], [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], and [[pop music|pop]], it is one of Cream's best known and most popular songs.  Cream bassist and vocalist [[Jack Bruce]] based it on a distinctive bass [[Ostinato#Riff|riff]] he developed after attending a [[Jimi Hendrix]] concert. Guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] and lyricist [[Pete Brown]] later contributed to the song.  Recording engineer [[Tom Dowd]] suggested the rhythm arrangement in which drummer [[Ginger Baker]] plays a distinctive [[tom-tom drum]] rhythm, although Baker claimed it was his idea.\n\nThe song was included on Cream's second album ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' in November 1967, which was a best seller. [[Atco Records]], the group's American label, was initially unsure of the song's potential. After recommendations by other label-affiliated artists, it released an edited single version in December 1967.{{efn|name=\"Release date\"|Although several music writers indicate a January 1968 or 1968 release, including Bobby Owsinski, Riley Haas, [[Chris Welch]], and Bob Leszczak, the single entered the ''Cash Box'' Looking Ahead chart dated 30 December 1967, precluding the possibility of a January 1968 release.<ref name=\"Spotlight\">\n{{cite journal\n| author = Cash Box\n| date = 30 December 1967\n| title = Looking Ahead\n| journal = [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]\n| volume = 29\n| issue = 23\n| issn = \n| page = 18\n| ref = harv\n}}</ref>}} The song became Cream's first and highest charting American single and one of the most popular singles of 1968. In September 1968, it became a modest chart hit after being released in the UK.\n\nCream performed \"Sunshine of Your Love\" regularly in concert and several live recordings have been issued, including on the ''[[Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005]]'' reunion album and video. Hendrix performed faster instrumental versions of the song, which he often dedicated to Cream. Several rock journals have placed the song on their greatest song lists, such as ''Rolling Stone'', ''Q'' magazine, and VH1.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it on its list of the \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\".\n\n==Composition==\n{{Listen\n| filename = Sunshine.ogg \n| title = Cream's \"Sunshine of Your Love\"\n| description = First 20 seconds of intro\n| pos = right\n| type = music\n}}\nIn early 1967, Cream were writing and rehearsing songs for their second album.

Cream attended a concert on 29 January 1967 by [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] at the [[Saville Theatre]] in London.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=137}}  Cream guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] elaborated in a 1988 [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|''Rolling Stone'']] magazine interview:\n{{quote|He [Hendrix] played this gig that was blinding.  I don't think Jack [Bruce] had really taken him in before{{nbsp}}... and when he did see it that night, after the gig he went home and came up with the riff.  It was strictly a dedication to Jimi.  And then we wrote a song on top of it.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=137}}}}\nMusic writers Covach and Boone describe the riff as blues-derived, which uses a minor blues pentatonic scale with an added flattened fifth note (or common [[blues scale]]).{{sfn|Covach|Boone|1997|p=84}}  The song follows a [[Twelve-bar blues|blues chord progression]] (I\u2013IV\u2013I) during the first eight bars.{{sfn|Covach|Boone|1997|p=84}}  Brown had a difficult time writing lyrics that fit the riff.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=89}}  After an all-night session, Bruce played it on a [[Double bass|standup bass]] while lyricist [[Pete Brown]] was staring out the window.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=89}}  Slowly, he started to write \"It's getting near dawn and lights close their tired eyes\", which is used in the first verse.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=97}}  Later, to break up the rhythm, Clapton wrote a refrain which also yielded the song's title.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=97}}{{sfn|Covach|Boone|1997|p=84}}  It consists of eight-[[Bar (music)|bar]] sections using three chords, when the [[Key (music)|key]] shifts to the V chord (I = V):{{sfn|Covach|Boone|1997|pp=84\u201385}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:500px;\"\n|width=12%|I\n|width=12%|{{music|flat}}III\u2013{{music|flat}}VII\n|width=12%|I\n|width=12%|{{music|flat}}III\u2013{{music|flat}}VII\n|width=12%|I\n|width=12%|{{music|flat}}III\u2013{{music|flat}}VII\n|width=12%|I\n|width=12%|I\n|-\n|}\nA [[bootleg recording]] from the [[Ricky-Tick]] club in London before Cream recorded the song in the studio, shows \"Sunshine of Your Love\" with a beat common to rock for the period.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=97}}  Cream drummer [[Ginger Baker]] compared it to the uptempo \"Hey Now, Princess\", another Bruce/Brown composition Cream recorded in March.{{sfn|Brewer|2005|loc=DVD}}  He said that he advised Bruce to slow it down and came up with the distinctive drum pattern which emphasises [[Beat (music)#On-beat and off-beat|beats one and three]]{{sfn|Brewer|2005|loc=DVD}}{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=89}} (typical rock drumming favours beats two and four and is known as the [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]]).{{sfn|Birnbaum|2012|pp=127\u2013128}}  However, Bruce and [[Audio engineer|recording engineer]] [[Tom Dowd]] dispute Baker's claim, which they say he only made much later.{{sfn|Brewer|2005|loc=DVD}}{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=97}}  Dowd later explained\n{{quote|Where all the other songs that they [Cream] played were prepared, [but] this one song, they never found a pocket, they were never comfortable{{nbsp}}... I said, 'You know, have you ever seen any American Westerns [films that have] the Indian beat, where the downbeat is the beat?'&nbsp;... And when he [Ginger] started playing it that way, all of the parts came together and right away they were elated.{{sfn|Brewer|2005|loc=DVD}}}}\n\n==Recording==\nCream performed their first American concerts in New York City in 1967. [[Robert Stigwood]], the group's manager, booked them for a [[Murray the K]] package show at the [[RKO General|RKO]] Manhattan Theatre from 25 March to 2 April 1967.{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=41}}  When it was finished, Stigwood arranged for a recording session with [[Ahmet Ertegun]] at [[Atlantic Studios]].{{sfn|Brewer|2005|loc=DVD}}  Bruce and Brown had a number of new songs{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=98}} in various stages of development and entered the studio on 3 April.{{sfn|Brewer|2005|loc=DVD}}  Initially, Ertegun assigned Dowd to work with the trio.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|pp=87\u201388}}    Dowd had worked with many of the biggest [[jazz]] and [[rhythm and blues]] musicians in the 1950s and 1960s.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|pp=87\u201388}}  However, Cream was his first exposure to extreme volume levels.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=88}}  The group arrived at Atlantic with their concert setup of multiple [[Marshall 1959|Marshall]] amplifiers (each 100 watts).{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=88}}{{efn|Cream's equipment was painted in psychedelic designs and colours by the Dutch design collective [[the Fool (design collective)|the Fool]] and was first used at the Murray the K shows.  Clapton's 1964 [[Gibson SG]] Standard (also called \"[[The Fool (guitar)|the Fool]]\"), Bruce's [[Fender Bass VI]], and Baker's drums were painted to match.{{sfn|Oxman|2011|pp=62\u201366}}}}  Dowd was surprised by the amount of equipment accompanying the trio: \"They recorded at ear-shattering level{{nbsp}}... Everyone I'd worked with before was using Fender Deluxes [about 20 watts] or Twins [about 80 watts]\u2014six- and seven-piece bands that didn't play as loud as this three piece did.\"{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=88}}\n\nErtegun brought in producer [[Felix Pappalardi]], who he believed could work as a go-between with the group and Dowd.{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=88}}  They began with \"[[Strange Brew (song)|Strange Brew]]\", \"[[Tales of Brave Ulysses]]\", and \"Sunshine of Your Love\".{{sfn|Schumacher|2003|pp=88\u201389}}  Ertegun previewed the demos and was unhappy, expecting more blues-based material that was found on ''Fresh Cream''.{{sfn|Thompson|2012|loc=eBook}}  [[Jerry Wexler]], Ertegun's Atlantic Records partner, reportedly went as far as to call it \"psychedelic hogwash\".{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=98}}  However, [[Booker T. Jones]] (producer and keyboardist of [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]) and [[Otis Redding]] (both whose [[Stax Records|Stax]] recordings at the time were distributed by Atco parent Atlantic) gave \"Sunshine of Your Love\" their wholehearted approval.{{sfn|Thompson|2012|loc=eBook}}  Differences were smoothed over by the time Cream returned in May 1967 to finish recording the songs for ''Disraeli Gears''.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=98}}{{efn|Pappalardi was so upset with Atlantic's reaction to Cream's early recordings, when he joined [[Leslie West]] to form [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]], he chose to work with another record label.{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=99}}}}\n\nWith Pappalardi and Dowd, work continued on \"Sunshine of Your Love\". For his guitar solo, Clapton used a sound known as the \"woman tone\" on his 1964 [[Gibson SG]] Standard.{{sfn|Oxman|2011|pp=62\u201366}}  Author Mitch Gallagher describes it as a \"smooth, dark, singing, sustaining sound\".{{sfn|Gallagher|2012|p=278}} It is one of the best-known examples of the woman tone and quotes the melody from the perennial pop standard \"[[Blue Moon (1934 song)|Blue Moon]]\". {{sfn|Gallagher|2012|p=278}}{{sfn|Adelt|2007|p=71}} By using the song's [[Pentatonic scale#Major pentatonic scale|major pentatonic scale]], Clapton provides a contrast with the riff's blues scale.{{sfn|Munro|2005|p=30}}  A writer for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] describes this as \"creating a balance between the sun and the moon\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://rockhall.com/blog/post/performances-cream-reunion-sunshine-of-your-love/\n| last = Morrison\n| first = Shelby\n| title = Rare Performances: Cream in 1993 \u2013 \"Sunshine of Your Love\"\n| website = The Story of Rock\n| publisher = [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]\n| year = 1993\n| accessdate = 21 February 2015\n}}</ref>  Baker plays much of the song on the tom-toms,{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=106}} described as sounding [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|African]] (Schumacher){{sfn|Schumacher|2003|p=89}} and [[Native American music#Native American drums|Native American]] (Shapiro).{{sfn|Shapiro|2009|p=97}}  Covach and Boone note he \"concentrates on the lower tom sounds and uses an articulation and sound reminiscent of the jazz drumming in the Woody Herman or Benny Goodman bands\".{{sfn|Covach|Boone|1997|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n==Releases and charts==\n\"Sunshine of Your Love\" was included as the second track on ''Disraeli Gears'', which was released in November 1967 by [[Reaction Records]] in the UK and [[Atco Records]] in the US.{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=40}} At first, Atco did not see the song as a single (\"Strange Brew\", backed with \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" had been released as a single in June 1967).{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=40}} However, in December 1967, the label issued an edited version of the song as the second single from the album, backed with \"[[SWLABR]]\"{{efn|name=\"Release date\"}} (the running time was trimmed from 4:08 to 3:03).<ref>\n{{cite AV media notes\n| title = Sunshine of Your Love\n| others = [[Cream (band)|The Cream]]{{sic}}\n| year = 1968\n| type = Single label\n| publisher = [[Atco Records]]\n| id = 45-6544\n| OCLC = 642983575\n| ref = harv\n}}</ref>\nIt entered [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine's [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart on 13 January 1968, reaching number 36 during its initial 14-week run.{{sfn|Whitburn|2015|p=137}}  The record re-entered the chart on 6 July 1968 and reached number five on 31 August 1968.{{sfn|Whitburn|2015|p=137}} In the UK, the single was not released until September 1968,{{sfn|Roberty|1993|p=40}} after Cream had announced their impending breakup.

dedicated the song to him.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=137, 300}}  He played it as an instrumental and sometimes as part of a medley.{{sfn|Belmo|Loveless|1998|pp=461\u2013465}}  A performance by the

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead.

Marty expects Wendy will be opposed, but to his surprise, she approves. Bruce and Marty commit to work for Del, and Del has his previous financial advisor Louis killed in front of them. Not only was Louis skimming, which Del suspected and Marty confirmed when analyzing the ledgers, he was also informing to Roy at the FBI.

Eugenia dies in an accident, and Sam wants access to her savings to pay for her elaborate funeral. Instead, Marty and Wendy volunteer to pay, and end up buying the funeral home. Roy reveals to Russ that their relationship is a ploy, and he recorded Russ's admission of trying to kill Marty.

Wendy attends a prayer breakfast to woo faltering senators and resorts to blackmail. Wilkes makes a play for Wendy as the price for obtaining the vote of the last senate holdout, but Wendy rebuffs him. Wendy sees Mason preaching on the streets of Jefferson City, baby Zeke at his side. Rachel's drug-and-drinking binge causes her to wreck her car, leading Roy to turn her into an informant against Marty and send her back to the Blue Cat.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore.

Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago.

Marty asks Ruth to run the strip club over the Fourth of July weekend, which leads to him hiring her as the full time manager. She betters Bobby's management with actions, including hiring new staff, that turn Lickety Splitz into a moneymaker.

They warn Marty to stop church construction, with implied threats to Mason's pregnant wife Grace if Marty does not persuade him to resume boat-based services. Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration. During sex, Marty intentionally reminds her of an encounter with Sugarwood, causing her discovery of the video Marty's private investigator made.
