The [[iPad]] program at St. Matthew, which was launched in 2013, allows for the issue of an Apple iPad to each child in 4th through 8th grade for use both at school and home as a primary learning tool, to be used for note-taking, content creation, project collaboration, individualized assessments and communicating with other students and their instructors.\nYounger grades use iPads to complete work in the classroom. Similarly, the Cardinal Advantage Classroom is equipped with ceiling-mounted LCD projectors, computers, faculty iPads, and Mimio Teach Systems. Pre-kindergarteners through third-graders can access mobile learning carts that contain a classroom set of iPads loaded with grade-specific educational applications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/community/north_central/news/article/North-Central-Campus-Briefs-Jan-10-4174329.php |title=North Central Campus Briefs \u2014 Jan. 10 |publisher=San Antonio Magazine - San Antonio, TX |date=8 January 2013 |website=San Antonio Express-News - mySA.com |access-date=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nSt. Matthew offers honors courses and elective programs for Middle School students, and participates in the [[National Junior Honor Society]].

{"title_page": "Elections in New Jersey", "text_new": "{{ElectionsNJ}}\n\n'''Elections in [[New Jersey]]''' are authorized under Article II of the [[New Jersey State Constitution]], which establishes elections for the [[Governor of New Jersey|governor]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey|lieutenant governor]], and members of the [[New Jersey Legislature]].  Elections are regulated under state law, Title 19.  The office of the [[New Jersey Secretary of State]] has a Division of Elections that oversees the execution of elections under state law (This used to be the [[New Jersey Attorney General]]).  In addition, the [[New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission]] (ELEC) is responsible for administering [[campaign financing]] and [[lobbying]] disclosure.\n\nHistorically, it has voted about half the time, nationally, for each of the two major parties since 1860.<ref>[http://www.270towin.com/states/New_Jersey]</ref> Traditionally a [[swing state]], It has voted Democratic in recent decades. The governorship has alternated between the two major parties since the election of Democrat [[Richard J. Hughes]] in 1961, with a succession of Republicans and Democrats serving as governor.  The [[New Jersey Legislature]] has also switched hands over the years, and one house was evenly divided from 1999\u20132001, when the Democrats took control. Three of the last four gubernatorial elections have been close.  New Jersey leans Democratic in national elections.  The Congressional seats have been as evenly divided over the decades, with little change due to political trends in the state. New Jersey currently has a Democratic governor, [[Phil Murphy]] and recently elected their second lieutenant governor, Democrat [[Sheila Oliver]].<ref>New Jersey Governors. (n.d.).

Needs merging with the above-->\nAt the national level, the state favors the Democratic Party: Both of its senators have been Democrats since 1982, and [[George H. W. Bush]] was the last Republican candidate for president to carry the state, in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]]. However, previous governor [[Chris Christie]] was a Republican serving from 2010 to 2018, as was [[Christine Todd Whitman]], who served from 1994 to 2001.\n\nNew Jersey is split almost down the middle between the [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]] television markets, respectively the largest and fourth-largest markets in the nation.  As a result, campaign budgets are among the largest in the country.\n\n==Political history==\n{{main|History of New Jersey}}\n\n===American Revolution===\nIn 1776, the first [[New Jersey State Constitution|Constitution of New Jersey]] was drafted. It was written during the Revolutionary War, and was created a basic framework for the state government. The constitution granted the right of suffrage to women and black men who met certain property requirements. The New Jersey Constitution of 1776<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/njfacts/njdoc10a.htm New Jersey Constitution of 1776]</ref> allowed \"all inhabitants of this Colony, of full age, who are worth fifty pounds proclamation money\" to vote. This included blacks, spinsters, and widows; married women could not own property under the [[common law]]. The Constitution declared itself temporary, and it was to be void if there was reconciliation with [[Great Britain]].<ref>Klinghoffer and Elkis. \"The Petticoat Electors: Women\u2019s Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776&ndash;1807.\" Journal of the Early Republic, 12, no. 2 (1992): 159&ndash;193.</ref><ref>Connors, R. J. (1775). New Jersey's Revolutionary Experience [Pamphlet]. Trenton, NJ: New Jersey Historical Commission.</ref> Both parties in elections mocked the other party for relying on \"petticoat electors\" and accused the other of allowing unqualified women to vote.\n\n===19th century===\nThe second version of the [[New Jersey State Constitution]] was written in 1844. The constitution provided the right of suffrage only to white males, removing it from women and black men. Some of the important components of the second State Constitution include the separation of the powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The new constitution also provided a [[bill of rights]]. The people had the right to directly elect the [[governor]].\n\n==Recent trends==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:1em; font-size:95%;\"\n|+ New Jersey vote|Gubernatorial election results<ref name=\"Leip, David\">{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|title=General Election Results \u2013 New York|publisher=[[Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]]|accessdate=November 18, 2016 |author=Leip, David}}</ref>\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!

It supported Republican presidential candidates in all but two elections from 1952 to 1988. It gave comfortable margins of victory to the Republican candidate in the close elections of 1948, 1968, and 1976. New Jersey was a crucial swing state in the elections of 1960, 1968, and 1992.\n\nHowever, the brand of Republicanism in New Jersey has historically been a moderate one.  As the national party tilted more to the right, the state's voters became more willing to support Democrats at the national level.  This culminated in 1992, when [[Bill Clinton]] narrowly carried the state, becoming the first Democrat to win it since 1964.  Since then, the only relatively close presidential race in New Jersey was in 2004, when Democrat [[John Kerry]] defeated [[George W. Bush]] in New Jersey by a margin of about seven percentage points.  Clinton won it handily in 1996, and [[Al Gore]] won it almost as easily in 2000.  In the 2008 and the 2012 presidential election, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] carried the state by more than 15 percentage points.  [[Hillary Clinton]] won it by over 14 points in 2016. Indeed, the 2004 election is the only election in recent years where the race hasn't been called for the Democrat soon after the polls closed.  As a result, at the presidential level New Jersey is now considered part of the solid bloc of blue states in the Northeast.\n\nThe most recent victory by a Republican in a U.S. Senate race in the state was [[Clifford P. Case]]'s reelection in 1972.  Only [[Hawaii]] has had longer periods of exclusive Democratic victories in U.S. Senate races. The last Republican to hold a Senate seat from New Jersey was [[Jeffrey Chiesa]], who was appointed a U.S. Senator by Governor [[Chris Christie]] in 2013 after Democrat [[Frank Lautenberg]] died in office. Chiesa served four months in office and did not seek election in his own right.\n\nAfter Kean won the biggest victory for a gubernatorial race in New Jersey in 1985, no Republican ever won 50 percent of the vote in a New Jersey election for three decades until [[Chris Christie]] was re-elected in 2013 with 60% of the vote.  [[Christine Todd Whitman]] was elected governor with 49 percent of the vote in 1993 and with 47 percent in 1997.\n\nOn November 3, 2009, incumbent Democratic Governor [[Jon Corzine]] was unseated by Republican challenger [[Chris Christie]]. Christie's margin of victory was 49%-45%.<ref>[http://www.nj.gov/state/elections/2009results/09general/09-official-general-election-gov-lt-gov-tallies-120109.pdf]</ref>  Four years later, Christie was reelected with 60 percent of the vote, becoming the first Republican to clear the 50 percent mark since 1985.\n\nAs New Jersey is split almost down the middle between the [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]] television markets, advertising budgets for statewide elections are among the most expensive in the country.\n\n===Partisan strongholds===\nThe state's Democratic strongholds include [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]] around the cities of Trenton and Princeton; [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]] and [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]] counties the state's two most urban counties, around the state's two largest cities, Newark and Jersey City; as well as Camden County and New Brunswick/Middlesex County and most of the other urban communities just outside Philadelphia and New York City.  The northeastern and southwestern counties, with over two million voters between them, have made it extremely difficult in recent years for a Republican presidential candidate to carry New Jersey.  In 2004, for instance, Bush lost the state largely due to being completely shut out in those areas.\n\nThe state's more rural to suburban northwestern counties are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] strongholds, especially mountainous [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon County]] and [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]].  [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset]], a more rural northwestern county, also leans Republican but can be competitive in national races. In the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]], Bush received about 52% in Somerset and 60% in Hunterdon, while in rural Republican Sussex County, Bush garnered 64% of the vote. Parts of rural to suburban northwestern [[Bergen County|Bergen]] and [[Passaic County|Passaic]] counties which are also mountainous, are also usually Republican.\n\nThe southeastern counties along the coast also favor Republicans, notably [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]], [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]], and [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May County]].  However, [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]], which includes urban [[Atlantic City]], has recently swung Democratic in national elections.\n\n===Swing counties===\nAbout half of the counties in New Jersey, are considered swing counties, though most lean toward one party, usually the Democrats. For example, [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] is solidly Republican in the wealthier and in some places rural and mountainous north and solidly Democratic in the more urbanized south. Due to the influence of the south, Bergen County has not gone Republican in a presidential election since 1992. The same is true of [[Passaic County]] which has a densely populated, heavily Hispanic Democratic south and a rural Republican north. Some other counties such as [[Salem County, New Jersey|Salem County]] lean Republican because the urbanized areas in those counties are relatively small compared to those of the more heavily Democratic counties. Statistically, Atlantic County is the most representative county.\n\n===Unaffiliated voters===\nUnaffiliated is a status for [[Voter registration|registered voters]] in [[New Jersey]]. Those voters who do not specify a [[political party]] affiliation when they register to vote are listed as unaffiliated.<ref name =\"NJDeptState\">[http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/parties_doe.html \"Political Party Resources.\" Division of Elections.

However, unaffiliated voters may declare their party affiliation up to and including the day of the [[primary election]].<ref name =\"NJDeptState\" /> Unaffiliated status does not affect participation in general elections.\n\n== New Jersey Congressional Districts ==\n{{main|New Jersey's congressional districts}}\nFollowing each decennial census, the [[New Jersey Redistricting Commission]] forms to realign the districts.  New Jersey currently has 12 [[New Jersey Congressional Districts|House districts]] In the 116th Congress, eleven of New Jersey's seats are held by Democrats and one is held by a Republican.\n\n==See also==\n*[[United States presidential election in New Jersey, 2004]]\n*[[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2005]]\n*[[United States Senate election in New Jersey, 2006]]\n*[[United States Senate election in New Jersey, 2008]]\n*[[United States Senate election in New Jersey, 2012]]\n*[[United States Senate election in New Jersey, 2018]]\n*[[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2009]]\n*[[New Jersey elections, 2009]]\n*[[Politics of New Jersey]]\n*[[Political party strength in New Jersey]]\n*[[Law of New Jersey]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/ Division of Elections] at the New Jersey Department of State official website\n*[http://www.elec.state.nj.us/ Election Law Enforcement Commission]\n*[http://www.politicsNJ.com PoliticsNJ]\n*{{Ballotpedia|New_Jersey|New Jersey}}\n\n{{ElectionsByUSState}}\n{{New Jersey}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elections In New Jersey}}\n[[Category:New Jersey elections| ]]\n[[Category:Government of New Jersey]]\n", "text_old": "{{ElectionsNJ}}\n\n'''Elections in [[New Jersey]]''' are authorized under Article II of the [[New Jersey State Constitution]], which establishes elections for the [[Governor of New Jersey|governor]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey|lieutenant governor]], and members of the [[New Jersey Legislature]].  Elections are regulated under state law, Title 19.  The office of the [[New Jersey Secretary of State]] has a Division of Elections that oversees the execution of elections under state law (This used to be the [[New Jersey Attorney General]]).  In addition, the [[New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission]] (ELEC) is responsible for administering [[campaign financing]] and [[lobbying]] disclosure.\n\nHistorically, it has voted about half the time, nationally, for each of the two major parties since 1860.<ref>[http://www.270towin.com/states/New_Jersey]</ref> Traditionally a [[swing state]], It has voted Democratic in recent decades. The governorship has alternated between the two major parties since the election of Democrat [[Richard J. Hughes]] in 1961, with a succession of Republicans and Democrats serving as governor.  The [[New Jersey Legislature]] has also switched hands over the years, and one house was evenly divided from 1999\u20132001, when the Democrats took control. Three of the last four gubernatorial elections have been close.  New Jersey leans Democratic in national elections.  The Congressional seats have been as evenly divided over the decades, with little change due to political trends in the state. New Jersey currently has a Democratic governor, [[Phil Murphy]] and recently elected their second lieutenant governor, Democrat [[Sheila Oliver]].<ref>New Jersey Governors. (n.d.).

Needs merging with the above-->\nAt the national level, the state favors the Democratic Party: Both of its Senators have been Democrats since 1982, and [[George H. W. Bush]] was the last Republican candidate for President to carry the state, in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]]. However, previous governor [[Chris Christie]] was a Republican serving from 2010 to 2018, as was [[Christine Todd Whitman]], who served from 1994 to 2001.\n\nNew Jersey is split almost down the middle between the [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]] television markets, respectively the largest and fourth-largest markets in the nation.  As a result, campaign budgets are among the largest in the country.\n\n==Political history==\n{{main|History of New Jersey}}\n\n===American Revolution===\nIn 1776, the first [[New Jersey State Constitution|Constitution of New Jersey]] was drafted. It was written during the Revolutionary War, and was created a basic framework for the state government. The constitution granted the right of suffrage to women and black men who met certain property requirements. The New Jersey Constitution of 1776<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/njfacts/njdoc10a.htm New Jersey Constitution of 1776]</ref> allowed \"all inhabitants of this Colony, of full age, who are worth fifty pounds proclamation money\" to vote. This included blacks, spinsters, and widows; married women could not own property under the [[common law]]. The Constitution declared itself temporary, and it was to be void if there was reconciliation with [[Great Britain]].<ref>Klinghoffer and Elkis. \"The Petticoat Electors: Women\u2019s Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776&ndash;1807.\" Journal of the Early Republic, 12, no. 2 (1992): 159&ndash;193.</ref><ref>Connors, R. J. (1775). New Jersey's Revolutionary Experience [Pamphlet]. Trenton, NJ: New Jersey Historical Commission.</ref> Both parties in elections mocked the other party for relying on \"petticoat electors\" and accused the other of allowing unqualified women to vote.\n\n===19th century===\nThe second version of the [[New Jersey State Constitution]] was written in 1844. The constitution provided the right of suffrage only to white males, removing it from women and black men. Some of the important components of the second State Constitution include the separation of the powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The new constitution also provided a [[bill of rights]]. The people had the right to directly elect the [[governor]].\n\n==Recent trends==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:1em; font-size:95%;\"\n|+ New Jersey vote|Gubernatorial election results<ref name=\"Leip, David\">{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|title=General Election Results \u2013 New York|publisher=[[Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]]|accessdate=November 18, 2016 |author=Leip, David}}</ref>\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!

It supported Republican presidential candidates in all but two elections from 1952 to 1988. It gave comfortable margins of victory to the Republican candidate in the close elections of 1948, 1968, and 1976. New Jersey was a crucial swing state in the elections of 1960, 1968, and 1992.\n\nHowever, the brand of Republicanism in New Jersey has historically been a moderate one.  As the national party tilted more to the right, the state's voters became more willing to support Democrats at the national level.  This culminated in 1992, when [[Bill Clinton]] narrowly carried the state, becoming the first Democrat to win it since 1964.  Since then, the only relatively close presidential race in New Jersey was in 2004, when Democrat [[John Kerry]] defeated [[George W. Bush]] in New Jersey by a margin of about seven percentage points.  Clinton won it handily in 1996, and [[Al Gore]] won it almost as easily in 2000.  In the 2008 and the 2012 presidential election, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] carried the state by more than 15 percentage points.  [[Hillary Clinton]] won it by over 14 points in 2016. Indeed, the 2004 election is the only election in recent years where the race hasn't been called for the Democrat soon after the polls closed.  As a result, at the presidential level New Jersey is now considered part of the solid bloc of blue states in the Northeast.\n\nThe most recent victory by a Republican in a U.S. Senate race in the state was [[Clifford P. Case]]'s reelection in 1972.  Only [[Hawaii]] has had longer periods of exclusive Democratic victories in U.S. Senate races. The last Republican to hold a Senate seat from New Jersey was [[Jeffrey Chiesa]], who was appointed a U.S. Senator by Governor [[Chris Christie]] in 2013 after Democrat [[Frank Lautenberg]] died in office. Chiesa served four months in office and did not seek election in his own right.\n\nAfter Kean won the biggest victory for a gubernatorial race in New Jersey in 1985, no Republican ever won 50 percent of the vote in a New Jersey election for three decades until [[Chris Christie]] was re-elected in 2013 with 60% of the vote.  [[Christine Todd Whitman]] was elected governor with 49 percent of the vote in 1993 and with 47 percent in 1997.\n\nOn November 3, 2009, incumbent Democratic Governor [[Jon Corzine]] was unseated by Republican challenger [[Chris Christie]]. Christie's margin of victory was 49%-45%.<ref>[http://www.nj.gov/state/elections/2009results/09general/09-official-general-election-gov-lt-gov-tallies-120109.pdf]</ref>  Four years later, Christie was reelected with 60 percent of the vote, becoming the first Republican to clear the 50 percent mark since 1985.\n\nAs New Jersey is split almost down the middle between the [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]] television markets, advertising budgets for statewide elections are among the most expensive in the country.\n\n===Partisan strongholds===\nThe state's Democratic strongholds include [[Mercer County, New Jersey|Mercer County]] around the cities of Trenton and Princeton; [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex]] and [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]] counties the state's two most urban counties, around the state's two largest cities, Newark and Jersey City; as well as Camden County and New Brunswick/Middlesex County and most of the other urban communities just outside Philadelphia and New York City.  The northeastern and southwestern counties, with over two million voters between them, have made it extremely difficult in recent years for a Republican presidential candidate to carry New Jersey.  In 2004, for instance, Bush lost the state largely due to being completely shut out in those areas.\n\nThe state's more rural to suburban northwestern counties are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] strongholds, especially mountainous [[Sussex County, New Jersey|Sussex County]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris County]], [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon County]] and [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]].  [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset]], a more rural northwestern county, also leans Republican but can be competitive in national races. In the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]], Bush received about 52% in Somerset and 60% in Hunterdon, while in rural Republican Sussex County, Bush garnered 64% of the vote. Parts of rural to suburban northwestern [[Bergen County|Bergen]] and [[Passaic County|Passaic]] counties which are also mountainous, are also usually Republican.\n\nThe southeastern counties along the coast also favor Republicans, notably [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]], [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]], and [[Cape May County, New Jersey|Cape May County]].  However, [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]], which includes urban [[Atlantic City]], has recently swung Democratic in national elections.\n\n===Swing counties===\nAbout half of the counties in New Jersey, are considered swing counties, though most lean toward one party, usually the Democrats. For example, [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] is solidly Republican in the wealthier and in some places rural and mountainous north and solidly Democratic in the more urbanized south. Due to the influence of the south, Bergen County has not gone Republican in a presidential election since 1992. The same is true of [[Passaic County]] which has a densely populated, heavily Hispanic Democratic south and a rural Republican north. Some other counties such as [[Salem County, New Jersey|Salem County]] lean Republican because the urbanized areas in those counties are relatively small compared to those of the more heavily Democratic counties.

In 1932, the school was moved to the corner of St George and Orrong Roads, Toorak. Property in Heyington was purchased and developed into playing fields. This location is now the Senior School Campus, housing Years 7 to 8, and Years 10 through to Year 12, in a vertical [[house system]].\n\nThe Heyington Campus, which is next to the [[Glen Waverley, Victoria|Glen Waverley]] railway line, was built in 1960, its main feature being the Kearney Building. \n\nThe Lansell Road property was opened in 1972, and that same year the Orrong Road property was sold. \n\nIn 1982, the K.C. Smith building was constructed for the middle school years on the Senior Campus.\n[[File:SKC Ovals 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Oval Number 1: Scoreboard in the background, and the Pavilion to the right]]In 1990 the Pavilion was opened. Since its opening, the Pavilion has flooded twice, both in 2005. Ovals 1 and 2 were completely submerged.\nThe Cummins Building was refurbished in 1997, and currently houses the creative arts precinct, which includes arts, drama, music and artistic works. The McCarthy Building was opened that year, housing art studios, the campus library and the Administration Block. \n\nThe Lansell Road property is now home to the Glendalough Campus, and in 1999 became a full [[primary school]], housing Prep to Year 6 students. Also in 1999, Year 9 students moved from the Senior Campus to a dedicated campus named Waterford in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Waterford currently resides in the former [[Vaucluse College FCJ]] site in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. 1999 saw a major change in the structure of the school, with the introduction of the House System for Years 10 to 12. This saw the desegregation of year levels and their amalgamation into houses with five tutor groups comprising Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12 boys, accompanied by a tutor. Previously, boys were organised by year levels, and supervised by Year Level Coordinators, somewhat similar to the current system found in the Middle School (Years 7 to 9).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary - History|last=|first=|publisher=St. Kevin's College|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 11}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, a $16 million indoor pool, gym and sports facility, the Wilding Centre, was blessed by Cardinal [[George Pell]] and opened for the students.\n\nIn 2009 the Godfrey Building was opened.\n\nIn 2010, the Boyd Egan Hall was opened at Glendalough and substantial floods filled the school's ovals and damaged the Fraser Tennis Courts.\n\nIn 2011, work began on a three-storey $14 million Science Wing, located adjacent to [[Heyington railway station]] at the end of the Kearney Building. \n\nIn 2013, the Kearney West Building was officially opened. The building contains science labs and woodwork rooms, which are used for senior classes.\n\nIn 2014, the McMahon Music Centre was opened at Glendalough and the remaining laboratories in the Kearney Building were refurbished. Music and drama facilities in the Cummins Building were modernised as well.\n\nIn 2017, the Tooronga Fields Campus was opened as the St Kevin's offsite sports ground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary 2018|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n2018 saw St Kevin's College celebrate its centenary year. A special 100-year logo was created and was used throughout the school year.

In 1932, the school was moved to the corner of St George and Orrong Roads, Toorak. Property in Heyington was purchased and developed into playing fields. This location is now the Senior School Campus, housing Years 7 to 8, and Years 10 through to Year 12, in a vertical [[house system]].\n\nThe Heyington Campus, which is next to the [[Glen Waverley, Victoria|Glen Waverley]] railway line, was built in 1960, its main feature being the Kearney Building. \n\nThe Lansell Road property was opened in 1972, and that same year the Orrong Road property was sold. \n\nIn 1982, the K.C. Smith building was constructed for the middle school years on the Senior Campus.\n[[File:SKC Ovals 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Oval Number 1: Scoreboard in the background, and the Pavilion to the right]]In 1990 the Pavilion was opened. Since its opening, the Pavilion has flooded twice, both in 2005. Ovals 1 and 2 were completely submerged.\nThe Cummins Building was refurbished in 1997, and currently houses the creative arts precinct, which includes arts, drama, music and artistic works. The McCarthy Building was opened that year, housing art studios, the campus library and the Administration Block. \n\nThe Lansell Road property is now home to the Glendalough Campus, and in 1999 became a full [[primary school]], housing Prep to Year 6 students. Also in 1999, Year 9 students moved from the Senior Campus to a dedicated campus named Waterford in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Waterford currently resides in the former [[Vaucluse College FCJ]] site in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. 1999 saw a major change in the structure of the school, with the introduction of the House System for Years 10 to 12. This saw the desegregation of year levels and their amalgamation into houses with five tutor groups comprising Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12 boys, accompanied by a tutor. Previously, boys were organised by year levels, and supervised by Year Level Coordinators, somewhat similar to the current system found in the Middle School (Years 7 to 9).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary - History|last=|first=|publisher=St. Kevin's College|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 11}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, a $16 million indoor pool, gym and sports facility, the Wilding Centre, was blessed by Cardinal [[George Pell]] and opened for the students.\n\nIn 2009 the Godfrey Building was opened.\n\nIn 2010, the Boyd Egan Hall was opened at Glendalough and substantial floods filled the school's ovals and damaged the Fraser Tennis Courts.\n\nIn 2011, work began on a three-storey $14 million Science Wing, located adjacent to [[Heyington railway station]] at the end of the Kearney Building. \n\nIn 2013, the Kearney West Building was officially opened. The building contains science labs and woodwork rooms, which are used for senior classes.\n\nIn 2014, the McMahon Music Centre was opened at Glendalough and the remaining laboratories in the Kearney Building were refurbished. Music and drama facilities in the Cummins Building were modernised as well.\n\nIn 2017, the Tooronga Fields Campus was opened as the St Kevin's offsite sports ground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary 2018|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n2018 saw St Kevin's College celebrate its centenary year. A special 100-year logo was created and was used throughout the school year. Several celebrations were conducted, including a free lunch provided by the school, intended to pay homage to the older traditions of the College chartering a train from [[Heyington railway station]] to other parts of Melbourne for a school picnic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 1|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> Special events such as \"The Great Debate\", featuring generations of St Kevin's old boys, took place<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> and a limited-edition 100-year history of the College was published for students and staff.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bound by the Green, Gold and Blue|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2020}}\nSt Kevin's College has five campuses:\n*Glendalough \u2013 The St Kevin's College Junior School in Lansell Road, [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], is named after the location of the St Kevin's Monastery in Ireland.

As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as [[cancer|malignancy]] or [[gangrene]]. In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventive surgery for such problems. A special case is that of [[congenital amputation]], a [[congenital disorder]], where [[fetus|fetal]] limbs have been cut off by constrictive bands.

The fluid in the pale skin solidifies, creating ice crystals, leading to swelling and severe pain. Other symptoms can include numbness, confusion, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, stiffness in the muscles or joints as well as difficulty walking. If the frostbite doesn't get treated soon, this process results in hypothermia, death or poisoning of the bloodstream.\n\nThis can affect the hands, feet, toes, fingers, eyes and face. Once the frostbite shuts the eyelids, this is known as snow blindness. The only way to stop it from spreading is through skin grafts or amputation.\n\n===Athletic performance===\nSometimes professional [[Sportsperson|athletes]] may choose to have a non-essential digit amputated to relieve chronic pain and impaired performance. \n* Australian Rules footballer [[Daniel Chick]] elected to have his left [[ring finger]] amputated as chronic pain and injury was limiting his performance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/0122/aussierules.html |title=RTE: Aussie Rules star has finger removed |access-date=2007-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214022643/http://www.rte.ie/sport/2002/0122/aussierules.html |archive-date=2007-12-14 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref> \n* [[Rugby union]] player [[Jone Tawake]] also had a finger removed.<ref>{{cite web |author=Australian Rugby Union |url=http://www.sportsaustralia.com/articles/oct06/artid6659.html |title=Tawake undergoes surgery to remove finger |publisher=SportsAustralia.com |date=2006-10-17 |access-date=2013-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501093242/http://sportsaustralia.com/articles/oct06/artid6659.html |archive-date=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[National Football League]] [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safety]] [[Ronnie Lott]] had the tip of his little finger removed after it was damaged in the [[1985 NFL season]].\n\n===Legal punishment {{anchor|As a punishment in Islam}}===\n* Amputation is used as a [[physical punishment|legal punishment]] in a number of countries, among them [[Legal system of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Legal system of Yemen|Yemen]], [[Legal system of the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], and [[Judicial system of Iran#Law|Iran]].\n\n== Surgery ==\n\n===Method===\n{{howto|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Curvy amputation knife DSC09451.jpg|thumb|200px|Curved knives such as this one were used, in the past, for some kinds of amputations.]]\nThe first step is [[ligature (medicine)|ligating]] the supplying [[artery]] and [[vein]], to prevent [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding). The muscles are transected, and finally, the [[bone]] is sawed through with an [[oscillating saw]]. Sharp and rough edges of the bone(s) are filed down, skin and muscle flaps are then transposed over the stump, occasionally with the insertion of elements to attach a [[prosthesis]].\n\nDistal stabilisation of muscles is recommended. This allows effective muscle contraction which reduces atrophy, allows functional use of the stump and maintains soft tissue coverage of the remnant bone. The preferred stabilisation technique is myodesis where the muscle is attached to the bone or its periosteum. In joint disarticulation amputations tenodesis may be used where the muscle tendon is attached to the bone. Muscles should be attached under similar tension to normal physiological conditions.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Smith DG |title=Atlas of Amputations and Limb Deficiencies: Surgical, Prosthetic and Rehabilitation Principles|date=2004|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|isbn=978-0892033133|pages=21\u201330|chapter=Chapter 2.

Chronic infections, often caused by diabetes or [[decubitus ulcers]] in bedridden patients, are common causes of infections that lead to gangrene, which would then necessitate amputation.\n\nThere are two key challenges: first, many patients have impaired circulation in their extremities, and second, they have difficulty curing infections in limbs with poor vasculation (blood circulation).\n \nCrush injuries where there is extensive tissue damage and poor circulation also benefit from [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (HBOT). The high level of oxygenation and revascularization speed up recovery times and prevent infections.\n\nA study found that the patented method called Circulator Boot achieved significant results in prevention of amputation in patients with diabetes and arterioscleorosis.<ref name=dillon1>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bouskela E, Donyo KA | title = Effects of oral administration of purified micronized flavonoid fraction on increased microvascular permeability induced by various agents and on ischemia/reperfusion in the hamster cheek pouch | journal = Angiology | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 391\u20139 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9158383 | doi = 10.1177/000331979704800503 | url = http://www.circulatorboot.com/literature/angiology1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101125035502/http://circulatorboot.com/literature/angiology1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2010-11-25 | access-date = 2010-06-24 }}</ref><ref name=dillon2>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dillon RS | title = Patient assessment and examples of a method of treatment.

These limbs can itch, ache, burn, feel tense, dry or wet, locked in or trapped or they can feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence. Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye ([[phantom eye syndrome]]).\n\nA similar phenomenon is unexplained sensation in a body part unrelated to the amputated limb. It has been hypothesized that the portion of the brain responsible for processing stimulation from amputated limbs, being deprived of input, expands into the surrounding brain, (''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'': [[V.S. Ramachandran]] and [[Sandra Blakeslee]]) such that an individual who has had an arm amputated will experience unexplained pressure or movement on his face or head{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.\n\nIn many cases, the phantom limb aids in adaptation to a prosthesis, as it permits the person to experience [[proprioception]] of the prosthetic limb. To support improved resistance or usability, comfort or healing, some type of [[stump sock]]s may be worn instead of or as part of wearing a prosthesis.\n\nAnother side effect can be [[heterotopic ossification]], especially when a bone injury is combined with a head injury. The brain signals the bone to grow instead of scar tissue to form, and nodules and other growth can interfere with prosthetics and sometimes require further operations. This type of injury has been especially common among soldiers wounded by [[improvised explosive device]]s in the [[Iraq War]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/26/MNSOLDIERS26.DTL |title=War without end / Damaged soldiers start their agonizing recoveries |first=Joan |last=Ryan |name-list-format=vanc |date=March 25, 2006 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208093622/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F03%2F26%2FMNSOLDIERS26.DTL |archive-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=June 4, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nDue to technologic advances in prosthetics, many amputees live active lives with little restriction.

This allows effective muscle contraction which reduces atrophy, allows functional use of the stump and maintains soft tissue coverage of the remnant bone. The preferred stabilisation technique is myodesis where the muscle is attached to the bone or its periosteum. In joint disarticulation amputations tenodesis may be used where the muscle tendon is attached to the bone. Muscles should be attached under similar tension to normal physiological conditions.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Smith DG |title=Atlas of Amputations and Limb Deficiencies: Surgical, Prosthetic and Rehabilitation Principles|date=2004|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|isbn=978-0892033133|pages=21\u201330|chapter=Chapter 2.

Of these, 4,435 occurred as a result of traffic and transportation accidents and 9,985 were due to labor accidents. Of all traumatic amputations, the distribution percentage is 30.75% for traffic accidents and 69.24% for labor accidents.<ref name=\"amstat.org\">[http://www.amstat.org/ American Statistical Association: Amputations in USA, 2000]</ref>\n* The population of the United States in 1999 was about 300,000,000, so the conclusion is that there is one amputation per 20,804 persons per year. In the group of labor amputations, 53% occurred in laborers and technicians, 30% in production and service workers, 16% in silviculture and fishery workers.<ref name=\"amstat.org\"/>\n* A study found that in 2010, 22.8% of patients undergoing amputation of a lower extremity in the United States were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days.<ref>Weiss AJ, Elixhauser A, Steiner C.

Chronic infections, often caused by diabetes or [[decubitus ulcers]] in bedridden patients, are common causes of infections that lead to gangrene, which would then necessitate amputation.\n\nThere are two key challenges: first, many patients have impaired circulation in their extremities, and second, they have difficulty curing infections in limbs with poor vasculation (blood circulation).\n \nCrush injuries where there is extensive tissue damage and poor circulation also benefit from [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (HBOT). The high level of oxygenation and revascularization speed up recovery times and prevent infections.\n\nA study found that the patented method called Circulator Boot achieved significant results in prevention of amputation in patients with diabetes and arterioscleorosis.<ref name=dillon1>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bouskela E, Donyo KA | title = Effects of oral administration of purified micronized flavonoid fraction on increased microvascular permeability induced by various agents and on ischemia/reperfusion in the hamster cheek pouch | journal = Angiology | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 391\u20139 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9158383 | doi = 10.1177/000331979704800503 | url = http://www.circulatorboot.com/literature/angiology1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101125035502/http://circulatorboot.com/literature/angiology1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2010-11-25 | access-date = 2010-06-24 }}</ref><ref name=dillon2>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dillon RS | title = Patient assessment and examples of a method of treatment.

These limbs can itch, ache, burn, feel tense, dry or wet, locked in or trapped or they can feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence. Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye ([[phantom eye syndrome]]).\n\nA similar phenomenon is unexplained sensation in a body part unrelated to the amputated limb. It has been hypothesized that the portion of the brain responsible for processing stimulation from amputated limbs, being deprived of input, expands into the surrounding brain, (''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'': [[V.S. Ramachandran]] and [[Sandra Blakeslee]]) such that an individual who has had an arm amputated will experience unexplained pressure or movement on his face or head{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.\n\nIn many cases, the phantom limb aids in adaptation to a prosthesis, as it permits the person to experience [[proprioception]] of the prosthetic limb. To support improved resistance or usability, comfort or healing, some type of [[stump sock]]s may be worn instead of or as part of wearing a prosthesis.\n\nAnother side effect can be [[heterotopic ossification]], especially when a bone injury is combined with a head injury. The brain signals the bone to grow instead of scar tissue to form, and nodules and other growth can interfere with prosthetics and sometimes require further operations. This type of injury has been especially common among soldiers wounded by [[improvised explosive device]]s in the [[Iraq War]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/26/MNSOLDIERS26.DTL |title=War without end / Damaged soldiers start their agonizing recoveries |first=Joan |last=Ryan |name-list-format=vanc |date=March 25, 2006 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208093622/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F03%2F26%2FMNSOLDIERS26.DTL |archive-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=June 4, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nDue to technologic advances in prosthetics, many amputees live active lives with little restriction.

The city collected an insurance settlement of almost $900,000 as a result of the cancellation.<ref name=\"TobinRamosSams\" />\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n=== Passenger ===\n{{Airport destination list | 3rdcoltitle = Refs | 3rdcolunsortable=yes\n<!--DO NOT ADD TERMINAL/CONCOURSE INFORMATION TO THIS TABLE AS IT VIOLATES [[WP:NOTTRAVEL]]-->\n<!-- -->\n| {{nowrap|[[Air Canada Express]]}} | [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto\u2013Pearson]] | <ref name=\"AirCanadaRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight Schedules|url=https://www.aircanada.com/us/en/aco/home/book/routes-and-partners/flight-schedules.html|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330083955/https://www.aircanada.com/us/en/aco/home/book/routes-and-partners/flight-schedules.html|archive-date=March 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Air Choice One]] | [[McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport|Jackson (TN)]] | <ref name=\"AtlantaGaAirChoiceOne\">{{cite web |title=Flights to Atlanta, GA |url=https://www.airchoiceone.com/destinations/flights-to-atlanta-ga/ |publisher=Air Choice One |access-date=March 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302104102/https://www.airchoiceone.com/destinations/flights-to-atlanta-ga/ |archive-date=March 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Air France]] | [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] | <ref name=\"AirFranceRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Horaires|url=https://www.airfrance.co.uk/GB/en/local/resainfovol/horaires/horaires.do|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419122802/http://www.airfrance.co.uk/GB/en/local/resainfovol/horaires/horaires.do|archive-date=April 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Alaska Airlines]] | [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport|Seattle/Tacoma]] | <ref name=\"AlaskaRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight timetable|url=https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|website=Alaskaair.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202123138/https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Airlines]] | [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[LaGuardia Airport|New York\u2013LaGuardia]], [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]], [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix\u2013Sky Harbor]], [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington\u2013National]] | <ref name=\"AmericanRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight schedules and notifications|url=https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202010611/https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] | [[Charlotte Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[LaGuardia Airport|New York\u2013LaGuardia]], [[Philadelphia International Airport|Philadelphia]], [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington\u2013National]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]] | <ref name=\"AmericanRoutes\" />\n<!-- -->\n| [[Boutique Air]] | [[Mid-Delta Regional Airport|Greenville (MS)]], [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport|Muscle Shoals]] | <ref name=\"BoutiqueRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Route Map and Schedule|url=https://www.boutiqueair.com/p/schedule|website=Boutiqueair.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205023354/https://www.boutiqueair.com/p/schedule|archive-date=December 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[British Airways]] | [[Heathrow Airport|London\u2013Heathrow]] | <ref name=\"BritishRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Timetables|url=https://www.britishairways.com/travel/schedules/public/en_gb|website=Britishairways.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330083400/https://www.britishairways.com/travel/schedules/public/en_gb|archive-date=March 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| {{nowrap|[[Delta Air Lines]]}} | [[Akron\u2013Canton Airport|Akron/Canton]], [[Albany International Airport|Albany (NY)]], [[Albuquerque International Sunport|Albuquerque]], [[Lehigh Valley International Airport|Allentown]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Appleton International Airport|Appleton]], [[Queen Beatrix International Airport|Aruba]], [[Asheville Regional Airport|Asheville]], [[Augusta Regional Airport|Augusta (GA)]], [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport|Austin]], [[Baltimore\u2013Washington International Airport|Baltimore]], [[Philip S.

With the help of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, specially designated immersion schools in which all subjects would be taught in Hawaiian were established. The [[University of Hawaii System|University of Hawaii]] developed a Hawaiian language graduate studies program. Municipal codes were altered to favor Hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Hawai\u02bbi Sign Language]], a [[sign language]] for the deaf based on the Hawaiian language, has been in use in the islands since the early 1800s.

Widemann and family, ca. 1860s.jpg|thumb|Mixed Hawaiian/European-American family in Honolulu, 1860s]]\n\nSome residents of Hawaii speak [[Hawaiian Pidgin|Hawai{{okina}}i Creole English]] (HCE), endonymically called ''pidgin'' or ''pidgin English''. The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog. During the 19th century, the increase in immigration\u2014mainly from China, Japan, Portugal\u2014especially from the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], and Spain\u2014catalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as ''pidgin''. By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ''ahi''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nHCE speakers have modified the meanings of some English words. For example, \"aunty\" and \"uncle\" may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder. [[Syntax]] and [[grammar]] follow distinctive rules different from those of General American English. For example, instead of \"it is hot today, isn't it?\", an HCE speaker would say simply \"stay hot, eh?\"{{efn|English \"to be\" is often omitted in Pidgin. In contexts where \"to be\" is used in [[General American]], \"to stay\" is preferred. \"To stay\" may have arisen due to an English calque of the Portuguese ''[[:en:wikt:ser#Portuguese|ser]]'', ''[[:en:wikt:estar#Portuguese|estar]]'', or ''[[:en:wikt:ficar#Portuguese|ficar]]''. ''Eh?'' ({{IPA-all|\u00e6\u0303\u02d0\u02e7\u02e6}}) is a [[tag question]] which may have roots in Japanese, which utilizes \u306d (ne?) to emphasize a point that may be agreed upon by all parties, or may come from Portuguese [[:en:wikt:n\u00e9#Portuguese|n\u00e9?]] (shortened from \"[[:en:wikt:n\u00e3o \u00e9#Portuguese|n\u00e3o \u00e9?]]\"), cf. French [[:en:wikt:n'est-ce pas#French|n'est-ce pas ?]]. ''Eh?'' may also have come from English ''yeah''.}} The term ''[[da kine]]'' is used as a [[filler (linguistics)|filler]]; a substitute for virtually any word or phrase. During the [[surfing]] boom in Hawaii, HCE was influenced by surfer slang. Some HCE expressions, such as ''brah'' and ''da kine'', have found their ways elsewhere through surfing communities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Religion===\n\n[[File:Perspective view of northwest elevation - Makiki Christian Church, 829 Pensacola Street, Honolulu, Honolulu County, HI HABS HI-533-1 (cropped).tif|thumb|alt=The fa\u00e7ade of a Christian church in downtown Honolulu.|The Makiki Christian Church in Honolulu heavily draws upon [[Japanese architecture]].]]\n\nChristianity is the most widespread religion in Hawaii, mainly represented by various [[Protestants]], [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Mormons]].

Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year, such as areas of [[California]], [[Arizona]] and [[Florida]], Hawaii's residents can be considered to be subject to a \"[[Sunshine tax]]\". This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs, a problem which many [[island country|island states and territories]] suffer from as well.\n\nThe higher costs to ship goods across an ocean may be further increased by the requirements of the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]], which generally requires that goods be transported between places within the U.S., including between the mainland U.S. west coast and Hawaii, using only U.S.-owned, built, and crewed ships. Jones Act-compliant vessels are often more expensive to build and operate than foreign equivalents, which can drive up shipping costs. While the Jones Act does not affect transportation of goods to Hawaii directly from Asia, this type of trade is nonetheless not common; this is a result of other primarily economic reasons including additional costs associated with stopping over in Hawaii (e.g. pilot and port fees), the market size of Hawaii, and the economics of using ever-larger ships that cannot be handled in Hawaii for transoceanic voyages. Therefore, Hawaii relies on receiving most inbound goods on Jones Act-qualified vessels originating from the U.S. west coast, which may contribute to the increased cost of some consumer goods and therefore the overall cost of living.<ref name=\"Keeping up with the Jones Act\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |title=Keeping up with the Jones Act |date=August 2012 |website=[[Hawaii Business Magazine]] |publisher=PacificBasin Communications |location=Honolulu, HI |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823083544/http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |archivedate=August 23, 2012 |url-status=live|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"U.S. Law Restricting Foreign Ships Leads to Higher Gas Prices\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|title=Jones Act Does Not Bar International Trade From Hawaii|last=Hansen|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2013|website=|publisher=Hawai\u02bbi Free Press|location=Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi|accessdate=July 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728040004/http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|archive-date=July 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act.

Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast [[Polynesian Triangle]] of the south and central Pacific Ocean. While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands. Some of these cultural influences, including the popularity (in greatly modified form) of ''[[luau|l\u016b{{okina}}au]]'' and ''[[hula]]'', are strong enough to affect the wider United States.\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n{{main|Cuisine of Hawaii}}\n[[File:Man with a Yoke Carrying Taro by Joseph Strong, oil on canvas board, 1880, Honolulu Museum of Art, accession 12692.1.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A painting of a man carrying taro by a yoke.|[[Taro]], or in Hawaiian ''kalo'', was one of the primary staples in Ancient Hawaii and remains a central ingredient in Hawaiian gastronomy today.]]\n\nThe [[cuisine of Hawaii]] is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, including the earliest Polynesians and [[Native Hawaiian cuisine]], and [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Polynesian cuisine|Polynesian]], [[Puerto Rican cuisine|Puerto Rican]], and [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] origins. Plant and animal food sources are imported from around the world for agricultural use in Hawaii. ''[[Poi (food)|Poi]]'', a starch made by pounding [[taro]], is one of the traditional foods of the islands. Many local restaurants serve the ubiquitous [[plate lunch]], which features two scoops of rice, a simplified version of American [[macaroni salad]] and a variety of toppings including [[hamburger]] patties, a fried egg, and [[gravy]] of a ''[[loco moco]]'', Japanese style ''[[tonkatsu]]'' or the traditional l\u016b{{okina}}au favorites, including ''[[kalua|k\u0101lua]]'' pork and ''[[laulau]]''. ''[[Spam musubi]]'' is an example of the fusion of ethnic cuisine that developed on the islands among the mix of immigrant groups and military personnel. In the 1990s, a group of chefs developed [[Hawaii regional cuisine]] as a contemporary fusion cuisine.\n\n===Customs and etiquette===\n\n{{Main|Customs and etiquette in Hawaii}}\n\nSome key customs and etiquette in Hawaii are as follows: when visiting a home, it is considered good manners to bring a small gift for one's host (for example, a dessert). Thus, parties are usually in the form of potlucks. Most locals take their shoes off before entering a home. It is customary for Hawaiian families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child's first birthday. It is also customary at Hawaiian weddings, especially at Filipino weddings, for the bride and groom to do a money dance (also called the [[pandanggo]]). Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as \"locals of Hawaii\" or \"people of Hawaii\".\n\n===Hawaiian mythology===\n\n{{Main|Hawaiian mythology}}\n[[File:Ethnologisches Museum Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 009.jpg|thumb|upright|A stone carving of a Hawaiian deity, housed at a German museum]]\n\nHawaiian mythology comprises the legends, historical tales, and sayings of the ancient Hawaiian people. It is considered a variant of a more general [[Polynesian mythology]] that developed a unique character for several centuries before ''circa'' 1800. It is associated with the [[Hawaiian religion]], which was officially suppressed in the 19th century but was kept alive by some practitioners to the modern day.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Prominent figures and terms include [[Aumakua]], the spirit of an ancestor or family god and [[K\u0101ne]], the highest of the four major Hawaiian deities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Polynesian mythology===\n\n{{main|Polynesian mythology}}\n[[File:Tahiti-Oro.jpg|thumb|upright|A sacred god figure wrapping for the war god [['Oro]], made of woven dried coconut fibre ([[sennit]]), which would have protected a Polynesian god effigy (''to'o''), made of wood]]\n\nPolynesian mythology is the [[oral tradition]]s of the people of Polynesia, a grouping of Central and South Pacific Ocean island [[archipelago]]s in the [[Polynesian triangle]] together with the scattered cultures known as the [[Polynesian outliers]].

Many are close enough in terms of vocabulary and grammar to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. There are also substantial cultural similarities between the various groups, especially in terms of social organization, childrearing, horticulture, building and textile technologies. Their mythologies in particular demonstrate local reworkings of commonly shared tales. The Polynesian cultures each have distinct but related oral traditions; legends or myths are traditionally considered to recount ancient history (the time of \"p\u014d\") and the adventures of gods (\"[[atua]]\") and deified ancestors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===List of state parks===\n\n{{main|List of Hawaiian state parks}}\n\nThere are [[list of Hawaiian state parks|many Hawaiian state parks]].\n* The [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] has state parks, recreation areas, and historical parks.\n* [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] has the [[Ahukini State Recreation Pier]], six state parks, and the [[Russian Fort Elizabeth State Historical Park]].\n* [[Maui]] has two state monuments, several state parks, and the [[Polipoli Spring State Recreation Area]].

The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog. During the 19th century, the increase in immigration\u2014mainly from China, Japan, Portugal\u2014especially from the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], and Spain\u2014catalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as ''pidgin''. By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ''ahi''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nHCE speakers have modified the meanings of some English words. For example, \"aunty\" and \"uncle\" may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder. [[Syntax]] and [[grammar]] follow distinctive rules different from those of General American English. For example, instead of \"it is hot today, isn't it?\", an HCE speaker would say simply \"stay hot, eh?\"{{efn|English \"to be\" is often omitted in Pidgin. In contexts where \"to be\" is used in [[General American]], \"to stay\" is preferred. \"To stay\" may have arisen due to an English calque of the Portuguese ''[[:en:wikt:ser#Portuguese|ser]]'', ''[[:en:wikt:estar#Portuguese|estar]]'', or ''[[:en:wikt:ficar#Portuguese|ficar]]''. ''Eh?'' ({{IPA-all|\u00e6\u0303\u02d0\u02e7\u02e6}}) is a [[tag question]] which may have roots in Japanese, which utilizes \u306d (ne?) to emphasize a point that may be agreed upon by all parties, or may come from Portuguese [[:en:wikt:n\u00e9#Portuguese|n\u00e9?]] (shortened from \"[[:en:wikt:n\u00e3o \u00e9#Portuguese|n\u00e3o \u00e9?]]\"), cf. French [[:en:wikt:n'est-ce pas#French|n'est-ce pas ?]]. ''Eh?'' may also have come from English ''yeah''.}} The term ''[[da kine]]'' is used as a [[filler (linguistics)|filler]]; a substitute for virtually any word or phrase. During the [[surfing]] boom in Hawaii, HCE was influenced by surfer slang. Some HCE expressions, such as ''brah'' and ''da kine'', have found their ways elsewhere through surfing communities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Religion===\n\n[[File:Perspective view of northwest elevation - Makiki Christian Church, 829 Pensacola Street, Honolulu, Honolulu County, HI HABS HI-533-1 (cropped).tif|thumb|alt=The fa\u00e7ade of a Christian church in downtown Honolulu.|The Makiki Christian Church in Honolulu heavily draws upon [[Japanese architecture]].]]\n\nChristianity is the most widespread religion in Hawaii, mainly represented by various [[Protestants]], [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Mormons]].

Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year, such as areas of [[California]], [[Arizona]] and [[Florida]], Hawaii's residents can be considered to be subject to a \"[[Sunshine tax]]\". This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs, a problem which many [[island country|island states and territories]] suffer from as well.\n\nThe higher costs to ship goods across an ocean may be further increased by the requirements of the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]], which generally requires that goods be transported between places within the U.S., including between the mainland U.S. west coast and Hawaii, using only U.S.-owned, built, and crewed ships. Jones Act-compliant vessels are often more expensive to build and operate than foreign equivalents, which can drive up shipping costs. While the Jones Act does not affect transportation of goods to Hawaii directly from Asia, this type of trade is nonetheless not common; this is a result of other primarily economic reasons including additional costs associated with stopping over in Hawaii (e.g. pilot and port fees), the market size of Hawaii, and the economics of using ever-larger ships that cannot be handled in Hawaii for transoceanic voyages. Therefore, Hawaii relies on receiving most inbound goods on Jones Act-qualified vessels originating from the U.S. west coast, which may contribute to the increased cost of some consumer goods and therefore the overall cost of living.<ref name=\"Keeping up with the Jones Act\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |title=Keeping up with the Jones Act |date=August 2012 |website=[[Hawaii Business Magazine]] |publisher=PacificBasin Communications |location=Honolulu, HI |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823083544/http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |archivedate=August 23, 2012 |url-status=live|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"U.S. Law Restricting Foreign Ships Leads to Higher Gas Prices\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|title=Jones Act Does Not Bar International Trade From Hawaii|last=Hansen|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2013|website=|publisher=Hawai\u02bbi Free Press|location=Honolulu, Hawai\u02bbi|accessdate=July 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728040004/http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|archive-date=July 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nHawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act.

Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast [[Polynesian Triangle]] of the south and central Pacific Ocean. While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands. Some of these cultural influences, including the popularity (in greatly modified form) of ''[[luau|l\u016b{{okina}}au]]'' and ''[[hula]]'', are strong enough to affect the wider United States.\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n{{main|Cuisine of Hawaii}}\n[[File:Man with a Yoke Carrying Taro by Joseph Strong, oil on canvas board, 1880, Honolulu Museum of Art, accession 12692.1.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A painting of a man carrying taro by a yoke.|[[Taro]], or in Hawaiian ''kalo'', was one of the primary staples in Ancient Hawaii and remains a central ingredient in Hawaiian gastronomy today.]]\n\nThe [[cuisine of Hawaii]] is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, including the earliest Polynesians and [[Native Hawaiian cuisine]], and [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Polynesian cuisine|Polynesian]], [[Puerto Rican cuisine|Puerto Rican]], and [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] origins. Plant and animal food sources are imported from around the world for agricultural use in Hawaii. ''[[Poi (food)|Poi]]'', a starch made by pounding [[taro]], is one of the traditional foods of the islands. Many local restaurants serve the ubiquitous [[plate lunch]], which features two scoops of rice, a simplified version of American [[macaroni salad]] and a variety of toppings including [[hamburger]] patties, a fried egg, and [[gravy]] of a ''[[loco moco]]'', Japanese style ''[[tonkatsu]]'' or the traditional l\u016b{{okina}}au favorites, including ''[[kalua|k\u0101lua]]'' pork and ''[[laulau]]''. ''[[Spam musubi]]'' is an example of the fusion of ethnic cuisine that developed on the islands among the mix of immigrant groups and military personnel. In the 1990s, a group of chefs developed [[Hawaii regional cuisine]] as a contemporary fusion cuisine.\n\n===Customs and etiquette===\n\n{{Main|Customs and etiquette in Hawaii}}\n\nSome key customs and etiquette in Hawaii are as follows: when visiting a home, it is considered good manners to bring a small gift for one's host (for example, a dessert). Thus, parties are usually in the form of potlucks. Most locals take their shoes off before entering a home. It is customary for Hawaiian families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child's first birthday. It is also customary at Hawaiian weddings, especially at Filipino weddings, for the bride and groom to do a money dance (also called the [[pandanggo]]). Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as \"locals of Hawaii\" or \"people of Hawaii\".\n\n===Hawaiian mythology===\n\n{{Main|Hawaiian mythology}}\n[[File:Ethnologisches Museum Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 009.jpg|thumb|upright|A stone carving of a Hawaiian deity, housed at a German museum]]\n\nHawaiian mythology comprises the legends, historical tales, and sayings of the ancient Hawaiian people. It is considered a variant of a more general [[Polynesian mythology]] that developed a unique character for several centuries before ''circa'' 1800.

Many are close enough in terms of vocabulary and grammar to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. There are also substantial cultural similarities between the various groups, especially in terms of social organization, childrearing, horticulture, building and textile technologies. Their mythologies in particular demonstrate local reworkings of commonly shared tales.
