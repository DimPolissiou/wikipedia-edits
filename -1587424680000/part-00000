The term ''Massaco'' (pronounced Mas-saco) may refer to the indigenous peoples, the river itself, the village occupied by the indigenous peoples, and the land adjacent to the river.<ref name=\"Massaco area\" />\n\nIn 1633, [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] was the second town in Connecticut settled by Europeans and the first English settlement (the first European settlement being [[Fort Hoop|Huys de Goede Hoop]], established by the Dutch in the Hartford area as a frontier settlement for the [[New Netherland]] Colony ten years earlier). For some time, the area of Massaco was considered \"an appendix to the towne of Windsor.{{sfn|Connecticut 1852| p=97}}\" Settlers in Windsor forested and farmed in the area, but did not come to Massaco permanently for a number of years. In 1642, the General Court [of the colony of Connecticut] ordered that:{{sfn|Connecticut 1850| p=71}}\n<blockquote>\nthe Governor and Mr. Heynes shall have liberty to dispose of the ground uppon that parte of Tunxis River cauled Mossocowe, to such inhabitants of Wyndsor as they shall see cause.\n</blockquote> Despite this order, there is no record that any settlements ensued immediately. Five years later the General Court issued another order:{{sfn|Connecticut 1850| p=161}}\n<blockquote>\nThe Court thinks fitt that Massacoe be purchased by the Country, and that ther be a Committee chosen to dispose of yt to such inhabitants of Wyndsor as by the shalbe judged meet to make improuement therof...\n</blockquote>\nbut there is no record of grants of land arising from this order.{{sfn|Phelps| p=10}}\n\nIn 1643, John Griffin and Michael Humphrey started a [[tar]] and [[turpentine]] business in Windsor. A few years later, a Massaco Indian named Manahanoose started a fire which destroyed tar belonging to Griffin. The Court ordered the payment of \"five hundred fathom of [[wampum]]\" as compensation. Instead of cash payment, Manahanoose delivered a deed to the land at Massacoe. The deed was agreed to by Manahanoose as well as other Indians, identified as \"the proprietors of Massaco\".{{sfn|Trumbull| p=342}} In 1653, the General Court granted {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of meadowland to Lieutenant Aaron Cook, {{convert|60|acre|m2}} to John Bissell and {{convert|50|acre|m2}} to Thomas Ford, all in Massacoe.{{sfn|Connecticut 1850| p=247}}\n\nSettlers did not build permanent settlements until the following decade. Aaron Cook built one of the early homes in the area now known as [[Terry's Plain Historic District|Terry's Plain]], and John Griffin built a home, possibly in 1664, the date associated with a deed to land in Massacoe.{{sfn|Phelps| p=12}} The settlement of Massacoe continued in the late 1660s. The General Court awarded a land grant to John Griffin of two hundred acres in 1663. In 1664, a deed description indicated he had become a permanent inhabitant. By 1669, a survey revealed that there were thirteen permanent residents of Massacoe. One of those residents, John Case, was appointed to the position of constable.{{sfn|Connecticut 1852| p=118}} This is the first recorded civil office held by residents of the area.{{sfn|Trumbull| p=342}}\n\n===Incorporation===\nIn 1670, Case, along with Joshua Holcomb & Thomas Barber, presented a petition to the General Court, requesting that Massacoe become a town of the colony of Connecticut.{{sfn|Trumbull| p=343}} On May 12, 1670, the General Court granted the petition, and ordered that the plantation should be called \"Simmsbury\". The boundaries at that time were [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] on the south and [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] on the east, with the extent of Simsbury running {{convert|10|mi|0}} north of Farmington and 10 miles west of Windsor, although the northern border, subject to dispute with [[Massachusetts]], would be resolved later.{{sfn|Connecticut 1852| p=127}} This extent covers what is present-day Simsbury as well as [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] and [[Canton, Connecticut|Canton]].\n\nThe precise origin of the name of the town is not known for certain. The town records covering the first ten years after incorporation were accidentally burned in 1680 and 1681. One possibility is that the name of Simsbury comes from the English town of [[Symondsbury]].<ref name=\"Fry\" /> Holcomb, one of the petitioners, originally came from Symondsbury. Another possibility is that the name was derived from Simon Wolcott. He was known familiarly as \"Sim\", and he was considered one of the prominent men of the town.{{sfn|Trumbull| p=343}}\n\n===King Philip's War===\nIn 1675, rumors of unrest among the indigenous peoples began to surface. The rumors proved accurate, and in the summer, [[King Philip's War]] began, a war between a number of tribes and the English settlers. The war extended through parts of four colonies, with Simsbury on the western edge of the conflict. At the time, it was seen as a [[frontier settlement]].{{sfn|Phelps| p=21}} The conflict was largely over by August 1676, although it did not formally end until a treaty was signed in 1678.\n\nThe colony formed a Council of War. In the days leading up to the war, they ordered settlers to keep night watches, and to work in the fields in armed groups of at least six.{{sfn|Phelps| p=20}} By the time of the colony's General Court meeting of October 14, 1675, the situation was considered serious enough that the court ordered the residents of Simsbury to move to safety in Windsor. The order read:\n\n{{quote|text=This Court orders, that the people of Simsbury shall have a week's time to secure themselves and their corn there, and at the end of the week from this date, the souldiers, now in garrison at Simsbury, shall be released their attendance there.|sign=Colony of Connecticut General Court{{sfn|Connecticut 1852| p=269}}}}\nIn March 1676, the town of Simsbury was first pillaged, then burned to the ground. This destruction is described as the most extensive of any event of any Indian War in New England.{{sfn|Phelps| p=24}} The settlers remained in Windsor until the spring of 1677, at which time most moved back to Simsbury, although some never returned.{{sfn|Phelps| p=25}}\n\n=== Daniel Hayes ===\nIn 1707, Daniel Hayes, then aged twenty-two, was captured by the indigenous people and carried off to [[New France|Canada]]. The capture was witnessed, and a rescue party raised, but the group did not catch up with the captors. He was tied up each night, and bound to saplings. It took thirty days to reach Canada, where Hayes was forced to [[gauntlet (punishment)|run the gauntlet]]. Near the end of the gauntlet, he hid in a [[wigwam]] to avoid an attempted blow by a club. The woman in the wigwam declared that the house was sacred, and having lost a husband and son to a war, adopted Hayes as her son. He remained for several years, attending to the woman. Eventually, he was sold to a Frenchman, who learned that Hayes had skill as a weaver, so put him to work in that business. Hayes managed to earn enough to buy his freedom after two years. He then returned to Simsbury, settled down on a farm and married. He became prominent, both in civil affairs as well as the church at Salmon Brook (now Granby).{{sfn|Phelps| p=37\u201344}}\n\n===From 1750 to 1865===\n[[File:PostcardMainStSimsburyCT1921.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Main Street in 1921]]\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\n{{clear}}\n\nTuesday, December 20, 1859 was a sad day in the town's history.

The population was 23,511 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name=\"Census 2010\" /> The town was incorporated as Connecticut's 21st town in May 1670.\n\nSimsbury was named the fourth best town in Connecticut on ''Connecticut Magazine''{{'}}s list of top places to live 2013 and 9th best town to live in 2015 in the United States by ''Time'' magazine.<ref name=\"time\" /> In 2016 Simsbury High School ranked 4th best high school in CT by Niche<ref name=\"niche\" /> and 9th by ''U.S. News & World Report''.<ref name=\"usnews\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n{{further|Massaco}}\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, the area today known as Simsbury was inhabited by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]. The [[Wappinger]] were one of these groups, composed of eighteen bands, organized not as formally as a tribe, but more of an association, like the [[Lenape|Delaware]]. These bands lived between the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]] rivers. The Wappingers were one of the [[Algonquian peoples]], a linguistic grouping which includes hundreds of tribes.{{sfn|Trelease| p=4\u20139}} One of the Wappinger bands, the [[Massaco]], lived near, but mostly west of what is now called the [[Farmington River]], the area now known as Simsbury and [[Canton, Connecticut|Canton]].<ref name=\"Massaco\" /> The river was called the Massaco by the native inhabitants. The term ''Massaco'' (pronounced Mas-saco) may refer to the indigenous peoples, the river itself, the village occupied by the indigenous peoples, and the land adjacent to the river.<ref name=\"Massaco area\" />\n\nIn 1633, [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] was the second town in Connecticut settled by Europeans and the first English settlement (the first European settlement being [[Fort Hoop|Huys de Goede Hoop]], established by the Dutch in the Hartford area as a frontier settlement for the [[New Netherland]] Colony ten years earlier). For some time, the area of Massaco was considered \"an appendix to the towne of Windsor.{{sfn|Connecticut 1852| p=97}}\" Settlers in Windsor forested and farmed in the area, but did not come to Massaco permanently for a number of years. In 1642, the General Court [of the colony of Connecticut] ordered that:{{sfn|Connecticut 1850| p=71}}\n<blockquote>\nthe Governor and Mr. Heynes shall have liberty to dispose of the ground uppon that parte of Tunxis River cauled Mossocowe, to such inhabitants of Wyndsor as they shall see cause.\n</blockquote> Despite this order, there is no record that any settlements ensued immediately. Five years later the General Court issued another order:{{sfn|Connecticut 1850| p=161}}\n<blockquote>\nThe Court thinks fitt that Massacoe be purchased by the Country, and that ther be a Committee chosen to dispose of yt to such inhabitants of Wyndsor as by the shalbe judged meet to make improuement therof...\n</blockquote>\nbut there is no record of grants of land arising from this order.{{sfn|Phelps| p=10}}\n\nIn 1643, John Griffin and Michael Humphrey started a [[tar]] and [[turpentine]] business in Windsor. A few years later, a Massaco Indian named Manahanoose started a fire which destroyed tar belonging to Griffin. The Court ordered the payment of \"five hundred fathom of [[wampum]]\" as compensation. Instead of cash payment, Manahanoose delivered a deed to the land at Massacoe. The deed was agreed to by Manahanoose as well as other Indians, identified as \"the proprietors of Massaco\".{{sfn|Trumbull| p=342}} In 1653, the General Court granted {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of meadowland to Lieutenant Aaron Cook, {{convert|60|acre|m2}} to John Bissell and {{convert|50|acre|m2}} to Thomas Ford, all in Massacoe.{{sfn|Connecticut 1850| p=247}}\n\nSettlers did not build permanent settlements until the following decade. Aaron Cook built one of the early homes in the area now known as [[Terry's Plain Historic District|Terry's Plain]], and John Griffin built a home, possibly in 1664, the date associated with a deed to land in Massacoe.{{sfn|Phelps| p=12}} The settlement of Massacoe continued in the late 1660s. The General Court awarded a land grant to John Griffin of two hundred acres in 1663. In 1664, a deed description indicated he had become a permanent inhabitant. By 1669, a survey revealed that there were thirteen permanent residents of Massacoe. One of those residents, John Case, was appointed to the position of constable.{{sfn|Connecticut 1852| p=118}} This is the first recorded civil office held by residents of the area.{{sfn|Trumbull| p=342}}\n\n===Incorporation===\nIn 1670, Case, along with Joshua Holcomb & Thomas Barber, presented a petition to the General Court, requesting that Massacoe become a town of the colony of Connecticut.{{sfn|Trumbull| p=343}} On May 12, 1670, the General Court granted the petition, and ordered that the plantation should be called \"Simmsbury\". The boundaries at that time were [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] on the south and [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] on the east, with the extent of Simsbury running {{convert|10|mi|0}} north of Farmington and 10 miles west of Windsor, although the northern border, subject to dispute with [[Massachusetts]], would be resolved later.{{sfn|Connecticut 1852| p=127}} This extent covers what is present-day Simsbury as well as [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] and [[Canton, Connecticut|Canton]].\n\nThe precise origin of the name of the town is not known for certain. The town records covering the first ten years after incorporation were accidentally burned in 1680 and 1681. One possibility is that the name of Simsbury comes from the English town of [[Symondsbury]].<ref name=\"Fry\" /> Holcomb, one of the petitioners, originally came from Symondsbury. Another possibility is that the name was derived from Simon Wolcott. He was known familiarly as \"Sim\", and he was considered one of the prominent men of the town.{{sfn|Trumbull| p=343}}\n\n===King Philip's War===\nIn 1675, rumors of unrest among the indigenous peoples began to surface. The rumors proved accurate, and in the summer, [[King Philip's War]] began, a war between a number of tribes and the English settlers. The war extended through parts of four colonies, with Simsbury on the western edge of the conflict. At the time, it was seen as a [[frontier settlement]].{{sfn|Phelps| p=21}} The conflict was largely over by August 1676, although it did not formally end until a treaty was signed in 1678.\n\nThe colony formed a Council of War. In the days leading up to the war, they ordered settlers to keep night watches, and to work in the fields in armed groups of at least six.{{sfn|Phelps| p=20}} By the time of the colony's General Court meeting of October 14, 1675, the situation was considered serious enough that the court ordered the residents of Simsbury to move to safety in Windsor. The order read:\n\n{{quote|text=This Court orders, that the people of Simsbury shall have a week's time to secure themselves and their corn there, and at the end of the week from this date, the souldiers, now in garrison at Simsbury, shall be released their attendance there.|sign=Colony of Connecticut General Court{{sfn|Connecticut 1852| p=269}}}}\nIn March 1676, the town of Simsbury was first pillaged, then burned to the ground. This destruction is described as the most extensive of any event of any Indian War in New England.{{sfn|Phelps| p=24}} The settlers remained in Windsor until the spring of 1677, at which time most moved back to Simsbury, although some never returned.{{sfn|Phelps| p=25}}\n\n=== Daniel Hayes ===\nIn 1707, Daniel Hayes, then aged twenty-two, was captured by the indigenous people and carried off to [[New France|Canada]]. The capture was witnessed, and a rescue party raised, but the group did not catch up with the captors. He was tied up each night, and bound to saplings. It took thirty days to reach Canada, where Hayes was forced to [[gauntlet (punishment)|run the gauntlet]]. Near the end of the gauntlet, he hid in a [[wigwam]] to avoid an attempted blow by a club. The woman in the wigwam declared that the house was sacred, and having lost a husband and son to a war, adopted Hayes as her son. He remained for several years, attending to the woman. Eventually, he was sold to a Frenchman, who learned that Hayes had skill as a weaver, so put him to work in that business. Hayes managed to earn enough to buy his freedom after two years. He then returned to Simsbury, settled down on a farm and married. He became prominent, both in civil affairs as well as the church at Salmon Brook (now Granby).{{sfn|Phelps| p=37\u201344}}\n\n===From 1750 to 1865===\n[[File:PostcardMainStSimsburyCT1921.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Main Street in 1921]]\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\n{{clear}}\n\nTuesday, December 20, 1859 was a sad day in the town's history.

Travel over land was difficult and expensive, so settlements were made along the coast, especially where rivers allowed small boats to travel inland.  Distant settlements were linked by elaborate sea-based trading networks. Since the easiest and cheapest way of long-distance travel was by sea, international trading networks emerged in the Atlantic world, with major hubs at [[London]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Boston]], and [[Havana]]. Time was a factor, as sailing ships averaged about 2 knots speed (50 miles a day). Navigators had to rely on maps of currents or they would be becalmed for days or weeks.<ref>Peggy K.

Awareness of the Atlantic World, of course, spiked post-1492: after the earliest European voyages to [[New World|the New World]] and continuing encounters on the African coast, a Euro-centric division of the Atlantic was proclaimed between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]] by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494.

Some critics see this North Atlantic emphasis as a return to British Imperial history that underplays the importance of African history, the slave trade, and their influential roles in Brazil and the multi-national Caribbean. Atlantic world history differs from traditional approaches to the history of colonization in its emphasis on inter-regional and international comparisons and its attention to events and trends that transcended national borders.  Atlantic World history emphasizes how the colonization of the Americas reshaped Africa and Europe, provided a foundation for later globalization, and insists that our understanding of the past benefits from looking beyond the nation state as our primary (or sole) category of analysis.\n\n==Aspects==\n===Environment===\n\nThe beginning of extensive contact between Europe, Africa, and the Americas had sweeping implications for the environmental and demographic history of all the regions involved.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2010 |title= The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas |journal= [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 163\u2013188 |jstor=25703506 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.163|citeseerx= 10.1.1.232.9242 }}</ref>  In the process known as the [[Columbian Exchange]], numerous plants, animals, and diseases were transplanted\u2014both deliberately and inadvertently\u2014from one continent to another. The epidemiological impact of this exchange on the indigenous peoples of the Americas was profound, causing very high death rates and population declines of 50% to 90% or even 100%. European and African immigrants also had very high death rates on their arrival, but they could be and were replaced by new shipments of immigrants (see the [[Population history of American indigenous peoples]]). Many foods that are common in present-day Europe, including corn (maize) and [[potato]]es, originated in the New World and were unknown in Europe before the sixteenth century.  Similarly, some staple crops of present-day West Africa, including [[cassava]] and [[peanut]]s, originated in the New World.  Some of the staple crops of Latin America, such as [[coffee]] and [[sugarcane]], were introduced by European settlers in the course of the [[Columbian Exchange]].<ref>Timothy Silver, ''A New Face on the Countryside: Indians, Colonists, and Slaves in South Atlantic Forests, 1500-1800'' (Studies in Environment and History) (1990)</ref>\n\n===Slavery and labor===\n[[File:1670 virginia tobacco slaves.jpg|thumb|Slaves working at a [[slave plantation|plantation]] in [[Virginia]], depicted in 1670 ]]\n{{main|Atlantic slave trade}}\nThe slave trade played a role in the history of the Atlantic world almost from the beginning.<ref>Hugh Thomas, ''The slave trade: The History of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440-1870'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/slave-trade-history-Atlantic-1440-1870/dp/0753820560/ \u00a0excerpt and text search]</ref>  As European powers began to conquer and claim large territories in the Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the role of [[chattel slavery]] and other forced labor systems in the development of the Atlantic world expanded.  European powers typically had vast territories that they wished to exploit through agriculture, mining, or other extractive industries, but they lacked the work force that they needed to exploit their lands effectively.  Consequently, they turned to a variety of coercive labor systems to meet their needs. At first the goal was to use native workers. Native Americans were employed through [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slavery]] and through the Spanish system of [[encomienda]]. Indian labor was not effective on a large scale for complex reasons (e.g., high death rates and relative ease of escape to Native communities), so plantation owners turned to African slaves via the [[Atlantic slave trade]].  European workers arrived as [[indentured servant]]s or [[penal labour|transported felons]] who went free after a term of labor.<ref>{{cite book|first =Kenneth|last= Morgan|title =Slavery, Atlantic Trade and the British Economy, 1660-1800|date = 2000|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 9780521588140|url = https://archive.org/details/slaveryatlantict00kenn_0|url-access =registration}}</ref> In short, the Atlantic World was one of widespread inequality where the exploitation of human labor provided the foundation for a small handful of elites to reap enormous profits.\n\nThe Trans-Atlantic Slave trade played a massive role in shaping the demographics of the Americas, especially in areas where huge plantations were the norm, such as in Brazil and the Caribbean. Roughly three quarters of immigrants to the Americas before 1820 were African, and more than half of these Africans were originally from West or Central Africa. In Brazil, the population percentage of Africans was even higher, with about seven African to every one Portuguese immigrant.<ref name = sweetnd>Sweet, James. \"The Evolution of Ritual in the African Diaspora.\" (n.d.): 64-80. Web.</ref> Because there was such a large population of Africans, it is unsurprising that African slaves aided in shaping the culture of these regions. In the early colonial period, there was a high prevalence of African spiritual practices, such as spirit possessions and healing practices. Presumably, these practices served as a point of connection and as an identity hold for slaves hailing from the same African origin.<ref name = sweet2009>Sweet, James H. \"Mutual Misunderstandings: Gester, Gender, and Healing in the African Portuguese World.\" Past and Present 4th ser. (2009): 128-43. Web.</ref> Such cultural practices allowed, at least to an extent, African slaves to maintain kinship structures similar to those that they might have seen in their homeland. In many cases, European authorities viewed spiritual positions that were highly esteemed in African societies to be socially unacceptable, morally corrupt, and heretical. This led to the disappearance or transformation of most African religious practices. For example, the practice of consulting kilundu, or Angolan spirits, was seen as homosexual by Portuguese authorities,<ref name = sweet2009/> a clear example of Eurocentrism in colonial societies, as European ideas of religion often did not match African ones. Unfortunately, there is a lack of documents written from the African point of view, so almost all information from this time period in these colonial societies is subject to cross-cultural misinterpretation, omission of facts, or other such changes that could affect the quality of description of African spiritual practices. Maintaining the integrity of cultural practices was difficult due to disagreement with European propriety and European tendency to generalize the African demographic makeup to merely \u201cCentral African,\u201d rather than acknowledging individual cultures. Eventually, most African traditions such as Kilundu, which was ultimately reduced to the popular Brazilian dance \u201cLundu,\u201d were either absorbed into other African traditions or reduced to a ritual simply resembling the original tradition.<ref name = sweetnd/>\n\nThe extent of voluntary [[immigration]] to the Atlantic world varied considerably by region, nationality, and time period.  Many European nations, particularly the Netherlands and France, only managed to send a few thousand voluntary immigrants. Though 15,000 or so who came to New France multiplied rapidly. In [[New Netherland]], the Dutch coped by recruiting immigrants of other nationalities.<ref>Jaap Jacobs, ''New Netherland: A Dutch Colony in Seventeenth-Century America'' (The Atlantic World) (2004)</ref>  In [[New England]], the massive [[Puritan]] migration of the first half of the seventeenth century created a large free workforce and thus obviated the need to use unfree labor on a large scale.  Colonial New England's reliance on the labor of free men, women, and children, organized in individual farm households, is called the yeoman or household labor system.<ref>Francis J. Bremer, ''First Founders: American Puritans and Puritanism in an Atlantic World'' (2012)</ref> There is an important distinction to be made between \"societies with slaves,\" such as colonial New England, and \"slave societies,\" where slavery was so central that it can properly be said to define all aspects of life in that region.<ref>Ira Berlin, \"Generations of Captivity: A History of African American Slaves\" (2003)</ref>\n\nThe French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] was one of the first American jurisdictions to end slavery, in 1794.  Brazil was last nation in the Western Hemisphere to end slavery, in 1888.\n\n===Governance===\n{{see also|Piracy in the Atlantic World}}\nThe Spanish [[conquistador]]es conquered the [[Aztec Empire]], more accurately now referred to by scholars as the Mexica empire{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}, in present-day [[History of Mexico|Mexico]], and the [[Inca Empire]], in present-day Peru, with surprising speed, assisted by horses, guns, large numbers of Native allies, and, perhaps above all, by the devastating mortality inflicted by newly introduced diseases such as [[smallpox]].  To some extent the prior emergence of the large and wealthy Inca and Mexica civilizations aided the transfer of governance to the Spanish, since these native empires had already established road systems, state bureaucracies and systems of taxation and intensive agriculture that were often inherited wholesale and then modified by the Spanish. The early Spanish conquerors of these empires were also aided by political instability and internal conflict within the Mexica and Incan regimes, which they successfully exploited to their benefit.<ref>John Huxtable Elliott, ''Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830'' (2007)</ref>\n\nOne of the problems that most European governments faced in the Americas was how to exercise authority over vast expanses of territory.<ref>Jacob Cooke, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the North American Colonies'' (1993) vol 1</ref>  Spain, which colonized Mexico, Central America, and the greater part of South America, established a network of powerful viceroyalties to administer different regions of its New World holdings: the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (1535), the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (1542), the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (1717/1739), and the [[Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata]] (1776).

Most of the North American [[Thirteen Colonies]] that became the United States had strong self-government via popular assemblies that countered the authority of governors with their own assertions of rights via parliamentary and other English sources of authority.  Only property owners could vote in British polities, but since so many free men in mainland British Colonial America owned land, a majority could vote and participate in popular politics.  The British challenge to the authority of colonial assemblies, especially via taxation, was a major cause of the American Revolution in the 1770s.<ref>Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds..

Some critics see this North Atlantic emphasis as a return to British Imperial history that underplays the importance of African history, the slave trade, and their influential roles in Brazil and the multi-national Caribbean. Atlantic world history differs from traditional approaches to the history of colonization in its emphasis on inter-regional and international comparisons and its attention to events and trends that transcended national borders.  Atlantic World history emphasizes how the colonization of the Americas reshaped Africa and Europe, provided a foundation for later globalization, and insists that our understanding of the past benefits from looking beyond the nation state as our primary (or sole) category of analysis.\n\n==Aspects==\n===Environment===\n\nThe beginning of extensive contact between Europe, Africa, and the Americas had sweeping implications for the environmental and demographic history of all the regions involved.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2010 |title= The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas |journal= [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 163\u2013188 |jstor=25703506 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.163|citeseerx= 10.1.1.232.9242 }}</ref>  In the process known as the [[Columbian Exchange]], numerous plants, animals, and diseases were transplanted\u2014both deliberately and inadvertently\u2014from one continent to another.

European and African immigrants also had very high death rates on their arrival, but they could be and were replaced by new shipments of immigrants (see the [[Population history of American indigenous peoples]]). Many foods that are common in present-day Europe, including corn (maize) and [[potato]]es, originated in the New World and were unknown in Europe before the sixteenth century.  Similarly, some staple crops of present-day West Africa, including [[cassava]] and [[peanut]]s, originated in the New World.  Some of the staple crops of Latin America, such as [[coffee]] and [[sugarcane]], were introduced by European settlers in the course of the [[Columbian Exchange]].<ref>Timothy Silver, ''A New Face on the Countryside: Indians, Colonists, and Slaves in South Atlantic Forests, 1500-1800'' (Studies in Environment and History) (1990)</ref>\n\n===Slavery and labor===\n[[File:1670 virginia tobacco slaves.jpg|thumb|Slaves working at a [[slave plantation|plantation]] in [[Virginia]], depicted in 1670 ]]\n{{main|Atlantic slave trade}}\nThe slave trade played a role in the history of the Atlantic world almost from the beginning.<ref>Hugh Thomas, ''The slave trade: The History of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440-1870'' (2006) [https://www.amazon.com/slave-trade-history-Atlantic-1440-1870/dp/0753820560/ \u00a0excerpt and text search]</ref>  As European powers began to conquer and claim large territories in the Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the role of [[chattel slavery]] and other forced labor systems in the development of the Atlantic world expanded.  European powers typically had vast territories that they wished to exploit through agriculture, mining, or other extractive industries, but they lacked the work force that they needed to exploit their lands effectively.  Consequently, they turned to a variety of coercive labor systems to meet their needs. At first the goal was to use native workers. Native Americans were employed through [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|Indian slavery]] and through the Spanish system of [[encomienda]]. Indian labor was not effective on a large scale for complex reasons (e.g., high death rates and relative ease of escape to Native communities), so plantation owners turned to African slaves via the [[Atlantic slave trade]].  European workers arrived as [[indentured servant]]s or [[penal labour|transported felons]] who went free after a term of labor.<ref>{{cite book|first =Kenneth|last= Morgan|title =Slavery, Atlantic Trade and the British Economy, 1660-1800|date = 2000|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 9780521588140|url = https://archive.org/details/slaveryatlantict00kenn_0|url-access =registration}}</ref> In short, the Atlantic World was one of widespread inequality where the exploitation of human labor provided the foundation for a small handful of elites to reap enormous profits.\n\nThe Trans-Atlantic Slave trade played a massive role in shaping the demographics of the Americas, especially in areas where huge plantations were the norm, such as in Brazil and the Caribbean. Roughly three quarters of immigrants to the Americas before 1820 were African, and more than half of these Africans were originally from West or Central Africa. In Brazil, the population percentage of Africans was even higher, with about seven African to every one Portuguese immigrant.<ref name = sweetnd>Sweet, James. \"The Evolution of Ritual in the African Diaspora.\" (n.d.): 64-80. Web.</ref> Because there was such a large population of Africans, it is unsurprising that African slaves aided in shaping the culture of these regions. In the early colonial period, there was a high prevalence of African spiritual practices, such as spirit possessions and healing practices. Presumably, these practices served as a point of connection and as an identity hold for slaves hailing from the same African origin.<ref name = sweet2009>Sweet, James H. \"Mutual Misunderstandings: Gester, Gender, and Healing in the African Portuguese World.\" Past and Present 4th ser. (2009): 128-43. Web.</ref> Such cultural practices allowed, at least to an extent, African slaves to maintain kinship structures similar to those that they might have seen in their homeland. In many cases, European authorities viewed spiritual positions that were highly esteemed in African societies to be socially unacceptable, morally corrupt, and heretical. This led to the disappearance or transformation of most African religious practices. For example, the practice of consulting kilundu, or Angolan spirits, was seen as homosexual by Portuguese authorities,<ref name = sweet2009/> a clear example of Eurocentrism in colonial societies, as European ideas of religion often did not match African ones. Unfortunately, there is a lack of documents written from the African point of view, so almost all information from this time period in these colonial societies is subject to cross-cultural misinterpretation, omission of facts, or other such changes that could affect the quality of description of African spiritual practices. Maintaining the integrity of cultural practices was difficult due to disagreement with European propriety and European tendency to generalize the African demographic makeup to merely \u201cCentral African,\u201d rather than acknowledging individual cultures. Eventually, most African traditions such as Kilundu, which was ultimately reduced to the popular Brazilian dance \u201cLundu,\u201d were either absorbed into other African traditions or reduced to a ritual simply resembling the original tradition.<ref name = sweetnd/>\n\nThe extent of voluntary [[immigration]] to the Atlantic world varied considerably by region, nationality, and time period.  Many European nations, particularly the Netherlands and France, only managed to send a few thousand voluntary immigrants. Though 15,000 or so who came to New France multiplied rapidly. In [[New Netherland]], the Dutch coped by recruiting immigrants of other nationalities.<ref>Jaap Jacobs, ''New Netherland: A Dutch Colony in Seventeenth-Century America'' (The Atlantic World) (2004)</ref>  In [[New England]], the massive [[Puritan]] migration of the first half of the seventeenth century created a large free workforce and thus obviated the need to use unfree labor on a large scale.  Colonial New England's reliance on the labor of free men, women, and children, organized in individual farm households, is called the yeoman or household labor system.<ref>Francis J. Bremer, ''First Founders: American Puritans and Puritanism in an Atlantic World'' (2012)</ref> There is an important distinction to be made between \"societies with slaves,\" such as colonial New England, and \"slave societies,\" where slavery was so central that it can properly be said to define all aspects of life in that region.<ref>Ira Berlin, \"Generations of Captivity: A History of African American Slaves\" (2003)</ref>\n\nThe French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] was one of the first American jurisdictions to end slavery, in 1794.  Brazil was last nation in the Western Hemisphere to end slavery, in 1888.\n\n===Governance===\n{{see also|Piracy in the Atlantic World}}\nThe Spanish [[conquistador]]es conquered the [[Aztec Empire]], more accurately now referred to by scholars as the Mexica empire{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}, in present-day [[History of Mexico|Mexico]], and the [[Inca Empire]], in present-day Peru, with surprising speed, assisted by horses, guns, large numbers of Native allies, and, perhaps above all, by the devastating mortality inflicted by newly introduced diseases such as [[smallpox]].  To some extent the prior emergence of the large and wealthy Inca and Mexica civilizations aided the transfer of governance to the Spanish, since these native empires had already established road systems, state bureaucracies and systems of taxation and intensive agriculture that were often inherited wholesale and then modified by the Spanish. The early Spanish conquerors of these empires were also aided by political instability and internal conflict within the Mexica and Incan regimes, which they successfully exploited to their benefit.<ref>John Huxtable Elliott, ''Empires of the Atlantic World: Britain and Spain in America 1492-1830'' (2007)</ref>\n\nOne of the problems that most European governments faced in the Americas was how to exercise authority over vast expanses of territory.<ref>Jacob Cooke, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the North American Colonies'' (1993) vol 1</ref>  Spain, which colonized Mexico, Central America, and the greater part of South America, established a network of powerful viceroyalties to administer different regions of its New World holdings: the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (1535), the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (1542), the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (1717/1739), and the [[Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata]] (1776).

Most of the North American [[Thirteen Colonies]] that became the United States had strong self-government via popular assemblies that countered the authority of governors with their own assertions of rights via parliamentary and other English sources of authority.  Only property owners could vote in British polities, but since so many free men in mainland British Colonial America owned land, a majority could vote and participate in popular politics.

The expulsion, preceded by the [[1940\u201344 insurgency in Chechnya]], was ordered by [[NKVD]] chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]] after approval by [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Joseph Stalin]], as a part of a [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|Soviet forced settlement program]] and [[population transfer in the Soviet Union|population transfer]] that affected several million members of non-Russian Soviet ethnic minorities between the 1930s and the 1950s.\n\nThe deportation was prepared from at least October 1943 and 19,000 officers as well as 100,000 [[NKVD]] soldiers from all over the USSR participated in this operation. The deportation encompassed their entire nations, as well as the liquidation of the [[Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. The demographic consequences of this eviction were catastrophic and far reaching: of the (according to Soviet archives; Chechen sources put the deportees at 650,000<ref name=kazbek>{{cite news |last1=Chanturiya |first1=Kazbek |title=After 73 years, the memory of Stalin\u2019s deportation of Chechens and Ingush still haunts the survivors |url=https://oc-media.org/features/after-73-years-the-memory-of-stalins-deportation-of-chechens-and-ingush-still-haunts-the-survivors/ |accessdate=27 November 2019 |agency=OC Media |date=23 February 2017}}</ref>) 496,000 Chechens and Ingush who were deported, at least a quarter perished. In total, the archive records show that over a hundred thousand people died or were killed during the round-ups and transportation, and during their early years in exile in the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz SSR]] as well as [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] where they were sent to the many [[labor camps]] in the [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|forced settlements]]. Chechen sources claim that 400,000 perished presuming a higher number of deportees.<ref name=kazbek/> Chechens suffered a higher proportional loss of life than any other ethnic group persecuted by [[population transfer in the Soviet Union]].{{Sfn|Ther|2014|p=118}} Chechens were under administrative supervision of the NKVD officials during that entire time.\n\nThe exile lasted for 13 years and the survivors would not return to their native lands until 1957, after the new Soviet authorities under [[Nikita Khrushchev]] reversed many of Stalin's policies, including the deportations of nations. A local report indicated that some 432,000 Vainakhs had resettled to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR by 1961, though they faced many obstacles while trying to settle back to the Caucasus, including unemployment, lack of accommodation and ethnic clashes with the local Russian population. Eventually, the Chechens and Ingush recovered and regained the majority of the population. This eviction left a permanent scar in the memory of the survivors and their descendants. February 23 is today remembered as a day of tragedy by most of Ingushs and Chechens. Many in Chechnya and Ingushetia classify it as an act of [[genocide]], as did the [[European Parliament]] in 2004.\n\n==Historical background==\n{{see|Chechen-Russian conflict|Russian irredentism|Caucasus War}}\n\nThe Chechens and the [[Ingush people|Ingush]] speak languages that are closely related and have a degree of passive intelligibility, both being [[Vainakh languages]].{{Sfn|Bugay|Gonov|2002|p=43}} The [[Chechen-Russian conflict]] is one of the [[List of longest wars|longest and most protracted conflicts]] in modern history, spanning three centuries.{{Sfn|Russell|2007|p=33}} Its origins date back to 1785,<ref name=\"Refworld\">{{cite web|title=Chronology for Chechens in Russia|publisher=Minorities at Risk|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38d12.html|author=Refworld|date=2004|accessdate=September 20, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921001401/http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38d12.html|archivedate=September 21, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> when the [[Chechens]] fought against Russian expansionism into the [[Caucasus]].

In May 1944, Beria issued a directive ordering the NKVD to browse the entire USSR in search for any remaining members of that nation, \"not leaving a single one\". As a result, an additional 4,146 Chechens and Ingush were found in [[Dagestan]], [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]], [[Krasnodar Krai]], [[Rostov Oblast|Rostov]] and [[Astrakhan Oblast]]. In April 1945, Beria was informed that 2,741 Chechens were deported from the Georgian SSR, 21 from the Azerbaijan SSR and 121 from Krasnodar Krai.

[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|In his secret speech]] on February 24, 1956, Khrushchev condemned these Stalinist deportations:\n{{quote|The Soviet Union is justly considered as a model of a [[multinational state]] because we have in practice assured the equality and friendship of all nations who live in our great fatherland.

The Russians, angered by issues over land ownership and job competition, [[1958 Grozny riots|rioted as early as 1958]].{{sfn|Tishkov|2004|p=33}} The 1958 riot was sparked by a fight between a Russian sailor and an Ingush youngster over a girl in which the Russian was fatally injured.

By 1989, the 750,000 Chechens already comprised a majority (55%) of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, while 300,000 Russians comprised 22% and 163,700 Ingush 12% of the population. Chechens started to gain control by the 1970s. Ultimately, the attempt to make Checheno-Ingushetia more multi-ethnic in order to discourage potential uprisings failed due to the higher birthrate of the Vainakhs.{{sfn|Bancheli|Bartmann|Srebrnik|2004|p=121}}\n\nA local report from 1961 indicated that out of 524,000 Vainakhs, 432,000 had resettled to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, 28,000 to Dagestan and 8,000 to North Ossetia.{{sfn|Tishkov|2004|p=34}} However, ethnic clashes continued even in the 1960s: in 1965 alone, 16 such clashes were recorded, resulting in 185 injuries and 19 fatalities.{{sfn|Seely|2001|p=87}} Chechens were greatly disadvantaged after being allowed to return. There were no Chechen-language schools, leading to a lack of education of the populace (which did not universally understand [[Russian language|Russian]]).{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=81, 88}} According to sociologist Georgi Derluguyan, the Checheno-Ingush Republic's economy was divided into two spheres, in which the Russian sphere had all the jobs with higher salaries in the urban areas: no Chechen cadre was promoted to a top position all until 1989.{{Sfn|Derluguyan|2005|p=243}} In the 1960s, in order to finance their families, some forty thousand men temporarily migrated from Chechen-Ingushetia each year to find part-time jobs in Kazakhstan and Siberia, thanks to their contacts from the time of their exile.{{Sfn|Derluguyan|2005|p=245}} On paper, the Chechen-Ingush Republic enjoyed the same privileges as other Soviet ASSRs, but in reality it had very little actual Chechens or Ingush representing its government, which was run directly by the Russians.{{sfn|Seely|2001|p=87}} Despite being rich with oil, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR remained the second poorest region of the entire USSR. Yusup Soslambekov, a chairman of the Chechen parliament after 1991, lamented that his people returned from exile to their homes \"not as masters of that land but as mere inhabitants, tenants.

The deportation encompassed their entire nations, as well as the liquidation of the [[Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]].

In total, the archive records show that over a hundred thousand people died or were killed during the round-ups and transportation, and during their early years in exile in the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh]] and [[Kyrgyz SSR]] as well as [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] where they were sent to the many [[labor camps]] in the [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|forced settlements]].

A local report indicated that some 432,000 Vainakhs had resettled to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR by 1961, though they faced many obstacles while trying to settle back to the Caucasus, including unemployment, lack of accommodation and ethnic clashes with the local Russian population. Eventually, the Chechens and Ingush recovered and regained the majority of the population. This eviction left a permanent scar in the memory of the survivors and their descendants. February 23 is today remembered as a day of tragedy by most of Ingushs and Chechens.

The operation was called \"Chechevitsa\" (Operation Lentil),{{sfn|Wood|2007|p=36}} its first two syllables pointing at its intended targets. The operation is referred to by Chechens often as \"Aardakh\" (the Exodus). This operation was being prepared and planned since at least October 1943, and included Beria's two most trusted NKVD officers, [[Ivan Serov]] and [[Bogdan Kobulov]].{{Sfn|Werth|2008|p=412}} Beria complained to Stalin about the \"low level of labour discipline\" among Chechens, the \"prevalence of banditry and terrorism\", the \"failure of Chechens to join the communist party\" and the \"confession of a German agent that he found a lot of support among the local Ingush\".{{sfn|Fowkes|1998|p=10}} Beria then ordered to implement the operation. When Supian Kagirovich Mollaev, the leader of the local government in the Checheno-Ingush ASSR, heard about the decision, he burst into tears, but soon pulled himself together and decided to follow orders.{{sfn|Fowkes|1998|p=10}} The Chechen-Ingush Republic was never fully occupied by the Nazi army, but the repressions were officially justified by \"an armed resistance to Soviet power\".{{sfn|Burds|2007|p=16\u201326}} The charges of the Vainakh collaboration with the Nazis were never subsequently proven in any Soviet court.{{sfn|Dushnyck|1975|p=503}}\n\nDuring World War II, 3,332,589 individuals were encompassed by Stalin's policies of deportations and forced settlements.{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=107}} Some of the stated reasons were allegedly to \"defuse ethnic tensions\", to \"stabilize the political situation\" or to punish people for their \"act against the Soviet authority\".{{sfn|Dunlop|1998|p=61}} According to the 1939 census, 407,690 Chechens and 92,074 Ingush were registered in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kreindler|1986|p=387}} On October 13, 1943, Operation Lentil commenced when about a hundred thousand troops and operative workers were moved into Checheno-Ingushetia, supposedly for mending roads and bridges.

Chechens started to gain control by the 1970s. Ultimately, the attempt to make Checheno-Ingushetia more multi-ethnic in order to discourage potential uprisings failed due to the higher birthrate of the Vainakhs.{{sfn|Bancheli|Bartmann|Srebrnik|2004|p=121}}\n\nA local report from 1961 indicated that out of 524,000 Vainakhs, 432,000 had resettled to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, 28,000 to Dagestan and 8,000 to North Ossetia.{{sfn|Tishkov|2004|p=34}} However, ethnic clashes continued even in the 1960s: in 1965 alone, 16 such clashes were recorded, resulting in 185 injuries and 19 fatalities.{{sfn|Seely|2001|p=87}} Chechens were greatly disadvantaged after being allowed to return.

It was a larger school than most of the ones for that period of time as it had three teachers and students of all ages.  The rooms were heated with pot-bellied stoves, and the boy students had to cut the wood to keep the fires going.  Water was carried to the rooms in a bucket and the students had their own cup to pour the water into from the bucket. Hibriten Academy was consolidated with Kings Creek High at the end of the 1932 school term.<ref>Adapted from an article by Irene Beach Bentley in '''''The Heritage of Caldwell County''''' as found in John Hawkins' book '''The Most American Thing: A History of Education in Caldwell County, North Carolina'''</ref>\n\n=== Building and construction of Hibriten High School ===\nFollowing a survey of the schools of Caldwell County in 1963, the [[North Carolina Department of Public Instruction|State Department of Public Instruction]] recommended that three of the rural schools\u2014Oak Hill, King's Creek, and Happy Valley\u2014be consolidated.  It was also recommended that a new building be constructed on a new site for the consolidated high school.  Thirty-five acres of land, located in the Lower Creek section of the county, were purchased at a cost of $37,500.\n\nIn 1962, an architect was employed for a period of two years to complete plans for the building.  Designed in a plan similar to a split-level building, the school consists of three levels and contains departments in science, home economics, English, French, math, social studies, music, physical education, drama, child care center, and vocational studies which include technical drafting, business, introduction to vocations, agriculture, carpentry, graphics, electronics, bricklaying, and the work study programs of industrial cooperative training and distributive education.  The building also includes administrative offices for the principal, assistant principal, secretary, guidance suite, visual air room, two first-aid rooms, and a conference room.  The cafeteria seats 250 people.  \n\nLocated at the foot of the [[Hibriten Mountain]], the school was given the name of Hibriten High School.  Its mascot is a panther, and the school colors are red, black and white.  It is located two miles from the main thoroughfare of the city of Lenoir.  The school was officially opened in the fall of 1966 with Kenneth A. Roberts as principal and Ronald Beane as assistant principal.  Student enrollment for the 1966-67 school term was 715, with a faculty of 42.  The class of 1967 graduated 118 students.

The majority held that the person administering the discipline must be a parent or legal guardian, or in some cases, a school teacher (i.e. non-parental relatives such as grandparents, aunts, or uncles, as well as babysitters and other caretakers, are banned from spanking); that the force must be used \"by way of correction\" (sober, reasoned uses of force that address the actual behaviour of the child and are designed to restrain, control or express some symbolic disapproval of his or her behaviour), that the child must be capable of benefiting from the correction (i.e. not under the age of 2 or over 12), and that the use of force must be \"reasonable under the circumstances\", meaning that it results neither in harm nor in the prospect of bodily harm.

On 1 July 1998, corporal punishment was outlawed through a new law stating that \"Degrading educational measures, especially physical and psychological maltreatment, are inadmissible\"; however, the common interpretation of that law was that parents still had some right to use corporal punishment of their children.

The majority held that the person administering the discipline must be a parent or legal guardian, or in some cases, a school teacher (i.e. non-parental relatives such as grandparents, aunts, or uncles, as well as babysitters and other caretakers, are banned from spanking); that the force must be used \"by way of correction\" (sober, reasoned uses of force that address the actual behaviour of the child and are designed to restrain, control or express some symbolic disapproval of his or her behaviour), that the child must be capable of benefiting from the correction (i.e. not under the age of 2 or over 12), and that the use of force must be \"reasonable under the circumstances\", meaning that it results neither in harm nor in the prospect of bodily harm. Punishment involving slaps or blows to the head is harmful, the Court held.<ref>Canadian Press, [http://www.corpun.com/cad00401.htm#12678 \"Top court upholds spanking law\"], ''Toronto Star'', 31 January 2004.</ref> Use of any implement other than a bare hand is illegal and hitting a child in anger or in retaliation for something a child did is not considered reasonable and is against the law.

Social acceptance is generally high, through allowances made for \"moderate physical discipline\" (using this or similar language) in most states' laws regarding [[assault]], [[Battery (crime)|criminal battery]], [[domestic violence]] or [[child abuse]]. Whether an instance of corporal punishment exceeds these bounds is usually decided on a case-by-case basis in family court proceedings.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Corporal punishment in the home]]\n*[[School corporal punishment]]\n*[[Spanking]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Corporal punishments|Laws]]\n", "name_user": "John B123", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changed unsupported cite parameter deadurl to url-status", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_corporal_punishment_laws"}
