The game takes place on a remote, heavily forested peninsula where the [[player character]] Eric Leblanc and his son Timmy are survivors of a plane crash. The game features [[nonlinear gameplay]] in an [[open world]] environment played from a [[first-person (video games)|first-person perspective]], with no set missions or quests, empowering the player to make their own decisions for survival. Following a four-year long [[early access]] beta phase, the game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in April 2018, and for the [[PlayStation 4]] in November 2018.<!--Due to more than one date in the lead, there should be no exact dates here per WP:VG/DATE--> The game was also a commercial success, selling over five million copies by the end of 2018. A sequel, ''Sons of the Forest'', is under development.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn ''The Forest'', players control Eric LeBlanc and must survive on a forested peninsula in search of his son Timmy after a devastating plane crash. Players must survive by creating shelter, weapons, and other survival tools. Inhabiting the island, along with various woodland creatures, are a tribe of nocturnal, [[cannibalistic]] mutants, who dwell in villages on the surface and in deep caves beneath the peninsula. While they are not necessarily always hostile to the player, their usual behaviour is aggressive, especially during the night.<ref name=\"PCG interview\"/>\n\nHowever, the developers wanted players to question whether the island's cannibalistic tribe is the enemy of the player or vice versa.<ref name=\"PCG interview\">{{cite web |url= http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/the-forest/ |title= The Forest interview: survival, horror and the VR wilderness |date= 28 May 2013 |accessdate= 28 January 2014 |first= Phil |last= Savage |work= PC Gamer}}</ref> For example, when first encountering the player, the cannibals may hesitate to attack and instead observe the player from a distance, attempt to communicate with the player through effigies, and send patrols around the player's base camp. In combat, they regularly attempt to protect one another from injury, remove torches, surround the player, hide behind cover, drag wounded tribesmen to safety, keep their distance, use tactical decisions, not overextend into unknown territory, and occasionally surrender out of fear. They are also afraid of fire, and will sometimes refrain from approaching the player if there is a campfire or torch nearby. Though there are no set missions, there is an optional conclusion to the game.<ref name=\"detailed\">{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-01-07-ambitious-open-world-horror-game-the-forest-detailed  |title= Ambitious open-world horror game The Forest detailed |date= 13 January 2014 |accessdate= 27 January 2014 |first= Jeffrey |last= Matulef |work= [[Eurogamer]]}}</ref>\n\nAs the player progresses through the game and explores the caves underneath the forest surface, they will encounter increasingly bizarre mutations, including deformed babies and mutants with several extra appendages. The game also features a day and night cycle, with the player able to build a shelter and traps, hunt animals and collect supplies during the day, and defend themselves against the mutants by night.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nAs seen in the opening intro of the game, the player possesses a survival guide book that the playable character authors, which contains many useful tips and general information about wilderness survival. The survival guide is also crucial because it allows for the player to build [[blueprints]] for various different structures that can aid the player in their survival. The player can choose to build a specific structure and then select a specific place where to place that structure in the world. Once the blueprint is placed, the player then needs to gather the necessary resources, such as sticks, rocks, logs, etc. in order to complete the particular structure. The player can choose from various structures and buildings in the survival guide. These include basic survival shelters, wooden cabins, treehouses, tree platforms, as well as custom-designed structures, which the player can modify in terms of size, shape, and position. Most of the shelters and buildings that the player can build also feature an option for saving the game. In fact, this is the only available method for saving, as there is no [[autosave]] function in the game. The survival guidebook also provides information about the wildlife of the peninsula. Once the player comes across a previously unknown species of animal or plant, the player jots it down and it appears in the guidebook. The guidebook also contains a \"to-do list\", which lists general goals that the player should follow, such as building a shelter or exploring different caves. \n\nThe player also possesses an inventory, which can be accessed at almost any time in the game. Any item that the player gathers, or collects in the world is stored in the inventory, which has a realistic design and shows where each item is stored. Items that can be placed in the inventory include tools, weapons, animal meats, furs, and skins, herbs and flowers, a map, a compass, as well as other things. The inventory also includes a [[crafting]] system. Crafting in the game is based on the player's knowledge about combining different components into useful items and tools. For example, in order to craft a basic axe, the player needs to gather and combine a stick, a rock, as well as rope. Once the player gathers and places all the required items on the crafting space, a gear icon will become visible, indicating that the player is able to construct a particular tool/weapon. In the inventory, the player can also choose to place two desired items/weapons for quick select by assigning them to the [[D-pad]] on a PS4 controller or to specific keys on PC.\n\nThe player also has a [[Heads-up display|HUD]] display on the bottom right of their screen. The HUD displays the player's total health, energy, stamina, hunger, and thirst levels. The amount of stamina available is directly related to the energy amount of the player. Hunger is measured via an icon depicting a human stomach, while the thirst icon depicts a water droplet. Water can be obtained from various sources, including the numerous lakes and rivers present in the world, although most of these are contaminated and can cause side effects to the player. Polluted water can be boiled to purify it. Another option is to construct a water collector, which gathers rainwater in a turtle shell. Food can be obtained from various animals, plants, and even other humans in the world.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game begins with Eric LeBlanc sitting in an airplane with his son Timmy, before the plane crashes on a remote, heavily forested peninsula. Eric and his son manage to survive the crash, but Eric watches helplessly as Timmy is kidnapped by a man covered in red paint before falling unconscious. Upon awakening in the crashed plane, Eric goes out in search of his son. Forced to defend himself from hostile wildlife and the cannibalistic mutants which live on the peninsula, Eric searches for his son's whereabouts. The forest contains clues to help Eric track down his son's kidnapper, who can be seldom seen in the distance observing Eric, but will flee if he is approached. The majority of clues leading to Timmy are in the cave system below the peninsula.\n\nOver time, Eric encounters increasingly bizarre mutations, such as mutants with extra limbs. Eventually, he discovers an abandoned underground lab complex owned by Sahara Therapeutics, a large research company responsible for experimenting with creatures on the peninsula. Upon entering the lab, Eric finds the lab's personnel dead and discovers that they were studying an artifact called the Resurrection Obelisk. Created by a mysterious group called the Ancient Ones, the artifact has the power to bring the dead back to life but requires a child sacrifice. While exploring the labs, Eric learns that his son's kidnapper, Dr. Matthew Cross, was a researcher at the facility before losing his daughter Megan to an \"Armsy\", a mutant with several arms. Driven insane by Megan's death, Cross resorted to using the artifact to resurrect Megan and kidnapped Timmy to use as a sacrifice. Eric eventually finds the Resurrection Obelisk and opens it only to find Timmy\u2019s dead body, having already been sacrificed by Cross to bring back Megan.\n\nDespite being too late to save his son, Eric soon discovers Cross dead and that the revived Megan has mutated into an aggressive, cannibalistic monster. Eric confronts the child, who seizes and mutates further before attacking him. Eric kills the mutated Megan and attempts to use her body to resurrect Timmy, but the process is a failure, since a live sacrifice is needed. Eric then reaches the facility's highest point and discovers a second artifact known as the Power Obelisk, which functions as a type of [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] device capable of bringing down planes when activated, implying that Cross had used it earlier to cause the plane crash in order to find a sacrifice. Eric is then faced with either activating the artifact or shutting it down. \n\nThe game features two endings. In the first, Eric uses the second artifact to cause another plane crash, intending to find a child sacrifice to bring Timmy back to life. One year later, Eric and his resurrected son have apparently been rescued, and they are invited onto a talk show to promote Eric's book, chronicling his experiences on the peninsula. However, during the show, Timmy collapses and begins to have a seizure, implying he is undergoing the same mutation that Cross's daughter had. If the player approaches Timmy, he will eventually snap out of it. If this is done, players will take the perspective of Timmy, who is now much older, gathering information on the peninsula for an unknown purpose while also trying to suppress his mutations. In the second ending, the player is given the option to shut the artifact down and spare the lives of everyone on the plane, at the cost of Timmy staying dead and Eric remaining isolated on the peninsula indefinitely.\n\n== Development ==\n''The Forest'' was inspired by cult films such as ''[[The Descent]]'' and ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' and video games like ''[[Don't Starve]]'',<ref name=\"interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-08-first-person-open-world-survival-horror-game-the-forest-looks-brilliant |title= First-person open-world survival horror game The Forest looks brilliant |date= 8 May 2013 |accessdate= 27 January 2014 |first= Jeffrey |last= Matulef |work= Eurogamer}}</ref> and was accepted as part of [[Steam Greenlight]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/11/11/the-forest-trailer-shows-continued-survival-panicked-combat-and-questionable-effigies/ |title= ''The Forest'' trailer shows continued survival, panicked combat and questionable effigies |date= 11 November 2013 |accessdate= 28 January 2014 |first= Phil |last= Savage |work= PC Gamer}}</ref> Canadian-based developers Endnight Games have said that [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] was an inspiration for the game, commenting that they do not want the whole game to be entirely \"dark and depressing.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web |url= http://www.vg247.com/2014/01/29/the-forest-survival-horror-and-the-guilt-of-killing-interview/ |title= The Forest: survival, horror and the guilt of killing \u2013 interview |date= 29 January 2014 |accessdate= 2 March 2014 |first= John |last= Robertson |work=[[VG247]]}}</ref> The game is being developed to be compatible with the [[Oculus Rift]] virtual reality headset.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.joystiq.com/2014/01/24/explore-virtual-reality-horror-game-the-forest-in-new-screens/ |title= Explore virtual reality horror game The Forest in new screens |date= 24 January 2014 |accessdate= 28 January 2014 |first= David |last= Hinkle |work= [[Joystiq]]}}</ref> After adding a [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] mode option during development, the team stated that they wished for the game to stay away from the [[Massively multiplayer online game|massive multiplayer]] feel of other games, such as ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]''.<ref name=\"detailed\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nThe development team has a background in film visual effects, having worked on films such as ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' and ''[[Tron: Legacy]]''.

The game takes place on a remote, heavily forested peninsula where the [[player character]] Eric Leblanc and his son Timmy are survivors of a plane crash. The game features [[nonlinear gameplay]] in an [[open world]] environment played from a [[first-person (video games)|first-person perspective]], with no set missions or quests, empowering the player to make their own decisions for survival. Following a four-year long [[early access]] beta phase, the game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in April 2018, and for the [[PlayStation 4]] in November 2018.<!--Due to more than one date in the lead, there should be no exact dates here per WP:VG/DATE--> The game was also a commercial success, selling over five million copies by the end of 2018. A sequel, ''Sons of the Forest'', is under development.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn ''The Forest'', players control Eric LeBlanc and must survive on a forested peninsula in search of his son Timmy after a devastating plane crash. Players must survive by creating shelter, weapons, and other survival tools. Inhabiting the island, along with various woodland creatures, are a tribe of nocturnal, [[cannibalistic]] mutants, who dwell in villages on the surface and in deep caves beneath the peninsula. While they are not necessarily always hostile to the player, their usual behaviour is aggressive, especially during the night.<ref name=\"PCG interview\"/>\n\nHowever, the developers wanted players to question whether the island's cannibalistic tribe is the enemy of the player or vice versa.<ref name=\"PCG interview\">{{cite web |url= http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/the-forest/ |title= The Forest interview: survival, horror and the VR wilderness |date= 28 May 2013 |accessdate= 28 January 2014 |first= Phil |last= Savage |work= PC Gamer}}</ref> For example, when first encountering the player, the cannibals may hesitate to attack and instead observe the player from a distance, attempt to communicate with the player through effigies, and send patrols around the player's base camp. In combat, they regularly attempt to protect one another from injury, remove torches, surround the player, hide behind cover, drag wounded tribesmen to safety, keep their distance, use tactical decisions, not overextend into unknown territory, and occasionally surrender out of fear. They are also afraid of fire, and will sometimes refrain from approaching the player if there is a campfire or torch nearby. Though there are no set missions, there is an optional conclusion to the game.<ref name=\"detailed\">{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-01-07-ambitious-open-world-horror-game-the-forest-detailed  |title= Ambitious open-world horror game The Forest detailed |date= 13 January 2014 |accessdate= 27 January 2014 |first= Jeffrey |last= Matulef |work= [[Eurogamer]]}}</ref>\n\nAs the player progresses through the game and explores the caves underneath the forest surface, they will encounter increasingly bizarre mutations, including deformed babies and mutants with several extra appendages. The game also features a day and night cycle, with the player able to build a shelter and traps, hunt animals and collect supplies during the day, and defend themselves against the mutants by night.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nAs seen in the opening intro of the game, the player possesses a survival guide book that the playable character authors, which contains many useful tips and general information about wilderness survival. The survival guide is also crucial because it allows for the player to build [[blueprints]] for various different structures that can aid the player in their survival. The player can choose to build a specific structure and then select a specific place where to place that structure in the world. Once the blueprint is placed, the player then needs to gather the necessary resources, such as sticks, rocks, logs, etc. in order to complete the particular structure. The player can choose from various structures and buildings in the survival guide. These include basic survival shelters, wooden cabins, treehouses, tree platforms, as well as custom-designed structures, which the player can modify in terms of size, shape, and position. Most of the shelters and buildings that the player can build also feature an option for saving the game. In fact, this is the only available method for saving, as there is no [[autosave]] function in the game. The survival guidebook also provides information about the wildlife of the peninsula. Once the player comes across a previously unknown species of animal or plant, the player jots it down and it appears in the guidebook. The guidebook also contains a \"to-do list\", which lists general goals that the player should follow, such as building a shelter or exploring different caves. \n\nThe player also possesses an inventory, which can be accessed at almost any time in the game. Any item that the player gathers, or collects in the world is stored in the inventory, which has a realistic design and shows where each item is stored. Items that can be placed in the inventory include tools, weapons, animal meats, furs, and skins, herbs and flowers, a map, a compass, as well as other things. The inventory also includes a [[crafting]] system. Crafting in the game is based on the player's knowledge about combining different components into useful items and tools. For example, in order to craft a basic axe, the player needs to gather and combine a stick, a rock, as well as rope. Once the player gathers and places all the required items on the crafting space, a gear icon will become visible, indicating that the player is able to construct a particular tool/weapon. In the inventory, the player can also choose to place two desired items/weapons for quick select by assigning them to the [[D-pad]] on a PS4 controller or to specific keys on PC.\n\nThe player also has a [[Heads-up display|HUD]] display on the bottom right of their screen. The HUD displays the player's total health, energy, stamina, hunger, and thirst levels. The amount of stamina available is directly related to the energy amount of the player. Hunger is measured via an icon depicting a human stomach, while the thirst icon depicts a water droplet. Water can be obtained from various sources, including the numerous lakes and rivers present in the world, although most of these are contaminated and can cause side effects to the player. Polluted water can be boiled to purify it. Another option is to construct a water collector, which gathers rainwater in a turtle shell. Food can be obtained from various animals, plants, and even other humans in the world.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game begins with Eric LeBlanc sitting in an airplane with his son Timmy, before the plane crashes on a remote, heavily forested peninsula.

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as <viridiarium> 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain <saeculum> was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce <knight> as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as <viridiarium> 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] competely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in everyday roman speech'.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

The longest total service record for a female MP is  held by [[Margaret Beckett|Dame Margaret Beckett]], who served for 4 years and 7 months between 1974 and 1979 and was then re-elected in June 1983. Beckett also holds the record for the longest span of service for a woman.\n\n===Shortest===\nThere are cases of MPs being elected posthumously; [[Edward Legge (Royal Navy officer)|Edward Legge]] (1710\u201347) was elected unopposed as [[Portsmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Portsmouth]] on 15 December 1747, four days before news arrived that he had died 87 days previously in the [[West Indies]]. In 1780 [[John Kirkman]] was elected as [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for the City of London]] despite passing away before polls closed.<ref name=\"GBOR96\"/>\n\nIn more recent times, members have died after polling, but before the declaration of the results. In [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]], [[Thomas Higgins (Irish politician)|Thomas Higgins]] was declared elected for the seat of [[North Galway (UK Parliament constituency)|North Galway]], even though he had died earlier that morning, after polling day. More recently, in 1945 Sir [[Edward Taswell Campbell]] at [[Bromley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bromley]] and [[Leslie Pym]] at [[Monmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth]] died after polling, but nine days before the declaration of the results. Both were declared elected posthumously, and both had been MPs for a number of years. [[Noel Skelton]] is another example in 1935.\n\nThe shortest non-posthumous service was that of [[Alfred Dobbs]], who was declared elected [[Smethwick (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Smethwick]] on 26 July 1945 and was killed the following day in a car accident on the way to take his seat.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buchanan |first=Tom |date=1991 |title=The Spanish Civil War and the British Labour Movement |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=98 |isbn=0521393337}}</ref>\n\nThe shortest service for women MPs has been 97 days in the case of [[Jane Dodds]], who was MP for [[Brecon and Radnorshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]] from a [[2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election|by-election on 1 August 2019]] to dissolution of Parliament on 6 November 2019 prior to [[2019 United Kingdom general election|the following month's general election]]. The previous record was 112 days in the case of both [[Ruth Dalton]], who was MP for [[Bishop Auckland (UK Parliament constituency)|Bishop Auckland]] from a [[1929 Bishop Auckland by-election|by-election on 7 February 1929]] to dissolution of Parliament on 10 May 1929 prior to [[1929 United Kingdom general election|that year's general election]], and [[Margo MacDonald]], who was MP for [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] from a [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election on 8 November 1973]] until the dissolution of Parliament on 8 February 1974 prior to the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|coming general election]].\n\n====Shortest total service since 1900====\nFor a comprehensive list of MPs since 1900 with less than 365 days total service see\n* [[List of United Kingdom MPs with the shortest service]]\n\n===Members who never took their seats===\n* [[John Finucane (Sinn F\u00e9in politician)|John Finucane]] <sup>a</sup>, 2019\u2013\n* [[\u00d3rfhlaith Begley]] <sup>a</sup>, 2018\u2013\n* [[Chris Hazzard]] <sup>a</sup>, 2017\u2013\n* [[Elisha McCallion]] <sup>a</sup>, 2017\u20132019\n* [[Barry McElduff]] <sup>a</sup>, 2017\u20132018\n* [[Mickey Brady]] <sup>a</sup>, 2015\u2013\n* [[Francie Molloy]] <sup>a</sup>, 2013\u2013\n* [[Paul Maskey]] <sup>a</sup>, 2011\u2013\n* [[Michelle Gildernew]] <sup>a</sup>, 2001\u20132015, 2017\u2013\n* [[Pat Doherty]] <sup>a</sup>, 2001\u20132017\n* [[Conor Murphy]]  <sup>a</sup>, 2005\u20132015\n* [[Martin McGuinness]] <sup>a</sup>, 1997\u20132013\n* [[Gerry Adams]] <sup>a</sup>, 1983\u201392, 1997\u20132011\n* [[Owen Carron]] <sup>a</sup>, 1981\u201383\n* [[Bobby Sands]] <sup>bc</sup>, 1981\n* [[Philip Clarke (politician)|Philip Clarke]] <sup>abd</sup>, 1955\n* [[Tom Mitchell (Irish politician)|Tom Mitchell]] <sup>abd</sup>, 1955\n* [[Alfred Dobbs]] <sup>c</sup>, 1945\n* [[Joseph Nicholas Bell|Joseph Bell]] <sup>c</sup>, 1922\n* [[Harry Wrightson]] <sup>c</sup>, 1918\u201319\n* [[Members of the 1st D\u00e1il#Members by constituency|69 Sinn F\u00e9in Members elected at the 1918 general election]] (including 6 first elected in by-elections 1917\u201318) <sup>a</sup>\n* [[James Annand]] <sup>c</sup>, 1906\n* [[Thomas Higgins (Irish politician)|Thomas Higgins]] <sup>e</sup>, 1906\n* [[Henry Francis Compton|Henry Compton]] <sup>f</sup>, 1905\u201306 (shortest serving MP \u2013 46 days \u2013 whose tenure was not ended by his death)\n* [[Joseph Andrews (British politician)|Joseph Andrews]] <sup>f</sup>, 1905\u201306\n\nNotes:\n:<sup>a</sup> Abstentionist\n:<sup>b</sup> In prison at time of election\n:<sup>c</sup> Died before taking seat\n:<sup>d</sup> Ruled ineligible\n:<sup>e</sup> Elected posthumously\n:<sup>f</sup> By-election win was superseded by subsequent general election, without Parliament sitting in the meantime\n\n==MPs who never won an election==\nOn rare occasions the election winner may be disqualified, either by an [[election court]] or by the House of Commons, and the seat awarded to the runner-up.\n:[[Malcolm St. Clair (UK politician)|Malcolm St. Clair]]: Bristol South-East, 1961\u201363\n:[[Charles Beattie]]: Mid-Ulster, 1955\u201356\n\n==MPs elected to two or more constituencies simultaneously==\n* [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]: elected in 1880 General election for three separate seats \u2013 [[Cork City]], [[Mayo (UK Parliament constituency)|Mayo]] and [[Meath (UK Parliament constituency)|Meath]].\n* [[Richard Hazleton]]: from 9 December 1910 until 23 February 1911, when he was unseated on a petition from the second seat, he was MP for [[North Galway (UK Parliament constituency)|North Galway]] and [[North Louth (UK Parliament constituency)|North Louth]].\n* At the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 election]], 4 [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] candidates were each elected to two seats: [[Arthur Griffith]] (Cavan East and Tyrone North West), [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] (Clare East and Mayo East), [[Liam Mellows]] (Galway East and Meath North) and [[Eoin MacNeill]] (Londonderry City and National University of Ireland).

All began serving in the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 126 years.\n* [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Henry Paget, Lord Paget (later 1st Marquess of Anglesey)]] served 1790\u20131804 and 1806\u201310; [[Arthur Paget (diplomat)|Arthur Paget]] 1794\u20131807; [[Berkeley Paget]] 1807\u201326; [[Charles Paget (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Charles Paget]] 1804\u201326 and 1831\u201333 and 1833\u201334; [[Edward Paget|Sir Edward Paget]], 1796\u20131806 and 1810\u201320; and [[William Paget (MP)|William Paget]] 1790 to his death in 1794. Four of the brothers began serving under the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 79 years.\n\n===Longest span of service in the Commons by brothers===\nProbably the longest (though not continuous) all time span of service by brothers in the Commons, in the Parliament of England, was 85 years from 1562, when [[Henry Knollys (privateer)|Sir Henry Knollys]] was elected MP for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]], until the death in 1648 of his brother [[Francis Knollys (admiral)|Sir Francis Knollys]] (above, aged reputedly 97) also representing Reading, although there were intervals of years when parliament did not meet. They were part of another set of six brothers who all sat at various times.\n\nSince regular parliamentary government was established by the start of the UK Parliament, contenders for longest span of continuous service include the four brothers [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] (also twice Prime Minister), [[William Yates Peel]], [[Jonathan Peel]] and [[Edmund Peel]], with a span of 59 years from Robert's by-election return on 15 April 1809 as MP for [[Cashel (UK Parliament constituency)|Cashel]], to the retirement of Jonathan at the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. Their collective service totalled 115 years and all four were simultaneously in Parliament when Edmund was sitting in 1831\u201332 and 1835\u201337 for [[Newcastle-under-Lyme (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle-under-Lyme]]. Another 59 year service span was enjoyed by two brothers, [[William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale]] (when Viscount Lowther before entering the House of Lords in 1841) and [[Henry Cecil Lowther]], from the former's election as MP for [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]] in 1808 until the death of the latter as MP for [[Westmorland (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland]] (which he had represented since 1812) and [[Father of the House]] on 4 December 1867.\n\n[[Thomas Hyde Villiers]] and his brother [[Charles Pelham Villiers]] (above) had a span of nearly 72 years service from the former's first election as MP in 1826 to the latter's death as a serving MP and Father of the House in 1898, but this was broken by an interval when the former was out of parliament in 1831, and the gap between Thomas' death on 3 December 1832 and Charles' first election in [[1835 United Kingdom general election|1835]]. Their consecutive service thus totalled 69 years.\n\n===Representation of same constituency by brothers===\nWhere seats were in the patronage of territorial magnates, it was commonplace into the 19th century for brothers in (usually landowning) families to hold seats successively or (before the advent of single member seats) even concurrently, before the system of choosing candidates by local party associations became organised on a competitive selection basis.\nTwo brothers successively represented [[North Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Derbyshire]] for a total span of nearly 48 years.

All began serving in the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 126 years.\n* [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Henry Paget, Lord Paget (later 1st Marquess of Anglesey)]] served 1790\u20131804 and 1806\u201310; [[Arthur Paget (diplomat)|Arthur Paget]] 1794\u20131807; [[Berkeley Paget]] 1807\u201326; [[Charles Paget (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Charles Paget]] 1804\u201326 and 1831\u201333 and 1833\u201334; [[Edward Paget|Sir Edward Paget]], 1796\u20131806 and 1810\u201320; and [[William Paget (MP)|William Paget]] 1790 to his death in 1794. Four of the brothers began serving under the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 79 years.\n\n===Longest span of service in the Commons by brothers===\nProbably the longest (though not continuous) all time span of service by brothers in the Commons, in the Parliament of England, was 85 years from 1562, when [[Henry Knollys (privateer)|Sir Henry Knollys]] was elected MP for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]], until the death in 1648 of his brother [[Francis Knollys (admiral)|Sir Francis Knollys]] (above, aged reputedly 97) also representing Reading, although there were intervals of years when parliament did not meet. They were part of another set of six brothers who all sat at various times.\n\nSince regular parliamentary government was established by the start of the UK Parliament, contenders for longest span of continuous service include the four brothers [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] (also twice Prime Minister), [[William Yates Peel]], [[Jonathan Peel]] and [[Edmund Peel]], with a span of 59 years from Robert's by-election return on 15 April 1809 as MP for [[Cashel (UK Parliament constituency)|Cashel]], to the retirement of Jonathan at the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. Their collective service totalled 115 years and all four were simultaneously in Parliament when Edmund was sitting in 1831\u201332 and 1835\u201337 for [[Newcastle-under-Lyme (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle-under-Lyme]]. Another 59 year service span was enjoyed by two brothers, [[William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale]] (when Viscount Lowther before entering the House of Lords in 1841) and [[Henry Cecil Lowther]], from the former's election as MP for [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]] in 1808 until the death of the latter as MP for [[Westmorland (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland]] (which he had represented since 1812) and [[Father of the House]] on 4 December 1867.\n\n[[Thomas Hyde Villiers]] and his brother [[Charles Pelham Villiers]] (above) had a span of nearly 72 years service from the former's first election as MP in 1826 to the latter's death as a serving MP and Father of the House in 1898, but this was broken by an interval when the former was out of parliament in 1831, and the gap between Thomas' death on 3 December 1832 and Charles' first election in [[1835 United Kingdom general election|1835]]. Their consecutive service thus totalled 69 years.\n\n===Representation of same constituency by brothers===\nWhere seats were in the patronage of territorial magnates, it was commonplace into the 19th century for brothers in (usually landowning) families to hold seats successively or (before the advent of single member seats) even concurrently, before the system of choosing candidates by local party associations became organised on a competitive selection basis.\nTwo brothers successively represented [[North Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Derbyshire]] for a total span of nearly 48 years.

Demographic studies and resultant reports conducted by the [[European Commission]]<ref>Eurostat, ''Population Projections'', European Commission, 2012</ref> point to the declining [[birth rate]] of the population of the native European peoples, which would need to be reversed from its present level of about 1.4 in order to preclude a population decline of the native European peoples by nearly half in each [[generation]], back to a replacement level of 2.1. Some have claimed that in order to compensate, it is necessary to allow migrants to settle in Europe in order to prevent labour [[shortage]]s. It has been argued that such immigration leads to [[ethnic conflict]]s, such as the [[2005 French riots|2005 civil unrest in France]].<ref>Steyn, Mark (2006) ''America Alone: The End of the World As We Know It'' Washington D.C., Regnery Publishing.

RAND Europe, an independent not-for-profit research institute, was able to collect these policies through research and analysis. There were three broad policy approaches that were generated from the debate. The first policy is to encourage childbearing among younger couples that involves marriage and cohabitation. The second policy states that there should be an increase in the immigration of working-age people. Thirdly, there should be an improvement of social policy in general, to mitigate negative consequences of these trends.

Source Eurostat]]\nThere have been mixed feelings over the European population's increased life expectancy and declining birth rate ever since the European countries were the first to start the [[demographic transition]] between the 18th and 19th centuries, and perhaps even more since this was achieved. Demographic studies and resultant reports conducted by the [[European Commission]]<ref>Eurostat, ''Population Projections'', European Commission, 2012</ref> point to the declining [[birth rate]] of the population of the native European peoples, which would need to be reversed from its present level of about 1.4 in order to preclude a population decline of the native European peoples by nearly half in each [[generation]], back to a replacement level of 2.1. Some have claimed that in order to compensate, it is necessary to allow migrants to settle in Europe in order to prevent labour [[shortage]]s. It has been argued that such immigration leads to [[ethnic conflict]]s, such as the [[2005 French riots|2005 civil unrest in France]].<ref>Steyn, Mark (2006) ''America Alone: The End of the World As We Know It'' Washington D.C., Regnery Publishing. On pages 10 and 54, birth rates among people of European ancestry populations in various nations are indicated that show all populations of European ancestry are reproducing at an average birth rate of only about 1.4, almost half the replacement rate of 2.1, and thus their population has a negative (declining) growth rate that will decline by almost half every generation.</ref><ref name=\"nytimes.com2\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/29/magazine/29Birth-t.html?fta=y \"Childless Europe: What Happens to a Continent When it Stops Making Babies?\"] ''New York Times Magazine'' Sunday, June 29, 2008</ref><ref>Himmelfarb, Milton, and Victor Baras (eds). 1978.

RAND Europe, an independent not-for-profit research institute, was able to collect these policies through research and analysis. There were three broad policy approaches that were generated from the debate. The first policy is to encourage childbearing among younger couples that involves marriage and cohabitation. The second policy states that there should be an increase in the immigration of working-age people. Thirdly, there should be an improvement of social policy in general, to mitigate negative consequences of these trends.
