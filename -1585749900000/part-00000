Short plays were unfashionable in the theatre of the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a group of one-act or otherwise brief pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\n''Shadow Play'' was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in  London (1936) and New York (1936\u20131937), where it played to full houses. It has enjoyed several major revivals and has been adapted for television.\n\nThe play depicts a husband and wife in a marriage on the brink of collapse. Under the influence of an unwisely large dose of sleeping pills, the wife has a dream that retells their story in hallucinatory form. Musical intervals weave in and out of the dream. The husband is so concerned for his wife's condition that his love is rekindled, and when she comes round they are reconciled.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s to longer plays; by the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre. He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley, p. 66</ref> In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of nine short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he has starred in his comedy ''[[Private Lives]]'' in 1930\u201331,<ref>Morley, (2013), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217</ref> and he wrote the ''Tonight at 8.30'' plays \"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283</ref> Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them. They were performed in various combinations of three.{{refn|The plays chosen for each performance were announced in advance, although a myth evolved that the groupings were random.<ref>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 January 1936, p. 10; 11 February 1936, p. 12; 2 March 1936, p. 12; 6 April 1936, p. 10; 2 May 1936, p. 12; 10 June 1936, p. 14.</ref>|group=n}}  ''Shadow Play'' was first presented on 18 October 1935 at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House, Manchester]], the final play in a programme that also contained ''[[Hands Across the Sea (play)|Hands Across the Sea]]'' and ''[[Fumed Oak]]''.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, p. 282</ref>\n\nThe first London performance was on 18 January 1936 at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]].<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 19 January 1936, p. 15.</ref> The production ran for a limited season, playing to full houses, but ending after three months.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 192</ref>{{refn|Coward, who disliked long runs, and also needed to set aside time to write and compose,<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 94\u201395</ref> usually insisted on playing a part for no longer than three months.<ref>Hoare, p. 155</ref>|group=n}} The Broadway premiere was at the [[Nederlander Theatre|National Theatre]] on 27 November 1936.

They have been to the theatre together, but Vicky refuses to accompany Martha to a party because Simon Gayforth, her husband, is sure to be there with Sybil Heston, to whom he somewhat attached. Vicky intends to go to bed, and takes three strong sleeping tablets. Her admirer Michael Doyle, rings up, and she tells him brusquely to call back tomorrow as she is too tired to talk now.\n\nSimon comes to tell Martha that George, her husband, is waiting impatiently for her. Simon too has decided not to go to the party, and he asks the Cunninghams to make his excuses for him. When they have gone he begins a serious conversation with his wife: he asks her to divorce him. She agrees, noting sadly that they have been married for just five years. The sleeping tablets begin to take effect making her head swim. The action becomes confused and dreamlike, and is evidently seen through Vicky's drugged eyes. Music is heard; it stops and then starts again. Simon dances a few steps. The music becomes more insistent. Simon and Vicky sing a duet, \"Then\" about transitory joy. This is followed by a second song, \"Play, Orchestra, Play\" (\"We Must Have Music\"). The lights fade to nothing. Sybil Heston appears in a pool of light, telling Simon that they must let Vicky know the truth; they are joined by Michael Doyle, who asks them to give her his love. The lights fade on a reprise of \"Play, Orchestra, Play\".\n\nThe scene changes to a moonlit garden. We see the first meeting of Vicky and Simon, at a country ball. Their dialogue is a mixture of what they said at the time and their current comments on it:\n:Vicky: What do you do?\n:Simon: I'm in a bank.\n:Vicky: High up in a bank? Or just sitting in a cage totting up things?\n:Simon: Oh, quite high up, really. It's a very good bank.\n:Vicky: I'm so glad.\n:Simon: How lovely you are.\n:Vicky: No, no, that came later \u2013 you've skipped some.\n:Simon: Sorry.\n:Vicky: You're nice and thin \u2013 your eyes are funny \u2013 you move easily \u2013 I'm afraid you're terribly attractive.\n:Simon: You never said that.\n:Vicky: No, but I thought it.\n:Simon: Stick to the script.\nThey sing a duet, \"You Were There,\" finishing in each other's arms in a spotlight. The dreamlike mood continues. Lena is seen spotlit, carrying sleeping tablets and a glass of water, and singing \"Then\". In another pool of light, Martha and George are seen in a car discussing the Gayforths' matrimonial troubles: Vicky runs on and accuses them of \"spoiling it all\". There follow hallucinatory images of the Gayforths' honeymoon journey to Venice and a noisy nightclub where Sybil Heston and Michael Doyle dance together in a brilliant spotlight. Another spotlight picks up Vicky and Simon, and the two couples dance on, constantly switching partners, faster and faster, as voices from the darkness rhythmically chant the names of night-clubs: \"The Florida, The Cocoanut Grove, The Four Hundred, The Blue Train\". The noise crescendos and then stops suddenly, with a blackout.\n\nLena, spotlit, is seen telephoning Martha asking her to come back because Vicky is suffering from an overdose of sleeping tablets and Simon is alarmed about her. In the final scene the lighting returns to normal. Simon, Lena and Martha are at Vicky's bedside, giving her black coffee. Simon tells her, when she asks for explanations, that, under the influence of the drug, \"you just went mad, that's all \u2013 raving \u2026 you began dancing about the room\". Deciding that Vicky is now safe, the others leave her alone with Simon. When she asks him about the divorce, he declares that he wants nothing of the sort; everything is all right again between them. He lifts her on to the bed, covers her over with the counterpane, and lies down on the sofa at her feet.\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\n\nIn 1937 a company led by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.

It was reprised by me later in the show while Gertie was scrambling breathlessly into a grey bouffant dress in the quick-change room at the side of the stage.

Arnold specified that a portion of his estate was to be used for \"...the promotion of [[Agriculture|Agricultural]], or [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] improvements\". According to the deed of trust between the Arnold trustees and the College, income from Arnold's legacy was to be used for establishing, developing and maintaining an arboretum to be known as the Arnold Arboretum, which \"shall contain, as far as practicable, all the trees [and] shrubs ... either indigenous or exotic, which can be raised in the open air of [[West Roxbury]].\" The historical mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of woody plants through research and to disseminate this knowledge through education.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sargent|first=Charles Sprague|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/71418|title=The first fifty years of the Arnold Arboretum|location=Cambridge, Mass.,}}</ref>\n\nArnold's gift was combined with {{convert|120|acre|km2}} of land that had been donated to Harvard University in 1842. [[Benjamin Bussey]] (1757\u20131842), a prosperous Boston merchant and scientific farmer, donated his country estate ''Woodland Hill'' and a part of his fortune to Harvard University \"for instruction in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], and related subjects\". Bussey had inherited land from fellow patriot [[Weld Family|Eleazer Weld]] in 1800 and further enlarged his large estate between 1806 and 1837 by acquiring and consolidating various farms that had been established as early as the seventeenth century. Harvard used this land for the creation of the [[Bussey Institute]], which was dedicated to agricultural experimentation. The first Bussey Institute building was completed in 1871 and served as headquarters for an [[undergraduate]] school of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Mary Jane|date=|title=Benjamin Bussey, Woodland Hill, and the Creation of the Arnold Arboretum|url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2006-64-1-benjamin-bussey-woodland-hill-and-the-creation-of-the-arnold-arboretum.pdf|journal=Arnoldia|volume=64(1)|pages=2-9|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn June of 1872 [[Charles Sprague Sargent]] was appointed as a professor of horticulture and the curator of the Arnold Arboretum; the following year he was appointed director of both the Arnold Arboretum and the Harvard Botanic Garden.

Recent introductions from Asia have resulted from the 1977 Arnold Arboretum Expedition to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], the 1980 Sino-American Botanical Expedition to western [[Hubei Province]], and more recent expeditions to [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nComprehensive collections are maintained and augmented for most genera, and genera that have received particular emphasis include: ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'', ''[[Beech|Fagus]]'', ''[[Carya]]'', ''[[Forsythia]]'', ''[[Taxodium]]'', ''[[Pinus]]'', ''[[Metasequoia]]'', ''[[Lonicera]]'', ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Malus]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'', ''[[Syringa]]'', ''[[Paulownia]]'', ''[[Albizia]]'', ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Gleditsia]]'' and ''[[Tsuga]]''. Other comprehensive collections include the Bradley Collection of [[Rosaceae|Rosaceous]] Plants, the collection of [[conifer]]s and dwarf conifers, and the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]]. Approximately 500 accessions are processed annually.\n\n== Collections policy ==\n[[File:ArnoldArboretumBirch20040415-01s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[birch]] tree in early spring]]\nThe mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of the [[evolution]] and biology of woody plants. Historically, this research has investigated the global distribution and evolutionary history of trees, shrubs and vines, with particular emphasis on the disjunct species of [[East Asia]] and North America. Today this work continues through molecular studies of the evolution and bio-geography of the floras of temperate Asia, North America and [[Europe]].\n\nResearch activities include molecular studies of gene evolution, investigations of plant-water relations, and the monitoring of plant phenology, vegetation succession, nutrient cycling and other factors that inform studies of environmental change. Applied work in horticulture uses the collections for studies in plant propagation, plant introduction, and environmental management. This diversity of scientific investigation is founded in a continuing commitment to acquire, grow, and document the recognized species and infraspecific [[taxa]] of [[Woody plant|ligneous plants]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] that are able to withstand the climate of the Arboretum's {{convert|281|acre|km2|adj=on}} Jamaica Plain/Roslindale site.\n\nAs a primary resource for research in plant biology, the Arboretum's living collections are developed, curated, and managed to support scientific investigation and study. To this end, acquisition policies place priority on obtaining plants that are genetically representative of documented wild populations. For each taxon, the Arnold Arboretum aspires to grow multiple accessions of known wild provenance in order to represent significant variation that may occur across the geographic range of the species. Accessions of garden or cultivated provenance are also acquired as governed by the collections policies herein.\n\nFor all specimens, full documentation of both provenance and history within the collection is a critical priority.  Curatorial procedures provide for complete and accurate records for each accession, and document original provenance, locations in the collections, and changes in botanical identity. [[Herbarium]] specimens, [[DNA]] materials, and [[digital images]] are gathered for the collection and maintained in Arboretum data systems and the herbarium at the Roslindale site.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch on plant pathology and integrated pest management for maintenance of the living collections is constantly ongoing. Herbarium-based research focuses on the systematics and biodiversity of both temperate and tropical Asian forests, as well as the ecology and potential for sustainable use of their resources. The Arboretum's education programs offer school groups and the general public a wide range of lectures, courses, and walks focusing on the ecology and cultivation of plants. Its quarterly magazine, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091007133215/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/static/home ''Arnoldia''], provides in-depth information on horticulture, botany, and garden history.

Currently the Arboretum utilizes a suite of [http://www.esri.com/ ESRI] Desktop and Mobile [http://www.gis.com/ GIS] software applications to manage, analyze, query, capture, manipulate, and display geographic information. A computer-driven embosser generates records labels. All accessioned plants in the collections are labeled with accession number, botanical name, and [[cultivar]] name (when appropriate), source information, common name, and map location. Trunk and/or display labels are also hung on many accessions and include botanical and common names and nativity.  Stake labels are used to identify plants located in the Leventritt Garden and Chinese Path.\n\n==Grounds maintenance==\nThe grounds staff consists of the manager of horticulture, three [[arborists]], ten horticultural technologists, a foreman, and a gardener. During the summer months ten horticultural interns supplement the grounds staff. A wide array of vehicles and modern equipment, including an aerial lift truck and a [[John Deere]] backhoe and front loader, are used in grounds maintenance. Permanent grounds staff, excluding the manager, are members of [[AFL/CIO]] Local 615, Service Employees International Union ([http://www.seiu.org/ SEIU]).\n\n==Nursery and greenhouse facilities==\nThe [http://arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/collections-management/propagation-distribution/ Dana Greenhouses], located at 1050 Centre Street (with a mailing address of 125 Arborway), were completed in 1962. They comprise four service [[greenhouse]]s totaling 3,744 square feet (348 m\u00b2), the headhouse with offices, cold rooms, storage areas, and a classroom. Staffing at the greenhouse includes the manager of greenhouses and nurseries, the plant propagator, two assistants, and, during the summer months, two horticultural interns. Adjacent to the greenhouse is a shade house of 3,150 square feet (293 m\u00b2), a 12,600 cubic foot (357 m\u00b3) cold storage facility, and three irrigated, inground nurseries totaling approximately one and one-half acres (6,000 m\u00b2). Also located in the greenhouse complex is the bonsai pavilion, where the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]] is displayed from the middle of April to the end of October. During the winter months the bonsai are held in the cold storage unit at temperatures slightly above freezing.\n\n==Isabella Welles Hunnewell Internship Program==\n[[File:Arnold Arboretum - Aug 2005 (c).JPG|thumb|right|upright|General view of Arnold Arboretum]]The Living Collections Department of the Arnold Arboretum offers a paid summer internship Program <ref>[http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/programs/intern.html Collections Internships & Fellowships]</ref> that combines hands-on training in horticulture with educational courses.\n\nThe Hunnewell Internship Program was endowed in 2003 by the descendants of [[H.

Recent introductions from Asia have resulted from the 1977 Arnold Arboretum Expedition to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], the 1980 Sino-American Botanical Expedition to western [[Hubei Province]], and more recent expeditions to [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nComprehensive collections are maintained and augmented for most genera, and genera that have received particular emphasis include: ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'', ''[[Beech|Fagus]]'', ''[[Carya]]'', ''[[Forsythia]]'', ''[[Taxodium]]'', ''[[Pinus]]'', ''[[Metasequoia]]'', ''[[Lonicera]]'', ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Malus]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'', ''[[Syringa]]'', ''[[Paulownia]]'', ''[[Albizia]]'', ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Gleditsia]]'' and ''[[Tsuga]]''. Other comprehensive collections include the Bradley Collection of [[Rosaceae|Rosaceous]] Plants, the collection of [[conifer]]s and dwarf conifers, and the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]]. Approximately 500 accessions are processed annually.\n\n== Collections policy ==\n[[File:ArnoldArboretumBirch20040415-01s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[birch]] tree in early spring]]\nThe mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of the [[evolution]] and biology of woody plants. Historically, this research has investigated the global distribution and evolutionary history of trees, shrubs and vines, with particular emphasis on the disjunct species of [[East Asia]] and North America. Today this work continues through molecular studies of the evolution and bio-geography of the floras of temperate Asia, North America and [[Europe]].\n\nResearch activities include molecular studies of gene evolution, investigations of plant-water relations, and the monitoring of plant phenology, vegetation succession, nutrient cycling and other factors that inform studies of environmental change. Applied work in horticulture uses the collections for studies in plant propagation, plant introduction, and environmental management. This diversity of scientific investigation is founded in a continuing commitment to acquire, grow, and document the recognized species and infraspecific [[taxa]] of [[Woody plant|ligneous plants]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] that are able to withstand the climate of the Arboretum's {{convert|281|acre|km2|adj=on}} Jamaica Plain/Roslindale site.\n\nAs a primary resource for research in plant biology, the Arboretum's living collections are developed, curated, and managed to support scientific investigation and study. To this end, acquisition policies place priority on obtaining plants that are genetically representative of documented wild populations. For each taxon, the Arnold Arboretum aspires to grow multiple accessions of known wild provenance in order to represent significant variation that may occur across the geographic range of the species. Accessions of garden or cultivated provenance are also acquired as governed by the collections policies herein.\n\nFor all specimens, full documentation of both provenance and history within the collection is a critical priority.  Curatorial procedures provide for complete and accurate records for each accession, and document original provenance, locations in the collections, and changes in botanical identity. [[Herbarium]] specimens, [[DNA]] materials, and [[digital images]] are gathered for the collection and maintained in Arboretum data systems and the herbarium at the Roslindale site.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch on plant pathology and integrated pest management for maintenance of the living collections is constantly ongoing. Herbarium-based research focuses on the systematics and biodiversity of both temperate and tropical Asian forests, as well as the ecology and potential for sustainable use of their resources. The Arboretum's education programs offer school groups and the general public a wide range of lectures, courses, and walks focusing on the ecology and cultivation of plants. Its quarterly magazine, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091007133215/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/static/home ''Arnoldia''], provides in-depth information on horticulture, botany, and garden history.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20051228104826/http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/research/research.html Current Research Initiatives]\n\n==Plant records==\nPlant records are maintained on a computerized database, ''BG-BASE'' 6.8 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080710150743/http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/bg-base/welcome.htm#top ''BG-BASE'' Inc.]), which was initiated in 1985 at the request of the Arnold Arboretum and the Threatened Plants Unit (TPU) of the World Conservation Monitoring Centre ([http://www.unep-wcmc.org/ WCMC]). Currently the Arboretum utilizes a suite of [http://www.esri.com/ ESRI] Desktop and Mobile [http://www.gis.com/ GIS] software applications to manage, analyze, query, capture, manipulate, and display geographic information. A computer-driven embosser generates records labels. All accessioned plants in the collections are labeled with accession number, botanical name, and [[cultivar]] name (when appropriate), source information, common name, and map location. Trunk and/or display labels are also hung on many accessions and include botanical and common names and nativity.  Stake labels are used to identify plants located in the Leventritt Garden and Chinese Path.\n\n==Grounds maintenance==\nThe grounds staff consists of the manager of horticulture, three [[arborists]], ten horticultural technologists, a foreman, and a gardener. During the summer months ten horticultural interns supplement the grounds staff. A wide array of vehicles and modern equipment, including an aerial lift truck and a [[John Deere]] backhoe and front loader, are used in grounds maintenance. Permanent grounds staff, excluding the manager, are members of [[AFL/CIO]] Local 615, Service Employees International Union ([http://www.seiu.org/ SEIU]).\n\n==Nursery and greenhouse facilities==\nThe [http://arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/collections-management/propagation-distribution/ Dana Greenhouses], located at 1050 Centre Street (with a mailing address of 125 Arborway), were completed in 1962. They comprise four service [[greenhouse]]s totaling 3,744 square feet (348 m\u00b2), the headhouse with offices, cold rooms, storage areas, and a classroom. Staffing at the greenhouse includes the manager of greenhouses and nurseries, the plant propagator, two assistants, and, during the summer months, two horticultural interns. Adjacent to the greenhouse is a shade house of 3,150 square feet (293 m\u00b2), a 12,600 cubic foot (357 m\u00b3) cold storage facility, and three irrigated, inground nurseries totaling approximately one and one-half acres (6,000 m\u00b2). Also located in the greenhouse complex is the bonsai pavilion, where the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]] is displayed from the middle of April to the end of October. During the winter months the bonsai are held in the cold storage unit at temperatures slightly above freezing.\n\n==Isabella Welles Hunnewell Internship Program==\n[[File:Arnold Arboretum - Aug 2005 (c).JPG|thumb|right|upright|General view of Arnold Arboretum]]The Living Collections Department of the Arnold Arboretum offers a paid summer internship Program <ref>[http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/programs/intern.html Collections Internships & Fellowships]</ref> that combines hands-on training in horticulture with educational courses.\n\nThe Hunnewell Internship Program was endowed in 2003 by the descendants of [[H. H. Hunnewell]] and his wife, Isabella Pratt Welles Hunnewell, for whom the Program is named. [[H. H. Hunnewell]] was a distant cousin and friend of [[Charles Sprague Sargent]], and Hunnewell and Sargent advised and helped each other on the creation of the Arnold Arboretum and Hunnewell's [[H.H.

The [[Baltic nobility|Baltic German noble]] [[Wrangel family]] was part of the [[Uradel]] (old nobility), the family was of [[Danish people|Dano]]-[[Germans|German]] origin, but their origin place was largely unknown. The family first appeared in [[Virumaa|Wierland]] (now Virumaa) of [[Duchy of Estonia (1219\u20131346)|Danish Estonia]] around the 13th Century. Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel was only distantly related to the famed Arctic explorer [[Ferdinand von Wrangel]] and the Prussian Generalfeldmarschall [[Friedrich von Wrangel]]. \n\n==Early life==\nWhile he was of [[Baltic German]] roots, he was a [[Russian Orthodox]] because his [[Lutheran]] grandfather, Baron Hans Georg Hermann von Wrangel, married a Russian woman, and all of his descendants were baptized Orthodox, creating a Russian branch of the family.\n\nAfter graduating from the [[Rostov]] Technical High School in 1896 and the Institute of Mining Engineering in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1901, Wrangel volunteered for the prestigious [[Russian Imperial Guard|Life Guards]] [[cavalry]] and was commissioned a reserve [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] in 1902 after graduating from the [[Nikolaev Cavalry School]]. He soon resigned his commission and travelled to [[Irkutsk]], where he was assigned to special missions by the [[Governor-General]].\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:Eristov & Wrangel. Kauschen 1914.jpg|thumb|Wrangel and Prince [[Simon Sidamon-Eristoff|Sidamon-Eristavi]] at a captured German cannon in 1914]]\nAt the start of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in February 1904, he re-enlisted and was assigned to the 2nd Regiment of the [[Baikal Cossacks|Transbaikal Cossack Corps]]. In December 1904, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. \n\nAfter the war ended, in January 1906, he was reassigned to the 55th Finland Dragoon Regiment, which, under General A. N. Orlov, took part in pacifying rebels in Siberia. In 1907, he returned to the Life Guards Cavalry Regiment. In 1908, he married Olga Mikhaylovna Ivanenko in St. Petersburg, and they produced two sons and two daughters.<ref>[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=166380230 New York Times obituary of his last surviving child]</ref> Wrangel graduated from the [[General Staff Academy (Imperial Russia)|Nicholas Imperial General Staff Academy]] in 1910 and the Cavalry Officers' School in 1911.\n\nWith the start of [[World War I]], Wrangel was promoted to captain and assigned command of a cavalry squadron. On October 13, 1914, he became one of the first Russian officers to be awarded the [[Order of St. George]] (4th degree) in the war, the highest military decoration of the Russian Empire. In December 1914, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. In October 1915, Wrangel was transferred to the [[Southwestern Front (Russian Empire)|Southwestern Front]] and was appointed commander of the 1st Regiment of the Transbaikal Cossacks.\n\nThe unit was very active in [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]] against the [[Empire of Austria|Austrians]], and Wrangel distinguished himself especially during the [[Brusilov Offensive]]. He was promoted to the rank of major general in January 1917 and took command of the 2nd Brigade of the Ussuri Cavalry Division, which was merged with other cavalry units to become the Consolidated Cavalry Corps in July that year. He was further decorated with the George Cross (4th degree) for his defense of the [[Zbruch River]] in the summer of 1917.\n[[File:\u0413\u0435\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0439\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043d \u0412\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442.jpg|thumb|140px|left|White propaganda poster, c. 1919]]\n\n== Russian Civil War==\nAfter the end of Russia's participation in the war, Wrangel resigned his commission and went to live at his [[dacha]] at [[Yalta]], in the [[Crimea]]. Arrested by the [[Bolsheviks]] at the end of 1917, he was released and escaped to [[Kiev]], where he joined [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]]'s [[Ukrainian State]]. However, it was soon apparent to him that the new government existed only because of the waning support of Germany, and in August 1918, he joined the anti-Bolshevik [[Volunteer Army]] based at [[Krasnodar|Yekaterinodar]], where he was given command of the 1st Cavalry Division and the rank of major general in the [[White movement]]. After the [[Second Kuban Campaign]] in late 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant general, and his division was raised to that of a [[army corps|corps]].\n\n[[File:Government of South Russia 1920 cropped.JPG|thumb|The [[Government of South Russia]] established in [[Sevastopol]], [[Crimea]] in April 1920]]\nAs an aggressive commander, he won a number of victories in the north of Caucasus. In January 1919, his military force was renamed to the [[Caucasus Volunteer Army]]. Wrangel soon clashed politically with [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] leader [[Anton Denikin]], who demanded a quick march on [[Moscow]]. Wrangel insisted that his forces should instead take [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]] first, to join up with the army of Admiral [[Aleksandr Kolchak]], [[Battle of Tsaritsyn|which his troops accomplished]] on June 30, 1919, after three previous attempts by [[Pyotr Krasnov]] had failed in 1918.\n\nWrangel gained a reputation as a skilled and just administrator, who, unlike some other White Army generals, did not tolerate lawlessness or looting by his troops.<ref>Lincoln, p. 430.</ref> However, after he was unable to join forces with Admiral Kolchak and at the insistence of Denikin, he led his forces north towards Moscow on a [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|failed attempt by the Whites to take it]] in autumn 1919. Continuing disagreement with Denikin led to his removal from command, and Wrangel departed for exile to [[Constantinople]] on February 8, 1920.[[File:\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043b\u044c\u0446\u044b \u0432 \u00ab\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044f\u00bb \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0435.jpg|thumb|Wrangel, Metropolitan [[Antony (Khrapovitsky)|Anthony]], Metropolitan [[Anastasius (Gribanovsky)|Anastasius]] and other Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Yugoslavia, 1927]]\n[[File:General Wrangel Statue.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Statue of Wrangel in [[Sremski Karlovci]]]]\n\nHowever, Denikin was forced to resign on March 20, 1920, and a military committee, led by General [[Abram Dragomirov]] in [[Sevastopol]], asked for Wrangel's return as [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the White forces in Crimea. He assumed that post on April 4, 1920, at the head of the ''[[Army of Wrangel|Russian Army]]'', and he put forth a coalition government that attempted to institute sweeping reforms (including land reforms).<ref>Luckett, pp. 359-360.</ref> He also recognized and established relations with the new (and short-lived) anti-Bolshevik independent republics of [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nHowever, by that stage in the [[Russian Civil War]], such measures were too late, and the White movement was rapidly losing support, both domestically and overseas.\nWrangel is immortalized by the nickname of \"Black Baron\" in the marching song ''[[The Red Army is the Strongest]]'', composed as a rallying call for a final effort on the part of the Bolsheviks to end the war. The song was immensely popular in the early Soviet Union in the 1920s.\n\n[[File:Wrangel in Sevastopol, 1920.jpg|left|thumb|210px|At a prayer vigil upon accepting command.]]\n\nAfter defeats in which he lost half his standing army and facing [[Northern Taurida Operation|defeat in Northern Tavria]] and [[Siege of Perekop (1920)|in the Crimea]], Wrangel organised [[Evacuation of the Crimea (1920)|a mass evacuation]] on the shores of the [[Black Sea]].<ref>Luckett, pp. 381ff.</ref> Wrangel gave every officer, soldier and civilian the choice to evacuate and go with him into the unknown or to remain in Russia and face the wrath of the Red Army.<ref name=rbth/> Wrangel evacuated the White forces from the Crimea in 1920; the remnants of the Russian Imperial Navy that became known as [[Wrangel's fleet]].

The [[Baltic nobility|Baltic German noble]] [[Wrangel family]] was part of the [[Uradel]] (old nobility), the family was of [[Danish people|Dano]]-[[Germans|German]] origin, but their origin place was largely unknown. The family first appeared in [[Virumaa|Wierland]] (now Virumaa) of [[Duchy of Estonia (1219\u20131346)|Danish Estonia]] around the 13th Century. Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel was only distantly related to the famed Arctic explorer [[Ferdinand von Wrangel]] and the Prussian Generalfeldmarschall [[Friedrich von Wrangel]]. \n\n==Early life==\nWhile he was of [[Baltic German]] roots, he was a [[Russian Orthodox]] because his [[Lutheran]] grandfather, Baron Hans Georg Hermann von Wrangel, married a Russian woman, and all of his descendants were baptized Orthodox, creating a Russian branch of the family.\n\nAfter graduating from the [[Rostov]] Technical High School in 1896 and the Institute of Mining Engineering in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1901, Wrangel volunteered for the prestigious [[Russian Imperial Guard|Life Guards]] [[cavalry]] and was commissioned a reserve [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] in 1902 after graduating from the Nikolaev Cavalry School. He soon resigned his commission and travelled to [[Irkutsk]], where he was assigned to special missions by the [[Governor-General]].\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:Eristov & Wrangel. Kauschen 1914.jpg|thumb|Wrangel and Prince [[Simon Sidamon-Eristoff|Sidamon-Eristavi]] at a captured German cannon in 1914]]\nAt the start of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in February 1904, he re-enlisted and was assigned to the 2nd Regiment of the [[Baikal Cossacks|Transbaikal Cossack Corps]]. In December 1904, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. \n\nAfter the war ended, in January 1906, he was reassigned to the 55th Finland Dragoon Regiment, which, under General A. N. Orlov, took part in pacifying rebels in Siberia. In 1907, he returned to the Life Guards Cavalry Regiment. In 1908, he married Olga Mikhaylovna Ivanenko in St. Petersburg, and they produced two sons and two daughters.<ref>[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=166380230 New York Times obituary of his last surviving child]</ref> Wrangel graduated from the [[General Staff Academy (Imperial Russia)|Nicholas Imperial General Staff Academy]] in 1910 and the Cavalry Officers' School in 1911.\n\nWith the start of [[World War I]], Wrangel was promoted to captain and assigned command of a cavalry squadron. On October 13, 1914, he became one of the first Russian officers to be awarded the [[Order of St. George]] (4th degree) in the war, the highest military decoration of the Russian Empire. In December 1914, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. In October 1915, Wrangel was transferred to the [[Southwestern Front (Russian Empire)|Southwestern Front]] and was appointed commander of the 1st Regiment of the Transbaikal Cossacks.\n\nThe unit was very active in [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]] against the [[Empire of Austria|Austrians]], and Wrangel distinguished himself especially during the [[Brusilov Offensive]]. He was promoted to the rank of major general in January 1917 and took command of the 2nd Brigade of the Ussuri Cavalry Division, which was merged with other cavalry units to become the Consolidated Cavalry Corps in July that year. He was further decorated with the George Cross (4th degree) for his defense of the [[Zbruch River]] in the summer of 1917.\n[[File:\u0413\u0435\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0439\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043d \u0412\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442.jpg|thumb|140px|left|White propaganda poster, c. 1919]]\n\n== Russian Civil War==\nAfter the end of Russia's participation in the war, Wrangel resigned his commission and went to live at his [[dacha]] at [[Yalta]], in the [[Crimea]]. Arrested by the [[Bolsheviks]] at the end of 1917, he was released and escaped to [[Kiev]], where he joined [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]]'s [[Ukrainian State]]. However, it was soon apparent to him that the new government existed only because of the waning support of Germany, and in August 1918, he joined the anti-Bolshevik [[Volunteer Army]] based at [[Krasnodar|Yekaterinodar]], where he was given command of the 1st Cavalry Division and the rank of major general in the [[White movement]]. After the [[Second Kuban Campaign]] in late 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant general, and his division was raised to that of a [[army corps|corps]].\n\n[[File:Government of South Russia 1920 cropped.JPG|thumb|The [[Government of South Russia]] established in [[Sevastopol]], [[Crimea]] in April 1920]]\nAs an aggressive commander, he won a number of victories in the north of Caucasus. In January 1919, his military force was renamed to the [[Caucasus Volunteer Army]]. Wrangel soon clashed politically with [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] leader [[Anton Denikin]], who demanded a quick march on [[Moscow]]. Wrangel insisted that his forces should instead take [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]] first, to join up with the army of Admiral [[Aleksandr Kolchak]], [[Battle of Tsaritsyn|which his troops accomplished]] on June 30, 1919, after three previous attempts by [[Pyotr Krasnov]] had failed in 1918.\n\nWrangel gained a reputation as a skilled and just administrator, who, unlike some other White Army generals, did not tolerate lawlessness or looting by his troops.<ref>Lincoln, p. 430.</ref> However, after he was unable to join forces with Admiral Kolchak and at the insistence of Denikin, he led his forces north towards Moscow on a [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|failed attempt by the Whites to take it]] in autumn 1919. Continuing disagreement with Denikin led to his removal from command, and Wrangel departed for exile to [[Constantinople]] on February 8, 1920.[[File:\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043b\u044c\u0446\u044b \u0432 \u00ab\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044f\u00bb \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0435.jpg|thumb|Wrangel, Metropolitan [[Antony (Khrapovitsky)|Anthony]], Metropolitan [[Anastasius (Gribanovsky)|Anastasius]] and other Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in Yugoslavia, 1927]]\n[[File:General Wrangel Statue.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Statue of Wrangel in [[Sremski Karlovci]]]]\n\nHowever, Denikin was forced to resign on March 20, 1920, and a military committee, led by General [[Abram Dragomirov]] in [[Sevastopol]], asked for Wrangel's return as [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the White forces in Crimea. He assumed that post on April 4, 1920, at the head of the ''[[Army of Wrangel|Russian Army]]'', and he put forth a coalition government that attempted to institute sweeping reforms (including land reforms).<ref>Luckett, pp. 359-360.</ref> He also recognized and established relations with the new (and short-lived) anti-Bolshevik independent republics of [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nHowever, by that stage in the [[Russian Civil War]], such measures were too late, and the White movement was rapidly losing support, both domestically and overseas.\nWrangel is immortalized by the nickname of \"Black Baron\" in the marching song ''[[The Red Army is the Strongest]]'', composed as a rallying call for a final effort on the part of the Bolsheviks to end the war.
