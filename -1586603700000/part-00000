The King was called the castle in honour of his father, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high|W\u0142adys\u0142aw I \u0141okietek]], calling it ''Father by the Rock'' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Ociec u ska\u0142y''). In 1665 the stronghold was taken over by the [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], which they partially burned and deconstructed.

According to [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]], Masaccio was the best painter of his generation because of his skill at imitating nature, recreating lifelike figures and movements as well as a convincing sense of three-dimensionality.<ref>Giorgio Vasari, ''Le Vite de' piu eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori,'' ed. Gaetano Milanesi, Florence, 1906, II, 287\u2013288.</ref> He employed nudes and foreshortenings in his figures. This had seldom been done before him.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Vasari, Giorgio, \"The Lives of the Artists\" Translated by Julia Conaway Bondanella and Peter Bondanella, Oxford World Classics.</ref>\n\nThe name Masaccio is a humorous version of Maso (short for Tommaso), meaning \"clumsy\" or \"messy\" Tom. The name may have been created to distinguish him from his principal collaborator, also called Maso, who came to be known as [[Masolino]] (\"little/delicate Tom\").\n\nDespite his brief career, he had a profound influence on other artists and is considered to have started the Early Italian Renaissance in painting with his works in the mid- and late-1420s. He was one of the first to use linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in his painting, employing techniques such as [[vanishing point]] in art for the first time. He moved away from the [[International Gothic]] style and elaborate ornamentation of artists like [[Gentile da Fabriano]] to a more naturalistic mode that employed perspective and [[chiaroscuro]] for greater [[realism (arts)|realism]].\n\nMasaccio died at the age of twenty-six and little is known about the exact circumstances of his death.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/jul/07/masacciothegreatestrenaissa The Guardian, ''Masaccio, the old master who died young'']</ref> Upon hearing of Masaccio\u2019s death, [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] said: \"We have suffered a great loss.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Early life==\nMasaccio was born to Giovanni di Simone Cassai and Jacopa di Martinozzo in Castel San Giovanni di Altura, now [[San Giovanni Valdarno]] (today part of the [[province of Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]]).<ref>John T. Spike, ''Masaccio,'' New York: 1996, 21\u201364, and Diane Cole Ahl, ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' Cambridge, 2002, 3\u20135.</ref> His father was a [[notary]] and his mother the daughter of an innkeeper of [[Barberino di Mugello]], a town a few miles north of [[Florence]]. His family name, Cassai, comes from the trade of his paternal grandfather Simone and granduncle Lorenzo, who were carpenters/cabinet makers (''casse'', hence ''cassai''). Masaccio's father died in 1406, when he was only five; later that same year a brother was born, named Giovanni (1406\u20131486) after his father. He also was to become a painter, with the nickname of [[Giovanni di ser Giovanni Guidi|lo Scheggia]] meaning \"the splinter.\"<ref>On Giovanni's career, see Luciano Bellosi and Margaret Haines, ''Lo Scheggia,'' Florence, 1999.</ref> In 1412 Monna Jacopa married an elderly [[apothecary]], Tedesco di maestro Feo, who already had several daughters, one of whom grew up to marry the only other documented painter from Castel San Giovanni, Mariotto di Cristofano (1393\u20131457).\nThere is no evidence for Masaccio's artistic education,<ref>Vasari (II, 295) implies that Masolino was Masaccio's teacher, but the earliest known work by Masaccio (the ''San Giovenale Triptych'') is painted in a style so different from Masolino's approach that it is hard to tie the two together (Luciano Berti, \"Masaccio 1422,\" ''Commentari'' 12 (1961) 84\u2013107.  Scholars cannot agree on any teacher for the young artist, though several names (Mariotto di Cristofano, Bicci di Lorenzo, Niccolo di ser Lapo) have been put forward. Recently scholars have also suggested that he may have trained as a manuscript illuminator. Roberto Bellucci and Cecilia Frosinini, \"Masaccio:  Technique in Context,\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' ed. Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 105\u2013122.</ref>  however Renaissance painters traditionally began an apprenticeship with an established master around the age of 12. Masaccio would likely have had to move to Florence to receive his training, but he was not documented in the city until he joined the painters guild (the Arte de' Medici e Speziali) as an independent master on January 7, 1422, signing as \"Masus S. Johannis Simonis pictor populi S. Nicholae de Florentia.\"\n\n==First works==\nThe first works attributed to Masaccio are the [[San Giovenale Triptych]] (1422), now in the Museum of Cascia di Reggello near Florence, and the [[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne (Masaccio)|''Virgin and Child with Saint Anne'']] (Sant'Anna Metterza) (c. 1424) at the [[Uffizi]]. [[Image:San Giovenale Masaccio.jpg|thumb|360px|''[[San Giovenale Triptych]]'' (1422)]] The San Giovenale altarpiece was discovered in 1961 in the church of San Giovenale at Cascia di Reggello, very close to Masaccio's hometown.  It depicts the Virgin and Child with angels in the central panel, Sts. Bartholomew and Blaise on the left panel, and Sts. Juvenal (i.e. San Giovenale) and Anthony Abbot in the right panel.  The painting has lost much of its original framing, and its surface is badly abraded.<ref>Roberto Bellucci and Cecilia Frosinini, \"The San Giovenale Altarpiece,\" in ''The Panel Paintings of Masolino and Masaccio,'' ed. Carl Brandon Strehlke, Milan, 2002, 69\u201379; Dillian Gordon, \"The Altarpieces of Masaccio,\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' ed. Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 124\u2013126.</ref>  Nevertheless, Masaccio's concern to suggest three-dimensionality through volumetric figures and foreshortened forms is apparent, and stands as a revival of Giotto's approach, rather than a continuation of contemporary trends. [[Image:Masolino 008.jpg|thumb|left|Masolino & Masaccio, ''[[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne (Masaccio)|Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]]'' (c. 1424), Uffizi]] The second work was perhaps Masaccio's first collaboration with the older and already-renowned artist, [[Masolino|Masolino da Panicale]] (1383/4\u2013c. 1436). The circumstances of the two artists' collaboration are unclear; since Masolino was considerably older, it seems likely that he brought Masaccio under his wing, but the division of hands in the ''Virgin and Child with Saint Anne'' is so marked that it is hard to see the older artist as the controlling figure in this commission.<ref>Roberto Longhi, \"Fatti di Masolino e di Masaccio,\" ''Critica d'arte'' 25-6 (1940) 145\u2013191.</ref>  Masolino is believed to have painted the figure of St. Anne and the angels that hold the cloth of honor behind her, while Masaccio painted the more important Virgin and Child on their throne.  Masolino's figures are delicate, graceful and somewhat flat, while Masaccio's are solid and hefty.\n\n==Maturity==\nIn Florence, Masaccio could study the works of [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] and become friends with [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and [[Donatello]]. According to [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]], at their prompting in 1423 Masaccio travelled to Rome with Masolino: from that point he was freed of all [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] influence, as seen in his [[altarpiece]] for the Carmelite Church in [[Pisa]].  The traces of influences from ancient Roman and Greek art that are present in some of Masaccio's works presumably originated from this trip: they should also have been present in a lost ''Sagra'', (today known through some drawings, including one by [[Michelangelo]]), a fresco commissioned for the consecration ceremony of the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine di Firenze|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in Florence (April 19, 1422). It was destroyed when the church's cloister was rebuilt at the end of the 16th century.\n\n[[Image:Masaccio7.jpg|thumb|400px|''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|The Tribute Money]]'', fresco in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence]]\n\n==Brancacci Chapel==\nIn 1424, the \"duo preciso e noto\" (\"well and known duo\") of Masaccio and Masolino was commissioned by the powerful and wealthy Felice Brancacci to execute a cycle of frescoes for the [[Brancacci Chapel]] in the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine di Firenze|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in Florence. With the two artists probably working simultaneously, the painting began around 1425, but for unknown reasons the chapel was left unfinished, and was completed by Filippino Lippi in the 1480s. The iconography of the fresco decoration is somewhat unusual; while the majority of the frescoes represent the life of St. Peter, two scenes, on either side of the threshold of the chapel space, depict the temptation and expulsion of Adam and Eve.  As a whole, the frescoes recount the life of St Peter as if it were the story of salvation.<ref>Umberto Baldini and Ornella Casazza, ''The Brancacci Chapel'', New York, 1990; Diane Cole Ahl, \"The Brancacci Chapel,\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio'', ed. Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 138\u2013157; J.T. Spike, \u201cThe Brancacci Code,\u201d in ''Watching Art: Writings in Honor of James Beck'', ed. L. Catterson and M. Zucker (Todi: Ediart, 2006), pp. 247\u201354.</ref>\nThe style of Masaccio's scenes shows the influence of Giotto especially. Figures are large, heavy, and solid; emotions are expressed through faces and gestures; and there is a strong impression of naturalism throughout the paintings. Unlike Giotto, however, Masaccio uses linear and atmospheric perspective, directional light, and ''chiaroscuro,'' which is the representation of form through light and color without outlines. As a result, his frescoes are even more convincingly lifelike than those of his trecento predecessor.\n\n===Works of the chapel===\n[[Image:Masaccio-TheExpulsionOfAdamAndEveFromEden-Restoration.jpg|thumb|left|When it was cleaned in the 1980s, Masaccio's [[fresco]] of ''[[The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (Masaccio)|The Expulsion]]'' (1426\u20131427) lost the added fig leaves.]]\n[[The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (Masaccio)|''The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden'']], depicts a distressed [[Adam and Eve]], chased from the garden by a threatening angel.  Adam covers his entire face to express his shame, while Eve's shame requires her to cover certain areas of her body. The fresco had a huge influence on [[Michelangelo]] and his work. Another major work is ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|The Tribute Money]]'' in which [[Jesus]] and the Apostles are depicted as neo-classical archetypes. Scholars have often noted that the shadows of the figures all fall away from the chapel window, as if the figures are lit by it; this is an added stroke of verisimilitude and further tribute to Masaccio's innovative genius.\nIn the ''Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus'', he painted a pavement in perspective, framed by large buildings to obtain a three-dimensional space in which the figures are placed proportionate to their surroundings. In this he was a pioneer in applying the newly discovered rules of perspective.\n\nIn September 1425 Masolino left the work and went to [[Hungary]]. It is not known if this was because of money quarrels with Felice or an artistic divergence with Masaccio. It has also been supposed that Masolino planned this trip from the very beginning, and needed a close collaborator who could continue the work after his departure.  But Masaccio left the frescoes [[unfinished work|unfinished]] in 1426 in order to respond to other commissions, probably coming from the same patron. However, it has also been suggested that the declining finances of Felice Brancacci were insufficient to pay for any further work, so the painter sought work elsewhere.\n[[Image:Filippino Lippi 011.jpg|thumb|right|''Raising of the Son of Theophilus of Antioch'']]\nMasaccio returned in 1427 to work again in the Carmine, beginning the ''Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus'', but apparently left it, too, unfinished, though it has also been suggested that the painting was severely damaged later in the century because it contained portraits of the Brancacci family, at that time excoriated as enemies of the [[Medici]].<ref>Casazza, Ornella. 1990. ''Masaccio and the Brancacci Chapel''. Antella, Firenze, Italy: Scala. p. 46. {{OCLC|25093965}}</ref> This painting was either restored or completed more than fifty years later by [[Filippino Lippi]].\nSome of the scenes completed by Masaccio and Masolino were lost in a fire in 1771; we know about them only through Vasari's biography. The surviving parts were extensively blackened by smoke. In the twentieth century, the removal of marble slabs covering two areas of the paintings revealed the original appearance of the work.<ref>Casazza, Ornella. 1990. ''Masaccio and the Brancacci Chapel''. Antella, Firenze, Italy: Scala. p. 15. {{OCLC|25093965}}</ref>\n\n==''Pisa Altarpiece''==\nOn February 19, 1426 Masaccio was commissioned by Giuliano di Colino degli Scarsi da San Giusto, for the sum of 80 florins, to paint a major altarpiece, the ''[[Pisa Altarpiece]]'', for his chapel in the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Pisa|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in [[Pisa]]. The work was dismantled and dispersed in the 18th century, and only eleven of about twenty original panels have been rediscovered in various collections around the world.<ref>Jill Dunkerton and Dillian Gordon, \"The Pisa Altarpiece\",  in ''The Panel Paintings of Masolino and Masaccio:  The Role of Technique,'' ed. Carl Brandon Strehlke, Milan, 2002, 89\u2013109.</ref> The central panel of the altarpiece (''[[The Madonna and Child (Masaccio)|The Madonna and Child]]'') is now in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London. Although it is very damaged, the work features a sculptural and human Madonna as well as a convincing perspectival depiction of her throne. Masaccio probably worked on it entirely in Pisa, shuttling back and forth to Florence, where he was still working on the Brancacci Chapel. In these years, [[Donatello]] was also working in Pisa at a monument for Cardinal Rinaldo Brancacci, to be sent to [[Naples]]. It is suggested that Masaccio's first ventures in plasticity and perspective were based on Donatello's sculpture, before he could study [[Brunelleschi]]'s more scientific approach to perspective.\n\n==''Holy Trinity''==\n[[Image:Masaccio trinity.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'', in full: ''Trinity with the Virgin, Saint John the Evangelist, and Donors'' (c. 1427) \u2013 Fresco, [[Santa Maria Novella, Florence]]]]Around 1427 Masaccio won a prestigious commission to produce a ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' for the Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]]. No contemporary documents record the patron of the fresco, but recently references to ownership of a tomb at the foot of the fresco have been found in the records of the Berti family of the Santa Maria Novella Quarter of Florence; this working-class family expressed a long-standing devotion to the Trinity, and may well have commissioned Masaccio's painting.<ref>Rita Maria Comanducci, \"'L'altare Nostro de la Trinit\u00e0': Masaccio's Trinity and the Berti Family,\" ''The Burlington Magazine,'' 145 (2003) 14\u201321.  Most scholars had thought that the Lenzi family commissioned the fresco:  Ugo Procacci, \"Nuove testimonianze su Masaccio,\" ''Commentari'', 27 (1976) 233-4; Rona Goffen, ''Masaccio's \"Trinity,\"'' Cambridge, 1998; Timothy Verdon, \"Masaccio's ''Trinity,''\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' ed. Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 158\u2013160.</ref> Probably it is the male patron who is represented to the left of the Virgin in the painting, while his wife is right of St. John the Evangelist. The fresco, considered by many to be Masaccio's masterwork, is the earliest surviving painting to use systematic linear perspective, possibly devised by Masaccio with the assistance of Brunelleschi.<ref>https://www.laetitiana.co.uk/single-post/2018/03/11/Masaccio-1401-28</ref>\n\nAccording to the reconstruction<ref name=\"Deimling\">B. Deimling, Early Renaissance Art in Florence and Central Italy, in R. Tolman (ed.),  ''The Art of Italian Renaissance'', Konemann,  1995, p. 244-246</ref> Masaccio started by producing a rough drawing of the composition and perspective lines on the wall. The drawing was covered with fresh plaster for making the fresco. To ensure the precise transfer of the perspective lines from the sketch to the plaster, Masaccio inserted a nail in at the [[vanishing point]] under the base of the cross and attached strings to it, which he pressed in (or carved into) the plaster. The marks of the preparatory works are still visible.\n\nThe sacred figures and the donors are represented above an image of a skeleton lying on a sarcophagus.  An inscription seemingly carved into the wall above the skeleton reads:  \"Io fui gia quel che voi siete e quel ch'io sono voi anco sarete\" (I once was what now you are and what I am, you shall yet be).  This skeleton is at once a reference to Adam, whose sin brought humans to death and a reminder to viewers that their time on earth is transitory.  It is only through faith in the Trinity, the fresco suggests, that one overcomes this death.<ref>Alessandro Cortesi, \"Una lettura teologica,\" in ''La Trinit\u00e0 di Masaccio:  il restauro dell'anno duemila,'' ed.

According to [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]], Masaccio was the best painter of his generation because of his skill at imitating nature, recreating lifelike figures and movements as well as a convincing sense of three-dimensionality.<ref>Giorgio Vasari, ''Le Vite de' piu eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori,'' ed. Gaetano Milanesi, Florence, 1906, II, 287\u2013288.</ref> He employed nudes and foreshortenings in his figures. This had seldom been done before him.<ref>Vasari, Giorgio, \"The Lives of the Artists\" Translated by Julia Conaway Bondanella and Peter Bondanella, Oxford World Classics.</ref>\n\nThe name Masaccio is a humorous version of Maso (short for Tommaso), meaning \"clumsy\" or \"messy\" Tom. The name may have been created to distinguish him from his principal collaborator, also called Maso, who came to be known as [[Masolino]] (\"little/delicate Tom\").\n\nDespite his brief career, he had a profound influence on other artists and is considered to have started the Early Italian Renaissance in painting with his works in the mid- and late-1420s. He was one of the first to use linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in his painting, employing techniques such as [[vanishing point]] in art for the first time. He moved away from the [[International Gothic]] style and elaborate ornamentation of artists like [[Gentile da Fabriano]] to a more naturalistic mode that employed perspective and [[chiaroscuro]] for greater [[realism (arts)|realism]].\n\nMasaccio died at the age of twenty-six and little is known about the exact circumstances of his death.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/jul/07/masacciothegreatestrenaissa The Guardian, ''Masaccio, the old master who died young'']</ref> Upon hearing of Masaccio\u2019s death, [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] said: \"We have suffered a great loss.\" <ref>Vasari, Giorgio, \"The Lives of the Artists\" Translated by Julia Conaway Bondanella and Peter Bondanella, Oxford World Classics.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMasaccio was born to Giovanni di Simone Cassai and Jacopa di Martinozzo in Castel San Giovanni di Altura, now [[San Giovanni Valdarno]] (today part of the [[province of Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]]).<ref>John T. Spike, ''Masaccio,'' New York: 1996, 21\u201364, and Diane Cole Ahl, ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' Cambridge, 2002, 3\u20135.</ref> His father was a [[notary]] and his mother the daughter of an innkeeper of [[Barberino di Mugello]], a town a few miles north of [[Florence]]. His family name, Cassai, comes from the trade of his paternal grandfather Simone and granduncle Lorenzo, who were carpenters/cabinet makers (''casse'', hence ''cassai''). Masaccio's father died in 1406, when he was only five; later that same year a brother was born, named Giovanni (1406\u20131486) after his father. He also was to become a painter, with the nickname of [[Giovanni di ser Giovanni Guidi|lo Scheggia]] meaning \"the splinter.\"<ref>On Giovanni's career, see Luciano Bellosi and Margaret Haines, ''Lo Scheggia,'' Florence, 1999.</ref> In 1412 Monna Jacopa married an elderly [[apothecary]], Tedesco di maestro Feo, who already had several daughters, one of whom grew up to marry the only other documented painter from Castel San Giovanni, Mariotto di Cristofano (1393\u20131457).\nThere is no evidence for Masaccio's artistic education,<ref>Vasari (II, 295) implies that Masolino was Masaccio's teacher, but the earliest known work by Masaccio (the ''San Giovenale Triptych'') is painted in a style so different from Masolino's approach that it is hard to tie the two together (Luciano Berti, \"Masaccio 1422,\" ''Commentari'' 12 (1961) 84\u2013107.  Scholars cannot agree on any teacher for the young artist, though several names (Mariotto di Cristofano, Bicci di Lorenzo, Niccolo di ser Lapo) have been put forward. Recently scholars have also suggested that he may have trained as a manuscript illuminator. Roberto Bellucci and Cecilia Frosinini, \"Masaccio:  Technique in Context,\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' ed. Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 105\u2013122.</ref>  however Renaissance painters traditionally began an apprenticeship with an established master around the age of 12. Masaccio would likely have had to move to Florence to receive his training, but he was not documented in the city until he joined the painters guild (the Arte de' Medici e Speziali) as an independent master on January 7, 1422, signing as \"Masus S. Johannis Simonis pictor populi S. Nicholae de Florentia.\"\n\n==First works==\nThe first works attributed to Masaccio are the [[San Giovenale Triptych]] (1422), now in the Museum of Cascia di Reggello near Florence, and the [[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne (Masaccio)|''Virgin and Child with Saint Anne'']] (Sant'Anna Metterza) (c. 1424) at the [[Uffizi]]. [[Image:San Giovenale Masaccio.jpg|thumb|360px|''[[San Giovenale Triptych]]'' (1422)]] The San Giovenale altarpiece was discovered in 1961 in the church of San Giovenale at Cascia di Reggello, very close to Masaccio's hometown.  It depicts the Virgin and Child with angels in the central panel, Sts. Bartholomew and Blaise on the left panel, and Sts. Juvenal (i.e. San Giovenale) and Anthony Abbot in the right panel.  The painting has lost much of its original framing, and its surface is badly abraded.<ref>Roberto Bellucci and Cecilia Frosinini, \"The San Giovenale Altarpiece,\" in ''The Panel Paintings of Masolino and Masaccio,'' ed. Carl Brandon Strehlke, Milan, 2002, 69\u201379; Dillian Gordon, \"The Altarpieces of Masaccio,\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' ed. Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 124\u2013126.</ref>  Nevertheless, Masaccio's concern to suggest three-dimensionality through volumetric figures and foreshortened forms is apparent, and stands as a revival of Giotto's approach, rather than a continuation of contemporary trends. [[Image:Masolino 008.jpg|thumb|left|Masolino & Masaccio, ''[[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne (Masaccio)|Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]]'' (c. 1424), Uffizi]] The second work was perhaps Masaccio's first collaboration with the older and already-renowned artist, [[Masolino|Masolino da Panicale]] (1383/4\u2013c. 1436). The circumstances of the two artists' collaboration are unclear; since Masolino was considerably older, it seems likely that he brought Masaccio under his wing, but the division of hands in the ''Virgin and Child with Saint Anne'' is so marked that it is hard to see the older artist as the controlling figure in this commission.<ref>Roberto Longhi, \"Fatti di Masolino e di Masaccio,\" ''Critica d'arte'' 25-6 (1940) 145\u2013191.</ref>  Masolino is believed to have painted the figure of St. Anne and the angels that hold the cloth of honor behind her, while Masaccio painted the more important Virgin and Child on their throne.  Masolino's figures are delicate, graceful and somewhat flat, while Masaccio's are solid and hefty.\n\n==Maturity==\nIn Florence, Masaccio could study the works of [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] and become friends with [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and [[Donatello]]. According to [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]], at their prompting in 1423 Masaccio travelled to Rome with Masolino: from that point he was freed of all [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] influence, as seen in his [[altarpiece]] for the Carmelite Church in [[Pisa]].  The traces of influences from ancient Roman and Greek art that are present in some of Masaccio's works presumably originated from this trip: they should also have been present in a lost ''Sagra'', (today known through some drawings, including one by [[Michelangelo]]), a fresco commissioned for the consecration ceremony of the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine di Firenze|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in Florence (April 19, 1422). It was destroyed when the church's cloister was rebuilt at the end of the 16th century.\n\n[[Image:Masaccio7.jpg|thumb|400px|''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|The Tribute Money]]'', fresco in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence]]\n\n==Brancacci Chapel==\nIn 1424, the \"duo preciso e noto\" (\"well and known duo\") of Masaccio and Masolino was commissioned by the powerful and wealthy Felice Brancacci to execute a cycle of frescoes for the [[Brancacci Chapel]] in the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine di Firenze|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in Florence. With the two artists probably working simultaneously, the painting began around 1425, but for unknown reasons the chapel was left unfinished, and was completed by Filippino Lippi in the 1480s. The iconography of the fresco decoration is somewhat unusual; while the majority of the frescoes represent the life of St. Peter, two scenes, on either side of the threshold of the chapel space, depict the temptation and expulsion of Adam and Eve.  As a whole, the frescoes recount the life of St Peter as if it were the story of salvation.<ref>Umberto Baldini and Ornella Casazza, ''The Brancacci Chapel'', New York, 1990; Diane Cole Ahl, \"The Brancacci Chapel,\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio'', ed. Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 138\u2013157; J.T. Spike, \u201cThe Brancacci Code,\u201d in ''Watching Art: Writings in Honor of James Beck'', ed. L. Catterson and M. Zucker (Todi: Ediart, 2006), pp. 247\u201354.</ref>\nThe style of Masaccio's scenes shows the influence of Giotto especially. Figures are large, heavy, and solid; emotions are expressed through faces and gestures; and there is a strong impression of naturalism throughout the paintings. Unlike Giotto, however, Masaccio uses linear and atmospheric perspective, directional light, and ''chiaroscuro,'' which is the representation of form through light and color without outlines. As a result, his frescoes are even more convincingly lifelike than those of his trecento predecessor.\n\n===Works of the chapel===\n[[Image:Masaccio-TheExpulsionOfAdamAndEveFromEden-Restoration.jpg|thumb|left|When it was cleaned in the 1980s, Masaccio's [[fresco]] of ''[[The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (Masaccio)|The Expulsion]]'' (1426\u20131427) lost the added fig leaves.]]\n[[The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (Masaccio)|''The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden'']], depicts a distressed [[Adam and Eve]], chased from the garden by a threatening angel.  Adam covers his entire face to express his shame, while Eve's shame requires her to cover certain areas of her body. The fresco had a huge influence on [[Michelangelo]] and his work. Another major work is ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|The Tribute Money]]'' in which [[Jesus]] and the Apostles are depicted as neo-classical archetypes. Scholars have often noted that the shadows of the figures all fall away from the chapel window, as if the figures are lit by it; this is an added stroke of verisimilitude and further tribute to Masaccio's innovative genius.\nIn the ''Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus'', he painted a pavement in perspective, framed by large buildings to obtain a three-dimensional space in which the figures are placed proportionate to their surroundings. In this he was a pioneer in applying the newly discovered rules of perspective.\n\nOn September 1425 Masolino left the work and went to [[Hungary]]. It is not known if this was because of money quarrels with Felice or an artistic divergence with Masaccio. It has also been supposed that Masolino planned this trip from the very beginning, and needed a close collaborator who could continue the work after his departure.  But Masaccio left the frescoes [[unfinished work|unfinished]] in 1426 in order to respond to other commissions, probably coming from the same patron. However, it has also been suggested that the declining finances of Felice Brancacci were insufficient to pay for any further work, so the painter sought work elsewhere.\n[[Image:Filippino Lippi 011.jpg|thumb|right|''Raising of the Son of Theophilus of Antioch'']]\nMasaccio returned in 1427 to work again in the Carmine, beginning the ''Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus'', but apparently left it, too, unfinished, though it has also been suggested that the painting was severely damaged later in the century because it contained portraits of the Brancacci family, at that time excoriated as enemies of the [[Medici]].<ref>Casazza, Ornella. 1990. ''Masaccio and the Brancacci Chapel''. Antella, Firenze, Italy: Scala. p. 46. {{OCLC|25093965}}</ref> This painting was either restored or completed more than fifty years later by [[Filippino Lippi]].\nSome of the scenes completed by Masaccio and Masolino were lost in a fire in 1771; we know about them only through Vasari's biography. The surviving parts were extensively blackened by smoke. In the twentieth century, the removal of marble slabs covering two areas of the paintings revealed the original appearance of the work.<ref>Casazza, Ornella. 1990. ''Masaccio and the Brancacci Chapel''. Antella, Firenze, Italy: Scala. p. 15. {{OCLC|25093965}}</ref>\n\n==''Pisa Altarpiece''==\nOn February 19, 1426 Masaccio was commissioned by Giuliano di Colino degli Scarsi da San Giusto, for the sum of 80 florins, to paint a major altarpiece, the ''[[Pisa Altarpiece]]'', for his chapel in the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Pisa|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in [[Pisa]]. The work was dismantled and dispersed in the 18th century, and only eleven of about twenty original panels have been rediscovered in various collections around the world.<ref>Jill Dunkerton and Dillian Gordon, \"The Pisa Altarpiece\",  in ''The Panel Paintings of Masolino and Masaccio:  The Role of Technique,'' ed. Carl Brandon Strehlke, Milan, 2002, 89\u2013109.</ref> The central panel of the altarpiece (''[[The Madonna and Child (Masaccio)|The Madonna and Child]]'') is now in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London. Although it is very damaged, the work features a sculptural and human Madonna as well as a convincing perspectival depiction of her throne. Masaccio probably worked on it entirely in Pisa, shuttling back and forth to Florence, where he was still working on the Brancacci Chapel. In these years, [[Donatello]] was also working in Pisa at a monument for Cardinal Rinaldo Brancacci, to be sent to [[Naples]]. It is suggested that Masaccio's first ventures in plasticity and perspective were based on Donatello's sculpture, before he could study [[Brunelleschi]]'s more scientific approach to perspective.\n\n==''Holy Trinity''==\n[[Image:Masaccio trinity.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'', in full: ''Trinity with the Virgin, Saint John the Evangelist, and Donors'' (c. 1427) \u2013 Fresco, [[Santa Maria Novella, Florence]]]]Around 1427 Masaccio won a prestigious commission to produce a ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' for the Dominican church of [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]]. No contemporary documents record the patron of the fresco, but recently references to ownership of a tomb at the foot of the fresco have been found in the records of the Berti family of the Santa Maria Novella Quarter of Florence; this working-class family expressed a long-standing devotion to the Trinity, and may well have commissioned Masaccio's painting.<ref>Rita Maria Comanducci, \"'L'altare Nostro de la Trinit\u00e0': Masaccio's Trinity and the Berti Family,\" ''The Burlington Magazine,'' 145 (2003) 14\u201321.  Most scholars had thought that the Lenzi family commissioned the fresco:  Ugo Procacci, \"Nuove testimonianze su Masaccio,\" ''Commentari'', 27 (1976) 233-4; Rona Goffen, ''Masaccio's \"Trinity,\"'' Cambridge, 1998; Timothy Verdon, \"Masaccio's ''Trinity,''\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Masaccio,'' ed. Diane Cole Ahl, Cambridge, 2002, 158\u2013160.</ref> Probably it is the male patron who is represented to the left of the Virgin in the painting, while his wife is right of St. John the Evangelist. The fresco, considered by many to be Masaccio's masterwork, is the earliest surviving painting to use systematic linear perspective, possibly devised by Masaccio with the assistance of Brunelleschi.<ref>https://www.laetitiana.co.uk/single-post/2018/03/11/Masaccio-1401-28</ref>\n\nAccording to the reconstruction<ref name=\"Deimling\">B. Deimling, Early Renaissance Art in Florence and Central Italy, in R. Tolman (ed.),  ''The Art of Italian Renaissance'', Konemann,  1995, p. 244-246</ref> Masaccio started by producing a rough drawing of the composition and perspective lines on the wall. The drawing was covered with fresh plaster for making the fresco. To ensure the precise transfer of the perspective lines from the sketch to the plaster, Masaccio inserted a nail in at the [[vanishing point]] under the base of the cross and attached strings to it, which he pressed in (or carved into) the plaster. The marks of the preparatory works are still visible.\n\nThe sacred figures and the donors are represented above an image of a skeleton lying on a sarcophagus.  An inscription seemingly carved into the wall above the skeleton reads:  \"Io fui gia quel che voi siete e quel ch'io sono voi anco sarete\" (I once was what now you are and what I am, you shall yet be).  This skeleton is at once a reference to Adam, whose sin brought humans to death and a reminder to viewers that their time on earth is transitory.  It is only through faith in the Trinity, the fresco suggests, that one overcomes this death.<ref>Alessandro Cortesi, \"Una lettura teologica,\" in ''La Trinit\u00e0 di Masaccio:  il restauro dell'anno duemila,'' ed.

It has never been confirmed that Masaccio collaborated on that work, even though it is possible that he contributed to Masolino's polyptych for the altar of [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]] with his panel portraying ''[[St. Jerome and St. John the Baptist (Masaccio)|St. Jerome and St. John the Baptist]]'', now in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] of [[London]].

His influence is particularly notable in the works of Florentine minor masters, such as [[Andrea di Giusto]], [[Giovanni dal Ponte]], and others who attempted to replicate his glowing, lifelike forms.\n\n==Main works==\n[[File:Masaccio 031.jpg|thumb|[[Virgin Mary]] with [[pseudo-Arabic]] halo, by Masaccio (1426).<ref>Mack, p.66</ref>]]\n* [[San Giovenale Triptych]] (1422) <small> tempera on panel, 108 x 153&nbsp;cm, [[Cascia di Reggello]]</small>\n* ''[[Virgin and Child (Masaccio)|Madonna with Child]]'' (1424) <small> \u2013 tempera on panel, 24 x 18&nbsp;cm, [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]]</small>\n* ''[[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]]'' (1424\u20131425) <small> \u2013 tempera on panel, 175 x 103&nbsp;cm, [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]</small>\n* ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|The Tribute Money]]'' (1424\u20131428) <small> \u2013 fresco, 247 x 597&nbsp;cm, [[Brancacci Chapel]], [[Florence]]</small>\n* ''[[Holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' (1425\u20131428) <small> \u2013 fresco, 667 x 317&nbsp;cm, [[Santa Maria Novella]], [[Florence]] <br></small>\n* ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Masaccio)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'' (1425) \u2013 <small> wood, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]</small>\n* ''[[The Madonna and Child (Masaccio)|Madonna with Child and Angel]]'' (1426) <small> \u2013 oil on table, [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], [[London]] </small>\n* ''[[Crucifixion (Masaccio)|Crucifixion]]'' (c. 1426) <small> \u2013 tempera on panel, 83 x 63&nbsp;cm, [[Museo di Capodimonte]], [[Naples]] </small>\n* ''[[St. Paul (Masaccio)|St. Paul]]'' (1426) <small> \u2013 tempera on panel, 51 x 30&nbsp;cm, [[Museo Nazionale di Pisa|Museo Nazionale]], [[Pisa]]</small>\n* ''[[St. Jerome and St. John the Baptist (Masaccio)|St. Jerome and St. John the Baptist]]'' (c. 1426\u20131428) <small> panel, 114 x 55&nbsp;cm, [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], [[London]] </small>\n* ''[[Nativity (Masaccio)|Nativity (Berlin Tondo)]]'' (1427\u20131428) <small> \u2013 tempera on wood, diameter 56&nbsp;cm, [[Staatliche Museen]], [[Berlin]]</small>\n* ''[[St Andrew (Masaccio)|St Andrew]]'' <small> \u2013 oil on table, 51 x 31&nbsp;cm, [[Getty Center|J.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Its [[IUPAC name]] is  '''2,4,6-trinitrophenol''' ('''TNP'''). The name \"picric\" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (''pikros''), meaning \"bitter\", reflecting its bitter taste.  It is one of the most [[acid]]ic [[phenols]]. Like other highly [[nitration|nitrate]]d organic compounds, picric acid is an [[Explosive material|explosive]], hence its primary use. It has also been used in medicine (antiseptic, burn treatments) and dyes.\n\n== History ==\nPicric acid was probably first mentioned in the [[alchemical]] writings of [[Johann Rudolf Glauber]]. Initially, it was made by [[nitrating]] substances such as animal horn, [[silk]], [[indigo dye|indigo]], and natural [[resin]], the synthesis from indigo first being performed by [[Peter Woulfe]] in 1771.<ref>Peter Woulfe (1771) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nEJWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Experiments to shew the nature of aurum mosaicum,\"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''61''' :  114\u2013130.  See pages 127\u2013130:  \"A method of dying wool and silk, of a yellow colour, with indigo; and also with several other blue and red colouring substances.\" and \"Receipt for making the yellow dye.\" \u2014 where Woulfe treats indigo with nitric acid (\"acid of nitre\").</ref>  Picric acid was named by the French chemist [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] in 1841.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dumas |first1=J. |title=Quatri\u00e8me m\u00e9moire sur les types chimiques |journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique |date=1841 |volume=2 |pages=204-232 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hx3dxf&view=1up&seq=208 |series=3rd series |trans-title=Fourth memoir on chemical types |language=French}}  The German chemist [[Justus von Liebig]] had named picric acid ''Kohlenstickstoffs\u00e4ure'' (French: ''acide carboazotique''), but Dumas proposed \"picric acid\".  From p. 228:  ''\"C'est sous ce nom que j'ai d\u00e9sign\u00e9 l'acide carboazotique, \u2026 \"'' (It is by this name [i.e., picric acid] that I designated carboazotic acid, \u2026 )</ref>  Its synthesis from [[phenol]], and the correct determination of its formula, were successfully accomplished in 1841.<ref>Auguste Laurent (1841) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6568619q/f199.image.langEN \"Sur le ph\u00e9nyle et ses d\u00e9riv\u00e9s\"] (On phenol and its derivatives), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', series 3, '''3''' :  195\u2013228 ; see especially pages 221\u2013228.</ref> In 1799, French chemist Jean-Joseph Welter (1763\u20131852) produced picric acid by treating silk with nitric acid; he found that potassium picrate could explode.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welter |title=Sur quelques mati\u00e8res particuli\u00e8res, trouv\u00e9es dans les substances animals, trait\u00e9es par l'acide nitrique |journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique |date=1799 |volume=29 |pages=301-305 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000067418503&view=1up&seq=305 |series=1st series |trans-title=On some particular materials, found in animal substances, treated with nitric acid |language=French}} From p. 303:  ''\"Le lendemain je trouvai la capsule tapis\u00e9e de cristaux dor\u00e9s qui avoient la finesse de la soie, qui d\u00e9tonoient comme la poudre \u00e0 canon, et qui, \u00e0 mon avis, en auroient produit l'effet dans une arme \u00e0 feu.\"'' (The next day, I found the crucible covered with golden crystals which had the fineness of silk, which detonated like gun powder, and which, in my opinion, would produce the same effect in a firearm.)  Welter named picric acid ''amer'' (bitter):  from p. 304:  ''\" \u2026 je nommerai ''amer''.\"'' ( \u2026 I will name it \"bitter\".)</ref>  Not until 1830 did chemists think to use picric acid as an [[Explosive material|explosive]]. Before then, chemists assumed that only the [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] of picric acid were explosive, not the acid itself.<ref>A theory to explain why picrate salts detonated whereas picric acid itself didn't, was proposed by the French chemists [[Antoine Fran\u00e7ois, comte de Fourcroy|Fourcroy]] and [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin|Vauquelin]] in 1806 and reiterated by the French chemist [[Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul|Chevreul]] in 1809.  Picric acid evidently contained enough oxygen within itself \u2014 i.e., it was \"super-oxygenated\" (''suroxig\u00e9n\u00e9'') (Fourcroy and Vauquelin, 1806), p. 543 ; (Chevreul, 1809), p. 129) \u2014 to completely combust even in the absence of air (because even in the absence of air, heat could transform it completely into gases, leaving no carbon).((Fourcroy and Vauquelin, 1806), pp. 542\u2013543) ; (Chevreul, 1809), pp. 127\u2013128)  However, when picric acid was burned, the heat that was generated, caused some of the acid to evaporate, dissipating so much heat that only burning, not detonation, occurred.  By contrast, picrate salts were solids that didn't sublimate, so they didn't dissipate heat; hence they did detonate.((Fourcroy and Vauquelin, 1806), p. 542) ; (Chevreul, 1809), pp. 129\u2013130)  See:\n*  {{cite journal |last1=Fourcroy |last2=Vauquelin |title=M\u00e9moire sur la d\u00e9couverte d'une nouvelle mati\u00e8re inflammable et d\u00e9tonnante, form\u00e9e par l'action de l'acide nitrique sur l'indigo et les mati\u00e8res animales |journal=M\u00e9moires de l'Institute des Sciences et Arts |date=1806 |volume=6 |pages=531\u2013543 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/86732#page/657/mode/1up |trans-title=Memoir on the discovery of a new flammable and explosive substance, formed by the action of nitric acid on indigo and animal substances |language=French}}\n*  {{cite journal |last1=Chevreul |title=Extrait d'un m\u00e9moire sur les substances am\u00e8res form\u00e9es par la r\u00e9action de l'acide nitrique sur l'indigo |journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique |date=1809 |volume=72 |pages=113\u2013142 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000067418718&view=1up&seq=459 |trans-title=Extract from a memoir on the bitter substances formed by the reaction of nitric acid with indigo |language=French}}</ref> In 1871 [[Hermann Sprengel]] proved it could be detonated<ref>Note:\n*  In March 1871, Sprengel detonated picric acid at the gunpowder works of John Hall & Sons in Faversham in Kent, England.\n*  Sprengel filed patents in Britain for \"safety explosives\" (i.e., stable explosives) on April 6, 1871 (no. 921) and on October 5, 1871 (no. 2642); in the latter patent, Sprengel proposed using picric acid dissolved in nitric acid as an explosive.\n*  Hermann Sprengel (1873) \"On a new class of explosives which are non-explosive during their manufacture, storage, and transport,\" ''Journal of the Chemical Society'', '''26''' : 796\u2013808.\n*  Hermann Sprengel, [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433090730692;view=1up;seq=35 ''The Discovery of Picric Acid (Melinite, Lyddite) \"As a Powerful Explosive\"'' ...], 2nd ed.

This pamphlet is a collection of (splenetic) letters in which Sprengel defends his priority in the use of picric acid as a high explosive.</ref> and most [[military]] powers used picric acid as their main [[high explosive]] material. Picric acid is also used in the analytical chemistry of metals, ores, and minerals.\n\nPicric acid was the first high explosive nitrated [[organic compound]] widely considered suitable to withstand the shock of firing in conventional [[artillery]]. [[Nitroglycerine]] and [[nitrocellulose]] (guncotton) were available earlier but shock sensitivity sometimes caused [[detonation]] in the artillery barrel at the time of firing. In 1885, based on research of Hermann Sprengel, French chemist [[Eug\u00e8ne Turpin]] patented the use of pressed and cast picric acid in [[Rock blasting|blasting]] charges and [[artillery shell]]s. In 1887 the French government adopted a mixture of picric acid and guncotton under the name '''Melinite'''. In 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in [[Lydd]], Kent, under the name '''Lyddite'''.  Japan followed with an \"improved\" formula known as '''[[shimose powder]]'''.  In 1889, a similar material, a mixture of [[ammonium cresylate]] with [[trinitrocresol]], or an ammonium salt of trinitrocresol, started to be manufactured under the name '''[[ecrasite]]''' in [[Austria-Hungary]]. By 1894 Russia was manufacturing artillery shells filled with picric acid. Ammonium picrate (known as '''Dunnite''' or [[explosive D]]) was used by the United States beginning in 1906. However, shells filled with picric acid become highly unstable if the compound reacts with metal shell or [[fuze]] casings to form metal [[picrate]]s which are more sensitive than the parent phenol. The sensitivity of picric acid was demonstrated in the [[Halifax Explosion]]. Picric acid was used in the [[Battle of Omdurman]],<ref name=\"brown\">Brown, G.I.

[[Toluene]] was less readily available than phenol, and TNT is less powerful than picric acid, but improved safety of munitions manufacturing and storage caused replacement of picric acid by TNT for most military purposes between the World Wars.<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\nEfforts to control the availability of [[phenol]], the precursor to picric acid, emphasize its importance in [[World War I]].  Germans are reported to have bought US supplies of phenol and converted it to [[acetylsalicylic acid]], i.e., [[aspirin]], to keep it from the Allies.  See [[Great Phenol Plot]].  At the time, phenol was obtained from [[coal]] as a co-product of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens and the manufacture of gas for [[gas lighting]].

Edison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake, NJ, facility using processes developed by his chemists.<ref>Conot, Robert (1979), A Streak of Luck: The Life & Legend of Thomas Alva Edison, Seaview Books, NY, p 413-4</ref> He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day.  Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe.  He built two plants to produce raw material [[benzene]] at [[Johnstown, PA]] and [[Bessemer, AL]], replacing supplies previously from Germany.  Edison also manufactured [[aniline dyes]], which previously had been supplied by the [[IG Farben|German dye trust]].  Other wartime products include [[xylene]], [[p-phenylenediamine]], [[shellac]], and [[pyrax]].  Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable.  In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.\n\n== Synthesis ==\nThe aromatic ring of [[phenol]] is highly activated towards electrophilic substitution reactions, and attempted nitration of [[phenol]], even with dilute nitric acid, results in the formation of high molecular weight tars. In order to minimize these side reactions, anhydrous phenol is sulfonated with fuming [[sulfuric acid]], and the resulting ''p''-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid is then nitrated with concentrated [[nitric acid]]. During this reaction, [[nitro compound|nitro]] groups are introduced, and the [[sulfonic acid]] group is displaced. The reaction is highly [[exothermic]], and careful temperature control is required. Another route of picric acid synthesis is direct nitration of [[2,4-Dinitrophenol]] with nitric acid.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2B4VqK18VOUC&lpg=PA132&ots=u8EYH6WBnW&dq=picric%20acid%20synthesis%20further%20nitration%20dinitrophenol&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q=picric%20acid%20synthesis%20further%20nitration%20dinitrophenol&f=false|title=Organic Chemistry of Explosives|last=Agrawal|first=Jai Prakash|last2=Hodgson|first2=Robert|date=2007-01-11|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470059357|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1299171|title=Manufacture of picric acid.

[[Explosive D]], also known as Dunnite, is the ammonium salt of picric acid\u2014more powerful but less stable than the more common explosive [[TNT]] (which is produced in a similar process to picric acid but with toluene as the feedstock). Picramide, formed by aminating picric acid (typically beginning with Dunnite), can be further aminated to produce the highly stable explosive [[TATB]].\n\nIt has found some use in organic chemistry for the preparation of crystalline salts of organic bases (picrates) for the purpose of identification and characterization.\n\nIn metallurgy, a 4% picric acid in ethanol etch called \"picral\" has been commonly used in optical metallography to reveal prior austenite grain boundaries in ferritic steels.  The hazards associated with picric acid have meant it has largely been replaced with other chemical etchants. However, it is still used to etch magnesium alloys, such as AZ31.\n\n[[Bouin solution]] is a common picric-acid-containing [[Fixation (histology)|fixative]] solution used for [[histology]] specimens.<ref>{{cite book |title=Histotechnology: A Self-Instructional Text |edition=3 |last1=Carson |first1=Freida L. |last2=Hladik |first2=Christa |year=2009 |publisher=[[American Society for Clinical Pathology]] Press |location=Hong Kong |isbn=978-0-89189-581-7 |page=19 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> It improves the staining of acid dyes, but it can also lead to hydrolysis of any DNA in the sample.<ref>{{cite web|last=Llewellyn|first=Brian D|title=Picric Acid|url=http://stainsfile.info/StainsFile/prepare/fix/agents/picric_acid.htm|work=StainsFile|accessdate=28 September 2012|date=February 2009}}</ref>\n\nClinical chemistry lab testing utilizes picric acid for the [[Jaffe reaction]] to test for [[creatinine]].

When glucose, picric acid and [[sodium carbonate]] are combined and heated, a characteristic red color forms.  With a calibrating glucose solution, the red color can be used to measure the glucose levels added. This is known as the Lewis and Benedict method of measuring glucose.<ref>2{{cite web|title=Measuring blood glucose levels in the 1920s|url=https://tacomed.com/chapter-4-measuring-blood-glucose-levels-in-the-1920s/the-lewis-and-benedict-method-of-measuring-glucose/|website=Tacomed.com|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nMuch less commonly, wet picric acid has been used as a skin dye, or temporary branding agent. It reacts with proteins in the skin to give a dark brown color that may last as long as a month.\n\nIn the early 20th century, picric acid was stocked in pharmacies as an [[antiseptic]] and as a treatment for [[burn]]s, [[malaria]], [[herpes]], and [[smallpox]]. Picric acid-soaked [[gauze]] was also commonly stocked in [[first aid kit]]s from that period as a burn treatment.  It was most notably used for the treatment of burns suffered by victims of the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] [[Hindenburg disaster|disaster]] in 1937.

Its popularity has been tempered by its toxic nature.\n\n==Safety==\nModern safety precautions recommend storing picric acid wet, to minimize the danger of explosion. Dry picric acid is relatively sensitive to [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]] and [[friction]], so laboratories that use it store it in bottles under a layer of [[water (molecule)|water]], rendering it safe. Glass or plastic bottles are required, as picric acid can easily form metal [[picrate]] salts that are even more sensitive and hazardous than the acid itself. Industrially, picric acid is especially hazardous because it is volatile and slowly sublimes even at room temperature.

Its [[IUPAC name]] is  '''2,4,6-trinitrophenol''' ('''TNP'''). The name \"picric\" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (''pikros''), meaning \"bitter\", reflecting its bitter taste.  It is one of the most [[acid]]ic [[phenols]]. Like other highly [[nitration|nitrate]]d organic compounds, picric acid is an [[Explosive material|explosive]], hence its primary use. It has also been used in medicine (antiseptic, burn treatments) and dyes.\n\n== History ==\nPicric acid was probably first mentioned in the [[alchemical]] writings of [[Johann Rudolf Glauber]]. Initially, it was made by [[nitrating]] substances such as animal horn, [[silk]], [[indigo dye|indigo]], and natural [[resin]], the synthesis from indigo first being performed by [[Peter Woulfe]] in 1771.<ref>Peter Woulfe (1771) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nEJWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Experiments to shew the nature of aurum mosaicum,\"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''61''' :  114\u2013130.

Before then, chemists assumed that only the [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] of picric acid were explosive, not the acid itself.<ref>A theory to explain why picrate salts detonated whereas picric acid itself didn't, was proposed by the French chemists [[Antoine Fran\u00e7ois, comte de Fourcroy|Fourcroy]] and [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin|Vauquelin]] in 1806 and reiterated by the French chemist [[Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul|Chevreul]] in 1809.  Picric acid evidently contained enough oxygen within itself \u2014 i.e., it was \"super-oxygenated\" (''suroxig\u00e9n\u00e9'') (Fourcroy and Vauquelin, 1806), p. 543 ; (Chevreul, 1809), p. 129) \u2014 to completely combust even in the absence of air (because even in the absence of air, heat could transform it completely into gases, leaving no carbon).((Fourcroy and Vauquelin, 1806), pp. 542\u2013543) ; (Chevreul, 1809), pp. 127\u2013128)  However, when picric acid was burned, the heat that was generated, caused some of the acid to evaporate, dissipating so much heat that only burning, not detonation, occurred.  By contrast, picrate salts were solids that didn't sublimate, so they didn't dissipate heat; hence they did detonate.((Fourcroy and Vauquelin, 1806), p. 542) ; (Chevreul, 1809), pp. 129\u2013130)  See:\n*  {{cite journal |last1=Fourcroy |last2=Vauquelin |title=M\u00e9moire sur la d\u00e9couverte d'une nouvelle mati\u00e8re inflammable et d\u00e9tonnante, form\u00e9e par l'action de l'acide nitrique sur l'indigo et les mati\u00e8res animales |journal=M\u00e9moires de l'Institute des Sciences et Arts |date=1806 |volume=6 |pages=531\u2013543 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/86732#page/657/mode/1up |trans-title=Memoir on the discovery of a new flammable and explosive substance, formed by the action of nitric acid on indigo and animal substances |language=French}}\n*  {{cite journal |last1=Chevreul |title=Extrait d'un m\u00e9moire sur les substances am\u00e8res form\u00e9es par la r\u00e9action de l'acide nitrique sur l'indigo |journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique |date=1809 |volume=72 |pages=113\u2013142 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000067418718&view=1up&seq=459 |trans-title=Extract from a memoir on the bitter substances formed by the reaction of nitric acid with indigo |language=French}}</ref> In 1871 [[Hermann Sprengel]] proved it could be detonated<ref>Note:\n*  In March 1871, Sprengel detonated picric acid at the gunpowder works of John Hall & Sons in Faversham in Kent, England.\n*  Sprengel filed patents in Britain for \"safety explosives\" (i.e., stable explosives) on April 6, 1871 (no. 921) and on October 5, 1871 (no. 2642); in the latter patent, Sprengel proposed using picric acid dissolved in nitric acid as an explosive.\n*  Hermann Sprengel (1873) \"On a new class of explosives which are non-explosive during their manufacture, storage, and transport,\" ''Journal of the Chemical Society'', '''26''' : 796\u2013808.\n*  Hermann Sprengel, [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433090730692;view=1up;seq=35 ''The Discovery of Picric Acid (Melinite, Lyddite) \"As a Powerful Explosive\"'' ...], 2nd ed.

This pamphlet is a collection of (splenetic) letters in which Sprengel defends his priority in the use of picric acid as a high explosive.</ref> and most [[military]] powers used picric acid as their main [[high explosive]] material. Picric acid is also used in the analytical chemistry of metals, ores, and minerals.\n\nPicric acid was the first high explosive nitrated [[organic compound]] widely considered suitable to withstand the shock of firing in conventional [[artillery]]. [[Nitroglycerine]] and [[nitrocellulose]] (guncotton) were available earlier but shock sensitivity sometimes caused [[detonation]] in the artillery barrel at the time of firing. In 1885, based on research of Hermann Sprengel, French chemist [[Eug\u00e8ne Turpin]] patented the use of pressed and cast picric acid in [[Rock blasting|blasting]] charges and [[artillery shell]]s. In 1887 the French government adopted a mixture of picric acid and guncotton under the name '''Melinite'''. In 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in [[Lydd]], Kent, under the name '''Lyddite'''.  Japan followed with an \"improved\" formula known as '''[[shimose powder]]'''.  In 1889, a similar material, a mixture of [[ammonium cresylate]] with [[trinitrocresol]], or an ammonium salt of trinitrocresol, started to be manufactured under the name '''[[ecrasite]]''' in [[Austria-Hungary]]. By 1894 Russia was manufacturing artillery shells filled with picric acid. Ammonium picrate (known as '''Dunnite''' or [[explosive D]]) was used by the United States beginning in 1906. However, shells filled with picric acid become highly unstable if the compound reacts with metal shell or [[fuze]] casings to form metal [[picrate]]s which are more sensitive than the parent phenol. The sensitivity of picric acid was demonstrated in the [[Halifax Explosion]]. Picric acid was used in the [[Battle of Omdurman]],<ref name=\"brown\">Brown, G.I.

[[Toluene]] was less readily available than phenol, and TNT is less powerful than picric acid, but improved safety of munitions manufacturing and storage caused replacement of picric acid by TNT for most military purposes between the World Wars.<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\nEfforts to control the availability of [[phenol]], the precursor to picric acid, emphasize its importance in [[World War I]].  Germans are reported to have bought US supplies of phenol and converted it to [[acetylsalicylic acid]], i.e., [[aspirin]], to keep it from the Allies.  See [[Great Phenol Plot]].  At the time, phenol was obtained from [[coal]] as a co-product of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens and the manufacture of gas for [[gas lighting]].

Dow was the leading producer.  Dow describes picric acid as \u201cthe main battlefield explosive used by the French.  Large amounts [of phenol] also went to Japan, where it was made into picric acid sold to the Russians.\u201d<ref>Brandt, E.N. (1997), ''Growth Company: Dow Chemical's First Century'', Michigan State University, {{ISBN|0-87013-426-4}} p. 97</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Edison]] needed phenol to manufacture [[phonograph]] records.  Edison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake, NJ, facility using processes developed by his chemists.<ref>Conot, Robert (1979), A Streak of Luck: The Life & Legend of Thomas Alva Edison, Seaview Books, NY, p 413-4</ref> He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day.  Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe.  He built two plants to produce raw material [[benzene]] at [[Johnstown, PA]] and [[Bessemer, AL]], replacing supplies previously from Germany.  Edison also manufactured [[aniline dyes]], which previously had been supplied by the [[IG Farben|German dye trust]].  Other wartime products include [[xylene]], [[p-phenylenediamine]], [[shellac]], and [[pyrax]].  Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable.  In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.\n\n== Synthesis ==\nThe aromatic ring of [[phenol]] is highly activated towards electrophilic substitution reactions, and attempted nitration of [[phenol]], even with dilute nitric acid, results in the formation of high molecular weight tars. In order to minimize these side reactions, anhydrous phenol is sulfonated with fuming [[sulfuric acid]], and the resulting ''p''-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid is then nitrated with concentrated [[nitric acid]]. During this reaction, [[nitro compound|nitro]] groups are introduced, and the [[sulfonic acid]] group is displaced. The reaction is highly [[exothermic]], and careful temperature control is required. Another route of picric acid synthesis is direct nitration of [[2,4-Dinitrophenol]] with nitric acid.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2B4VqK18VOUC&lpg=PA132&ots=u8EYH6WBnW&dq=picric%20acid%20synthesis%20further%20nitration%20dinitrophenol&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q=picric%20acid%20synthesis%20further%20nitration%20dinitrophenol&f=false|title=Organic Chemistry of Explosives|last=Agrawal|first=Jai Prakash|last2=Hodgson|first2=Robert|date=2007-01-11|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470059357|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1299171|title=Manufacture of picric acid.

[[Explosive D]], also known as Dunnite, is the ammonium salt of picric acid\u2014more powerful but less stable than the more common explosive [[TNT]] (which is produced in a similar process to picric acid but with toluene as the feedstock). Picramide, formed by aminating picric acid (typically beginning with Dunnite), can be further aminated to produce the highly stable explosive [[TATB]].\n\nIt has found some use in organic chemistry for the preparation of crystalline salts of organic bases (picrates) for the purpose of identification and characterization.\n\nIn metallurgy, a 4% picric acid in ethanol etch called \"picral\" has been commonly used in optical metallography to reveal prior austenite grain boundaries in ferritic steels.  The hazards associated with picric acid have meant it has largely been replaced with other chemical etchants. However, it is still used to etch magnesium alloys, such as AZ31.\n\n[[Bouin solution]] is a common picric-acid-containing [[Fixation (histology)|fixative]] solution used for [[histology]] specimens.<ref>{{cite book |title=Histotechnology: A Self-Instructional Text |edition=3 |last1=Carson |first1=Freida L. |last2=Hladik |first2=Christa |year=2009 |publisher=[[American Society for Clinical Pathology]] Press |location=Hong Kong |isbn=978-0-89189-581-7 |page=19 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> It improves the staining of acid dyes, but it can also lead to hydrolysis of any DNA in the sample.<ref>{{cite web|last=Llewellyn|first=Brian D|title=Picric Acid|url=http://stainsfile.info/StainsFile/prepare/fix/agents/picric_acid.htm|work=StainsFile|accessdate=28 September 2012|date=February 2009}}</ref>\n\nClinical chemistry lab testing utilizes picric acid for the [[Jaffe reaction]] to test for [[creatinine]].

When glucose, picric acid and [[sodium carbonate]] are combined and heated, a characteristic red color forms.  With a calibrating glucose solution, the red color can be used to measure the glucose levels added. This is known as the Lewis and Benedict method of measuring glucose.<ref>2{{cite web|title=Measuring blood glucose levels in the 1920s|url=https://tacomed.com/chapter-4-measuring-blood-glucose-levels-in-the-1920s/the-lewis-and-benedict-method-of-measuring-glucose/|website=Tacomed.com|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nMuch less commonly, wet picric acid has been used as a skin dye, or temporary branding agent. It reacts with proteins in the skin to give a dark brown color that may last as long as a month.\n\nIn the early 20th century, picric acid was stocked in pharmacies as an [[antiseptic]] and as a treatment for [[burn]]s, [[malaria]], [[herpes]], and [[smallpox]]. Picric acid-soaked [[gauze]] was also commonly stocked in [[first aid kit]]s from that period as a burn treatment.  It was most notably used for the treatment of burns suffered by victims of the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] [[Hindenburg disaster|disaster]] in 1937. Picric acid was also used as a treatment for [[trench foot]] suffered by soldiers stationed on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]].<ref>(1922) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b2943177;view=1up;seq=201] ''History of the Great War - Surgery of the War, Vol. 1'', Pg. 175.</ref>\n\nPicric acid has been used for many years by [[Fly tying|fly tyers]] to dye mole skins and feathers a dark olive green. Its popularity has been tempered by its toxic nature.\n\n==Safety==\nModern safety precautions recommend storing picric acid wet, to minimize the danger of explosion. Dry picric acid is relatively sensitive to [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]] and [[friction]], so laboratories that use it store it in bottles under a layer of [[water (molecule)|water]], rendering it safe. Glass or plastic bottles are required, as picric acid can easily form metal [[picrate]] salts that are even more sensitive and hazardous than the acid itself. Industrially, picric acid is especially hazardous because it is volatile and slowly sublimes even at room temperature.

It is believed that the mosque was built by the eldest son of Shaista Khan, Buzurg Umed Khan. He was also the conqueror of Chittagong. But, his name is not cited  on the  inscription. This mosque was unused for a longer time and in the year 1761 the British officials used it to store Arms and ammunition. In 1853 the leading Muslim of Chittagong headed by Hamidullah approached the British Government and was successful in releasing the mosque for religious purpose in 1855.
