Each version of the work typically establishes its own continuity, and sometimes introduces parallel universes, to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified.

With nothing but his fists, he challenges Malekith's forces. Obviously, his efforts, raw strength and heroism is enough to attract the attention of one of Malekith's War Witches, who approaches Eddie with a dangerous gift, a Dreamstone, which brings life to dreams and desires. Seeing a golden opportunity to become a weapon and lethal protector once more, Eddie takes the stone, which grants him his wish. He creates an artificial symbiote similar to Venom, but much taller and thinner, almost ghoulish-looking with spikes that cover large portions of his body and razor-sharp claws. Eddie also realizes that this murderous creature has no mind of its own.<ref>''Venom'' Vol.4 #13.

His appearance was designed by Mark Bagley to be more of a monster than a supervillain, describing him as a \"huge cancerous/tumorous creature\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/books/2017/07/14/marvel-legacy-spider-man-venom/|title=Marvel Legacy: Spider-Man goes back to basics, Venom becomes a protector|author=[[Entertaiment Weekly]]|date=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Eddie Brock was a writer for the Daily Globe. He was at [[Justin Hammer#Ultimate Marvel|Justin Hammer]]'s press conference; his face is not shown, only his hands and arms appear.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w), [[Bagley, Mark]] (p), ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Ultimate incarnation of Venom is vastly different from the mainstream incarnation: ''Eddie Brock Jr.'' is Peter Parker's childhood friend (along with a college student who is a lab assistant for [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Curtis Connors]]) and the Venom symbiote is not extraterrestrial but is the second stage of a genetically created \"suit\" designed by ''[[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]]'' (Peter's father) and ''Eddie Brock Sr.'' (Eddie's father) as a cure for severe disease meant to bond to the user and protect them from internal and external harm. The suit is tailored for a specific DNA (Richard's in this case), and the person to whom it belongs can control the suit more easily. If, however, someone uses a suit designed for somebody else, they are constantly damaged by the suit which requires nourishment, gained by feeding on organic flesh, to function. If bonded to an incompatible host the Venom suit begins consuming them almost immediately, forcing them to feed on others to sustain it or die themselves. When taking a host, the organic matter that comprises the suit completely envelops the host, regardless of resistance, temporarily blinding it, before encasing itself in a hard, purple casing, similar to a [[pupa]], as it bonds further with the host. When the host emerges, the suit then shifts its appearance and function to assist its host, such as creating eyes for it to see through, or tries to take it over, inducing a homicidal rage and attempting to feed itself if bonded with an incompatible host. When bonded with a host and forcibly removed, the Venom suit leaves trace amounts of itself in their bloodstream, which attracts other samples of Venom to itself, and can overload Peter's spider-sense. In the video game ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', absorbing the trace amounts in Peter's blood allowed Eddie to take complete control of the suit, gaining a greater ability to talk and a spider symbol on his chest.\n\nVenom's only known weakness is electricity, and larger amounts of the suit will need more electricity to kill, as varying amounts of the suit will be stunned or vaporized by electric shocks. This was first seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #38, when an electric wire got tangled around Venom's foot. An electrocution from live power-lines vaporised the smaller amount on Peter, while a similar amount disabled Eddie. Note in the video game ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] electrocutes Venom during a cutscene, the suit is not affected by the shock like the live power-line did in the \"Venom\" arc. The suit can take the [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Shocker]]'s vibro-shocks, and can protect its host from a bullet, who feels nothing more than a relaxing vibration.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Venom suit was introduced when Peter Parker reunited with his childhood friend Eddie Brock Jr. to continue their fathers' research into a protoplasmic cure for cancer. Eddie Sr. had kept the suit in the lab for his son as his legacy. After finding that [[Bolivar Trask#Ultimate Marvel|Bolivar Trask]] had tried to weaponize his father's research, Peter attempted to steal a sample to conduct his own research on, but spilled it by accident.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> The original [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) was able to control the suit to a greater extent than anyone because of his powers and because the suit was designed for his father. Feeding off Spider-Man's own thoughts, the suit enhanced his strength, generated its own webbing, and made him completely bulletproof. But when Spider-Man was chasing down an armed robber, the suit attempted to take over him, growing a fanged maw. After fighting for control, Spider-Man electrocuted the suit before returning to destroy the sample. Enraged, Eddie ignored Peter's warnings and used a second sample of the Venom suit on himself. Eddie, wearing the Venom suit, initially resembled a bulkier version of Spider-Man but the suit grew a fanged mouth, claws, tentacles and spinal ridges. Eddie hunted down Peter, intending to force him to be absorbed in the suit but was electrocuted by downed power lines and retreated.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33-39. Marvel Comics.</ref> \nEddie was then captured by [[Silver Sable#Ultimate Marvel|Silver Sable]], who was hired by Bolivar since the suit technically belonged to him and ordered [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Adrian Toomes]] to conduct his experiments on the suit in an attempt to remove the suit from Eddie. Then [[Beetle (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Beetle]] tried to capture Venom, but Venom escaped and was confronted by Spider-Man. During a battle the suit eventually separated itself from Eddie and forcibly bonded itself with Peter, turning him into Venom. The [[Ultimates]] arrived and were able to separate Peter from the suit. Eddie later approached Peter and demanded that he retrieve the suit for him but was rebuffed. During a confrontation between Peter, Eddie and [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]], Gwen transformed into [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]]. Contact with Carnage caused trace amounts of the suit within Eddie's body to multiply, transforming him into Venom, at which point the two symbiotes began to fight. After a brief battle the Venom symbiote absorbed all traces of the Carnage symbiote, leaving Gwen an ordinary human, and causing Venom to change into a new form even larger than before, with small glowing red eyes. Venom retreated from battle, and was later captured by the Beetle and taken to Latveria.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #123-128. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the video game, it is implied that Eddie Sr. and Venom are responsible for the plane crash which killed Peter's parents. After Peter Parker becomes Carnage and fights Venom. Carnage is defeated and absorbed by Venom, and as a result Venom develops the trademark white spider symbol and Eddie Brock gains full control of the suit.\n\nVenom appeared with his trademark white spider symbol in ''[[Ultimates 3]]''.<ref>[[Loeb, Jeph]] (w), [[Madureira, Joe]] (a), ''[[Ultimates 3]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He attacks the Ultimates' [[Avengers Mansion#Ultimate Marvel|mansion]], demanding to find [[Alternative versions of Scarlet Witch#Ultimate Marvel|the woman]]. The Ultimates fight him until [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Thor]] strikes him with lightning, turning him into a puddle of organic matter.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n;In other media\n* In ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series, Eddie Brock was heavily inspired by the Ultimate version of Venom while he shared a strong resemblance to the mainstream iteration of Venom.\n* In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, the Venom symbiote was heavily inspired by the Ultimate version: an artificial lifeform designed through Peter Parker's DNA by [[Doctor Octopus]]. The first version's initial host is [[Harry Osborn]] and also has a strong resemblance to the mainstream iteration. The second iteration's main host is [[Flash Thompson]] as Agent Venom.\n* The titular character from the 2018 film ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' is suggested to have borrowed a few elements from this version of Venom, most notably the fact that its origin and appearance is on most part independent of the influence of Spider-Man. In other words, the latter was not a direct or indirect cause of Eddie Brock and the Venom symbiote bonding together, so Venom does not possess any of Spider-Man's powers but instead sports his own set of similar powers. Thus, the original story and character arc are not fully incorporated into the film.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' film, Peter Parker from Miles Morales's dimension mentions Venom in the \"Spidey-Bells\" song.\n* The Ultimate version of Venom is playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]''.\n* The Ultimate version of Venom is presumed to be the black web-like substance wrapping around a sick Harry Osborn in the very last post-credits scene in the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' acting as life support and is presumed to be in the sequel.\n\n== MC2 ==\nIn ''[[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]'', the Venom symbiote was separated from Eddie Brock and remained trapped in containment for more than a decade. After being free, attempts to re-bond with Peter Parker to become '''Spider-Venom''' and makes him to kill his own family, but gets separated by [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] and [[Phil Urich#MC2|Phil Urich]] as the heroic Green Goblin.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #5.

At the debut fashion show for the line, Peter Parker is photographing with Mary Jane Watson wearing one of the dresses, unaware of its true nature.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn the audience is the [[Power Pack]] in their civilian identities, invited by Peter as a thank you for their help in the previous two issues. When the symbiotes hear Peter's name, their genetic memory recognizes it and they turn Mary Jane and the other three models into She-Venoms, and attack.  The Power Pack join Spider-Man in the battle, during which Spider-Man briefly corners the designer and gets the truth out of him about the clones.  The symbiote clones are sheared from their unwilling hosts, three by a sonic boom produced by [[Julie Power]]/Lightspeed's superhuman speed, the other by an energy burst from [[Katie Power]]/Energizer.  The battle is then won when [[Jack Power (Marvel Comics)|Jack Power]]/Mass Master uses the music booth to blast them all with high audio, crippling them long enough to be captured.  During the battle, however, one symbiote clone manages to briefly make contact with Katie Power's alien-born costume, causing it to become \"infected\" by the Venom symbiote's evil and vengeful desires (the kids' costumes in this continuity are semi-biological themselves, a concept later reinforced during a later mini-series when one is seen to repair damage to itself on its own).  This causes Katie's costume to take on a Venom-like appearance, with the only differences being it is obviously smaller and Katie's energy burst symbol takes the place of the spider symbol's main body, the spider legs remaining.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe [[Kymellian]] costume-turned-symbiote completely takes control of the little girl at night, using her to team with the [[Sinister Six]] to capture Spider-Man, and then turn on the other members of Power Pack, Katie's own siblings, to take revenge on them for their part in the symbiote clones' defeat.  In the final battle, Julie Power manages to find and free Spider-Man, and together they manage to get [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] to blast all the villains, including himself, with a large electrical discharge powerful enough to render them all unconscious and again shear the costume-turned-symbiote off of Katie, the discharge purging Katie's costume of the \"infection\" in the process, restoring it to normal.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n== Marvel Zombies ==\nIn the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' mini-series on Earth-2149, Venom briefly appears as one of the many zombified villains. He fights the zombie [[Spider-Man]], who quickly kills him, because the Symbiote has started to die, being unable to absorb adrenaline from Eddie Brock's zombified body. He died very early at the hands of the zombie Spider-Man himself before Zombie Spider-Man goes on. Like his [[Earth 616]] counterpart, he has cancer and the Symbiote doesn't want to be with him.

Kron as a child was continually abused by the android housekeeper which thought that Kron was a dog and he has always been a bully and takes enjoyment in other people's pain. The relationship between the two is so conflicted that Miguel tried to kill his brother. \nIn his introduction, Stone gave the orders to have [[Punisher 2099|Jake Gallows]]' family killed. Gallows found Stone and fatally wounded him with a knife and dumped his body into the sewer.<ref>''Punisher 2099'' #2</ref> Following the altercation Kron lay dying in the sewer, his body brushed up against a black ball. The ball then bonded to him and formed a new Venom. The symbiote was described as having mutated over the years, and displayed new abilities in this timeline, including acidic blood and saliva.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref> With this new power, Stone sought to emotionally torture Miguel\u2014whom Kron never discovered was his half-brother\u2014by hurting those close to him, going so far as to kill Miguel's former love Dana\u2014who was also Tyler's lover. The future Spider-Man and Venom fought and Spider-Man was the victor. After the fight he had the town turn on sonics through all of the speakers, thus neutralizing Venom. They then brought him back to the lab for study. It was revealed that the symbiote bonded with Kron on a molecular level, giving Kron an amorphous physiology that allowed his body to take on the properties of the symbiote itself.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, after the symbiote was separated from Kron, it merged with Roman the Sub-Mariner, the son of [[Namor (comics)|Namor]], who fled to the ocean and is never seen again.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #38</ref> It was later shown that part of the symbiote is at the [[Alchemax]] lab for studying.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #44</ref>\n\nWhen the series was introduced as a one-shot in 2099, it introduced '''Alea Bell''' as the new Venom 2099. When she was a child, her left arm was badly burned in a crash that also resulted in the death of her mother. Raised by her father, Theo, Alea was bullied at school over her scars. She was then selected to undergo an experimental treatment being developed by Alchemax scientist Dr. Russell. She regainexd consciousness to find that the treatment had worked and her arm was restored. During a confrontation the next day with a girl at school, a black tendril emerged from her hand and sliced through the Alchemax monitoring bracelet. Alea heard a sinister voice in her head, her left arm transforming into a jet-black limb tipped with razor-sharp claws. Returning home, Alea learned that the purported panacea she'd been treated with was a piece of a symbiote called Venom, and that Alchemax intended to turn her into a supersoldier using it. Empathizing with its pain, felt, Alea reluctantly agreed to the symbiote's request to be made whole in exchange for her getting her normal life back. Infiltrating Alchemax, Alea was accosted by a pair of guards and was horrified when the symbiote killed them to protect her. As the symbiote scolded her innocent naivety, Alea protested that she didn't want to be seen as a monster. Arriving at the lab containing the other pieces of the symbiote, Alea shut down the containment grid, but was knocked unconscious by Dr. Russell. The Venom symbiote, reclaiming its disparate pieces, bonded to Alea, transformed her into Venom and had eaten Dr. Russell as revenge for cutting it apart. Disgusted, Alea reiterated that she didn't want to become a monster and asked if they could be a hero instead; the Venom symbiote begrudgingly agreeing to her request. At school the following day, Alea transformed into Venom to terrify her bully. However, the symbiote was abruptly overcome by the will of a dark god. Alarmed, Alea asked the Venom symbiote what had happened and it told her that the god of its species, [[Knull (comics)|Knull]], was somehow still alive and on Earth.\n\n;Other versions\n* A variant of Venom 2099 appears as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] along with another version of the Vulture and Doctor Octopus.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 3 #23.</ref>\n* [[Timestorm 2009-2099]]'s version of [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] is [[Kron Stone]].<ref>''Timestorm 2009-2099'' #1</ref>\n\n;In other media\n* Scorpion 2099 is a boss in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[John Kassir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|title=San Diego Comic-Con 2010: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimension Updates|accessdate=2010-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723174322/http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|archive-date=2010-07-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Deadly Villains of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/09/03/the-deadly-villains-of-spider-man-shattered-dimensions?page=9|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n* Venom 2099 appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]''. \n* Venom 2099 appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]''.\n\n== Spider-Man Unlimited ==\nIn the animated series and second issue of the comic series ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', Venom and Carnage appear as re-occurring villains, stowing away on [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s shuttle on its way to Counter-Earth and in subsequent appearances attempting to infect the citizens of Counter-Earth with symbiotes and serving a hive-mind called the Synoptic.

Upon meeting him, Venom is quick to berate Spider-Man for abandoning him all those years ago with a genuine sense of bitterness and sorrow, describing himself as a responsibility that Spider-Man neglected, leaving the wallcrawler at a loss for words. Defeated, the Sinister Six, Spidey and Venom have their final battle, in which [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] gives Spider-Man a detonator to make all the Sinners explode.

His Earth (Earth-TRN644) was eradicated by the Poisons so he gathered Venoms from across the multiverse in order to prevent the Poisons consuming more of them. He is captured by the Poisons and he realises that instead of bringing more Venoms to fight, he had brought the Poisons more Venoms to consume. In the climax he sends all of the surviving Venoms to their universes while the bomb explodes. His fate is unknown.<ref name=Venomverse />\n\n===Venomized Captain America===\nA Venomized version of '''[[Captain America]]''' makes an appearance while he recruits different versions of Venoms. He is captured by the Poisons and refusing to collaborate with them, he gets consumed and joins them.

At the time a young girl from Nigeria named '''Ngozi''' who was in a wheelchair bonded to the symbiote, allowing her to walk again. At the same time Rhino killed Black Panther and Nogozi defeated him. After T'Challa's death Ngozi with the symbiote became the new Black Panther.<ref name=VWS /><ref>''Black Panther Long Live the King'' #6</ref>\n\n===Venom-Punisher===\nIn another universe of Earth-TRN651, Venom makes an agreement with the '''Punisher''' to help him kill the Kingpin in exchange to help Venom kill Spider-Man. After killing the Kingpin, Punisher forced by the symbiote was ready to kill Spider-Man until Venom-Strange recruited him to fight the Poisons. Then he got consumed by the Poisons and got killed by [[Flash Thompson#Agent Anti-Venom and death|Anti-Venom]] while invading Earth-616.<ref name=VWS>''Venomverse War Stories''.</ref><ref>''Venomized'' #3</ref>\n\n== What If... ==\n{{See also|What If (comics)}}\n\n=== ...The alien costume had possessed Spider-Man? ===\nIn this one-shot, after obtaining the symbiote costume, Spider-Man waits too long before visiting [[Mr. Fantastic]] who would free him from the symbiote's control. The suit takes control of Spider-Man and as it constantly feeds on him, Spider-Man ages at an accelerated rate. Within days, Spider-Man dies of old age. Desperate to survive, the symbiote bonds with a weakened [[Hulk]]. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] confronts Venom-Hulk. The costume explains that it is sorry for Spider-Man's death, but is draining the gamma radiation from Bruce Banner as repentance. Thor in disbelief defeats him, leading the symbiote to take over Thor. Banner however is shown cured of being The Hulk. The heroes employ [[Black Bolt]]'s incredibly powerful voice to create enough sonic damage to critically injure the symbiote.\n\nThor is freed, and the heroes prepare to transport the alien to another dimension. [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] takes matters into her own hands and kills the alien because of anger at the death of Spider-Man.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Fingeroth, Danny]] | penciller=Bagley, Mark|inker=[[Keith Williams (comics)|Williams, Keith]] | story=What if the Alien costume had possessed Spider-Man?|title=[[What If (comics)|What If]] | volume=2|issue=4|date=October 1989|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n=== ...Venom had possessed The Punisher? ===\nIn this one-shot issue, after the symbiote leaves Spider-Man, it joins with the [[Punisher]] instead of Eddie Brock. Castle uses the symbiote's abilities to further his war on crime; he used the suit's shape-shifting nature to create glider-wings and used its webbing as bullets.\n\nThe symbiote causes the Punisher's war to become more brutal and unrestrained than ever before as he set about confronting and killing many super-criminals. The symbiote eventually influences him to confront and beat Spider-Man, but before it can kill the Web Slinger, Castle's soldierly discipline wins out. With his new powers, Punisher takes out [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and even the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. At the climax of a confrontation with Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Moon Knight]], from which the Punisher emerges victorious, a blast from Spider-Man's borrowed sonic blaster allows Punisher to overcome and tame the symbiote by convincing it that his war on crime means more to him than anything, even his own life, and would sooner commit suicide and kill them both if he did not have complete control over it.\n\nThe symbiote then recedes from Punisher's face and manifests his trademark Skull insignia upon his chest. Castle tells the assembled heroes that he is in control now before making his escape.<ref>{{Comic book reference| writer=[[Busiek, Kurt]] | artist=[[McDonnell, Luke]] | story=What if Venom had possessed The Punisher?|title=What If| volume=2| issue=44|date=December 1992|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n=== ...The Marvel Super-Heroes had remained on Battleworld? ===\nIn this one-shot issue, the Marvel Super-Heroes and Villains left alive from the [[Secret Wars]] after [[Galactus]]' and the [[Beyonder]]'s fatal battle find themselves trapped on Battleworld. Deciding to make the best of things, they all settle down and build new lives and families. Twenty-five years later, Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote are a single entity. With Reed Richards dead, there was no way to free Spider-Man from the symbiote and thus he was forced to accept this new way of life. Over time he becomes cold, calculating and emotionally distant from the rest of the group. The body of Peter Parker is now nothing more than a skeleton with the symbiote acting as his skin, much to the dismay of the other super-heroes and their children.<ref>''What If...'' Vol. 2, #114</ref>\n\n=== ...Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? ===\nThis one-shot issue presents a different approach to the events of ''[[Spider-Man: The Other]]'', where Peter Parker dies and is resurrected with greater spider powers. Instead, Peter rejects the chance to rise again in a new form and leaves his body and spirit separated. This leaves his body open to a complete takeover by the Venom symbiote. The suit quickly abandons its latest host, Mac Gargan, as soon as it senses Peter's vulnerable state and rushes to once again unite with its first host. After cocooning Peter's body, the symbiote fully bonds with Peter, turning him into a violent monster called [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#What If?|Poison]]. Poison longs for a companion to join them in their new life and chooses Mary Jane. After dispatching the Avengers who rush to her aid, Watson offers herself willingly to prevent any further harm to the people protecting her. She promises Poison that she will give her body but not her soul and make Poison's life as miserable as possible. This seems to leave Poison heartbroken and he flees. Instead, he unearths the grave of [[Gwen Stacy]]. The last images reveal Poison watching over a new cocoon like his own, but crimson colored, as it bursts forth showing a hand similar to [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]'s.<ref>{{Comic book reference| writer=[[David, Peter]] | penciller=Pham, Khoi|inker=[[Florea, Sandu]] | story=What if Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? - Poison Selves|title=What If| volume=3| issue=2|date=November 2006|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | page=| panel=}}</ref>\n\n=== ...Iron Man: Demon in an Armor ===\nIn this one shot, which happens to take place in Earth-90211, Spider-Man has the Venom symbiote costume. Wade Wilson, as [[Deadpool]], is hired by Galactus to kill the Beyonder for merging [[MODOK]] to Galactus's rear end in exchange for the Community Cube. He was given a weapon called the Recton Expungifier, the only weapon that could kill the Beyonder. When Deadpool tracked down his target to a night club, he was enticed into the Beyonder's partying lifestyle, getting [[Jheri curl]]s in the process. While hanging out with the Beyonder in a flying limousine, Spider-Man broke into the car and demanded the symbiote costume be removed from himself. Beyonder's driver shoots Spider-Man out of the limousine and the symbiote leaves Spider-Man and merges with Deadpool, creating '''Venompool'''. However, after years of partying, Beyonder grew tired and threw Venompool to the world, snapping him out of the Beyonder's magic. Venompool attempted to resume his contract and kill the Beyonder, but he accidentally pawned the Recton Expungifier. He decides to get himself clean by kidnapping and selling a drunken [[Alternative versions of Iron Man#Demon in an Armor|Tony Stark]] to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]]. Unfortunately, he can't join any major superhero teams, like the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and [[Fantastic Four]] because of his newly acquired Jheri curls.\n\n== In ''[[What The--?!]]'' ==\nIn the ''[[Spider-Ham]]'' universe, \"The Bee-Yonder\" gives Spider-Ham a version of the black uniform.<ref>''Spider-Ham'' #17.</ref> In issue #20, Pork Grind, a pig version of Venom is introduced as an enemy of [[Spider-Ham|Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham]].

He was much stronger than Spider-Ham, who was smashed by him like paper.

With nothing but his fists, he challenges Malekith's forces. Obviously, his efforts, raw strength and heroism is enough to attract the attention of one of Malekith's War Witches, who approaches Eddie with a dangerous gift, a Dreamstone, which brings life to dreams and desires. Seeing a golden opportunity to become a weapon and lethal protector once more, Eddie takes the stone, which grants him his wish. He creates an artificial symbiote similar to Venom, but much taller and thinner, almost ghoulish-looking with spikes that cover large portions of his body and razor-sharp claws.

His appearance was designed by Mark Bagley to be more of a monster than a supervillain, describing him as a \"huge cancerous/tumorous creature\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/books/2017/07/14/marvel-legacy-spider-man-venom/|title=Marvel Legacy: Spider-Man goes back to basics, Venom becomes a protector|author=[[Entertaiment Weekly]]|date=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Eddie Brock was a writer for the Daily Globe.

Marvel Comics.</ref> The Ultimate incarnation of Venom is vastly different from the mainstream incarnation: ''Eddie Brock Jr.'' is Peter Parker's childhood friend (along with a college student who is a lab assistant for [[Lizard (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Curtis Connors]]) and the Venom symbiote is not extraterrestrial but is the second stage of a genetically created \"suit\" designed by ''[[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]]'' (Peter's father) and ''Eddie Brock Sr.'' (Eddie's father) as a cure for severe disease meant to bond to the user and protect them from internal and external harm. The suit is tailored for a specific DNA (Richard's in this case), and the person to whom it belongs can control the suit more easily. If, however, someone uses a suit designed for somebody else, they are constantly damaged by the suit which requires nourishment, gained by feeding on organic flesh, to function. If bonded to an incompatible host the Venom suit begins consuming them almost immediately, forcing them to feed on others to sustain it or die themselves. When taking a host, the organic matter that comprises the suit completely envelops the host, regardless of resistance, temporarily blinding it, before encasing itself in a hard, purple casing, similar to a [[pupa]], as it bonds further with the host. When the host emerges, the suit then shifts its appearance and function to assist its host, such as creating eyes for it to see through, or tries to take it over, inducing a homicidal rage and attempting to feed itself if bonded with an incompatible host. When bonded with a host and forcibly removed, the Venom suit leaves trace amounts of itself in their bloodstream, which attracts other samples of Venom to itself, and can overload Peter's spider-sense. In the video game ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', absorbing the trace amounts in Peter's blood allowed Eddie to take complete control of the suit, gaining a greater ability to talk and a spider symbol on his chest.\n\nVenom's only known weakness is electricity, and larger amounts of the suit will need more electricity to kill, as varying amounts of the suit will be stunned or vaporized by electric shocks. This was first seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #38, when an electric wire got tangled around Venom's foot. An electrocution from live power-lines vaporised the smaller amount on Peter, while a similar amount disabled Eddie. Note in the video game ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] electrocutes Venom during a cutscene, the suit is not affected by the shock like the live power-line did in the \"Venom\" arc. The suit can take the [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Shocker]]'s vibro-shocks, and can protect its host from a bullet, who feels nothing more than a relaxing vibration.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Venom suit was introduced when Peter Parker reunited with his childhood friend Eddie Brock Jr. to continue their fathers' research into a protoplasmic cure for cancer. Eddie Sr. had kept the suit in the lab for his son as his legacy. After finding that [[Bolivar Trask#Ultimate Marvel|Bolivar Trask]] had tried to weaponize his father's research, Peter attempted to steal a sample to conduct his own research on, but spilled it by accident.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref> The original [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) was able to control the suit to a greater extent than anyone because of his powers and because the suit was designed for his father. Feeding off Spider-Man's own thoughts, the suit enhanced his strength, generated its own webbing, and made him completely bulletproof. But when Spider-Man was chasing down an armed robber, the suit attempted to take over him, growing a fanged maw. After fighting for control, Spider-Man electrocuted the suit before returning to destroy the sample. Enraged, Eddie ignored Peter's warnings and used a second sample of the Venom suit on himself. Eddie, wearing the Venom suit, initially resembled a bulkier version of Spider-Man but the suit grew a fanged mouth, claws, tentacles and spinal ridges. Eddie hunted down Peter, intending to force him to be absorbed in the suit but was electrocuted by downed power lines and retreated.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #33-39. Marvel Comics.</ref> \nEddie was then captured by [[Silver Sable#Ultimate Marvel|Silver Sable]], who was hired by Bolivar since the suit technically belonged to him and ordered [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Adrian Toomes]] to conduct his experiments on the suit in an attempt to remove the suit from Eddie. Then [[Beetle (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Beetle]] tried to capture Venom, but Venom escaped and was confronted by Spider-Man. During a battle the suit eventually separated itself from Eddie and forcibly bonded itself with Peter, turning him into Venom. The [[Ultimates]] arrived and were able to separate Peter from the suit. Eddie later approached Peter and demanded that he retrieve the suit for him but was rebuffed. During a confrontation between Peter, Eddie and [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]], Gwen transformed into [[Carnage (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]]. Contact with Carnage caused trace amounts of the suit within Eddie's body to multiply, transforming him into Venom, at which point the two symbiotes began to fight. After a brief battle the Venom symbiote absorbed all traces of the Carnage symbiote, leaving Gwen an ordinary human, and causing Venom to change into a new form even larger than before, with small glowing red eyes and got a spider symbol. Venom retreated from battle, and was later captured by the Beetle and taken to Latveria.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael. ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #123-128.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n;In other media\n* In ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series, Eddie Brock was heavily inspired by the Ultimate version of Venom while he shared a strong resemblance to the mainstream iteration of Venom.\n* In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, the Venom symbiote was heavily inspired by the Ultimate version: an artificial lifeform designed through Peter Parker's DNA by [[Doctor Octopus]]. The first version's initial host is [[Harry Osborn]] and also has a strong resemblance to the mainstream iteration. The second iteration's main host is [[Flash Thompson]] as Agent Venom.\n* The titular character from the 2018 film ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' is suggested to have borrowed a few elements from this version of Venom, most notably the fact that its origin and appearance is on most part independent of the influence of Spider-Man. In other words, the latter was not a direct or indirect cause of Eddie Brock and the Venom symbiote bonding together, so Venom does not possess any of Spider-Man's powers but instead sports his own set of similar powers. Thus, the original story and character arc are not fully incorporated into the film.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' film, Peter Parker from Miles Morales's dimension mentions Venom in the \"Spidey-Bells\" song.\n* The Ultimate version of Venom is playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]''.\n* The Ultimate version of Venom is presumed to be the black web-like substance wrapping around a sick Harry Osborn in the very last post-credits scene in the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' acting as life support and is presumed to be in the sequel.\n\n== MC2 ==\nIn ''[[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]'', the Venom symbiote was separated from Eddie Brock and remained trapped in containment for more than a decade.

The hybrid named herself \"April Parker\" and went on to live with the real Spider-Girl's family (her [[Benjamin Richard Parker|baby brother]], [[Alternative versions of Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], and Peter) and starts to go school where she befriends May's friends especially Gene Thompson, [[Flash Thompson#MC2|Flash Thompson]]'s son.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #10-11.

At the debut fashion show for the line, Peter Parker is photographing with Mary Jane Watson wearing one of the dresses, unaware of its true nature.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nIn the audience is the [[Power Pack]] in their civilian identities, invited by Peter as a thank you for their help in the previous two issues. When the symbiotes hear Peter's name, their genetic memory recognizes it and they turn Mary Jane and the other three models into She-Venoms, and attack.  The Power Pack join Spider-Man in the battle, during which Spider-Man briefly corners the designer and gets the truth out of him about the clones.  The symbiote clones are sheared from their unwilling hosts, three by a sonic boom produced by [[Julie Power]]/Lightspeed's superhuman speed, the other by an energy burst from [[Katie Power]]/Energizer.  The battle is then won when [[Jack Power (Marvel Comics)|Jack Power]]/Mass Master uses the music booth to blast them all with high audio, crippling them long enough to be captured.  During the battle, however, one symbiote clone manages to briefly make contact with Katie Power's alien-born costume, causing it to become \"infected\" by the Venom symbiote's evil and vengeful desires (the kids' costumes in this continuity are semi-biological themselves, a concept later reinforced during a later mini-series when one is seen to repair damage to itself on its own).  This causes Katie's costume to take on a Venom-like appearance, with the only differences being it is obviously smaller and Katie's energy burst symbol takes the place of the spider symbol's main body, the spider legs remaining.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe [[Kymellian]] costume-turned-symbiote completely takes control of the little girl at night, using her to team with the [[Sinister Six]] to capture Spider-Man, and then turn on the other members of Power Pack, Katie's own siblings, to take revenge on them for their part in the symbiote clones' defeat.  In the final battle, Julie Power manages to find and free Spider-Man, and together they manage to get [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] to blast all the villains, including himself, with a large electrical discharge powerful enough to render them all unconscious and again shear the costume-turned-symbiote off of Katie, the discharge purging Katie's costume of the \"infection\" in the process, restoring it to normal.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n== Marvel Zombies ==\nIn the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' mini-series on Earth-2149, Venom briefly appears as one of the many zombified villains. He fights the zombie [[Spider-Man]], who quickly kills him, because the Symbiote has started to die, being unable to absorb adrenaline from Eddie Brock's zombified body. He died very early at the hands of the zombie Spider-Man himself before Zombie Spider-Man goes on. Like his [[Earth 616]] counterpart, he has cancer and the Symbiote doesn't want to be with him. Unlike his Earth 616 counterpart, his disease is not cured and he is instead destroyed. Before he died, Brock managed to sputter out that he and the symbiote are dying, to which the zombie Spider-Man states that Venom is breaking his cold, dead heart.<ref>{{Cite comic\n\n| Writer = Robert Kirkman\n\n| Penciller = Sean Phillips\n\n| Inker = Sean Phillips\n\n| Story = Marvel Zombies (Part Four)\n\n| Title = Marvel Zombies\n\n| Volume = 1\n\n| Issue = 4\n\n| Date = May 2006\n\n| Publisher = Marvel Comics\n\n}}</ref>\n\n== 100th Anniversary Special Spider-Man ==\nIn an alternate universe of Earth-TRN421, in the year 2061, after '''[[Wilson Fisk]]''' killed Eddie Brock in a confrontation, he got the symbiote and modified it giving it the ability to travel through technology. Then Kingpin after being bonded to the symbiote, started chasing Peter so he could finally kill Spider-Man once and for all.

Kron as a child was continually abused by the android housekeeper which thought that Kron was a dog and he has always been a bully and takes enjoyment in other people's pain. The relationship between the two is so conflicted that Miguel tried to kill his brother. \nIn his introduction, Stone gave the orders to have [[Punisher 2099|Jake Gallows]]' family killed. Gallows found Stone and fatally wounded him with a knife and dumped his body into the sewer.<ref>''Punisher 2099'' #2</ref> Following the altercation Kron lay dying in the sewer, his body brushed up against a black ball. The ball then bonded to him and formed a new Venom. The symbiote was described as having mutated over the years, and displayed new abilities in this timeline, including acidic blood and saliva.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref> With this new power, Stone sought to emotionally torture Miguel\u2014whom Kron never discovered was his half-brother\u2014by hurting those close to him, going so far as to kill Miguel's former love Dana\u2014who was also Tyler's lover. The future Spider-Man and Venom fought and Spider-Man was the victor. After the fight he had the town turn on sonics through all of the speakers, thus neutralizing Venom. They then brought him back to the lab for study. It was revealed that the symbiote bonded with Kron on a molecular level, giving Kron an amorphous physiology that allowed his body to take on the properties of the symbiote itself.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #37. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, after the symbiote was separated from Kron, it merged with Roman the Sub-Mariner, the son of [[Namor (comics)|Namor]], who fled to the ocean and is never seen again.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #38</ref> It was later shown that part of the symbiote is at the [[Alchemax]] lab for studying.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #44</ref>\n\nWhen the series was introduced as a one-shot in 2099, it introduced '''Alea Bell''' as the new Venom 2099. When she was a child, her left arm was badly burned in a crash that also resulted in the death of her mother. Raised by her father, Theo, Alea was bullied at school over her scars. She was then selected to undergo an experimental treatment being developed by Alchemax scientist Dr. Russell. She regainexd consciousness to find that the treatment had worked and her arm was restored. During a confrontation the next day with a girl at school, a black tendril emerged from her hand and sliced through the Alchemax monitoring bracelet. Alea heard a sinister voice in her head, her left arm transforming into a jet-black limb tipped with razor-sharp claws. Returning home, Alea learned that the purported panacea she'd been treated with was a piece of a symbiote called Venom, and that Alchemax intended to turn her into a supersoldier using it. Empathizing with its pain, felt, Alea reluctantly agreed to the symbiote's request to be made whole in exchange for her getting her normal life back. Infiltrating Alchemax, Alea was accosted by a pair of guards and was horrified when the symbiote killed them to protect her. As the symbiote scolded her innocent naivety, Alea protested that she didn't want to be seen as a monster. Arriving at the lab containing the other pieces of the symbiote, Alea shut down the containment grid, but was knocked unconscious by Dr. Russell. The Venom symbiote, reclaiming its disparate pieces, bonded to Alea, transformed her into Venom and had eaten Dr. Russell as revenge for cutting it apart. Disgusted, Alea reiterated that she didn't want to become a monster and asked if they could be a hero instead; the Venom symbiote begrudgingly agreeing to her request. At school the following day, Alea transformed into Venom to terrify her bully. However, the symbiote was abruptly overcome by the will of a dark god. Alarmed, Alea asked the Venom symbiote what had happened and it told her that the god of its species, [[Knull (comics)|Knull]], was somehow still alive and on Earth.\n\n;Other versions\n* A variant of Venom 2099 appears as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] along with another version of the Vulture and Doctor Octopus.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 3 #23.</ref>\n* [[Timestorm 2009-2099]]'s version of [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] is [[Kron Stone]].<ref>''Timestorm 2009-2099'' #1</ref>\n\n;In other media\n* Scorpion 2099 is a boss in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[John Kassir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|title=San Diego Comic-Con 2010: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimension Updates|accessdate=2010-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723174322/http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|archive-date=2010-07-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Deadly Villains of Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/09/03/the-deadly-villains-of-spider-man-shattered-dimensions?page=9|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n* Venom 2099 appears as a playable character in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]''. \n* Venom 2099 appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]''.\n\n== Spider-Man Unlimited ==\nIn the animated series and second issue of the comic series ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', Venom and Carnage appear as re-occurring villains, stowing away on [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s shuttle on its way to Counter-Earth and in subsequent appearances attempting to infect the citizens of Counter-Earth with symbiotes and serving a hive-mind called the Synoptic.

Upon meeting him, Venom is quick to berate Spider-Man for abandoning him all those years ago with a genuine sense of bitterness and sorrow, describing himself as a responsibility that Spider-Man neglected, leaving the wallcrawler at a loss for words. Defeated, the Sinister Six, Spidey and Venom have their final battle, in which [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] gives Spider-Man a detonator to make all the Sinners explode.

Despite their history, Peter agrees that Venom will teach the ways of the Spider-Clan and the use of his powers to Peter. Venom and the rest of the new Spider-Clan aid in training Peter to become more powerful, tapping into the mystical side of his spider abilities. In the end, Peter discovers that the group is run by Peter's biological mother, who ordered the death of [[Aunt May]] to rid him of emotional attachments. As a result, Peter refuses to take his place as leader, rejecting the clan. Venom is awarded with rulership over the Spider-Clan.

The suit takes control of Spider-Man and as it constantly feeds on him, Spider-Man ages at an accelerated rate. Within days, Spider-Man dies of old age. Desperate to survive, the symbiote bonds with a weakened [[Hulk]]. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] confronts Venom-Hulk. The costume explains that it is sorry for Spider-Man's death, but is draining the gamma radiation from Bruce Banner as repentance.

The heroes employ [[Black Bolt]]'s incredibly powerful voice to create enough sonic damage to critically injure the symbiote.\n\nThor is freed, and the heroes prepare to transport the alien to another dimension. [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] takes matters into her own hands and kills the alien because of anger at the death of Spider-Man.<ref>{{comic book reference|writer=[[Fingeroth, Danny]] | penciller=Bagley, Mark|inker=[[Keith Williams (comics)|Williams, Keith]] | story=What if the Alien costume had possessed Spider-Man?|title=[[What If (comics)|What If]] | volume=2|issue=4|date=October 1989|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n=== ...Venom had possessed The Punisher? ===\nIn this one-shot issue, after the symbiote leaves Spider-Man, it joins with the [[Punisher]] instead of Eddie Brock. Castle uses the symbiote's abilities to further his war on crime; he used the suit's shape-shifting nature to create glider-wings and used its webbing as bullets.\n\nThe symbiote causes the Punisher's war to become more brutal and unrestrained than ever before as he set about confronting and killing many super-criminals. The symbiote eventually influences him to confront and beat Spider-Man, but before it can kill the Web Slinger, Castle's soldierly discipline wins out. With his new powers, Punisher takes out [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and even the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. At the climax of a confrontation with Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Moon Knight]], from which the Punisher emerges victorious, a blast from Spider-Man's borrowed sonic blaster allows Punisher to overcome and tame the symbiote by convincing it that his war on crime means more to him than anything, even his own life, and would sooner commit suicide and kill them both if he did not have complete control over it.\n\nThe symbiote then recedes from Punisher's face and manifests his trademark Skull insignia upon his chest. Castle tells the assembled heroes that he is in control now before making his escape.<ref>{{Comic book reference| writer=[[Busiek, Kurt]] | artist=[[McDonnell, Luke]] | story=What if Venom had possessed The Punisher?|title=What If| volume=2| issue=44|date=December 1992|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n=== ...The Marvel Super-Heroes had remained on Battleworld? ===\nIn this one-shot issue, the Marvel Super-Heroes and Villains left alive from the [[Secret Wars]] after [[Galactus]]' and the [[Beyonder]]'s fatal battle find themselves trapped on Battleworld. Deciding to make the best of things, they all settle down and build new lives and families. Twenty-five years later, Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote are a single entity. With Reed Richards dead, there was no way to free Spider-Man from the symbiote and thus he was forced to accept this new way of life. Over time he becomes cold, calculating and emotionally distant from the rest of the group. The body of Peter Parker is now nothing more than a skeleton with the symbiote acting as his skin, much to the dismay of the other super-heroes and their children.<ref>''What If...'' Vol. 2, #114</ref>\n\n=== ...Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? ===\nThis one-shot issue presents a different approach to the events of ''[[Spider-Man: The Other]]'', where Peter Parker dies and is resurrected with greater spider powers. Instead, Peter rejects the chance to rise again in a new form and leaves his body and spirit separated. This leaves his body open to a complete takeover by the Venom symbiote. The suit quickly abandons its latest host, Mac Gargan, as soon as it senses Peter's vulnerable state and rushes to once again unite with its first host. After cocooning Peter's body, the symbiote fully bonds with Peter, turning him into a violent monster called [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#What If?|Poison]]. Poison longs for a companion to join them in their new life and chooses Mary Jane. After dispatching the Avengers who rush to her aid, Watson offers herself willingly to prevent any further harm to the people protecting her. She promises Poison that she will give her body but not her soul and make Poison's life as miserable as possible. This seems to leave Poison heartbroken and he flees. Instead, he unearths the grave of [[Gwen Stacy]]. The last images reveal Poison watching over a new cocoon like his own, but crimson colored, as it bursts forth showing a hand similar to [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]'s.<ref>{{Comic book reference| writer=[[David, Peter]] | penciller=Pham, Khoi|inker=[[Florea, Sandu]] | story=What if Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? - Poison Selves|title=What If| volume=3| issue=2|date=November 2006|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | page=| panel=}}</ref>\n\n=== ...Iron Man: Demon in an Armor ===\nIn this one shot, which happens to take place in Earth-90211, Spider-Man has the Venom symbiote costume.

When Deadpool tracked down his target to a night club, he was enticed into the Beyonder's partying lifestyle, getting [[Jheri curl]]s in the process. While hanging out with the Beyonder in a flying limousine, Spider-Man broke into the car and demanded the symbiote costume be removed from himself. Beyonder's driver shoots Spider-Man out of the limousine and the symbiote leaves Spider-Man and merges with Deadpool, creating '''Venompool'''. However, after years of partying, Beyonder grew tired and threw Venompool to the world, snapping him out of the Beyonder's magic. Venompool attempted to resume his contract and kill the Beyonder, but he accidentally pawned the Recton Expungifier. He decides to get himself clean by kidnapping and selling a drunken [[Alternative versions of Iron Man#Demon in an Armor|Tony Stark]] to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]].

Shuya, who immediately admitted killing Manami, mocked her compassionate reaction to his feigned expression of remorse with \"just kidding\".\n\nHaving revealed their identities, she explained that because the killers, as minors, are protected by the [[Law of Japan#Criminal law|Juvenile Law of 1947]], turning them in wouldn't make a difference. As a teacher, she believes that she must teach them a lesson by making them amend for their mistakes in a way that does not harm them. Firstly, she beguiles them by admitting injecting her late daughter's biological father's [[HIV]]-contaminated blood in the milk cartons of the two students who she claimed to have murdered her daughter. The rest of the film switches between the aftermath of Moriguchi's confession and the events before the confession through a series of first-person narratives from Moriguchi and her three students. \n\nNaoki Shimomura (Kaoru Fujiwara), Student B, becomes a [[Hikikomori|shut-in]] because he believes he has acquired [[AIDS]] from drinking HIV-contaminated milk. His mother (Yoshino Kimura), after spotting the hidden malicious messages in well-wishes cards from Naoki's classmates, realizes her son was somehow involved with an earlier incident. She decides to commit murder-suicide to free her son and herself from torment, but in the ensuing struggle, Naoki kills her. The police arrest him for the murder. \n\nShuya Watanabe (Yukito Nishii), Student A, explains that his mother abused him before leaving to pursue her scientific ambitions. He confesses that her abandonment has driven him to thrive in science, from making small inventions to recording his killing and dissecting animals. His first public invention, an electric anti-mugger wallet, earned him a science fair award, but it failed to make the headlines as the media was busy covering the \"Lunacy Incident\".\n\nShuya and Naoki's recollections reveal that Shuya said he had upgraded the anti-mugger wallet. He decided to try it out on someone and roped Naoki in to help with his plan. They decided on Moriguchi's daughter Manami. However, when they tested it on Manami, Shuya's device only managed to render Manami unconscious. Shuya mistook this as instant death, who then told Naoki to tell the world that Shuya did it. Enraged Naoki then threw the conscious Manami into the pool where she drowned, therefore proving he was the more effective killer.\n\nThe classmates force classmate Mizuki Kitahara (Ai Hashimoto) to kiss Shuya as part of their bullying against Shuya. Mizuki later tells Shuya she believes Moriguchi had lied about the blood-contaminated milk as it was an implausible method of transmission. After spending time together, Mizuki eventually confesses to Shuya that she identified the \"Lunacy Murder\" girl, who poisoned her parents, as her other self. They soon became romantically involved, but Shuya kills her after a confrontation over his [[Oedipus Complex]] and claims that she was nothing but \"a means to relieve boredom\".\n\nAfter finally finding messages left with his mother's name and work place, Shuya visits the university where his mother works expecting to reunite with her, but discovers she has remarried. Believing she has forgotten him, he plants a bomb in his school's sport hall where the graduation ceremony is to be held and he is to give a speech. However, to his surprise, the bomb does not go off during the ceremony. As he tries to work out what has happened, he receives a call from Moriguchi, who says that she has relocated the bomb to his mother's office. She explains that it is her ultimate revenge, to let Shuya's mother die by his own hands, but his redemption would now begin. As the screen darkens, Moriguchi chuckles and says, \"just kidding.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Takako Matsu]] as Yuko Moriguchi\n* [[Masaki Okada]] as Yoshiteru Terada (Werther)\n* [[Yoshino Kimura]] as Yuko Shimomura\n* Yukito Nishii as Shuya Watanabe\n* Kaoru Fujiwara as Naoki Shimomura\n* [[Ai Hashimoto]] as Mizuki Kitahara\n* [[Mana Ashida]] as Manami Moriguchi\n\n==Reception==\n===Film grossing and critical response===\nSoon after the film had started showing in 266 cinemas, it had already grossed \u00a5269,835,200 with 194,893 audiences, breaking the record previously held by ''[[I Give My First Love to You]]''.

On 17 November 2015, the EBU announced that SBS had been invited to participate in the 2016 contest and that Australia would once again take part.\n\nIn 2015, Australia was guaranteed a spot in the final of the contest and was allowed to vote during both semi-finals and the final. For 2016, Australia would have to qualify for the final from one of two semi-finals and could only vote in the semi-final in which the nation was competing. [[Dami Im]] sang [[Sound of Silence (Dami Im song)|Sound of Silence]] and finished second in the [[Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016 contest]].\n\nIn 2019, the country was represented by [[Kate Miller-Heidke]] with \"[[Zero Gravity (Kate Miller-Heidke song)|Zero Gravity]],\" which was chosen in a [[Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019|national selection]].

The nominal fallacy similarly referred to as the naming-explaining fallacy is an error where one believes that a label carries explanatory information in other words, the concept shrinks with knowledge.\n \nIn this comic, the function of X is either less than or equal to one. The discrete variable in this case can be divided into two parts, contradictory or exclusive categories. Therefore the dichotomous variable is discrete, i.e., nothing lies in between, its either equal to or less than.\n \nThe physician needs to understand what happens in a child\u2019s body when they are diagnosed with the green nose flue, however, he needs to understand how to treat the green nose flue and the exact meds to use. In this case, considering the opposite to contrast is more or less a means of defining something. \n \nThe defendant in the comic choses to resolve the existing discrepancy between the preexisting scenarios with the new information by settling with the fact that his fate is already decided and in spite of what he says, he is still guilty. He is accused to have the ability of reading minds by someone who doesn\u2019t share his evaluations and therefore it\u2019s hard for her to overcome the bias.  \n \nThe student has a tendency to hold on the belief that persistence is the key to success to be true in spite of the ample evidence in the calculation that discredits the belief. Upon realizing that the evidence at hand contradicts the belief he chooses to dismiss or discredit it by choosing to continue in that path until the answer turns out right. \n \nSince multiple pathways of causation imply that various antecedent conditions or causes are responsible for the same effects, in the comic above, failure to effectively manage a supply chain can more or less lead to inefficiencies.\n \nIn psychology, barnum effect occurs when an individual believes that his or her personality description specifically applies to them despite the fact that it applies to everyone else. The physician is in need of an individual with more personality, a characteristic that is applied across the board in humanity. \n \nHindsight bias in psychology is simply an explanation of the tendency of individuals to overestimate their ability to probably predict an event that was predicted prior. However, in most cases it usually happens after learning the outcome of the event.  In the comic, an event that hasn\u2019t occurred is quite hard to predict in spite the experience the fellow seems to possess. \n \nIn reality, every choice made has a consequence, both positive and negative. This is brought out in the comic as the business management team is unable to decide whether to come up with a business plan for the coming year because in the past they ended up doing nothing. However, it would be irrational lacking a plan altogether. \n \nAn experience of emotional discomfort or comfort is not a valid gauge to render something right or wrong. It\u2019s quite clear that the audience was not fascinated by the film as they anticipated but since the third individual takes comfort in the fact that the film is loved by someone else, he chooses to dismiss their opinion.\n\n==Actor==\nLevy had a starring role in the children\u2019s television series ''[[Wonderbug]]'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=Crime Fighting Heroes of Television: Over 10,000 Facts from 151 Shows, 1949-2001|last=Terrace|first=Vincent|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=199}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Sid and Marty Krofft: A Critical Study of Saturday Morning Children's Television 1969-1993|last=Erickson|first=Hal|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=239}}</ref> for which he received an [[Emmy]] nomination<ref>The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences; 1976-1977 Emmy Awards nomination for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Children\u2019s Programming (notification: 9/11/76).</ref> in 1977.
