{"title_page": "AltiVec", "text_new": "{{POWER, PowerPC, and Power ISA}}\n'''AltiVec''' is a single-precision [[floating point]] and integer [[SIMD]] [[instruction set]] designed and owned by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[IBM]], and [[Freescale Semiconductor]] (formerly [[Motorola]]'s Semiconductor Products Sector) &mdash; the [[AIM alliance]].  It is implemented on versions of the [[PowerPC]] processor architecture, including Motorola's [[PowerPC G4|G4]], [[IBM]]'s [[PowerPC 970|G5]] and [[POWER6]] processors, and [[P.A. Semi]]'s [[PWRficient]] PA6T.  AltiVec is a [[trademark]] owned solely by Freescale, so the system is also referred to as '''Velocity Engine''' by Apple and '''VMX''' ('''Vector Multimedia Extension''') by IBM and P.A. Semi.\n\nWhile AltiVec refers to an instruction set, the implementations in CPUs produced by IBM and Motorola are separate in terms of logic design. To date, no IBM core has included an AltiVec logic design licensed from Motorola or vice versa.\n\nAltiVec is a standard part of the [[Power ISA#Power ISA v.2.03|Power ISA v.2.03]]<ref name=\"isa203\">{{cite web\n |title     = Power ISA v.2.03\n |publisher = Power.org\n |url       = http://www.power.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PowerISA_203_Final_Public.pdf\n}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> specification. It was never formally a part of the PowerPC architecture until this specification although it used PowerPC instruction formats and syntax and occupied the opcode space expressly allocated for such \npurposes.\n\n==Comparison to x86-64 SSE ==\n\nBoth VMX/AltiVec and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] feature 128-bit vector registers that can represent sixteen 8-bit signed or unsigned chars, eight 16-bit signed or unsigned shorts, four 32-bit ints or four [[IEEE floating-point standard|32-bit]] floating point variables.  Both provide [[CPU cache|cache]]-control instructions intended to minimize [[cache pollution]] when working on streams of data.\n\nThey also exhibit important differences. Unlike [[SSE2]], VMX/AltiVec supports a special [[RGB color model|RGB]] \"[[pixel]]\" data type, but it does not operate on 64-bit double precision floats, and there is no way to move data directly between scalar and [[vector processor|vector]] registers. In keeping with the \"load/store\" model of the PowerPC's [[RISC]] design, the vector registers, like the scalar registers, can only be loaded from and stored to memory. However, VMX/AltiVec provides a much more complete set of \"horizontal\" operations that work across all the elements of a vector; the allowable combinations of data type and operations are much more complete. Thirty-two 128-bit vector registers are provided, compared to eight for SSE and SSE2 (extended to 16 in [[x86-64]]), and most VMX/AltiVec instructions take three register operands compared to only two register/register or register/memory operands on [[IA-32]].\n\nVMX/AltiVec is also unique in its support for a flexible vector [[permute instruction]], in which each byte of a resulting vector value can be taken from any byte of either of two other vectors, parametrized by yet another vector.  This allows for sophisticated manipulations in a single instruction.\n\nRecent versions of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), [[IBM VisualAge]] compiler and other compilers provide [[intrinsic function|intrinsics]] to access VMX/AltiVec instructions directly from [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] programs. As of version 4, the GCC also includes [[Automatic vectorization|auto-vectorization]] capabilities that attempt to intelligently create VMX/Altivec accelerated binaries without the need for the programmer to use intrinsics directly. The \"vector\" type keyword is introduced to permit the declaration of native vector types, e.g., \"<code>vector unsigned char foo;</code>\" declares a 128-bit vector variable named \"foo\" containing sixteen 8-bit unsigned chars. The full complement of arithmetic and binary operators is defined on vector types so that the normal C expression language can be used to manipulate vector variables. There are also overloaded intrinsic functions such as \"<code>vec_add</code>\" that emit the appropriate op code based on the type of the elements within the vector, and very strong type checking is enforced. In contrast, the Intel-defined data types for IA-32 SIMD registers declare only the size of the vector register (128 or 64 bits) and in the case of a 128-bit register, whether it contains integers or floating point values. The programmer must select the appropriate intrinsic for the data types in use, e.g., \"<code>_mm_add_epi16(x,y)</code>\" for adding two vectors containing eight 16-bit integers.\n\n==Development history==\nThe Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) was developed between 1996 and 1998 by a collaborative project between Apple, IBM, and Motorola. \nApple was the primary customer for Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) until Apple switched to Intel-made, x86-based CPUs on June 6, 2005. They used it to accelerate [[multimedia]] applications such as [[QuickTime]], [[iTunes]] and key parts of Apple's [[Mac OS X]] including in the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz graphics compositor]].  Other companies such as Adobe used AltiVec to optimize their image-processing programs such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. Motorola was the first to supply AltiVec enabled processors starting with their G4 line.  AltiVec was also used in some embedded systems for high-performance digital signal processing.\n\nIBM consistently left VMX out of their earlier [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER microprocessors]], which were intended for server applications where it was not very useful. The [[POWER6]] microprocessor, introduced in 2007, implements AltiVec. The last desktop microprocessor from IBM, the [[PowerPC 970]] (dubbed the \"G5\" by Apple) also implemented AltiVec with hardware similar to that of the [[PowerPC G4|PowerPC 7400]].\n\nAltiVec is a brandname trademarked by Freescale (previously Motorola) for the standard ''Category:Vector'' part of the [[Power ISA#Power ISA v.2.03|Power ISA v.2.03]]<ref name=\"isa203\" /> specification.  This Category is also known as VMX (used by IBM), and \"Velocity Engine\" (a brand name previously used by Apple).\n\nThe [[Cell microprocessor|Cell]] Broadband Engine, used in (amongst other things) the [[PlayStation 3]], also supports Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) in its PPU, with the SPU ISA being enhanced but architecturally similar.\n\nFreescale is bringing an enhanced version of AltiVec to [[PowerPC e6500|e6500]] based [[QorIQ]] processors.\n\n=== VMX128 ===\nIBM enhanced VMX for use in [[Xenon (processor)|Xenon]] (Xbox 360) and called this enhancement VMX128.

However, it may be possible to combine them using compiler-specific workarounds; for instance, in GCC one may do <code>#undef vector</code> to remove the <code>vector</code> keyword, and then use the GCC-specific <code>__vector</code> keyword in its place.\n\nAltiVec also lacks 64-bit integer support. Developers who wish to operate on 64-bit data will develop routines from 32-bit components. For example, below are examples of 64-bit <tt>add</tt> and <tt>subtract</tt> in C using a vector with four 32-bit words.

After receiving the letter, Luke Hunter did not inform the other leaders of Panthera. In January 2018 the ten conservationists were arrested by the Iranian government and charged with treason. The Iranian government stated that the activists were using their motion cameras to spy on Iran's military. Despite this the activists have maintained innocence. As well one of the activists died under mysterious circumstances and the other activists have claimed to have suffered torture and mistreatment at the hands of the Iranian government. It has been argued by some since then that Kaplan were indirectly responsible for the Iranian activists arrest and imprisonment.

At the September 2017 UANI conference Kaplan gave a speech in which he compared Iran to a [[Reticulated python|Reticulated Python]] devouring a [[Goat]] and also said that [[Shia Islam|Shiite Muslims]], the majority religion in Iran, were religiously bound by \"taqiyya\" to deceive those outside of their religion and conceal their true intentions.

After his speech in 2017 the conservationists found out the extent of his views on Iran and sent a letter to Panthera in distress trying to figure out what was going on and worrying they might get in trouble. After receiving the letter, Luke Hunter did not inform the other leaders of Panthera of the letter after he received it. In January 2018 the ten conservationists were arrested by the Iranian government and charged with treason. The Iranian government stated that the activists were using their motion cameras to spy on Iran's military. Despite this the activists have maintained innocence. As well one of the activists died under mysterious circumstances and the other activists have claimed to have suffered torture and mistreatment at the hands of the Iranian government. It has been argued by some since then that Kaplan were indirectly responsible for the Iranian activists arrest and imprisonment.

The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

It was written by Minogue, [[Biffco|Richard Stannard]], [[Julian Gallagher]], [[Biffco|Ash Howes]] and [[Martin Harrington]], and produced by Stannard and Gallagher. It is unrelated to the song \"Love at First Sight\" from Minogue's debut studio album ''[[Kylie (album)|Kylie]]'' (1988). \"Love at First Sight\" is a [[disco]] song which describes the singer falling and believing in [[love at first sight]]. The song was released as the third, and second in North America, [[Single (music)|single]] from ''Fever'' on 10 June 2002.\n\n\"Love at First Sight\" received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s; majority of the critics commended the song's commercial appeal and composition. Minor criticism was towards the production similarities of Minogue's previous singles from ''Fever''. \"Love at First Sight\" was a worldwide commercial success. In her native Australia, it peaked at number three on the [[Australian Singles Chart]], but even found more success in the United Kingdom, where it debuted and peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It also charted inside the top-ten in countries including Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Spain and New Zealand. In the United States, it peaked at number 23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number one on the [[Dance Club Songs]] chart.\n\nAn accompanying [[music video]] for \"Love at First Sight\" was directed by [[Johan Renck]], featuring  Minogue in a futuristic maze with backup dancers, all shot in [[One shot (music video)|single take]] motion. \"Love at First Sight\" was first performed on her [[KylieFever2002]] tour, and has featured on all her concert tours with the exception of the [[Anti Tour]]. The song was later nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording]] in 2003, becoming Minogue's first Grammy nomination.\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{Listen\n | filename    = Kylie Minogue Love at First Sight Sample.ogg\n | title       = \"Love at First Sight\" (2002)\n | description = A 21 second sample of \"Love at First Sight\" containing part of the chorus.

It was written by Minogue, [[Biffco|Richard Stannard]], [[Julian Gallagher]], [[Biffco|Ash Howes]] and [[Martin Harrington]], and produced by Stannard and Gallagher. It is unrelated to the song \"Love at First Sight\" from Minogue's debut studio album ''[[Kylie (album)|Kylie]]'' (1988). \"Love at First Sight\" is a [[disco]] song which describes the singer falling and believing in [[love at first sight]]. The song was released as the third, and second in North America, [[Single (music)|single]] from ''Fever'' on 10 June 2002.\n\n\"Love at First Sight\" received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s; majority of the critics commended the song's commercial appeal and composition. Minor criticism was towards the production similarities of Minogue's previous singles from ''Fever''. \"Love at First Sight\" was a worldwide commercial success. In her native Australia, it peaked at number three on the [[Australian Singles Chart]], but even found more success in the United Kingdom, where it debuted and peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It also charted inside the top-ten in countries including Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Spain and New Zealand. In the United States, it peaked at number 23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number one on the [[Dance Club Songs]] chart.\n\nAn accompanying [[music video]] for \"Love at First Sight\" was directed by [[Johan Renck]], featuring  Minogue in a futuristic maze with backup dancers, all shot in [[One shot (music video)|single take]] motion. \"Love at First Sight\" was first performed on her [[KylieFever2002]] tour, and has featured on all her concert tours with the exception of the [[Anti Tour]]. The song was later nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording]] in 2003, becoming Minogue's first Grammy nomination.\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{Listen\n | filename    = Kylie Minogue Love at First Sight Sample.ogg\n | title       = \"Love at First Sight\" (2002)\n | description = A 21 second sample of \"Love at First Sight\" containing part of the chorus.

The game takes in a large city still recovering from a war decades prior to the game's start, with players taking the role of an amnesic detective who has been charged with solving a murder mystery. During the investigation, he comes to recall events about his own past as well as current forces trying to affect the city. ''Disco Elysium'' was written and designed by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], inspired by [[Infinity Engine]]\u2013era role-playing games. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] releases planned for 2020.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' is a non-traditional role-playing game featuring no combat. Instead, resolution of events are done though skill checks and [[dialog tree]]s via a system of 24 skills that represent different aspects of the protagonist, such as their pain threshold and perception. In addition, a system called the \"Thought Cabinet\" represents other moral and ideological viewpoints of the protagonist, with players having the ability to freely support or suppress them. The game was based on a [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting that Kurvitz had previously created, with him forming ZA/UM in 2016 as a way to build out the game. ''Disco Elysium'' was critically acclaimed, with its narrative and conversation systems receiving the most praise. It was named as a [[game of the year]] by several publications, and won numerous other awards for its narrative and art.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|The current dialog for ''Disco Elysium'' running along the right side of the screen showing conversations in white and choices in red, atop the current scene the character is in]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html|title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective|publisher=Techspot|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |date=17 October 2019 |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=Critical Hit|accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through skill checks and [[dialog tree|dialogue trees]].<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |first=Justin |last=Woo |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424|title=Disco Elysium: Character generation, skill checks and gameplay strategy|website=GameCrate|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/|title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained|website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up. The choice of clothing that the player equips on the player-character can impart both positive and negative effects on certain skills.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, made based on a random dice roll, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet.  Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet|title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained|website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe 24 skills also play into the dialogue trees, creating a situation where the player-character may have an internal debate with one aspect of their mind, creating the idea that the player is communicating with a fragmented mind. These internal conversations may provide suggestions or additional insight that can guide the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters, depending on the skill points invested into the skill. For example, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described by ZA/UM as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and may come into situations where the player-character may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance, should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/your-skills-talk-to-you-in-disco-elysium-an-inventive-rpg-that-keeps-impressing/ | title = Your skills talk to you in Disco Elysium, an inventive RPG that keeps impressing | first = David | last = O'Keefe | date = 10 September 2018 | accessdate = 7 April 2020 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe world of ''Disco Elysium'' is made of landmasses known as isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down.

A [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] was formed afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by a Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they have been assigned to investigate the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. His identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. The detectives set out to explore the rest of the district, following up on leads while investigating smaller cases, helping residents with a variety of tasks.\n\nThese tasks allow the player to begin to fill in gaps in the detective\u2019s identity, revealing him to be  Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad. Through their work, they discover the killing appears to be connected to an ongoing strike by the Martinaise\u2019s dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. They seek out representatives of both the dockworkers and the Wild Pines corporation, meeting up with Evrart Claire for more information on the union and Joyce Messier on the involvement of Wild Pines.\n\nThis leads them to discover that the man was killed before the hanging. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[Vigilante|vigilantes]] in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje. Seeking more information on the man, they return to Joyce, who reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThey meet with Klassje for her end of the story who reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth while the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby hiding within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover-up was all Klaasje's idea and has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a standoff between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulindian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nHarry and his partner are confronted by his old squad upon their return to Martenaise. They reflect on Harry's actions during the game, whether he has solved the case and how he handled the mercenaries, as well as being impressed by the news that the Phasmid does exist. Harry's former partner Jean Vicquemare confirms that Harry's emotional breakdown was indeed the result of Dora leaving him several years ago. If the player has done well, the squad expresses hope that Harry's state will improve in the future, and invites him and either Kim or Cuno to a special RCM unit.\n\n==Development and release==\n''Disco Elysium'' was developed by ZA/UM, a company founded in 2016 by [[Karelians|Karelian]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], who served as the game's lead writer and designer.<ref name= Gamesindustry>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Haydn |date=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-31-disco-elysium|title=Chasing oblivion with Disco Elysium and alcohol addiction|website=Gamesindustry.biz}}</ref><ref name= Kurvitz>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Disco Elysium's lead designer wants to make an expansion and sequel, has already written a novel |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysiums-lead-designer-wants-to-make-an-expansion-and-sequel-has-already-written-a-novel/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref> Kurvitz had previously created the game's setting for a [[tabletop RPG]], and has also written novels, such as ''Sacred and Terrible Air'' (2013), that take place in it.<ref name= Kurvitz/> A team consisting of eight writers also assisted Kurvitz.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war|title=Making games under threat of nuclear war|website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The game's original title was ''No Truce With The Furies'', but was renamed in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/09/no-truce-with-the-furies-gets-a-mad-new-title-and-trailer/|title=No Truce With The Furies gets a mad new title and trailer|first=Dominic|last=Tarason|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=9 March 2018}}</ref> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London, with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/|title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha|first=Deisi|last=Helem\u00e4e|publisher=Geenius.ee|date=5 September 2018|lang=Estonian|accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> ZA/UM cited a variety of different influences and inspirations for the game, including other games ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'' and ''[[Kentucky Route Zero]]'';

The game takes in a large city still recovering from a war decades prior to the game's start, with players taking the role of an amnesic detective who has been charged with solving a murder mystery. During the investigation, he comes to recall events about his own past as well as current forces trying to affect the city. ''Disco Elysium'' was written and designed by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], inspired by [[Infinity Engine]]\u2013era role-playing games. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] releases planned for 2020.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' is a non-traditional role-playing game featuring no combat. Instead, resolution of events are done though skill checks and [[dialog tree]]s via a system of 24 skills that represent different aspects of the protagonist, such as their pain threshold and perception. In addition, a system called the \"Thought Cabinet\" represents other moral and ideological viewpoints of the protagonist, with players having the ability to freely support or suppress them. The game was based on a [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting that Kurvitz had previously created, with him forming ZA/UM in 2016 as a way to build out the game. ''Disco Elysium'' was critically acclaimed, with its narrative and conversation systems receiving the most praise. It was named as a [[game of the year]] by several publications, and won numerous other awards for its narrative and art.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|The current dialog for ''Disco Elysium'' running along the right side of the screen showing conversations in white and choices in red, atop the current scene the character is in]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html|title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective|publisher=Techspot|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |date=17 October 2019 |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=Critical Hit|accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through skill checks and [[dialog tree|dialogue trees]].<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |first=Justin |last=Woo |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424|title=Disco Elysium: Character generation, skill checks and gameplay strategy|website=GameCrate|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/|title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained|website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up. The choice of clothing that the player equips on the player-character can impart both positive and negative effects on certain skills.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, made based on a random dice roll, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet.  Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet|title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained|website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe 24 skills also play into the dialogue trees, creating a situation where the player-character may have an internal debate with one aspect of their mind, creating the idea that the player is communicating with a fragmented mind. These internal conversations may provide suggestions or additional insight that can guide the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters, depending on the skill points invested into the skill. For example, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described by ZA/UM as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and may come into situations where the player-character may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance, should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/your-skills-talk-to-you-in-disco-elysium-an-inventive-rpg-that-keeps-impressing/ | title = Your skills talk to you in Disco Elysium, an inventive RPG that keeps impressing | first = David | last = O'Keefe | date = 10 September 2018 | accessdate = 7 April 2020 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe world of ''Disco Elysium'' is made of landmasses known as isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down.

A [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] was formed afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by a Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they have been assigned to investigate the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. His identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. The detectives set out to explore the rest of the district, following up on leads while investigating smaller cases, helping residents with a variety of tasks.\n\nThese tasks allow the player to begin to fill in gaps in the detective\u2019s identity, revealing him to be  Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad. Through their work, they discover the killing appears to be connected to an ongoing strike by the Martinaise\u2019s dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. They seek out representatives of both the dockworkers and the Wild Pines corporation, meeting up with Evrart Claire for more information on the union and Joyce Messier on the involvement of Wild Pines.\n\nThis leads them to discover that the man was killed before the hanging. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[Vigilante|vigilantes]] in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje. Seeking more information on the man, they return to Joyce, who reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThey meet with Klassje for her end of the story who reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth while the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby hiding within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover-up was all Klaasje's idea and has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a standoff between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulindian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nHarry and his partner are confronted by his old squad upon their return to Martenaise. They reflect on Harry's actions during the game, whether he has solved the case and how he handled the mercenaries, as well as being impressed by the news that the Phasmid does exist. Harry's former partner Jean Vicquemare confirms that Harry's emotional breakdown was indeed the result of Dora leaving him several years ago. If the player has done well, the squad expresses hope that Harry's state will improve in the future, and invites him and either Kim or Cuno to a special RCM unit.\n\n==Development and release==\n''Disco Elysium'' was developed by ZA/UM, a company founded in 2016 by [[Karelians|Karelian]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], who served as the game's lead writer and designer.<ref name= Gamesindustry>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Haydn |date=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-31-disco-elysium|title=Chasing oblivion with Disco Elysium and alcohol addiction|website=Gamesindustry.biz}}</ref><ref name= Kurvitz>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Disco Elysium's lead designer wants to make an expansion and sequel, has already written a novel |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysiums-lead-designer-wants-to-make-an-expansion-and-sequel-has-already-written-a-novel/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref> Kurvitz had previously created the game's setting for a [[tabletop RPG]], and has also written novels, such as ''Sacred and Terrible Air'' (2013), that take place in it.<ref name= Kurvitz/> A team consisting of eight writers also assisted Kurvitz.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war|title=Making games under threat of nuclear war|website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The game's original title was ''No Truce With The Furies'', but was renamed in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/09/no-truce-with-the-furies-gets-a-mad-new-title-and-trailer/|title=No Truce With The Furies gets a mad new title and trailer|first=Dominic|last=Tarason|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=9 March 2018}}</ref> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London, with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/|title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha|first=Deisi|last=Helem\u00e4e|publisher=Geenius.ee|date=5 September 2018|lang=Estonian|accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> ZA/UM cited a variety of different influences and inspirations for the game, including other games ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'' and ''[[Kentucky Route Zero]]'';
