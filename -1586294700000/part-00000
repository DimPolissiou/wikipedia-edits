It is the [[Chair (official)|seat]] of the [[Bishop of Galloway]], and the [[mother church]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Galloway]]. St Margaret's was designated a cathedral in 2007, and is the most recent church to be given status as a Roman Catholic cathedral in the United Kingdom, due to the closure of [[Good Shepherd Cathedral, Ayr]].\n\n== History of St Margaret's Ayr ==\nSt Margaret's Church and later Cathedral has changed considerably over its almost 200 years of existence.\n\nThe church was designed by architect James Dempster.  [http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/building_full.php?id=229620]\n\nDuring the 1960/1970s the Church was remodelled as a result of Vatican II.  These changes significantly altered the layout of the Sanctuary and were carried out to enable the congregation to have a more active role in Mass, with the Priest celebrating Mass facing the congregation rather than towards the High Altar.\n\nIn the mid-1990s it became apparent that the Church required substantial capital works undertaken.  There were issues with water ingress, dampness, corrosion of windows, problems with electricity and general wear and tear.  Father Martin McCluskey began to discuss with the Parish the need for a major renovation program to begin.  Unfortunately, his untimely death in 1996 resulted in him being unable to undertake or commission any of the works to take place.  When Father Patrick Keegans arrived at the Parish in 1997 he agreed that works were required and were required sooner rather than later and initiated the process of preparing for major renovations.\n\nThe Church underwent a very thorough makeover and re-dedication in the late 1990s and early years of this century. The sanctuary was completely refurbished and new furnishings, a central aisle, stained glass windows, new organ, new large sacristy and many other improvements, with a white colour scheme for the ceiling and walls. New lighting and new central heating was also installed. All of these improvements were costly, but substantial grants from Heritage Scotland and the National Lottery plus some very successful and imaginative fundraising saw the bills paid off in a remarkably short time.\n\nDuring these renovations the Parish Community signed two books; a Book of Dedication and a Book of Remembrance.  All parishioners were invited to sign the book of dedication and remember those family members and friends who had died.  Both these books are placed directly under the High Altar in the Cathedral as a lasting legacy to parishioners past, present and future.\n\nThe new fully refurbished church officially re-opened on 31 March 2000 in a ceremony attended by many people from both civic and religious life, as well as parishioners from Saint Margarets and across the diocese. This official opening and re-dedication was presided by Bishop Maurice Taylor and the Homilist was Canon Matthew McManus who served in Saint Margarets as Assistant Priest from 1965 - 1976.\n\nOn 14 September 2007, the Feast of the Triumph of the Cross, Bishop Cunningham along with priests & bishops from across Scotland dedicated Saint Margaret's Church as Cathedral Church of the Diocese of Galloway following the closure of The Good Shepherd Cathedral in Ayr.\n\n=== Key Dates ===\n1822 | The Catholic population in Ayrshire was growing and was ministered to by visiting priests, Bishop Cameron sent Rev William Thomson to be the first Parish priest.\n\n1826 | After much petitioning by the Rev William Thomson, the foundation stone was laid for the St Margaret's.\n\n1827 | The new St Margaret's church was officially opened.\n\n1895 | A permanent school was opened for the children of St Margaret's in a new building adjacent to the church.\n\n1930 | St Margaret's High School opened in Whitletts Road when all classes were transferred from the \u2018wee school\u2019 next to the church.

Parishioners Pat Lynch, Mary Godfrey, Lee Galloway and Ken Burrell cut the ribbon.\n\n2007 | Pope Benedict XVI accepted the petition of Right Reverend John Cunningham, the 7th Bishop of Galloway, to move the cathedral seat to St Margaret's Church, Ayr.\n\n== History of Galloway Cathedrals ==\nWhen the Roman Catholic Hierarchy was restored to Scotland in 1878, the Diocese of Galloway consisted of [[South Ayrshire]], [[Dumfriesshire]], [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] and [[Wigtownshire]]. St Andrew's, Dumfries was chosen as the Cathedral church and parish. In 1947, the Apostolic Constitution, \u2018Dominici Gregis\u2019, erected the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow|Province of Glasgow]] by creating [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Motherwell|Motherwell]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Paisley|Paisley]] as the two new suffragan sees. This same document also detached ten parishes in the north of Ayrshire and placed them in the Diocese of Galloway. This change resulted in Dumfries no longer being central to the population of the Diocese as a whole, and convinced the then Bishop, [[Joseph McGee]], that he should move his residence to Ayr, where he could be more available to his people. In the aftermath of the destruction of St Andrew's Cathedral by fire on 10 May 1961, Bishop McGee petitioned Pope John XXIII (now Saint John XXIII) for permission to site the cathedral in the town of Ayr and to use [[Good Shepherd Cathedral, Ayr|Good Shepherd church]] as his cathedral until such time as a new cathedral could be built. This permission was granted on 12 March 1962, by a decree issued by the Sacred Consistorial Congregation. During the years that followed circumstances changed and no new cathedral was ever built.\n\nSerious problems developed concerning the fabric of the Good Shepherd building and persistent water penetration. More serious than this, however, was the substantial drop in the numbers of those attending the cathedral \u2013 a drop that proved to be ongoing. By September, 2001 Bishop [[Maurice Taylor (bishop)|Maurice Taylor]] had come to the conclusion that Good Shepherd church was no longer a suitable venue for the cathedral. Accordingly, he petitioned the Holy See for permission to transfer the cathedral to St Margaret's, Ayr, the mother church in the area. The decision taken in Rome, in view of the fact that Bishop Taylor was due to retire, was that any decision concerning the future of the cathedral should be left to his successor. Bishop [[John Cunningham (bishop)|John Cunningham]] came to the same conclusion as Bishop Taylor concerning the future of the cathedral. Accordingly, he petitioned [[Pope Benedict XVI]] to transfer the cathedral from Good Shepherd to St Margaret's. The Bishop received an affirmative response and St Margaret's has been the cathedral since 28th 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=www.gallowaydiocese.org.uk/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=n095uF5cPMI%3D&tabid=137 |url=http://www.gallowaydiocese.org.uk/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=n095uF5cPMI%3D&tabid=137 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== History of Clergy ==\n\n=== Parish Priests ===\n(1822-1857)  \t\t\tRev.

Patrick Keegans\n\n(October 2016 \u2013 Present)\tRev. David Borland\n\n== The Nave ==\nThe two windows positioned behind the heavy structure of the gallery presented a particular problem for the designer Susan Bradbury. The gallery obscures the central third of the design, therefore the artist chose a repeat pattern so that the mind automatically fills in the hidden parts. The pattern-work is in the form of Celtic knots which shade from green to blue to represent the relationship between heaven and earth and the unbroken love that God has with everyone. The Celtic theme refers to the history of the congregation, originating in Ireland but now firmly rooted in Scotland, and because it has no beginning and no end this is also a symbol of eternity.\n\nFor the highly visible windows of the nave there are two major Christian themes \"Divine Light\" and \"Water of Life.\" The stained glass was to be made in the Millennium year so the artist concentrated on two verses from the Book of Revelation: Rev 21:23, \"And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof\"; and Rev 22:17, \"Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\"\n\nThese words were writ large on the drawing board throughout the design process, but such themes are open to many interpretations and other ideas played their part too. The window \"Divine Light\" shimmers with all the colours of the spectrum and incorporates ideas such as Let there be Light, The Light of the World, \"A light shines in the darkness, a light that darkness could not overpower\" (Jn 1:5).\n\nOn the south side of the nave the water window reminds us that Ayr has always depended on water, for the River Ayr and the coast have been important for trade and for fishing. Water has a rich and varied spiritual symbolism and there is a great resonance to verses such as: \"He leadeth me beside still waters\" (Ps 23:2); \"for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea\" (Is 11:9); \"But whoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life\" (Jn 4:14). Hopefully people will merge their own ideas with those of the artist.\n\nThe \u2018Water of Life\u2019 window is also a memorial to all those who died in the PanAm 103 disaster.  This window was gifted to the Parish by the American relatives of those involved in the air disaster. This was in recognition of the close bonds that the previous Cathedral Administrator (Patrick Canon Keegans) had with these families as he was Parish Priest in Lockerbie at the time of the disaster.\n\nBoth 'Divine Light' and 'Water of Lifef' windows sparkle with lenses of lead crystal; in one for the theme of light, in the other to represent bubbles as the River Ayr flows into the blue mass of the sea.\n\nThe window at the West side (above the Gallery) of the Cathedral fronting John Street was renovated in 2016.  It has been designed by the same artist as those in 2000 (Susan Bradbury) and again uses modern and symbolic images to interpret a spiritual theme.\n\nThe window consists of three lancets with five tracery lights above.  The new design is inspired by the theme of Praise as described in Psalm 148, represented symbolically by a blaze of golden light.  There are a range of different types of glass within this window including blown glass, etched glass, flash glass, spun rounders and glass lenses\n\nThe title of this window is \u201cGloria in Excelsis Deo\u2026 Glory to God in the Highest\u201d.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Divine Light Window.jpg|Divine Light Window\nFile:Water Of Life.jpg|Water of Life Window\nFile:Glory to God.jpg|Glory to God Window\n</gallery>\n\n== The Sanctuary ==\n[[File:SanctuaryViewGallery.jpg|thumb|View of Sanctuary from Gallery]]\n\n=== Windows ===\nThe windows found in the Sanctuary contrast sharply from the symbolic and modern windows found in the Nave.  These Victorian windows have a strong gothic revival colour scheme and are pictorial by nature.\n\nBehind the high altar are four original stained glass windows dating from 1827.  These windows depict, from left to right:\n\n1) The Virgin Mary\n\n2) Jesus, The Good Shepherd\n\n3) Saint Joseph\n\n4) Saint Margaret of Scotland\n\n=== Altar Furnishings ===\nThe Altar Furnishings were originally designed by AustinSmithLord Architects in 2000 with some minor changes in 2007 to reflect the change in status of the church.\n\nThe Bishops chair is known as The Cathedra. This is where the Bishop will sit when he presides at solemn functions.  It was designed and crafted by Michael Mancini in 2007.\n\nThe Cross is originally from St Mary's Church, Saltcoats.  It was gifted to the Cathedral in the early part of the 2010s.  The sanctuary cross from 1970s - 1990s can be found in the confession room.\n\n==Sacred Heart Chapel==\nThe new windows in both side chapels have a stronger colour scheme to link the modern work with original windows retained on the Sanctuary and Tracepts.\n\nTo the left of the Sanctuary is the Sacred Heart Chapel. In this chapel you will find a modern stained glass window in a ruby red colour filled with hearts.\n\nThe new window of the Sacred Heart Chapel is a meditation on the theme of Love.\n\nThe older original window above the altar containing the Tabernacle shows Christ appearing as the Sacred Heart to St Margaret Mary Alacoque.<gallery>\nFile:Sacred Heard Window.jpg|Sacred Heart Window\nFile:SacredHeartChapel.jpg|Sacred Heart Chapel\n</gallery>\n\n== Our Lady Chapel ==\nThe cooler coloured modern window of the Lady Chapel is a meditation on the theme of grief and consolation and it is inspired by the grief of Our Lady.  This window contains the letter M signifying Mary; a crown to represent Mary as Queen of Heaven and tears of a sorrowing mother.\n\nThe original rose window above the altar depicts the Annunciation, the announcement of the Incarnation by the angel Gabriel to Mary.\n\nBoth modern windows in the side chapels are made of flashed glass imported from France. A flash is a thin layer of colour applied over a clear base, and this thin layer can be etched away with hydrofluoric acid to show the underlying colourless glass or to give any shade between the original deep blue (or red) to the palest tint. The firm shapes of the letters and hearts were made using a plastic film to resist the acid and the more organic textures were created using a bituminous resist.<gallery>\nFile:Our Lady Window.jpg|Our Lady Window\nFile:OurLady.jpg|Our Lady Chapel\n</gallery>\n\n== Reconciliation Room ==\nUnder the gallery is the new Reconciliation Room, this was the old baptistry.  Within this room there are two original stained glass windows.  One of the Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan the other of Jesus preaching in the Temple.  Within this room you will also find the Sanctuary Cross used in St. Margarets between 1970s and 1999.\n\nIn 2016, a Holy Door for the Year of Mercy was opened between the Reconciliation Room and the Porch.\n\n==The Stations of the Cross==\nThe Stations of the Cross trace the story of the Passion using hands as the main symbolic image. There are hands placing a crown of thorns, hands carrying the cross, hands offering comfort, hands in torment and hands tormenting. As well as the images, the colours are also symbolic.\n\nEach time Jesus falls, brown has been used for the earth itself, if you look closely at the hands you will see that at each fall the pain is greater.\n\nA softer warmer brown is used for the wood of the cross and the strength of Simon of Cyrene.\n\nBlue expresses grief in the saddest moments, when Jesus stretches out his hand to his Mother, when he meets the mourning women and when he is taken down from the cross.\n\nRed expresses violence when Christ is stripped of his clothes and at the moment of death. The strongest red defines the most violent act, when the flesh is actually pierced by the nails. At the moment of Jesus\u2019 death the veil of the temple was torn right down the middle. This Station shows the emptiness, the void of death when Jesus has died and is gone.\n\nGreen is used for the gentleness of Veronica, for the living branches of thorns and in the final image, as a symbol of hope beyond death.\n\nEach Station is made of two sheets of glass in the same frame. One is a flashed glass carefully etched to subtly grade the colour across the sheet. The other carries the image which is printed onto the glass with an iron oxide pigment and fired in the kiln. The distance between the two sheets and the transparency of the glass give internal reflections that soften the image and create a kind of dreamy quality.\n\n== Images ==\n<gallery>\nImage:smc_ayr2.jpg|External View (with Cathedral Hall)\nImage:smc_map.jpg|Galloway Diocese in relation to Scotland\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of cathedrals in the United Kingdom]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.rcayr.org.uk Ayr Cathedral homepage]\n*http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/building_full.php?id=229620\n\n{{Roman Catholic Cathedrals in the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[Category:Listed cathedrals in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Religion in Ayr]]\n[[Category:Churches in South Ayrshire|Ayr]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Scotland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2014}}\n{{Infobox church\n| name = Ayr Cathedral\n| fullname = Cathedral of Saint Margaret, Ayr\n| image = smc_ayr.jpg\n| imagesize = \n| imagealt = \n| caption = The Cathedral of Saint Margaret, Ayr\n| pushpin map = Scotland South Ayrshire\n| pushpin label position = \n| pushpin map alt = \n| pushpin mapsize = 220\n| map caption = Location in South Ayrshire\n| coordinates = {{coord|55.464722|-4.626667|region:GB_type:landmark|display=title}}\n| osgraw = <!-- TEXT -->\n| osgridref = <!-- {{gbmappingsmall|TEXT}} -->\n| location = [[Ayr]], [[South Ayrshire]]\n| country = [[Scotland]]\n| denomination = [[Roman Catholic]]\n| tradition = \n| membership = \n| website = [https://web.archive.org/web/20120730022904/http://www.gallowaydiocese.org.uk/Parishes/ParishesInAlphabeticalOrder/AyrCathedralofSaintMargaret/tabid/61/Default.aspx gallowaydiocese.org.uk]\n| former name = The Church of Saint Margaret\n| bull date = \n| consecrated date = \n| people = \n| status = In Use\n| functional status = \n| heritage designation = A-Listed Building\n| designated date = 28 July 2007\n| previous cathedrals = Cathedral of the Good Shepherd, Ayr\n| architect = \n| architectural type = \n| style = Gothic\n| years built = \n| groundbreaking = \n| completed date = \n| construction cost = \n| closed date = \n| demolished date = \n| capacity = 350\n| length = \n| length nave = \n| length choir = \n| width = \n| width nave = \n| width transepts = \n| height = \n| height nave = \n| height choir = \n| dome quantity = \n| dome height outer = \n| dome height inner = \n| dome dia outer = \n| dome dia inner = \n| tower quantity = \n| tower height = \n| spire quantity = \n| spire height = \n| archdiocese = \n| metropolis = \n| diocese = [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Galloway|Galloway]]\n| diocese start = \n| province = [[Province of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh|St Andrews and Edinburgh]]\n| archbishop = \n| bishop = William Nolan\n| dean = \n| provost = \n| canon = Patrick Keegans, John McGee & Alexander McGarry,\n| reader = \n| director = \n| organist = \n| logo = \n| logosize = \n| logolink = \n| logoalt = \n}}\n\n'''The Cathedral Church of Saint Margaret''', also known as Ayr Cathedral, is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[cathedral]] located in [[Ayr]], [[Scotland]].

Patrick Keegans\n\n(October 2016 \u2013 Present)\tRev. David Borland\n\n== The Nave ==\nThe two windows positioned behind the heavy structure of the gallery presented a particular problem for the designer Susan Bradbury. The gallery obscures the central third of the design, therefore the artist chose a repeat pattern so that the mind automatically fills in the hidden parts. The pattern-work is in the form of Celtic knots which shade from green to blue to represent the relationship between heaven and earth and the unbroken love that God has with everyone. The Celtic theme refers to the history of the congregation, originating in Ireland but now firmly rooted in Scotland, and because it has no beginning and no end this is also a symbol of eternity.\n\nFor the highly visible windows of the nave there are two major Christian themes \"Divine Light\" and \"Water of Life.\" The stained glass was to be made in the Millennium year so the artist concentrated on two verses from the Book of Revelation: Rev 21:23, \"And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof\"; and Rev 22:17, \"Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.\"\n\nThese words were writ large on the drawing board throughout the design process, but such themes are open to many interpretations and other ideas played their part too. The window \"Divine Light\" shimmers with all the colours of the spectrum and incorporates ideas such as Let there be Light, The Light of the World, \"A light shines in the darkness, a light that darkness could not overpower\" (Jn 1:5).\n\nOn the south side of the nave the water window reminds us that Ayr has always depended on water, for the River Ayr and the coast have been important for trade and for fishing. Water has a rich and varied spiritual symbolism and there is a great resonance to verses such as: \"He leadeth me beside still waters\" (Ps 23:2); \"for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea\" (Is 11:9); \"But whoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life\" (Jn 4:14). Hopefully people will merge their own ideas with those of the artist.\n\nThe \u2018Water of Life\u2019 window is also a memorial to all those who died in the PanAm 103 disaster.  This window was gifted to the Parish by the American relatives of those involved in the air disaster. This was in recognition of the close bonds that the previous Cathedral Administrator (Patrick Canon Keegans) had with these families as he was Parish Priest in Lockerbie at the time of the disaster.\n\nBoth 'Divine Light' and 'Water of Lifef' windows sparkle with lenses of lead crystal; in one for the theme of light, in the other to represent bubbles as the River Ayr flows into the blue mass of the sea.\n\nThe window at the West side (above the Gallery) of the Cathedral fronting John Street was renovated in 2016.  It has been designed by the same artist as those in 2000 (Susan Bradbury) and again uses modern and symbolic images to interpret a spiritual theme.\n\nThe window consists of three lancets with five tracery lights above.  The new design is inspired by the theme of Praise as described in Psalm 148, represented symbolically by a blaze of golden light.  There are a range of different types of glass within this window including blown glass, etched glass, flash glass, spun rounders and glass lenses\n\nThe title of this window is \u201cGloria in Excelsis Deo\u2026 Glory to God in the Highest\u201d.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Divine Light Window.jpg|Divine Light Window\nFile:Water Of Life.jpg|Water of Life Window\nFile:Glory to God.jpg|Glory to God Window\n</gallery>\n\n== The Sanctuary ==\n[[File:SanctuaryViewGallery.jpg|thumb|View of Sanctuary from Gallery]]\n\n=== Windows ===\nThe windows found in the Sanctuary contrast sharply from the symbolic and modern windows found in the Nave.  These Victorian windows have a strong gothic revival colour scheme and are pictorial by nature.\n\nBehind the high altar are four original stained glass windows dating from 1827.  These windows depict, from left to right:\n\n1) The Virgin Mary\n\n2) Jesus, The Good Shepherd\n\n3) Saint Joseph\n\n4) Saint Margaret of Scotland\n\n=== Altar Furnishings ===\nThe Altar Furnishings were originally designed by AustinSmithLord Architects in 2000 with some minor changes in 2007 to reflect the change in status of the church.\n\nThe Bishops chair is known as The Cathedra. This is where the Bishop will sit when he presides at solemn functions.  It was designed and crafted by Michael Mancini in 2007.\n\nThe Cross is originally from St Mary's Church, Saltcoats.  It was gifted to the Cathedral in the early part of the 2010s.  The sanctuary cross from 1970s - 1990s can be found in the confession room.\n\n==Sacred Heart Chapel==\nThe new windows in both side chapels have a stronger colour scheme to link the modern work with original windows retained on the Sanctuary and Tracepts.\n\nTo the left of the Sanctuary is the Sacred Heart Chapel. In this chapel you will find a modern stained glass window in a ruby red colour filled with hearts.\n\nThe new window of the Sacred Heart Chapel is a meditation on the theme of Love.\n\nThe older original window above the altar containing the Tabernacle shows Christ appearing as the Sacred Heart to St Margaret Mary Alacoque.<gallery>\nFile:Sacred Heard Window.jpg|Sacred Heart Window\nFile:SacredHeartChapel.jpg|Sacred Heart Chapel\n</gallery>\n\n== Our Lady Chapel ==\nThe cooler coloured modern window of the Lady Chapel is a meditation on the theme of grief and consolation and it is inspired by the grief of Our Lady.  This window contains the letter M signifying Mary; a crown to represent Mary as Queen of Heaven and tears of a sorrowing mother.\n\nThe original rose window above the altar depicts the Annunciation, the announcement of the Incarnation by the angel Gabriel to Mary.\n\nBoth modern windows in the side chapels are made of flashed glass imported from France. A flash is a thin layer of colour applied over a clear base, and this thin layer can be etched away with hydrofluoric acid to show the underlying colourless glass or to give any shade between the original deep blue (or red) to the palest tint. The firm shapes of the letters and hearts were made using a plastic film to resist the acid and the more organic textures were created using a bituminous resist.<gallery>\nFile:Our Lady Window.jpg|Our Lady Window\nFile:OurLady.jpg|Our Lady Chapel\n</gallery>\n\n== Reconciliation Room ==\nUnder the gallery is the new Reconciliation Room, this was the old baptistry.  Within this room there are two original stained glass windows.  One of the Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan the other of Jesus preaching in the Temple.  Within this room you will also find the Sanctuary Cross used in St. Margarets between 1970s and 1999.\n\nIn 2016, a Holy Door for the Year of Mercy was opened between the Reconciliation Room and the Porch.\n\n==The Stations of the Cross==\nThe Stations of the Cross trace the story of the Passion using hands as the main symbolic image. There are hands placing a crown of thorns, hands carrying the cross, hands offering comfort, hands in torment and hands tormenting. As well as the images, the colours are also symbolic.\n\nEach time Jesus falls, brown has been used for the earth itself, if you look closely at the hands you will see that at each fall the pain is greater.\n\nA softer warmer brown is used for the wood of the cross and the strength of Simon of Cyrene.\n\nBlue expresses grief in the saddest moments, when Jesus stretches out his hand to his Mother, when he meets the mourning women and when he is taken down from the cross.\n\nRed expresses violence when Christ is stripped of his clothes and at the moment of death. The strongest red defines the most violent act, when the flesh is actually pierced by the nails. At the moment of Jesus\u2019 death the veil of the temple was torn right down the middle. This Station shows the emptiness, the void of death when Jesus has died and is gone.\n\nGreen is used for the gentleness of Veronica, for the living branches of thorns and in the final image, as a symbol of hope beyond death.\n\nEach Station is made of two sheets of glass in the same frame. One is a flashed glass carefully etched to subtly grade the colour across the sheet. The other carries the image which is printed onto the glass with an iron oxide pigment and fired in the kiln. The distance between the two sheets and the transparency of the glass give internal reflections that soften the image and create a kind of dreamy quality.\n\n== Images ==\n<gallery>\nImage:smc_ayr2.jpg|External View (with Cathedral Hall)\nImage:smc_map.jpg|Galloway Diocese in relation to Scotland\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of cathedrals in the United Kingdom]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.rcayr.org.uk Ayr Cathedral homepage]\n*http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/building_full.php?id=229620\n\n{{Roman Catholic Cathedrals in the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[Category:Listed cathedrals in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Religion in Ayr]]\n[[Category:Churches in South Ayrshire|Ayr]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Scotland]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory of St Margaret's Ayr:fmt", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayr_Cathedral"}

These include:\n\n=== Cell lines ===\nA fundamental missing piece in the advancement of cultured meat is the availability of the appropriate cellular materials. While some methods and protocols from human and mouse cell culture may apply to agricultural cellular materials, it has become clear that most do not. This is evidenced by the fact that established protocols for creating human and mouse embryonic stem cells have not succeeded in establishing ungulate embryonic stem cell lines.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2007|title=Challenges and prospects for the establishment of embryonic stem cells of domesticated ungulates|journal=Animal Reproduction Science|volume=98|issue=1\u20132|doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2006.10.009|pmid=17097839|pages=147\u201368 | last1 = Keefer | first1 = CL | last2 = Pant | first2 = D | last3 = Blomberg | first3 = L | last4 = Talbot | first4 = NC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2008|title=The pursuit of ES cell lines of domesticated ungulates|journal=Stem Cell Rev|volume=4|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s12015-008-9026-0|pmid=18612851|via=|pages=235\u201354 | last1 = Talbot | first1 = NC | last2 = Le Ann | first2 = Blomberg|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1232876}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|date=2016|title=Embryonic Stem Cells and Fetal Developmental Models|journal=Fetal Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-3483-6_5|pmid=|pages=81\u201399|series=Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine|last1=Nowak-Imialek|first1=Monika|last2=Niemann|first2=Heiner|isbn=978-1-4939-3481-2}}</ref>\n\nThe ideal criteria for cell lines for the purpose of cultured meat production include immortality, high proliferative ability, surface independence, serum independence, and tissue-forming ability.

FBS is a blood product extracted from fetal calves. This product supplies cells with nutrients and stimulating growth factors, but is unsustainable and resource-heavy to produce, with large batch-to-batch variation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van der Valk|first=J|date=2010|title=Optimization of chemically defined cell culture media--replacing fetal bovine serum in mammalian in vitro methods|journal=Toxicol in Vitro|volume=24|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.tiv.2010.03.016|pmid=20362047|pages=1053\u201363|hdl=1874/191398}}</ref> Cultured meat companies have been putting significant resources into alternative growth media.\n\nAfter the creation of the cell lines, efforts to remove serum from the growth media are key to the advancement of cellular agriculture as fetal bovine serum has been the target of most criticisms of cellular agriculture and cultured meat production.

Each increase in size will require a re-optimization of various parameters such as unit operations, fluid dynamics, mass transfer, and reaction kinetics.\n\n=== Scaffold materials ===\nFor cells to form tissue, it is helpful for a material scaffold to be added to provide structure. Scaffolds are crucial for cells to form tissues larger than 100&nbsp;\u00b5m across. An ideal scaffold must be non-toxic for the cells, edible, and allow for the flow of nutrients and oxygen. It must also be cheap and easy to produce on a large scale without the need for animals.\n\n=== 3D tissue systems ===\nThe final phase for creating cultured meat involves bringing together all the previous pieces of research to create large (>100&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter) pieces of tissue that can be made of mass-produced cells without the need for serum, where the scaffold is suitable for cells and humans.\n\n== Applications ==\nWhile the majority of discussion has been around food applications, particular cultured meat, cellular agriculture can be used to create any kind of agricultural product, including those that never involved animals to begin with, like Ginkgo Biowork's fragrances.\n\n=== Meat ===\n\n*Impossible Foods\n*:The Impossible Burger produced by [[Impossible Foods]] contains heme, which the company claims gives the burger its bloody look and taste.

These include:\n\n=== Cell lines ===\nA fundamental missing piece in the advancement of cultured meat is the availability of the appropriate cellular materials. While some methods and protocols from human and mouse cell culture may apply to agricultural cellular materials, it has become clear that most do not. This is evidenced by the fact that established protocols for creating human and mouse embryonic stem cells have not succeeded in establishing ungulate embryonic stem cell lines.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2007|title=Challenges and prospects for the establishment of embryonic stem cells of domesticated ungulates|journal=Animal Reproduction Science|volume=98|issue=1\u20132|doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2006.10.009|pmid=17097839|pages=147\u201368 | last1 = Keefer | first1 = CL | last2 = Pant | first2 = D | last3 = Blomberg | first3 = L | last4 = Talbot | first4 = NC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2008|title=The pursuit of ES cell lines of domesticated ungulates|journal=Stem Cell Rev|volume=4|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s12015-008-9026-0|pmid=18612851|via=|pages=235\u201354 | last1 = Talbot | first1 = NC | last2 = Le Ann | first2 = Blomberg|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1232876}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|date=2016|title=Embryonic Stem Cells and Fetal Developmental Models|journal=Fetal Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-3483-6_5|pmid=|pages=81\u201399|series=Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine|last1=Nowak-Imialek|first1=Monika|last2=Niemann|first2=Heiner|isbn=978-1-4939-3481-2}}</ref>\n\nThe ideal criteria for cell lines for the purpose of cultured meat production include immortality, high proliferative ability, surface independence, serum independence, and tissue-forming ability.

FBS is a blood product extracted from fetal calves. This product supplies cells with nutrients and stimulating growth factors, but is unsustainable and resource-heavy to produce, with large batch-to-batch variation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van der Valk|first=J|date=2010|title=Optimization of chemically defined cell culture media--replacing fetal bovine serum in mammalian in vitro methods|journal=Toxicol in Vitro|volume=24|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.tiv.2010.03.016|pmid=20362047|pages=1053\u201363|hdl=1874/191398}}</ref> Cultured meat companies have been putting significant resources into alternative growth media.\n\nAfter the creation of the cell lines, efforts to remove serum from the growth media are key to the advancement of cellular agriculture as fetal bovine serum has been the target of most criticisms of cellular agriculture and cultured meat production.

Each increase in size will require a re-optimization of various parameters such as unit operations, fluid dynamics, mass transfer, and reaction kinetics.\n\n=== Scaffold materials ===\nFor cells to form tissue, it is helpful for a material scaffold to be added to provide structure. Scaffolds are crucial for cells to form tissues larger than 100&nbsp;\u00b5m across. An ideal scaffold must be non-toxic for the cells, edible, and allow for the flow of nutrients and oxygen. It must also be cheap and easy to produce on a large scale without the need for animals.\n\n=== 3D tissue systems ===\nThe final phase for creating cultured meat involves bringing together all the previous pieces of research to create large (>100&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter) pieces of tissue that can be made of mass-produced cells without the need for serum, where the scaffold is suitable for cells and humans.\n\n== Applications ==\nWhile the majority of discussion has been around food applications, particular cultured meat, cellular agriculture can be used to create any kind of agricultural product, including those that never involved animals to begin with, like Ginkgo Biowork's fragrances.\n\n=== Meat ===\n\n*Impossible Foods\n*:The Impossible Burger produced by [[Impossible Foods]] contains heme, which the company claims gives the burger its bloody look and taste.

The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref>[https://wkusports.com/documents/2019/7/17/2019_WKU_Football_Media_Guide.pdf WKU Football Media Guide retrieved 31 March 2020.]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T. Smith Stadium]]. This was 20 years after the 1992 \"Save the Program\" season and 10 years after the 2002 championship season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/club-named-for-harbaugh/article_e11bf624-0397-11e2-9665-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Club named for Harbaugh|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\n====David Elson (2003\u20132009)====\nAfter serving on [[Jack Harbaugh|Harbaugh]]'s coaching staff seven seasons, [[David Elson]] was promoted to head coach where he led the Hilltoppers for seven seasons. Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up?

Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]].

Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His last season as football coach the team claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In 1930, James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in 1932 seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the 1937 season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart which started a long series of winning seasons.

Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up?

The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]].

A typical yellowjacket worker is about 12&nbsp;mm (0.5&nbsp;in) long, with alternating bands on the abdomen; the queen is larger, about 19&nbsp;mm (0.75&nbsp;in) long (the different patterns on their abdomens help separate various species).\n\nYellowjackets are sometimes mistakenly called \"[[bee]]s\" (as in \"meat bees\"), given that they are similar in size and  general coloration to [[honey bee]]s, but yellowjackets are actually wasps. In contrast to honey bees, yellowjackets have yellow or white markings, are not covered with tan-brown dense hair on their bodies, do not carry pollen, and do not have the flattened, hairy hind legs used to carry it.\n\nYellowjackets have lance-like stingers with small barbs, and typically sting repeatedly,<ref name = Akre/> though occasionally a stinger becomes lodged and pulls free of the wasp's body; the [[venom]], like most [[Bee sting|bee]] and wasp venoms, is primarily dangerous to only those humans who are [[allergic]] or are stung many times. All species have yellow or white on their faces. Their mouthparts are well-developed with strong [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] for capturing and chewing insects, with [[Proboscis|probosces]] for sucking nectar, fruit, and other juices. Yellowjackets build nests in trees, shrubs, or in protected places such as inside man-made structures, or in soil cavities, tree stumps, mouse burrows, etc. They build them from wood fiber they chew into a paper-like pulp. Many other insects exhibit [[protective mimicry]] of aggressive, stinging yellowjackets; in addition to numerous [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s ([[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]]), the list includes some [[fly|flies]], [[moth]]s, and [[beetle]]s ([[Batesian mimicry]]).\n\nYellowjackets' closest relatives, the [[hornet]]s, closely resemble them, but have larger heads, seen especially in the large distance from the eyes to the back of the head.<ref name = Akre/> {{clr}}\n\n== Life cycle and habits ==\n[[File:Vespula 0078.JPG|thumb|left|''Vespula squamosa'' queen]]\nYellowjackets are social hunters living in colonies containing workers, queens, and males (drones). Colonies are annual with only inseminated queens [[overwinter]]ing. Fertilized queens are found in protected places such as in hollow logs, in stumps, under bark, in leaf litter, in soil cavities, and in man-made structures. Queens emerge during the warm days of late spring or early summer, select a nest site, and build a small paper nest in which they lay eggs. After eggs hatch from the 30 to 50 brood cells, the queen feeds the young larvae for about 18 to 20&nbsp;days. [[Larvae]] [[pupate]], then emerge later as small, infertile females called workers. Workers in the colony take over caring for the larvae, feeding them with chewed up meat or fruit. By midsummer, the first adult workers emerge and assume the tasks of nest expansion, foraging for food, care of the queen and larvae, and colony defense.\n\nFrom this time until her death in the autumn, the queen remains inside the nest, laying eggs. The colony then expands rapidly, reaching a maximum size of 4000 to 5000<ref>Lives of Social Insects Peggy Larson p.13</ref> workers and a nest of 10,000 to 15,000 cells in late summer. (This is true of most species in most areas; however, ''V. squamosa'', in the southern part of its range, may build much larger perennial colonies populated by scores of queens, tens of thousands of workers, and hundreds of thousands of cells.) At peak size, reproductive cells are built with new males and queens produced. Adult reproductives remain in the nest fed by the workers. New queens build up fat reserves to overwinter. Adult reproductives leave the parent colony to mate. After mating, males quickly die, while fertilized queens seek protected places to overwinter. Parent colony workers dwindle, usually leaving the nest to die, as does the foundress queen. Abandoned nests rapidly decompose and disintegrate during the winter. They can persist as long as they are kept dry, but are rarely used again. In the spring, the cycle is repeated; weather in the spring is the most important factor in colony establishment.\n\nThe diet of the adult yellowjacket consists primarily of items rich in sugars and [[carbohydrates]], such as fruits, flower nectar, and tree sap. Larvae feed on proteins derived from insects, meats, and fish, which are collected by the adults, which chew and condition them before feeding them to the larvae. Many of the insects collected by the adults are considered pest species, making the yellowjacket beneficial to [[agriculture]].<ref name=\"motherearthnews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/pest-control/benefits-of-wasps-yellow-jackets-zw0z1303zkin.aspx|title=About Yellowjackets and the Benefits of Wasps in the Garden|work=Mother Earth News}}</ref> Larvae, in return, secrete a sugar material to be eaten by the adults; this exchange is a form of [[trophallaxis]]. In late summer, foraging workers pursue other food sources from meats to ripe fruits, or scavenge human garbage, sodas, picnics, etc., as additional sugar is needed to foster the next generation's queens.<ref name=\"motherearthnews.com\"/>\n\n== Notable species ==\n*European yellowjackets, the German wasp (''[[Vespula germanica]]''), and the common wasp (''[[Vespula vulgaris]]'') were originally native to Europe, but are now established in southern Africa, New Zealand, and eastern Australia\n*The North American yellowjacket (''[[Vespula alascensis]]''), [[eastern yellowjacket]] (''Vespula maculifrons''), western yellowjacket (''[[Vespula pensylvanica]]''), and prairie yellowjacket (''[[Vespula atropilosa]]'') are native to North America.\n*[[Vespula squamosa|Southern yellowjacket]] (''Vespula squamosa'')\n*[[Bald-faced hornet]]s (''Dolichovespula maculata'') belong among the yellowjackets rather than the true hornets.

This feature is shared with some true hornets, which has led to some naming confusion.\n\n''Vespula'' species, in contrast, build concealed nests, usually underground.\n\nYellowjacket nests usually last for only one season, dying off in winter. The nest is started by a single queen, called the \"foundress\". Typically, a nest can reach the size of a basketball by the end of a season. In parts of Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, and southwestern coastal areas of the United States, the winters are mild enough to allow nest overwintering. Nests that survive multiple seasons become massive and often possess multiple egg-laying queens.<ref name=tuscaloosa>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060717/NEWS/607180308/1007/9112002|author=|date=|title=Yellow jackets building enormous nests|publisher=TuscaloosaNews.com|accessdate=2013-01-14}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aces.edu/department/extcomm/npa/daily/archives/002193.php Extension Daily: What is Causing Super-sized Yellow Jacket Nests?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629105352/http://www.aces.edu/department/extcomm/npa/daily/archives/002193.php |date=2007-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n== In the United States ==\nThe [[Vespula germanica|German yellowjacket]] (''V. germanica'') first appeared in Ohio in 1975, and has now become the dominant species over the eastern yellowjacket. It is bold and aggressive, and can sting repeatedly and painfully. It will mark aggressors and pursue them. It is often confused with ''[[Polistes dominula]]'', an invasive species in the United States, due to their very similar pattern. The German yellowjacket builds its nests in cavities\u2014not necessarily underground\u2014with the peak worker population in temperate areas between 1000 and 3000 individuals between May and August. Each colony produces several thousand new reproductives after this point through November. The eastern yellowjacket builds its nests underground, also with the peak worker population between 1000 and 3000 individuals, similar to the German yellowjacket. Nests are built entirely of wood fiber and are completely enclosed except for a small entrance at the bottom. The color of the paper is highly dependent on the source of the wood fibers used. The nests contain multiple, horizontal tiers of combs within. Larvae hang within the combs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn the southeastern United States, where southern yellowjacket (''[[Vespula squamosa]]'') nests may persist through the winter, [[Group size measures|colony sizes]] of this species may reach 100,000 adult wasps.<ref name=tuscaloosa/> The same kind of nest expansion has occurred in [[Hawaii]] with the invasive western yellowjacket (''V. pensylvanica'').<ref>[http://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/hcsu/projects.php \"Response of Native Plant Communities to Alien Species Management on the Island of Hawaii\"] on the Hawaiian Cooperative Studies Program website</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Giovanna Garzoni (Italian - Still Life with Bowl of Citrons - Google Art Project (detail with wasp).jpg|thumb|Detail of [[Giovanna Garzoni]]'s ''Still Life with Bowl of Citrons'', 17th century]]\n\nThe yellowjacket's most visible place in American popular culture is as a [[mascot]], most famously with the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|Yellow Jackets]], represented by the mascot [[Buzz (mascot)|Buzz]].

A typical yellowjacket worker is about 12&nbsp;mm (0.5&nbsp;in) long, with alternating bands on the abdomen; the queen is larger, about 19&nbsp;mm (0.75&nbsp;in) long (the different patterns on their abdomens help separate various species).\n\nYellowjackets are sometimes mistakenly called \"[[bee]]s\" (as in \"meat bees\"), given that they are similar in size and  general coloration to [[honey bee]]s, but yellowjackets are actually wasps. In contrast to honey bees, yellowjackets have yellow or white markings, are not covered with tan-brown dense hair on their bodies, do not carry pollen, and do not have the flattened, hairy hind legs used to carry it.\n\nYellowjackets have lance-like stingers with small barbs, and typically sting repeatedly,<ref name = Akre/> though occasionally a stinger becomes lodged and pulls free of the wasp's body; the [[venom]], like most [[Bee sting|bee]] and wasp venoms, is primarily dangerous to only those humans who are [[allergic]] or are stung many times. All species have yellow or white on their faces. Their mouthparts are well-developed with strong [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] for capturing and chewing insects, with [[Proboscis|probosces]] for sucking nectar, fruit, and other juices. Yellowjackets build nests in trees, shrubs, or in protected places such as inside man-made structures, or in soil cavities, tree stumps, mouse burrows, etc. They build them from wood fiber they chew into a paper-like pulp. Many other insects exhibit [[protective mimicry]] of aggressive, stinging yellowjackets; in addition to numerous [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s ([[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]]), the list includes some [[fly|flies]], [[moth]]s, and [[beetle]]s ([[Batesian mimicry]]).\n\nYellowjackets' closest relatives, the [[hornet]]s, closely resemble them, but have larger heads, seen especially in the large distance from the eyes to the back of the head.<ref name = Akre/> {{clr}}\n\n== Life cycle and habits ==\n[[File:Vespula 0078.JPG|thumb|left|''Vespula squamosa'' queen]]\nYellowjackets are social hunters living in colonies containing workers, queens, and males (drones). Colonies are annual with only inseminated queens [[overwinter]]ing. Fertilized queens are found in protected places such as in hollow logs, in stumps, under bark, in leaf litter, in soil cavities, and in man-made structures. Queens emerge during the warm days of late spring or early summer, select a nest site, and build a small paper nest in which they lay eggs. After eggs hatch from the 30 to 50 brood cells, the queen feeds the young larvae for about 18 to 20&nbsp;days. [[Larvae]] [[pupate]], then emerge later as small, infertile females called workers. Workers in the colony take over caring for the larvae, feeding them with chewed up meat or fruit. By midsummer, the first adult workers emerge and assume the tasks of nest expansion, foraging for food, care of the queen and larvae, and colony defense.\n\nFrom this time until her death in the autumn, the queen remains inside the nest, laying eggs. The colony then expands rapidly, reaching a maximum size of 4000 to 5000<ref>Lives of Social Insects Peggy Larson p.13</ref> workers and a nest of 10,000 to 15,000 cells in late summer. (This is true of most species in most areas; however, ''V. squamosa'', in the southern part of its range, may build much larger perennial colonies populated by scores of queens, tens of thousands of workers, and hundreds of thousands of cells.) At peak size, reproductive cells are built with new males and queens produced. Adult reproductives remain in the nest fed by the workers. New queens build up fat reserves to overwinter. Adult reproductives leave the parent colony to mate. After mating, males quickly die, while fertilized queens seek protected places to overwinter. Parent colony workers dwindle, usually leaving the nest to die, as does the foundress queen. Abandoned nests rapidly decompose and disintegrate during the winter. They can persist as long as they are kept dry, but are rarely used again. In the spring, the cycle is repeated; weather in the spring is the most important factor in colony establishment.\n\nThe diet of the adult yellowjacket consists primarily of items rich in sugars and [[carbohydrates]], such as fruits, flower nectar, and tree sap. Larvae feed on proteins derived from insects, meats, and fish, which are collected by the adults, which chew and condition them before feeding them to the larvae. Many of the insects collected by the adults are considered pest species, making the yellowjacket beneficial to [[agriculture]].<ref name=\"motherearthnews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/pest-control/benefits-of-wasps-yellow-jackets-zw0z1303zkin.aspx|title=About Yellowjackets and the Benefits of Wasps in the Garden|work=Mother Earth News}}</ref> Larvae, in return, secrete a sugar material to be eaten by the adults; this exchange is a form of [[trophallaxis]]. In late summer, foraging workers pursue other food sources from meats to ripe fruits, or scavenge human garbage, sodas, picnics, etc., as additional sugar is needed to foster the next generation's queens.<ref name=\"motherearthnews.com\"/>\n\n== Notable species ==\n*European yellowjackets, the German wasp (''[[Vespula germanica]]''), and the common wasp (''[[Vespula vulgaris]]'') were originally native to Europe, but are now established in southern Africa, New Zealand, and eastern Australia\n*The North American yellowjacket (''[[Vespula alascensis]]''), [[eastern yellowjacket]] (''Vespula maculifrons''), western yellowjacket (''[[Vespula pensylvanica]]''), and prairie yellowjacket (''[[Vespula atropilosa]]'') are native to North America.\n*[[Vespula squamosa|Southern yellowjacket]] (''Vespula squamosa'')\n*[[Bald-faced hornet]]s (''Dolichovespula maculata'') belong among the yellowjackets rather than the true hornets.

This feature is shared with some true hornets, which has led to some naming confusion.\n\n''Vespula'' species, in contrast, build concealed nests, usually underground.\n\nYellowjacket nests usually last for only one season, dying off in winter. The nest is started by a single queen, called the \"foundress\". Typically, a nest can reach the size of a basketball by the end of a season. In parts of Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, and southwestern coastal areas of the United States, the winters are mild enough to allow nest overwintering.

It is often confused with ''[[Polistes dominula]]'', an invasive species in the United States, due to their very similar pattern. The German yellowjacket builds its nests in cavities\u2014not necessarily underground\u2014with the peak worker population in temperate areas between 1000 and 3000 individuals between May and August. Each colony produces several thousand new reproductives after this point through November. The eastern yellowjacket builds its nests underground, also with the peak worker population between 1000 and 3000 individuals, similar to the German yellowjacket. Nests are built entirely of wood fiber and are completely enclosed except for a small entrance at the bottom. The color of the paper is highly dependent on the source of the wood fibers used. The nests contain multiple, horizontal tiers of combs within.

The early harbors of Mytilene were linked during ancient times by a channel 700 meters long and 30 meters wide. The Roman writer Longus speaks of white stone bridges linking the two sides. The Greek word \u03b5\u1f54\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''e\u00faripos'' is a commonly-used term when referring to a strait. The strait allowed ancient warships called [[trireme]]s, with three tiers of rowers or more. The boats that passed were ca. six meters wide plus oars and had depth of two meters.\n\nThe areas of the city that were densely populated connected the two bodies of land with marble bridges. They usually followed a curved line. The strait begins at the old market called Apano Skala. It was also close to Metropolis Street and ended at the Southern Harbor. One could argue that the channel transversed what is now called Ermou Street. Over time the strait began to collect silt and earth. There was also human intervention for the protection of the [[Castle of Mytilene]].

Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey's theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in Rome) on the hill on the western side of town. Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena.  Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman).  Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city.  It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] had written.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nArchaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the [[Castle of Mytilene]] by the [[University of British Columbia]] and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of [[Demeter]] and [[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]] of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the [[Gattelusi]], the medieval [[Genoa|Genoese]] family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era. The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia.  Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses. Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents. Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves, some remained. The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.\n\nOther excavations done jointly with the 20th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a \"vampire\" burial, a middle aged man with {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century AD) to remains of [[Hellenistic]] structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of [[Aeolic]] grey wares. A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure.  The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins.  The latter museum is especially rich in [[mosaic]]s and [[sculpture]], including the famous late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic floor from the \"House of Menander\" with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright.  There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] under the direction of the archeologist Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|University of the Aegean}}\n[[File:Experimental Lyseum School of Mytilene.JPG|thumb|200px|Experimental Lyceum School of Mytilene]]\n\nThere are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven [[Secondary education|lyceums]], and eight [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the [[University of the Aegean]].

Mytilene is the [[capital city]] and port of the island of [[Lesbos]] and also the capital and administration center of the [[North Aegean]] Region. The seat of the governor of the [[North Aegean]] Region is Mytilene, such as the headquarters of the [[University of the Aegean]].\n\nMytilene is one of the 13 [[municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]] (counties) on the island of [[Lesbos]]. Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island. It is also the seat of a [[metropolitan bishop]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 59v 3.png|thumb|left|160px|[[Pittacus of Mytilene]] (c. 640 \u2013 568 BC), one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]; woodcut from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].]]\n[[File:Port Mytilene.jpg|thumb|View of the port, with the dome of Saint Therapon.]]\n[[File:Lesbos Mytilene01.JPG|thumb|The church of [[Saint Therapon (Mytilene)|Saint Therapon]] at the port]]\n\nAs an ancient city, lying off the east coast, Mytilene was initially confined to a small island just offshore that later was joined to Lesbos, creating a north and south harbor. The early harbors of Mytilene were linked during ancient times by a channel 700 meters long and 30 meters wide. The Roman writer Longus speaks of white stone bridges linking the two sides. The Greek word \u03b5\u1f54\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''e\u00faripos'' is a commonly-used term when referring to a strait. The strait allowed ancient warships called [[trireme]]s, with three tiers of rowers or more. The boats that passed were ca. six meters wide plus oars and had depth of two meters.\n\nThe areas of the city that were densely populated connected the two bodies of land with marble bridges. They usually followed a curved line. The strait begins at the old market called Apano Skala. It was also close to Metropolis Street and ended at the Southern Harbor. One could argue that the channel transversed what is now called Ermou Street. Over time the strait began to collect silt and earth. There was also human intervention for the protection of the [[Castle of Mytilene]]. The strait eventually filled with earth.<ref>[http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 Harbor of Mytilene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052712/http://www.ellinikiaktoploia.net/index.php/2011-06-28-15-10-27/2914-2012-02-26-08-51-08 |date=2014-08-08 }} accessed July 31, 2014</ref>\n\nMytilene contested successfully with [[Mithymna]] in the north of the island for the leadership of the island in the seventh century BC and became the centre of the island's prosperous eastern hinterland.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Her most famous citizens were the poets [[Sappho]] and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and the statesman [[Pittacus of Mitylene|Pittacus]] (one of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]).

The Athenian public assembly voted to massacre all the men of the city and to sell the women and children into slavery but the next day in the [[Mytilenian Debate]] changed its mind. A fast [[trireme]] sailed the {{convert|186|nmi|km}} in less than a day and brought the decision to cancel the general massacre, but a thousand citizens were executed for taking part in the rebellion.\n\n[[Aristotle]] lived on Mytilene for two years, 337\u2013335 BC, with his friend and successor, [[Theophrastus]] (a native of the island), after being the tutor to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], son of King [[Philip II of Macedon]].<ref>[http://www.ivu.org/history/greece_rome/theophrastus.html Bio of Theophrastus] accessed December 11, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/authors/about_aristotle.html Grade Saver bio on Aristotle] accessed December 11, 2007</ref><!---but not Alexander the Great just yet.

From Mytilene they continued towards [[Chios]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|20:15|KJV}}).\n\nThe novel ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' by [[Longus]], is set in the country around it and opens with a description of the city.\n\nScholar and historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], also known as Zacharias of Mytilene was from Mytilene and lived from 465 to around 536. He was made Bishop of Mytilene and may have been a [[Chalcedonian Christian]].

The [[Church of St. Symeon, Mytilene]] venerates one of the three brothers.\n\nCatching the eye of the Empress [[Zo\u00eb Porphyrogenita]], [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] was exiled to Mytilene on the island of Lesbos by her second husband, [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]]. The death of Michael IV and the overthrow of Michael V in 1042 led to Constantine being recalled from his place of exile and appointed as a judge in Greece.<ref>Finlay George \"History of the Byzantine Empire from 716 \u2013 1057\" William Blackwood & Sons, 1853</ref>\n \nLesbos and Mytilene had an established [[Jews|Jewish population]] since ancient times.

In 1198, the [[Republic of Venice]] obtained the right to commerce from the city's port.\n\nIn the 13th century, it was captured by the [[Emperor of Nicaea]], [[Theodore I Laskaris]].  In 1335, the Byzantines, with the help of Ottoman forces, reconquered the island, then property of the Genoese nobleman [[Domenico Cattaneo]]. In 1355, emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] gave it to the Genoese adventurer [[Francesco I Gattilusio|Francesco Gattilusio]], who married the emperor's sister, Maria.  They renovated the fortress in 1373, and it remained in Genoese hands until 1462, when it was [[Ottoman conquest of Lesbos#Siege|besieged and captured]] by the Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]].\n\nMytilene along with the rest of Lesbos remained under Ottoman control until the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, when in November it became part of the [[Kingdom of Greece]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\n{{wide image|Panorama Mytilini.jpg|900px|align-cap=center|View of the seafront}}\n\nMytilene is located in the southeastern part of the island, north and east of the Bay of Gera.

Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey's theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in Rome) on the hill on the western side of town. Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena.  Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman).  Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city.  It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] had written.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nArchaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the [[Castle of Mytilene]] by the [[University of British Columbia]] and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of [[Demeter]] and [[Kore (sculpture)|Kore]] of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the [[Gattelusi]], the medieval [[Genoa|Genoese]] family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era. The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia.  Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses. Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents. Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves, some remained. The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.\n\nOther excavations done jointly with the 20th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a \"vampire\" burial, a middle aged man with {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century AD) to remains of [[Hellenistic]] structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of [[Aeolic]] grey wares. A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure.  The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins.  The latter museum is especially rich in [[mosaic]]s and [[sculpture]], including the famous late [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic floor from the \"House of Menander\" with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright.  There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the [[Greek Archaeological Service]] under the direction of the archeologist Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|University of the Aegean}}\n[[File:Experimental Lyseum School of Mytilene.JPG|thumb|200px|Experimental Lyceum School of Mytilene]]\n\nThere are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven [[Secondary education|lyceums]], and eight [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the [[University of the Aegean]].
