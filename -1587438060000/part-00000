Tezuka also states that as players continue to upload levels, he and the development staff will use these creations as a reference for adding content after launch, viewing the dynamic as a give-and-take between developers and consumers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Super Mario Maker 2'' was revealed during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on February 13, 2019.

''Super Mario Maker 2'' introduces new features and course assets, including a new course style and assets based on ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Super Mario#Common elements|Super Mario Maker#Gameplay|label 1=Common elements of the Super Mario series|label 2=Gameplay of Super Mario Maker}}\nLike its predecessor, ''Super Mario Maker 2'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] in which players create their own courses using assets from across the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series and publish them onto the internet for others to play. Players can choose from a selection of prior ''Super Mario'' games to base their course's visual style and gameplay on, including ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

Tezuka also states that as players continue to upload levels, he and the development staff will use these creations as a reference for adding content after launch, viewing the dynamic as a give-and-take between developers and consumers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Super Mario Maker 2'' was revealed during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on February 13, 2019.

It is a duet with his younger sister [[Janet Jackson|Janet]], and was released as a [[double A-side]] with \"[[Childhood (Michael Jackson song)|Childhood]]\", a solo song by Michael. The single was released on May 31, 1995.\n\n\"Scream\" is cited primarily as an aggressive, retaliatory song directed at the tabloid media and their coverage of the [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|child sexual abuse accusations made against Michael Jackson in 1993]]. \"Scream\" was written, composed and produced by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis|Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis]], Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson; Michael played many of the instruments. It incorporates elements of [[pop music|pop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[electronic rock|electrorock]], [[new jack swing]], [[dance music|dance-pop]], and [[funk]]. Recording for Scream took place at the Hit Factory in New York City in October 1994 and at Flyte Tyme Studios in Edina, Minnesota in December 1994. The song was leaked to radio stations early, despite [[Epic Records]]' attempt to keep it off air until the official release date.<ref>nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=GF&s_site=grandforks&p_multi=GF&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB6EAAC6906C62A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D</ref>{{dead link|date=July 2019}}\n\nGenerally well received amongst critics, it has been compared favorably to other songs by Michael Jackson. The corresponding music video remains one of his most critically acclaimed; it won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]] and the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Music Video]]. At a cost of $7 million, it was listed in the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most expensive music video ever made; however, director Mark Romanek has refuted the claim, saying that there were two other music videos from the same era which cost \"millions more\" than the video for \"Scream\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/09/15/129890627/speaking-of-the-vmas-mark-romanek-wasn-t-there|title=Mark Romanek: 'Never Let Me Go' Director On His Music Video Career|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n\"Scream\" would become the first single in the 37-year history of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' to debut at number five on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], where it peaked. Elsewhere, it topped the charts in Italy, New Zealand, and Spain while reaching the top five in Australia, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Michael performed \"Scream\" on his 1996\u20131997 [[HIStory World Tour]]. Following his [[Death of Michael Jackson|death]] in 2009, Janet performed the song on her 2011 [[Number Ones, Up Close and Personal]] as a tribute to him, the 2015\u20132016 [[Unbreakable World Tour (Janet Jackson tour)|Unbreakable World Tour]], and on several dates of her 2017-2018 [[State of the World Tour]].\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Health and appearance of Michael Jackson|1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson}}\n\"Scream\" is a song primarily directed at the tabloid press. As far back as the late 1980s, Jackson and the press had a difficult relationship. In 1986, the tabloids ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen chamber]] to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying down in a glass box. When Jackson bought a pet [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] called [[Bubbles (chimpanzee)|Bubbles]], it was reported as evidence of increasing detachment from reality.<ref name=\"BBC, Jackson's image problems\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4584367.stm |title=Music's misunderstood superstar |publisher=BBC |date=June 13, 2005 |accessdate=July 14, 2008 }}</ref> It was reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of [[Joseph Merrick]] (the \"elephant man\"). However, Jackson stated the story is untrue in both an interview with Oprah<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjshouse.com/stories/oprah.html|title=Michael Jackson's House - Michael Jackson Fan Page - www.mjshouse.com|first=Michael|last=White|website=www.mjshouse.com}}</ref> and an interview with Martin Bashir in ''Take Two - The Footage You Were Never Meant To See''. Still, these stories inspired the pejorative nickname \"Wacko Jacko\", which Jackson acquired the following year and would come to despise. He stopped leaking untruths to the press, so the media began making up their own stories.<ref name=\"BBC, Jackson's image problems\"/><ref name = \"tara 370\u2013373\">Taraborrelli, p. 370\u2013373</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Jackson released the song and music video \"[[Leave Me Alone (Michael Jackson song)|Leave Me Alone]]\", a song about his perceived victimization at the hands of the press.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 365</ref> The video shows Jackson poking fun not only at the press but also the situation he was in. In the video, there are images of shrines to his friend [[Elizabeth Taylor]], newspapers with bizarre headlines, Jackson dancing with the bones of [[Joseph Merrick|The Elephant Man]], and an animated nose with a scalpel chasing it across the screen.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 413</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the relationship between Jackson and the press came to a head when he was accused of [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|child sexual abuse]]. Although never charged with a crime, Jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place. Complaints about the coverage and media included using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline,<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 42\u201345</ref> accepting stories of Jackson's alleged criminal activity in return for money,<ref name = \"campbell 77-80\">Campbell (1995), p. 77\u201380</ref> accepting confidential, leaked material from the police investigation in return for money paid,<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 47\u201350</ref> deliberately using pictures of Jackson's appearance at its worst,<ref name = \"tara 500-507\">Taraborrelli, p. 500\u2013507</ref> a lack of objectivity<ref name = \"tara 500-507\"/> and using headlines that strongly implied Jackson's guilt.<ref name = \"tara 500-507\"/> At the time, Jackson said of the media reaction, \"I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions.\"<ref name=\"(find) MJ speaks out\">{{cite magazine |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n10_v85/ai_14947357?tag=artBody;col1 |title=Michael Jackson speaks: 'I am totally innocent of any wrongdoing.' |magazine=Jet |date=January 10, 1994 |accessdate=August 3, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe singer began taking [[painkiller]]s, [[Valium]], [[Xanax]] and [[Ativan]] to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him.<ref name = \"tara 518\u2013520\">Taraborrelli, 514-516\">Taraborrelli, p. 514\u2013516</ref> Jackson's health had deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of his tour and went into rehabilitation.<ref name = \"campbell 89-93\"/><ref name = \"tara 524-528\"/> Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of a clinic and was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers.<ref name = \"campbell 89-93\"/> A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson had lost approximately 10&nbsp;lb (4.5&nbsp;kg) in weight and had stopped eating.<ref name = \"tara 524-528\"/><ref name=\"HIStory review NYT\"/> The singer's spokesperson told reporters that Jackson was \"barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level\".<ref name = \"tara 524-528\"/> While in the clinic, Jackson took part in group and one-on-one therapy sessions.<ref name = \"campbell 89-93\">Campbell (1995), p. 89\u201393</ref><ref name = \"tara 524-528\">Taraborrelli, p. 524\u2013528</ref>\n\nWhen Jackson left the U.S. to go into rehabilitation, the media showed him little sympathy. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' held a \"Spot the Jacko\" contest, offering readers a trip to [[Disney World]] if they could correctly predict where the entertainer would appear next.<ref name = \"campbell 89-93\"/> A ''[[The Daily Express|Daily Express]]'' headline read, \"Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run\", while a ''[[News of the World]]'' headline accused Jackson of being a [[fugitive]].

One analyst for [[SoundScan]] expressed the opinion that the press were out of touch with the public when it came to Jackson; the public liked him, while the press did not.

The acclaimed video was shot primarily in black and white, at a cost of $7&nbsp;million.]]\nThe 4:46 minute music video for \"Scream\" was choreographed by [[Travis Payne]], [[LaVelle Smith Jnr]], [[Tina Landon]] and Sacha Lucashenko in May 1995, and [[Sean Cheesman]], directed by [[Mark Romanek]], with the production being designed by Tom Foden. Jackson did not create the \"concept\" for the video, which he had often done in the past, but left it to Romanek. Jackson later described the making of \"Scream\" as a collaborative effort. The song and its accompanying video are a response to the backlash Jackson received from the media in 1993.<ref name = \"1995 mtv interview\"/><ref name=\"HIStory Volume 2 dvd\"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Bark |first= Ed |title = Michael Jackson Interview Raises Questions, Answers | page = 06E | newspaper = [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] | date = June 26, 1995 |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref>\n\nFoden commented, \"Mark had written the treatment and the general idea was that Michael and Janet were on this large spacecraft.

Jim Farber of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' described her as \"Sporting a thick thatch of wig hair, and eyes darkened by coal-black makeup... sullen and arty... Janet, however, never looked tougher, or more in control.\"<ref name=\"nydailynews on Scream vid\"/> The video has influences of Japanese sci-fi [[anime]]; several clips of the ''[[Zillion (anime)|Zillion]]'' anime series, [[Vampire Hunter D (1985 film)|''Vampire Hunter D'']] movie, and the film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' can be seen in the background screens.<ref name=\"nydailynews on Scream vid\"/> The version of the video included on ''[[Michael Jackson's Vision]]'' is uncut and contains the \"Stop fucking with me\" lyric, which was censored in ''[[HIStory on Film, Volume II]]''.\n\n====Synopsis====\nThe video begins showing a sign appearing with the logo of the song's title. The scene then changes a spacecraft traveling past Earth before the camera zooms in inside. The lights come on and reveal Michael and Janet inside individual capsules. During this sequence, the song's intro, a soundtrack of [[noise music]] with heavy [[sub-bass]], uncharacteristic for the song's style, is heard. Suddenly, the spacecraft zooms out through the outer part of the galaxy, sending them screaming, and the song starts when the screaming Michael pounds his hands on the capsule window, shattering it. \n\nIn the first verse, Michael is seen in the room where he is floating on gravity. Then, Michael is shown in a room with thousands of guitars where he breaks one while Janet sings the next verse. Then, it shows Michael dancing on the wall while Janet looks at her nail before playing a game of tag. Then, it shows Michael and Janet in a room where they are using a remote control by changing pictures of [[Andy Warhol]], art painting, statues, etc. Next, it shows both Michael and Janet in the media room where they are playing a video game which Michael wins. Then, Janet sports a skimpy bikini in some scenes while at the core of the craft, grabs at her breasts, gives the camera a middle finger and simulates male urination where Michael is shown taking controls into some kind of Observation. (In the out-takes, there is a still color photograph of Michael also giving the camera a middle finger.) \n\nMichael is then seen in a white room while wearing a black robe where he is meditating before screaming which breaks the glass above him. The scene then shifts, showing Michael and Janet performing a dance breakdown. Then, it cuts back to the media room where Janet is dancing with Michael being seen on the television screen while Janet does the same thing with Michael. Then, Michael is seen playing a tennis game where he is using a robotic orb to break jars.\n\n===Reception and influence===\nThe video premiered in the summer of 1995, on [[MTV]] and [[BET]] and the next evening on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s \"[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime Live]]\" during [[Diane Sawyer]]'s interview with Jackson and [[Lisa Marie Presley]].

It is a duet with his younger sister [[Janet Jackson|Janet]], and was released as a [[double A-side]] with \"[[Childhood (Michael Jackson song)|Childhood]]\", a solo song by Michael. The single was released on May 31, 1995.\n\n\"Scream\" is cited primarily as an aggressive, retaliatory song directed at the tabloid media and their coverage of the [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|child sexual abuse accusations made against Michael Jackson in 1993]]. \"Scream\" was written, composed and produced by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis|Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis]], Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson; Michael played many of the instruments. It incorporates elements of [[pop music|pop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[electronic rock|electrorock]], [[new jack swing]], [[dance music|dance-pop]], and [[funk]]. Recording for Scream took place at the Hit Factory in New York City in October 1994 and at Flyte Tyme Studios in Edina, Minnesota in December 1994. The song was leaked to radio stations early, despite [[Epic Records]]' attempt to keep it off air until the official release date.<ref>nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=GF&s_site=grandforks&p_multi=GF&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB6EAAC6906C62A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D</ref>{{dead link|date=July 2019}}\n\nGenerally well received amongst critics, it has been compared favorably to other songs by Michael Jackson. The corresponding music video remains one of his most critically acclaimed; it won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]] and the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Music Video]]. At a cost of $7 million, it was listed in the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most expensive music video ever made; however, director Mark Romanek has refuted the claim, saying that there were two other music videos from the same era which cost \"millions more\" than the video for \"Scream\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/09/15/129890627/speaking-of-the-vmas-mark-romanek-wasn-t-there|title=Mark Romanek: 'Never Let Me Go' Director On His Music Video Career|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n\"Scream\" would become the first single in the 37-year history of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' to debut at number five on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], where it peaked. Elsewhere, it topped the charts in Italy, New Zealand, and Spain while reaching the top five in Australia, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Michael performed \"Scream\" on his 1996\u20131997 [[HIStory World Tour]]. Following his [[Death of Michael Jackson|death]] in 2009, Janet performed the song on her 2011 [[Number Ones, Up Close and Personal]] as a tribute to him, the 2015\u20132016 [[Unbreakable World Tour (Janet Jackson tour)|Unbreakable World Tour]], and on several dates of her 2017-2018 [[State of the World Tour]].\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Health and appearance of Michael Jackson|1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson}}\n\"Scream\" is a song primarily directed at the tabloid press. As far back as the late 1980s, Jackson and the press had a difficult relationship. In 1986, the tabloids ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen chamber]] to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying down in a glass box. When Jackson bought a pet [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] called [[Bubbles (chimpanzee)|Bubbles]], it was reported as evidence of increasing detachment from reality.<ref name=\"BBC, Jackson's image problems\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4584367.stm |title=Music's misunderstood superstar |publisher=BBC |date=June 13, 2005 |accessdate=July 14, 2008 }}</ref> It was reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of [[Joseph Merrick]] (the \"elephant man\"). However, Jackson stated the story is untrue in both an interview with Oprah<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjshouse.com/stories/oprah.html|title=Michael Jackson's House - Michael Jackson Fan Page - www.mjshouse.com|first=Michael|last=White|website=www.mjshouse.com}}</ref> and an interview with Martin Bashir in ''Take Two - The Footage You Were Never Meant To See''. Still, these stories inspired the pejorative nickname \"Wacko Jacko\", which Jackson acquired the following year and would come to despise. He stopped leaking untruths to the press, so the media began making up their own stories.<ref name=\"BBC, Jackson's image problems\"/><ref name = \"tara 370\u2013373\">Taraborrelli, p. 370\u2013373</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Jackson released the song and music video \"[[Leave Me Alone (Michael Jackson song)|Leave Me Alone]]\", a song about his perceived victimization at the hands of the press.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 365</ref> The video shows Jackson poking fun not only at the press but also the situation he was in. In the video, there are images of shrines to his friend [[Elizabeth Taylor]], newspapers with bizarre headlines, Jackson dancing with the bones of [[Joseph Merrick|The Elephant Man]], and an animated nose with a scalpel chasing it across the screen.<ref>Taraborrelli, p. 413</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the relationship between Jackson and the press came to a head when he was accused of [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|child sexual abuse]]. Although never charged with a crime, Jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place. Complaints about the coverage and media included using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline,<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 42\u201345</ref> accepting stories of Jackson's alleged criminal activity in return for money,<ref name = \"campbell 77-80\">Campbell (1995), p. 77\u201380</ref> accepting confidential, leaked material from the police investigation in return for money paid,<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 47\u201350</ref> deliberately using pictures of Jackson's appearance at its worst,<ref name = \"tara 500-507\">Taraborrelli, p. 500\u2013507</ref> a lack of objectivity<ref name = \"tara 500-507\"/> and using headlines that strongly implied Jackson's guilt.<ref name = \"tara 500-507\"/> At the time, Jackson said of the media reaction, \"I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions.\"<ref name=\"(find) MJ speaks out\">{{cite magazine |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n10_v85/ai_14947357?tag=artBody;col1 |title=Michael Jackson speaks: 'I am totally innocent of any wrongdoing.' |magazine=Jet |date=January 10, 1994 |accessdate=August 3, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe singer began taking [[painkiller]]s, [[Valium]], [[Xanax]] and [[Ativan]] to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him.<ref name = \"tara 518\u2013520\">Taraborrelli, 514-516\">Taraborrelli, p. 514\u2013516</ref> Jackson's health had deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of his tour and went into rehabilitation.<ref name = \"campbell 89-93\"/><ref name = \"tara 524-528\"/> Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of a clinic and was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers.<ref name = \"campbell 89-93\"/> A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson had lost approximately 10&nbsp;lb (4.5&nbsp;kg) in weight and had stopped eating.<ref name = \"tara 524-528\"/><ref name=\"HIStory review NYT\"/> The singer's spokesperson told reporters that Jackson was \"barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level\".<ref name = \"tara 524-528\"/> While in the clinic, Jackson took part in group and one-on-one therapy sessions.<ref name = \"campbell 89-93\">Campbell (1995), p. 89\u201393</ref><ref name = \"tara 524-528\">Taraborrelli, p. 524\u2013528</ref>\n\nWhen Jackson left the U.S. to go into rehabilitation, the media showed him little sympathy. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' held a \"Spot the Jacko\" contest, offering readers a trip to [[Disney World]] if they could correctly predict where the entertainer would appear next.<ref name = \"campbell 89-93\"/> A ''[[The Daily Express|Daily Express]]'' headline read, \"Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run\", while a ''[[News of the World]]'' headline accused Jackson of being a [[fugitive]]. These tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had traveled to Europe to have [[cosmetic surgery]] that would make him unrecognizable on his return.<ref name = \"campbell 89-93\"/> [[Geraldo Rivera]] set up a mock trial, with a jury made up of audience members, even though Jackson had not been charged with a crime.<ref>Campbell (1995), p. 104\u2013106</ref>\n\n\"Scream\"/\"Childhood\" and ''HIStory'' were Jackson's first releases since the allegations, and the press was waiting to see if the album would sell well. One analyst for [[SoundScan]] expressed the opinion that the press were out of touch with the public when it came to Jackson; the public liked him, while the press did not. He believed that \"naysayers\" in the media would be left surprised with the commercial reception to the ''HIStory'' campaign.<ref name=\"Time on HIStory\">{{cite magazine |first=Christopher |last=Farley |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983063-1,00.html |title=History and hubris |magazine=Time |date=June 19, 1995 |accessdate=September 18, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, on 24 June 1995, \"Scream (David Morales Remix)\" was released as a single peaking at number 43, dropping to number 57 a week later.

Jackson did not create the \"concept\" for the video, which he had often done in the past, but left it to Romanek. Jackson later described the making of \"Scream\" as a collaborative effort.

Janet, however, never looked tougher, or more in control.\"<ref name=\"nydailynews on Scream vid\"/> The video has influences of Japanese sci-fi [[anime]]; several clips of the ''[[Zillion (anime)|Zillion]]'' anime series, [[Vampire Hunter D (1985 film)|''Vampire Hunter D'']] movie, and the film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' can be seen in the background screens.<ref name=\"nydailynews on Scream vid\"/> The version of the video included on ''[[Michael Jackson's Vision]]'' is uncut and contains the \"Stop fucking with me\" lyric, which was censored in ''[[HIStory on Film, Volume II]]''.\n\n====Synopsis====\nThe video begins showing a sign appearing with the logo of the song's title. The scene then changes a spacecraft traveling past Earth before the camera zooms in inside. The lights come on and reveal Michael and Janet inside individual capsules. During this sequence, the song's intro, a soundtrack of [[noise music]] with heavy [[sub-bass]], uncharacteristic for the song's style, is heard. Suddenly, the spacecraft zooms out through the outer part of the galaxy, sending them screaming, and the song starts when the screaming Michael pounds his hands on the capsule window, shattering it. \n\nIn the first verse, Michael is seen in the room where he is floating on gravity. Then, Michael is shown in a room with thousands of guitars where he breaks one while Janet sings the next verse. Then, it shows Michael dancing on the wall while Janet looks at her nail before playing a game of tag. Then, it shows Michael and Janet in a room where they are using a remote control by changing pictures of [[Andy Warhol]], art painting, statues, etc. Next, it shows both Michael and Janet in the media room where they are playing a video game which Michael wins. Then, Janet sports a skimpy bikini in some scenes while at the core of the craft, grabs at her breasts, gives the camera a middle finger and simulates male urination where Michael is shown taking controls into some kind of Observation. (In the out-takes, there is a still color photograph of Michael also giving the camera a middle finger.) \n\nMichael is then seen in a white room while wearing a black robe where he is meditating before screaming which breaks the glass above him. The scene then shifts, showing Michael and Janet performing a dance breakdown. Then, it cuts back to the media room where Janet is dancing with Michael being seen on the television screen while Janet does the same thing with Michael. Then, Michael is seen playing a tennis game where he is using a robotic orb to break jars.\n\n===Reception and influence===\nThe video premiered in the summer of 1995, on [[MTV]] and [[BET]] and the next evening on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s \"[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime Live]]\" during [[Diane Sawyer]]'s interview with Jackson and [[Lisa Marie Presley]].
