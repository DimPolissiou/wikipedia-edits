Since the army regulation doesn't mention about the name tags, each unit has its own regulation for the tags.  Therefore, the layout, length, font, letters (Japanese or Latin alphabets), place of wearing, how to attach the tag (either sewing or using velcro) etc. vary.  Some troops do not use name tags for winter jackets.\n*Tracksuits and running shoes \u2013 The recruits are demanded to buy their own tracksuits and a pair of running shoes, upon the enlistment.  There is a uniform code called \"\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u6226 (Jaasen, literally jersey and combat uniform)\", which is composed of combat jacket, combat cap, trackpants and sneakers.  This uniform code is often used in the boot camp for jogging, eating in canteen or going to bath, since it's easy to identify the name and the troop of the recruits.  Any trackpants and sneakers are permitted for the code, for instance, it is possible to wear the following items: Nike Air Force 1, Adidas Superstar trackpants etc.\n*\u90e8\u968a\u8b58\u5225\u5e3d (Baseball Cap) \u2013 Many troops use baseball caps with the troop's logo instead of the issued combat cap.  Since it is unofficially introduced, each soldier has to buy it by him/herself.

Some troops do not use name tags for winter jackets.\n*Tracksuits and running shoes \u2013 The recruits are demanded to buy their own tracksuits and a pair of running shoes, upon the enlistment.  There is a uniform code called \"\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u6226 (Jaasen, literally jersey and combat uniform)\", which is composed of combat jacket, combat cap, trackpants and sneakers.  This uniform code is often used in the boot camp for jogging, eating in canteen or going to bath, since it's easy to identify the name and the troop of the recruits.  Any trackpants and sneakers are permitted for the code, for instance, it is possible to wear the following items: Nike Air Force 1, Adidas Superstar trackpants etc.\n*\u90e8\u968a\u8b58\u5225\u5e3d (Baseball Cap) \u2013 Many troops use baseball caps with the troop's logo instead of the issued combat cap.

His brief biography in ''[[The Play Pictorial]]'' review of ''[[The Blue Moon (musical)|The Blue Moon]]'' in 1905 recorded that:\n<blockquote>\nBlakiston's first engagement was with a modern, but somewhat shady, repertoire Company whose manager cast him for juvenile lead, only because he possessed a presentable wardrobe. The thirsty members of the company were most eager to show him how his parts really should be played, but stipulated that the coaching was done in the nearest bar-parlour. Soon after joining, his manager called him aside and said, \"My boy, you're too good for juveniles. When I see real talent I always help it on. I'll sacrifice myself by exchanging parts with you \u2013 I'll lend you my clothes (take care of them as it has taken me years to collect them), and you shall lend me yours.\" \"Whereupon this gentleman\" says Mr. Blakiston, \"possessed himself of all my available suits and linen, and two weeks later gave me 12/- for two weeks' work, explaining with tears in his eyes that business was so bad owing to my inability to play such important parts. I never saw my clothes again. The manager's clothes (mostly rags) I sold for a few shillings, and got insulted over the transaction.\" After going through many vicissitudes Mr. Blakiston obtained an introduction to Mr. [[Edward Compton (actor)|Edward Compton]] who engaged him as prompter, and thenceforth he worked his way up to the position of leading man, which position he retained for five years before trying his fate in town.<ref>[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&&&www.stagebeauty.net/produce/bluem/th-bluem.html ''The Blue Moon'' in ''The Play Pictorial'' No. 82 (1905)]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHis stage roles included Chastelard in ''The Queen's Room'' (1891) at the [[Opera Comique]];<ref>[[J.

His brief biography in ''[[The Play Pictorial]]'' review of ''[[The Blue Moon (musical)|The Blue Moon]]'' in 1905 recorded that:\n<blockquote>\nBlakiston's first engagement was with a modern, but somewhat shady, repertoire Company whose manager cast him for juvenile lead, only because he possessed a presentable wardrobe. The thirsty members of the company were most eager to show him how his parts really should be played, but stipulated that the coaching was done in the nearest bar-parlour. Soon after joining, his manager called him aside and said, \"My boy, you're too good for juveniles. When I see real talent I always help it on. I'll sacrifice myself by exchanging parts with you \u2013 I'll lend you my clothes (take care of them as it has taken me years to collect them), and you shall lend me yours.\" \"Whereupon this gentleman\" says Mr. Blakiston, \"possessed himself of all my available suits and linen, and two weeks later gave me 12/- for two weeks' work, explaining with tears in his eyes that business was so bad owing to my inability to play such important parts. I never saw my clothes again. The manager's clothes (mostly rags) I sold for a few shillings, and got insulted over the transaction.\" After going through many vicissitudes Mr. Blakiston obtained an introduction to Mr. [[Edward Compton (actor)|Edward Compton]] who engaged him as prompter, and thenceforth he worked his way up to the position of leading man, which position he retained for five years before trying his fate in town.<ref>[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&&&www.stagebeauty.net/produce/bluem/th-bluem.html ''The Blue Moon'' in ''The Play Pictorial'' No. 82 (1905)]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHis stage roles included Chastelard in ''The Queen's Room'' (1891) at the [[Opera Comique]];<ref>[[J.

In the north of New Zealand, they are known as \"chippies\", but are marketed as \"chips\" throughout the country. In Australia and New Zealand, sometimes the distinction is made between \"hot chips\" (fried potatoes) and \"chips\" or \"potato chips\".

Many other popular brands in the United States, such as [[Frito-Lay]], also offer such a product.\n\nAnother possible health concern related to potato chips is [[acrylamide]], which is produced when potatoes are fried or baked at high temperatures. Studies show that laboratory animals exposed to high levels of acrylamide develop cancer;<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/food/chemicals/acrylamide \"Acrylamide\"]</ref> however, it is currently unclear whether a similar risk exists in humans.

This makes chips that are uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked and packaged in rigid cardboard or plastic canisters. Pringles are officially branded as \"potato crisps\" in the US. Pringles may be termed \"potato chips\" in Britain, to distinguish them from traditional \"crisps\". [[Munchos]], another brand that uses the term \"potato crisps\", has deep air pockets in its chips that give it a curved shape, though the chips themselves resemble regular bagged chips.\n\nAn additional variant of potato chips exists in the form of \"potato sticks\", also called \"shoestring potatoes\". These are made as extremely thin (2 to 3&nbsp;mm) versions of the popular French fry but are fried in the manner of regular salted potato chips. A [[hickory]]-smoke-flavored version is popular in Canada, going by the [[vending machine]] name \"Hickory Sticks\". Potato sticks are typically packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches, similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in hermetically sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringles container). [[Reckitt Benckiser]] was a market leader in this category{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} under the Durkee Potato Stix and [[French's]] Potato Sticks names but exited the business in 2008. In 2014, French's reentered the market.\n\nA larger variant (about 1&nbsp;cm thick) made with dehydrated potatoes is marketed as [[Andy Capp]]'s [[Andy Capp's fries|Pub Fries]], using the theme of a long-running British [[comic strip]], which are baked and sold in a variety of flavors.\nWalkers make a similar product (using the Smiths brand) called \"Chipsticks\" which are sold in ready-salted and salt and vinegar flavors.\n\nSome companies have also marketed [[baking|baked]] potato chips as an alternative with lower fat content. Additionally, some varieties of fat-free chips have been made using artificial, and indigestible, fat substitutes. These became well known in the media when an ingredient many contained, [[Olestra]], was linked in some individuals to abdominal discomfort and loose stools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://win.niddk.nih.gov/notes/summer98/artcl9.html |title=New Fat-free Product on the Market |publisher=[[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] |date=Summer 1998 |accessdate=26 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210050117/http://win.niddk.nih.gov/notes/summer98/artcl9.html |archivedate=10 February 2009 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref>\n\nMany other products might be called \"crisps\" in Britain, but would not be classed as \"potato chips\" because they are not made with potato or are not chipped (for example, [[Wotsits]], [[Quavers]], [[Skips (snack)|Skips]], [[Hula Hoops]], and [[Monster Munch]]).\n\n[[Sweet potato]] chips are eaten in Korea, New Zealand, and Japan; parsnip, [[beetroot]], and carrot crisps are available in the United Kingdom.

This has been linked to health issues such as high [[blood pressure]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rmwp7X2FZ68C&pg=PA275&dq=Most+potato+chips+contain+high+levels+of+sodium,+from+salt.+This+has+been+linked+to+health+issues+such+as+high+blood+pressure#v=onepage&q=Most%20potato%20chips%20contain%20high%20levels%20of%20sodium,%20from%20salt.%20This%20has%20been%20linked%20to%20health%20issues%20such%20as%20high%20blood%20pressure&f=false|title=Public Health and the Risk Factor: A History of an Uneven Medical Revolution|last=Rothstein|first=William G.|date=2003|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=9781580461276|language=en}}</ref> However, researchers at [[Queen Mary University of London]] in 2004 have noted that a small \"bag of ready-salted crisps\" contains less salt than a serving of many breakfast cereals, including \"every brand of [[cornflakes]] on sale in the UK.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/news/surveys/2004/cereals/index.html |title=Health hazard hidden in breakfast bowls |website=Action on Salt |date=12 November 2004 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |publisher=[[Queen Mary University of London]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107011818/http://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/news/surveys/2004/cereals/index.html |archivedate=7 November 2012  }}</ref>\n\nSome potato chip companies have responded to the long-standing concerns by investing in research and development to modify existing recipes and create health-conscious products. [[PepsiCo]] research shows that about 80% of salt on chips is not sensed by the tongue before being swallowed. [[Frito-Lay]] spent $414 million in 2009 on product development, including development of salt crystals that would reduce the salt content of [[Lay's]] potato chips without adversely affecting flavor.<ref name=\"newsalt\">{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704534904575131602283791566 |title=PepsiCo Develops 'Designer Salt' to Chip Away at Sodium Intake |last=McKay |first=Betsy |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=22 March 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223092112/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704534904575131602283791566 |archivedate=23 December 2014  }}</ref>\n\nUnsalted chips are available, e.g. the longstanding British brand [[Salt 'n' Shake]], whose chips are not seasoned, but instead include a small salt [[sachet]] in the bag for seasoning to taste. Many other popular brands in the United States, such as [[Frito-Lay]], also offer such a product.\n\nAnother possible health concern related to potato chips is [[acrylamide]], which is produced when potatoes are fried or baked at high temperatures. Studies show that laboratory animals exposed to high levels of acrylamide develop cancer;<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/food/chemicals/acrylamide \"Acrylamide\"]</ref> however, it is currently unclear whether a similar risk exists in humans.  In August 2008, [[California Attorney General]] [[Jerry Brown]] announced a settlement with [[Frito-Lay]], [[Kettle Foods]], and [[Lance Inc.]] the makers of [[Cape Cod Potato Chips]] for violating the state's [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act]]. The state had alleged in 2005 that potato chips from these companies failed to document that they contained high levels of acrylamide, which is listed by California since the 1990s as a [[carcinogen]]. These companies paid fines and agreed to reduce acrylamide levels to be under 275 parts per billion.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://oag.ca.gov/news/press_release?id=1595 |title= Atty. Gen.

This makes chips that are uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked and packaged in rigid cardboard or plastic canisters. Pringles are officially branded as \"potato crisps\" in the US. Pringles may be termed \"potato chips\" in Britain, to distinguish them from traditional \"crisps\". [[Munchos]], another brand that uses the term \"potato crisps\", has deep air pockets in its chips that give it a curved shape, though the chips themselves resemble regular bagged chips.\n\nAn additional variant of potato chips exists in the form of \"potato sticks\", also called \"shoestring potatoes\". These are made as extremely thin (2 to 3&nbsp;mm) versions of the popular French fry but are fried in the manner of regular salted potato chips. A [[hickory]]-smoke-flavored version is popular in Canada, going by the [[vending machine]] name \"Hickory Sticks\". Potato sticks are typically packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches, similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in hermetically sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringles container). [[Reckitt Benckiser]] was a market leader in this category{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} under the Durkee Potato Stix and [[French's]] Potato Sticks names but exited the business in 2008. In 2014, French's reentered the market.\n\nA larger variant (about 1&nbsp;cm thick) made with dehydrated potatoes is marketed as [[Andy Capp]]'s [[Andy Capp's fries|Pub Fries]], using the theme of a long-running British [[comic strip]], which are baked and sold in a variety of flavors.\nWalkers make a similar product (using the Smiths brand) called \"Chipsticks\" which are sold in ready-salted and salt and vinegar flavors.\n\nSome companies have also marketed [[baking|baked]] potato chips as an alternative with lower fat content. Additionally, some varieties of fat-free chips have been made using artificial, and indigestible, fat substitutes. These became well known in the media when an ingredient many contained, [[Olestra]], was linked in some individuals to abdominal discomfort and loose stools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://win.niddk.nih.gov/notes/summer98/artcl9.html |title=New Fat-free Product on the Market |publisher=[[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] |date=Summer 1998 |accessdate=26 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210050117/http://win.niddk.nih.gov/notes/summer98/artcl9.html |archivedate=10 February 2009 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->}}</ref>\n\nMany other products might be called \"crisps\" in Britain, but would not be classed as \"potato chips\" because they are not made with potato or are not chipped (for example, [[Wotsits]], [[Quavers]], [[Skips (snack)|Skips]], [[Hula Hoops]], and [[Monster Munch]]).\n\n[[Sweet potato]] chips are eaten in Korea, New Zealand, and Japan; parsnip, [[beetroot]], and carrot crisps are available in the United Kingdom.

The platforms occupy the sidewalks of Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between Broadway and 6th Avenue in [[downtown Portland]], and are the 21st and 7th stops eastbound on the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]], respectively. They are situated directly west of the [[Portland Transit Mall]] at [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]]; these stations, along with the [[Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th and Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th stations]] that are served by the [[MAX Green Line|Green]], [[MAX Orange Line|Orange]], and [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow]] lines, mark the only point in the MAX system where passengers can transfer to any of the five existing lines.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations are among the 27 original stations built as part of the Banfield light rail project\u2014Portland's first light rail line. They opened along with the inaugural service of MAX on September 5, 1986. The Red Line began serving the stations in September 2001, initially connecting downtown to [[Portland International Airport]]. In 2003, the Red Line extended westward to [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]]. The Yellow Line also served the stations from 2004 to 2009, connecting downtown to the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Expo Center]]; TriMet rerouted this line to serve the transit mall in August 2009.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Pioneer Courthouse Square}}\n\nThe Portland city block presently known as [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]] had previously been occupied by various structures, including a school, a hotel, and a parking garage. In March 1856, a proclamation combined Portland's two competing school districts and created School District No. 1, which built the city's first permanent public school at this location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/#.XnI3dKhKhhE |title=Central School |publisher=[[Oregon Historical Society]] |date=March 17, 2018 |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930101129/https://www.oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/ |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> The school, which came to be referred to as Central School, opened on May 7, 1858.<ref>{{cite news |last=Killen |first=John |title=Throwback Thursday: Portland public schools, started in 1850s, took awhile to catch on |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=June 11, 2015 |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318151006/https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> With the arrival of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to Portland in 1883, [[Henry Villard]] purchased the site of Central School for $75,000 and began building a first class hotel. The ensuing [[Panic of 1884]] halted construction for five years due to the collapse of Villard's finances. Construction resumed with the help of George B. Markle and other local investors, and the [[Portland Hotel]] opened on April 7, 1890.

Oregon]], United States, served by [[TriMet]] as part of its [[MAX Light Rail]] system. The platforms occupy the sidewalks of Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between Broadway and 6th Avenue in [[downtown Portland]], and are the 21st and 7th stops eastbound on the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]], respectively. They are situated directly west of the [[Portland Transit Mall]] at [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]]; these stations, along with the [[Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th and Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th stations]] that are served by the [[MAX Green Line|Green]], [[MAX Orange Line|Orange]], and [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow]] lines, mark the only point in the MAX system where passengers can transfer to any of the five existing lines.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations are among the 27 original stations built as part of the Banfield light rail project\u2014Portland's first light rail line. They opened along with the inaugural service of MAX on September 5, 1986. The Red Line began serving the stations in September 2001, initially connecting downtown to [[Portland International Airport]]. In 2003, the Red Line extended westward to [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]]. The Yellow Line also served the stations from 2004 to 2009, connecting downtown to the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Expo Center]]; TriMet rerouted this line to serve the transit mall in August 2009.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Pioneer Courthouse Square}}\n\nThe Portland city block presently known as [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]] had previously been occupied by various structures, including a school, a hotel, and a parking garage. In March 1856, a proclamation combined Portland's two competing school districts and created School District No. 1, which built the city's first permanent public school at this location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/#.XnI3dKhKhhE |title=Central School |publisher=[[Oregon Historical Society]] |date=March 17, 2018 |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930101129/https://www.oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/ |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> The school, which came to be referred to as Central School, opened on May 7, 1858.<ref>{{cite news |last=Killen |first=John |title=Throwback Thursday: Portland public schools, started in 1850s, took awhile to catch on |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=June 11, 2015 |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318151006/https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> With the arrival of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to Portland in 1883, [[Henry Villard]] purchased the site of Central School for $75,000 and began building a first class hotel.
