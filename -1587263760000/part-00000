Although the quality of the equipment are likely inferior to the South Korean counterparts, the P'okp'ung-ho is believed to be a considerable threat at medium/short range engagements, although lacking when firing from long ranges at night.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Models==\n* '''Pokpung-Ho I''' - The initial variant.

Although the quality of the equipment are likely inferior to the South Korean counterparts, the P'okp'ung-ho is believed to be a considerable threat at medium/short range engagements, although lacking when firing from long ranges at night.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Models==\n* '''Pokpung-Ho I''' - The initial variant.

The film chronicles the first interplanetary adventure of [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] and his attempts to mediate [[civil war|civil unrest]] amongst the warring kingdoms of [[Barsoom]]. It was directed by [[Andrew Stanton]] from a screenplay written by Stanton, [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]], and [[Michael Chabon]]. The film was produced by [[Jim Morris (film producer)|Jim Morris]], [[Colin Wilson (film producer)|Colin Wilson]], and Lindsey Collins. ''John Carter'' stars [[Taylor Kitsch]] in the title role, [[Lynn Collins]], [[Samantha Morton]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]], [[Dominic West]], [[James Purefoy]], [[Bryan Cranston]], and [[Willem Dafoe]].\n\nSeveral developments on a theatrical film adaptation of the ''Barsoom'' series emerged throughout the 20th century from various major studios and producers, with the earliest attempt dating back to the 1930s. Most of these efforts, however, ultimately stalled in [[development hell]]. In the late-2000s, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] began a concerted effort to develop a film adaptation of Burroughs' works, after a previously abandoned venture by the studio in the 1980s. The project was driven by Stanton, who had pressed Disney to renew the [[Film rights|screen rights]] from the Burroughs estate. Stanton became director in 2009, this was his live-action debut, as his previous directorial work for Disney included the [[Pixar]] animated films, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003) and ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"Den of Geek\">{{cite news|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/946918/what_we_know_about_john_carter.html|title=What We Know About John Carter|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|date=June 19, 2011|newspaper=Den of Geek|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"SlashFilmSciretta\">{{cite news|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/john-carter-of-mars-to-be-pixars-first-live-action-film-bryan-cranston-joins-cast/|title=John Carter of Mars to be Pixar's First Live Action Film, Bryan Cranston Joins Cast|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|date=January 13, 2011|newspaper=SlashFilm|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref> Filming began in November 2009, with [[principal photography]] underway in January 2010, wrapping seven months later in July 2010.<ref name=\"Latino Review\">{{cite news|last=Blaber|first=Genevieve|title=Utah is Beginning to Look Like Mars|url=http://www.latinoreview.com/news/utah-is-beginning-to-look-like-mars-7124|accessdate=June 22, 2011|newspaper=Latino Review|date=June 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"standard.net\">{{cite news |title=Disney wraps up Mars movie shooting in Utah |newspaper=[[Standard-Examiner]] |date=August 2, 2010 |url=http://www.standard.net/node/47453 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> [[Michael Giacchino]] composed the film's musical score.<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times Hero Complex\">{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2011/06/16/john-carter-andrew-stanton-on-martian-history-comic-con-and-monty-python/|title='John Carter': Andrew Stanton on Martian history, Comic-Con and ...

Due to the film's poor box office performance, Disney cancelled plans for a sequel (titled ''Gods of Mars'') and the trilogy Stanton had planned.<ref name=gods/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], movie plots are 400 to 700 words ONLY. Please respect this longstanding guideline. -->\nIn 1881, [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] attends the funeral of his uncle, [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], a former [[American Civil War]] [[Confederate Army]] captain who died suddenly. Per Carter's instructions, the body is put in a tomb that can be unlocked only from the inside. His attorney gives Carter's personal journal for Burroughs to read, in the hope of finding clues explaining Carter's cause of death.\n\nIn a flashback to 1868 in the [[Arizona Territory]], [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] Colonel Powell arrests Carter. Powell, knowing about Carter's military background, seeks his help in fighting the [[Apache]].  Carter escapes his holding cell, but fails to get far with U.S. cavalry soldiers in close pursuit. After a run-in with a band of Apaches, Carter and a wounded Powell are chased until they take to hiding in a cave that turns out to be the object of Carter's earlier searching, the 'Spider Cave of Gold'. A [[Barsoom#Therns|Thern]] appears in the cave at that moment and, surprised by the two men, attacks them with a knife; Carter kills him but accidentally activates the Thern's powerful medallion, and is unwittingly transported to a ruined and dying planet, [[Barsoom]]. Because of his different bone density and the planet's low gravity, Carter is able to jump high and perform feats of incredible strength. He is captured by the Green Martian [[Tharks]] and their [[Emperor|Jeddak]] [[Tars Tarkas]].\n\nElsewhere on Barsoom, the Red Martian cities of Helium and Zodanga have been at war for a thousand years. Sab Than, Jeddak of Zodanga, armed with a special weapon obtained from the Thern leader Matai Shang, proposes a cease-fire and an end to the war by marrying the Princess of Helium, [[Dejah Thoris]]. The Princess escapes and is rescued by Carter. Carter, Dejah, and Tarkas' daughter Sola, embark on a quest to get to the end of a sacred river to find a way for Carter to get back home. They obtain information about the \"ninth ray\", a means of using infinite energy and also the key to understanding how the medallion works. But they are later attacked by Shang's minions, the Green Martians of Warhoon. After the attack, Carter is captured and taken back with Dejah while Sola is able to escape. The demoralized Dejah grudgingly agrees to marry Sab Than, then gives Carter his medallion and tells him to go back to Earth. Carter decides to stay and is captured by Shang, who explains to him the purpose of Therns and how they manipulate the civilizations of different worlds to their doom, feeding off the planet's resources in the process. Carter is able to make an escape as he and Sola go back to the Tharks requesting their help. There they discover Tarkas has been overthrown by a ruthless brute, Tal Hajus. Tarkas, Carter and Sola are put on trial in a colosseum battle with two enormous vicious creatures, the four-armed Great White-Apes. After defeating them and killing Hajus, Carter becomes the leader of the Tharks.\n\nThe Thark army charges on Helium and defeats the Zodangan army by killing Sab Than, while Shang is forced to escape and leave Mars for good. Carter becomes prince of Helium by marrying Dejah. On their first night, Carter decides to stay forever on Mars and throws away his medallion. Seizing this opportunity, Shang briefly reappears and sends him back to Earth. Carter then embarks on a long quest, looking for clues of the Therns' presence on Earth and hoping to find one of their medallions; after several years he appears to die suddenly and asks for unusual funeral arrangements\u2014consistent with his having found a medallion, since his return to Mars would leave his Earth body in a coma-like state. He makes Burroughs his protector, giving him clues about how to open the tomb.\n\nBack in the present, Burroughs runs back to Carter's tomb and opens it, finding it empty. Shang, disguised as a man with a bowler hat who has been observing Carter, suddenly appears, having followed Burroughs. As Shang prepares to attack, Carter appears and kills Shang. Carter then tells Burroughs that he never found a medallion. Instead, he devised a scheme to lure a Thern into revealing himself. Carter takes Shang's medallion, whispers the code, and is then transported back to Barsoom.\n\n==Cast==\n===Earthmen===\n* [[Taylor Kitsch]] as [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], a Confederate army captain who is transported to Mars.\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Colonel Powell, a Union colonel who wants John to help his U.S. cavalry soldiers against the Apache.\n* [[Daryl Sabara]] as [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the nephew of John Carter.\n* [[Don Stark]] as Dix, a shopkeeper at an Arizona town where John Carter stops.\n* [[Nicholas Woodeson]] as Dalton, John Carter's executor who summons Edgar.\n\n===Red Martians===\n* [[Lynn Collins]] as [[Dejah Thoris]], the Princess of Helium.\n* [[Dominic West]] as Sab Than, the Jeddak of Zodanga.\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Tardos Mors, the Jeddak of Helium and Dejah Thoris' father.\n* [[James Purefoy]] as Kantos Kan, the [[Captain|Odwar]] of the ship Xavarian.\n* [[Art Malik]] as Zodangan General.\n\n===Tharks===\nThe Tharks are performed through a combination of voice-acting and motion-capture with stilts.\n\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as [[Tars Tarkas]], the Jeddak of the Tharks.\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Sola, a Thark that works with John Carter.\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as the voice and motion-capture of Tal Hajus, a vicious Thark that dislikes John Carter and Tars Tarkas.\n* [[Polly Walker]] as Sarkoja, a merciless Thark who hates Sola.\n* [[David Schwimmer]] as a young Thark Warrior, a Thark who informs Tars Tarkas that eighteen of the Thark eggs didn't hatch.\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as the Thark bookmaker, a Thark who collects the bets on any conflict.\n\n===Therns===\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Matai Shang, the Hekkador of the Therns.

The story was originally serialized in six monthly installments (from February through to July 1912) in the [[pulp magazine]] ''[[The All-Story]]''; those chapters, originally titled \"[[Under the Moons of Mars]]\", were then collected as a novel and published in hardcover five years later from [[A. C. McClurg]].\n\n===Bob Clampett involvement===\n[[File:Princess of Mars large.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs|Burroughs]], [[A. C. McClurg|McClurg]].]]\nIn 1931, ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' director [[Bob Clampett]] approached Edgar Rice Burroughs with the idea of adapting ''A Princess of Mars'' into a feature-length animated film. Burroughs responded enthusiastically, recognizing that a regular live-action feature would face various limitations to adapt accurately, so he advised Clampett to write an original animated adventure for John Carter.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jim |last=Korkis |title=Lost Cartoons: The Animated \"John Carter of Mars\" |publisher=Jim Hill Media |date=June 2, 2003 |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/02/1093.aspx |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}</ref> Working with Burroughs' son John Coleman Burroughs in 1935, Clampett used [[rotoscope]] and other hand-drawn techniques to capture the action, tracing the motions of an athlete who performed John Carter's powerful movements in the reduced Martian gravity, and designed the green-skinned, 4-armed Tharks to give them a believable appearance. He then produced footage of them riding their eight-legged Thoats at a gallop, which had all of their eight legs moving in coordinated motion; he also produced footage of a fleet of rocketships emerging from a Martian volcano. [[MGM]] was to release the cartoons, and the studio heads were enthusiastic about the series.<ref name=\"glut105-6\">{{cite book|last=Glut |first=Donald F. |title=The Frankenstein archive: Essays on the Monster, the Myth, the Movies, and More |pages=105\u20136 |publisher=McFarland |date=2002 |isbn=0-7864-1353-0}}</ref>\n\nThe test footage, produced by 1936,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.erbzine.com/mag21/2175.html|title=The John Carter Animation Project: Promotional Portfolio by John Coleman Burroughs |publisher= ERBzine (#2175) |date= 2008 |accessdate=December 9, 2009}}</ref> received negative reactions from film exhibitors across the U.S., especially in small towns; many gave their opinion that the concept of an Earthman on Mars was just too outlandish an idea for midwestern American audiences to accept. The series was not given the go-ahead, and Clampett was instead encouraged to produce an animated [[Tarzan]] series, an offer that he later declined. Clampett recognized the irony in MGM's decision, as the ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[movie serial]], released in the same year by [[Universal Studios]], was highly successful. He speculated that MGM believed that serials were played only to children during Saturday matinees, whereas the John Carter tales were intended to be seen by adults during the evening. The footage that Clampett produced was believed lost for many years, until Burroughs' grandson, Danton Burroughs, in the early 1970s found some of the film tests in the Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc. archives.<ref name=\"glut105-6\" /> Had ''A Princess of Mars'' been released, it might have preceded [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' to become the first American feature-length animated film.<ref name=\"hughes\">{{cite book|last=Hughes |first=David |title=The Greatest Science Fiction Movies Never Made |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |date=2008 |pages=311\u201322 |isbn=978-1-84576-755-6}}</ref>\n\n===Disney progression===\nDuring the late 1950s, famous [[stop-motion animation]] effects director [[Ray Harryhausen]] expressed interest in filming the novels, but it was not until the 1980s that producers [[Mario Kassar]] and [[Andrew G. Vajna]] bought the rights for [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], with a view to creating a competitor to ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] were hired to write, while [[John McTiernan]] and [[Tom Cruise]] were approached to direct and star. The project collapsed because McTiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate Burroughs' vision of Barsoom. The project remained at Disney, and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was a strong proponent of filming the novels, but the rights eventually returned to the Burroughs estate.<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\n===Paramount effort===\nProducer [[James Jacks]] read [[Harry Knowles]]' autobiography, which lavishly praised the ''John Carter of Mars'' series. Having read the Burroughs' novels as a child, Jacks was moved to convince [[Paramount Pictures]] to acquire the film rights; a [[bidding war]] with [[Columbia Pictures]] followed. After Paramount and Jacks won the rights, Jacks contacted Knowles to become an adviser on the project and hired [[Mark Protosevich]] to write the screenplay. [[Robert Rodriguez]] signed on in 2004 to direct the film after his friend Knowles showed him the script. Recognizing that Knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers, Rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer.<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\nFilming was set to begin in 2005, with Rodriguez planning to use the all-digital stages he was using for his production of ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', a film based on the [[graphic novel]] series by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].<ref name=\"hughes\" /> Rodriguez planned to hire [[Frank Frazetta]], the popular Burroughs and fantasy illustrator, as a designer on the film.<ref>{{cite news|authorlink=Drew McWeeny |first=Drew |last=McWeeny |title=Holy Crap!!

In 2004, unable to employ a non-DGA filmmaker, Paramount assigned [[Kerry Conran]] to direct and [[Ehren Kruger]] to rewrite the John Carter script. The Australian [[Outback]] was scouted as a shooting location. Conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in October 2005 by [[Jon Favreau]].<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\nFavreau and screenwriter [[Mark Fergus]] wanted to make their script faithful to Burroughs' novels, retaining John Carter's links to the [[American Civil War]] and ensuring that the Barsoomian [[Tharks]] were 15 feet tall (previous scripts had made them human-sized). Favreau argued that a modern-day soldier would not know how to fence or ride a horse like Carter, who had been a Confederate officer. The first film he envisioned would have adapted the first three novels in the Barsoom series: ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'', ''[[The Gods of Mars]]'', and ''[[The Warlord of Mars]]''. Unlike Rodriguez and Conran, Favreau preferred using [[practical effects]] for his film and cited ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' as his inspiration. He intended to use make-up, as well as [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], to create the Tharks.

American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film]] based on ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'', the first book in the ''[[Barsoom]]'' series of novels by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]. The film chronicles the first interplanetary adventure of [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] and his attempts to mediate [[civil war|civil unrest]] amongst the warring kingdoms of [[Barsoom]]. It was directed by [[Andrew Stanton]] from a screenplay written by Stanton, [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]], and [[Michael Chabon]]. The film was produced by [[Jim Morris (film producer)|Jim Morris]], [[Colin Wilson (film producer)|Colin Wilson]], and Lindsey Collins. ''John Carter'' stars [[Taylor Kitsch]] in the title role, [[Lynn Collins]], [[Samantha Morton]], [[Mark Strong]], [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]], [[Dominic West]], [[James Purefoy]] and [[Willem Dafoe]].\n\nSeveral developments on a theatrical film adaptation of the ''Barsoom'' series emerged throughout the 20th century from various major studios and producers, with the earliest attempt dating back to the 1930s. Most of these efforts, however, ultimately stalled in [[development hell]]. In the late-2000s, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] began a concerted effort to develop a film adaptation of Burroughs' works, after a previously abandoned venture by the studio in the 1980s. The project was driven by Stanton, who had pressed Disney to renew the [[Film rights|screen rights]] from the Burroughs estate. Stanton became director in 2009, this was his live-action debut, as his previous directorial work for Disney included the [[Pixar]] animated films, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003) and ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"Den of Geek\">{{cite news|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/946918/what_we_know_about_john_carter.html|title=What We Know About John Carter|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|date=June 19, 2011|newspaper=Den of Geek|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"SlashFilmSciretta\">{{cite news|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/john-carter-of-mars-to-be-pixars-first-live-action-film-bryan-cranston-joins-cast/|title=John Carter of Mars to be Pixar's First Live Action Film, Bryan Cranston Joins Cast|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|date=January 13, 2011|newspaper=SlashFilm|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}</ref> Filming began in November 2009, with [[principal photography]] underway in January 2010, wrapping seven months later in July 2010.<ref name=\"Latino Review\">{{cite news|last=Blaber|first=Genevieve|title=Utah is Beginning to Look Like Mars|url=http://www.latinoreview.com/news/utah-is-beginning-to-look-like-mars-7124|accessdate=June 22, 2011|newspaper=Latino Review|date=June 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"standard.net\">{{cite news |title=Disney wraps up Mars movie shooting in Utah |newspaper=[[Standard-Examiner]] |date=August 2, 2010 |url=http://www.standard.net/node/47453 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> [[Michael Giacchino]] composed the film's musical score.<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times Hero Complex\">{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2011/06/16/john-carter-andrew-stanton-on-martian-history-comic-con-and-monty-python/|title='John Carter': Andrew Stanton on Martian history, Comic-Con and ...

Please respect this longstanding guideline. -->\nIn 1881, [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] attends the funeral of his uncle, [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], a former [[American Civil War]] [[Confederate Army]] captain who died suddenly. Per Carter's instructions, the body is put in a tomb that can be unlocked only from the inside. His attorney gives Carter's personal journal for Burroughs to read, in the hope of finding clues explaining Carter's cause of death.\n\nIn a flashback to 1868 in the [[Arizona Territory]], [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] Colonel Powell arrests Carter. Powell, knowing about Carter's military background, seeks his help in fighting the [[Apache]].  Carter escapes his holding cell, but fails to get far with U.S. cavalry soldiers in close pursuit. After a run-in with a band of Apaches, Carter and a wounded Powell are chased until they take to hiding in a cave that turns out to be the object of Carter's earlier searching, the 'Spider Cave of Gold'. A [[Barsoom#Therns|Thern]] appears in the cave at that moment and, surprised by the two men, attacks them with a knife; Carter kills him but accidentally activates the Thern's powerful medallion, and is unwittingly transported to a ruined and dying planet, [[Barsoom]]. Because of his different bone density and the planet's low gravity, Carter is able to jump high and perform feats of incredible strength. He is captured by the Green Martian [[Tharks]] and their [[Emperor|Jeddak]] [[Tars Tarkas]].\n\nElsewhere on Barsoom, the Red Martian cities of Helium and Zodanga have been at war for a thousand years. Sab Than, Jeddak of Zodanga, armed with a special weapon obtained from the Thern leader Matai Shang, proposes a cease-fire and an end to the war by marrying the Princess of Helium, [[Dejah Thoris]]. The Princess escapes and is rescued by Carter. Carter, Dejah, and Tarkas' daughter Sola, embark on a quest to get to the end of a sacred river to find a way for Carter to get back home. They obtain information about the \"ninth ray\", a means of using infinite energy and also the key to understanding how the medallion works. But they are later attacked by Shang's minions, the Green Martians of Warhoon. After the attack, Carter is captured and taken back with Dejah while Sola is able to escape. The demoralized Dejah grudgingly agrees to marry Sab Than, then gives Carter his medallion and tells him to go back to Earth. Carter decides to stay and is captured by Shang, who explains to him the purpose of Therns and how they manipulate the civilizations of different worlds to their doom, feeding off the planet's resources in the process. Carter is able to make an escape as he and Sola go back to the Tharks requesting their help. There they discover Tarkas has been overthrown by a ruthless brute, Tal Hajus. Tarkas, Carter and Sola are put on trial in a colosseum battle with two enormous vicious creatures, the four-armed Great White-Apes. After defeating them and killing Hajus, Carter becomes the leader of the Tharks.\n\nThe Thark army charges on Helium and defeats the Zodangan army by killing Sab Than, while Shang is forced to escape and leave Mars for good. Carter becomes prince of Helium by marrying Dejah. On their first night, Carter decides to stay forever on Mars and throws away his medallion. Seizing this opportunity, Shang briefly reappears and sends him back to Earth. Carter then embarks on a long quest, looking for clues of the Therns' presence on Earth and hoping to find one of their medallions; after several years he appears to die suddenly and asks for unusual funeral arrangements\u2014consistent with his having found a medallion, since his return to Mars would leave his Earth body in a coma-like state. He makes Burroughs his protector, giving him clues about how to open the tomb.\n\nBack in the present, Burroughs runs back to Carter's tomb and opens it, finding it empty. Shang, disguised as a man with a bowler hat who has been observing Carter, suddenly appears, having followed Burroughs. As Shang prepares to attack, Carter appears and kills Shang. Carter then tells Burroughs that he never found a medallion. Instead, he devised a scheme to lure a Thern into revealing himself. Carter takes Shang's medallion, whispers the code, and is then transported back to Barsoom.\n\n==Cast==\n===Earthmen===\n* [[Taylor Kitsch]] as [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], a Confederate army captain who is transported to Mars.\n* [[Bryan Cranston]] as Colonel Powell, a Union colonel who wants John to help his U.S. cavalry soldiers against the Apache.\n* [[Daryl Sabara]] as [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the nephew of John Carter.\n* [[Don Stark]] as Dix, a shopkeeper at an Arizona town where John Carter stops.\n* [[Nicholas Woodeson]] as Dalton, John Carter's executor who summons Edgar.\n\n===Red Martians===\n* [[Lynn Collins]] as [[Dejah Thoris]], the Princess of Helium.\n* [[Dominic West]] as Sab Than, the Jeddak of Zodanga.\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as Tardos Mors, the Jeddak of Helium and Dejah Thoris' father.\n* [[James Purefoy]] as Kantos Kan, the [[Captain|Odwar]] of the ship Xavarian.\n* [[Art Malik]] as Zodangan General.\n\n===Tharks===\nThe Tharks are performed through a combination of voice-acting and motion-capture with stilts.\n\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as [[Tars Tarkas]], the Jeddak of the Tharks.\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Sola, a Thark that works with John Carter.\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as the voice and motion-capture of Tal Hajus, a vicious Thark that dislikes John Carter and Tars Tarkas.\n* [[Polly Walker]] as Sarkoja, a merciless Thark who hates Sola.\n* [[David Schwimmer]] as a young Thark Warrior, a Thark who informs Tars Tarkas that eighteen of the Thark eggs didn't hatch.\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as the Thark bookmaker, a Thark who collects the bets on any conflict.\n\n===Therns===\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Matai Shang, the Hekkador of the Therns.

The story was originally serialized in six monthly installments (from February through to July 1912) in the [[pulp magazine]] ''[[The All-Story]]''; those chapters, originally titled \"[[Under the Moons of Mars]]\", were then collected as a novel and published in hardcover five years later from [[A.

Burroughs responded enthusiastically, recognizing that a regular live-action feature would face various limitations to adapt accurately, so he advised Clampett to write an original animated adventure for John Carter.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jim |last=Korkis |title=Lost Cartoons: The Animated \"John Carter of Mars\" |publisher=Jim Hill Media |date=June 2, 2003 |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/02/1093.aspx |accessdate=January 2, 2009}}</ref> Working with Burroughs' son John Coleman Burroughs in 1935, Clampett used [[rotoscope]] and other hand-drawn techniques to capture the action, tracing the motions of an athlete who performed John Carter's powerful movements in the reduced Martian gravity, and designed the green-skinned, 4-armed Tharks to give them a believable appearance. He then produced footage of them riding their eight-legged Thoats at a gallop, which had all of their eight legs moving in coordinated motion; he also produced footage of a fleet of rocketships emerging from a Martian volcano. [[MGM]] was to release the cartoons, and the studio heads were enthusiastic about the series.<ref name=\"glut105-6\">{{cite book|last=Glut |first=Donald F. |title=The Frankenstein archive: Essays on the Monster, the Myth, the Movies, and More |pages=105\u20136 |publisher=McFarland |date=2002 |isbn=0-7864-1353-0}}</ref>\n\nThe test footage, produced by 1936,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.erbzine.com/mag21/2175.html|title=The John Carter Animation Project: Promotional Portfolio by John Coleman Burroughs |publisher= ERBzine (#2175) |date= 2008 |accessdate=December 9, 2009}}</ref> received negative reactions from film exhibitors across the U.S., especially in small towns; many gave their opinion that the concept of an Earthman on Mars was just too outlandish an idea for midwestern American audiences to accept. The series was not given the go-ahead, and Clampett was instead encouraged to produce an animated [[Tarzan]] series, an offer that he later declined. Clampett recognized the irony in MGM's decision, as the ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' [[movie serial]], released in the same year by [[Universal Studios]], was highly successful. He speculated that MGM believed that serials were played only to children during Saturday matinees, whereas the John Carter tales were intended to be seen by adults during the evening. The footage that Clampett produced was believed lost for many years, until Burroughs' grandson, Danton Burroughs, in the early 1970s found some of the film tests in the Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc. archives.<ref name=\"glut105-6\" /> Had ''A Princess of Mars'' been released, it might have preceded [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' to become the first American feature-length animated film.<ref name=\"hughes\">{{cite book|last=Hughes |first=David |title=The Greatest Science Fiction Movies Never Made |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |date=2008 |pages=311\u201322 |isbn=978-1-84576-755-6}}</ref>\n\n===Disney progression===\nDuring the late 1950s, famous [[stop-motion animation]] effects director [[Ray Harryhausen]] expressed interest in filming the novels, but it was not until the 1980s that producers [[Mario Kassar]] and [[Andrew G. Vajna]] bought the rights for [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], with a view to creating a competitor to ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] were hired to write, while [[John McTiernan]] and [[Tom Cruise]] were approached to direct and star. The project collapsed because McTiernan realized that visual effects were not yet advanced enough to recreate Burroughs' vision of Barsoom. The project remained at Disney, and [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was a strong proponent of filming the novels, but the rights eventually returned to the Burroughs estate.<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\n===Paramount effort===\nProducer [[James Jacks]] read [[Harry Knowles]]' autobiography, which lavishly praised the ''John Carter of Mars'' series. Having read the Burroughs' novels as a child, Jacks was moved to convince [[Paramount Pictures]] to acquire the film rights; a [[bidding war]] with [[Columbia Pictures]] followed. After Paramount and Jacks won the rights, Jacks contacted Knowles to become an adviser on the project and hired [[Mark Protosevich]] to write the screenplay. [[Robert Rodriguez]] signed on in 2004 to direct the film after his friend Knowles showed him the script. Recognizing that Knowles had been an adviser to many other filmmakers, Rodriguez asked him to be credited as a producer.<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\nFilming was set to begin in 2005, with Rodriguez planning to use the all-digital stages he was using for his production of ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', a film based on the [[graphic novel]] series by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].<ref name=\"hughes\" /> Rodriguez planned to hire [[Frank Frazetta]], the popular Burroughs and fantasy illustrator, as a designer on the film.<ref>{{cite news|authorlink=Drew McWeeny |first=Drew |last=McWeeny |title=Holy Crap!!

In 2004, unable to employ a non-DGA filmmaker, Paramount assigned [[Kerry Conran]] to direct and [[Ehren Kruger]] to rewrite the John Carter script. The Australian [[Outback]] was scouted as a shooting location. Conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in October 2005 by [[Jon Favreau]].<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\nFavreau and screenwriter [[Mark Fergus]] wanted to make their script faithful to Burroughs' novels, retaining John Carter's links to the [[American Civil War]] and ensuring that the Barsoomian [[Tharks]] were 15 feet tall (previous scripts had made them human-sized). Favreau argued that a modern-day soldier would not know how to fence or ride a horse like Carter, who had been a Confederate officer. The first film he envisioned would have adapted the first three novels in the Barsoom series: ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'', ''[[The Gods of Mars]]'', and ''[[The Warlord of Mars]]''. Unlike Rodriguez and Conran, Favreau preferred using [[practical effects]] for his film and cited ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' as his inspiration. He intended to use make-up, as well as [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], to create the Tharks. In August 2006, Paramount chose not to renew the film rights, preferring instead to focus on its ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' [[Media franchise|franchise]]. Favreau and Fergus moved on to [[Marvel Studios]]' ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''.<ref name=\"hughes\" />\n\n===Return to Disney, Stanton involvement===\n[[Andrew Stanton]], director of the [[Pixar]] Animation Studios hits ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003) and ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008), lobbied the [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] to reacquire the rights from Burroughs' estate. \"Since I'd read the books as a kid, I wanted to see somebody put it on the screen,\" he explained.<ref name=\"LA Times March 6 story\">{{cite news|author=Dawn C.

The studio was initially skeptical. Stanton had never directed a live-action film before, and wanted to make the film without any major stars whose names could guarantee an audience, at least on opening weekend.

After spending several years improvising his guitar to the sound of [[jungle music|jungle]] and [[drum and bass]] music on [[pirate radio]], Bailey proposed to collaborator [[John Zorn]] that he make an album of his musical fusion. Zorn then contacted Birmingham-based drum and bass producer D.J. Ninj to provide the musical backing, who recorded his contributions in spring 1995. After a failed session with engineer [[Mick Harris]], Bailey recorded his overlaid guitar improvisations in [[Bill Laswell]]'s [[New York City]] studio in October 1995, slightly altering Ninj's contributions to remove [[electric piano]] passages.\n\nThe resulting album has been considered the first duet's fusion of free improvisation guitar and [[breakbeat]] music ever released. Ninj's drum and bass backing is thudding and [[minimalist music|minimal]], while Bailey's guitar playing is inventive, loud and fast, incorporating truncated [[guitar lick|lick]]s, heavy distortion and chiming sounds. The album was released to critical acclaim, with some critics finding the album's pairing inspiring. The album is regarded as Bailey's first genre experiment of the mid-late 1990s, a period in which Bailey recorded with unlikely non-improvising collaborators.\n\n==Background==\n\n[[Free improvisation]] guitarist Derek Bailey's involvement with [[jungle music|jungle]] and [[drum and bass]] came via coincidence around 1993, discovering the genres when flickering through radio and discovering them on [[pirate radio]]. Bailey, then aged 64, enjoyed practising along to percussion and the jungle music he was hearing struck him, so he subsequently began practising along to it, although for a long period of time he was unaware of the genre's name.<ref name=\"Lee1\">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Stewart|title=Derek Bailey interview|work=The Sunday Times|date=19 January 1997}}</ref> He first, unsuccessfully, attempted to discover the name by asking a six-year-old boy in Bailey's local newsagent, who played jungle and drum and bass on his personal stereo, but discovered the name 'drum and bass' when reading about it in ''[[The Times]]''.<ref name=\"Lee1\" /> Bailey began making tapes of his guitar improvisations to jungle music on the radio.<ref name=\"Lee1\" /> His attraction to drum and bass was the genre's rawness and non-musical qualities. He explained:\n{{quote|\"The general bustle, it doesn't hang about, it moves. [...] It's most common to get eight bars and then repeat it, but that isn't the case in drum'n'bass as I heard it. There were structures, but not logical structures. For me, that was one of its attractions, it wasn\u2019t music. I also liked its ambiguities about the time. If you had a drummer like that, he would never play with a bass player like that. It's a really fantastic feel.\"<ref name=\"Lee1\" />}}\n\nBailey's experiments also included an additional, 'random' element as a result of the broken cassette player he had been using to tape the pirate radio broadcast. He explained: \"I thought, 'This sounds great', and then I realised it was playing back faster than it was originally.\"<ref name=\"Lee1\" /> American avant-garde musician [[John Zorn]] approached Bailey shortly afterwards, asking him to record three albums with alternate rhythm sections\u2013including [[dub music|dub]] bassist [[Bill Laswell]], [[noise rock]] group [[Ruins (Japanese band)|Ruins]] and drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]]. Bailey's \"accelerated\" jungle radio bootlegs \"seemed to offer amazing possibilities\" for the project,<ref name=\"Lee1\" /> so the guitarist sent a tape of his drum and bass-backed improvisations to Zorn and suggested to him that he could make an album of it.

After some time, Bailey could hear rainfall and asked Harris to \"turn the fucking thing up,\" but again, nothing made it on to tape. Though the presence of Ninj at the session, who was fascinated by Bailey's improvising, had kept Bailey's spirits high, Bailey and Harris were becoming frustrated and the former abandoned the session there, at which point Harris suggested Bailey use Laswell's studio in New York, which Bailey soon arranged with Zorn, hoping to hire Bob Musso as engineer.<ref name=\"efi\" />\n\nBailey took Ninj's tape to New York in September 1995 to record his contributions in Laswell's studio.

After spending several years improvising his guitar to the sound of [[jungle music|jungle]] and [[drum and bass]] music on [[pirate radio]], Bailey proposed to collaborator [[John Zorn]] that he make an album of his musical fusion. Zorn then contacted Birmingham-based drum and bass producer D.J. Ninj to provide the musical backing, who recorded his contributions in spring 1995. After a failed session with engineer [[Mick Harris]], Bailey recorded his overlaid guitar improvisations in [[Bill Laswell]]'s [[New York City]] studio in October 1995, slightly altering Ninj's contributions to remove [[electric piano]] passages.\n\nThe resulting album has been considered the first duet's fusion of free improvisation guitar and [[breakbeat]] music ever released. Ninj's drum and bass backing is thudding and [[minimalist music|minimal]], while Bailey's guitar playing is inventive, loud and fast, incorporating truncated [[guitar lick|lick]]s, heavy distortion and chiming sounds. The album was released to critical acclaim, with some critics finding the album's pairing inspiring. The album is regarded as Bailey's first genre experiment of the mid-late 1990s, a period in which Bailey recorded with unlikely non-improvising collaborators.\n\n==Background==\n\n[[Free improvisation]] guitarist Derek Bailey's involvement with [[jungle music|jungle]] and [[drum and bass]] came via coincidence around 1993, discovering the genres when flickering through radio and discovering them on [[pirate radio]]. Bailey, then aged 64, enjoyed practising along to percussion and the jungle music he was hearing struck him, so he subsequently began practising along to it, although for a long period of time he was unaware of the genre's name.<ref name=\"Lee1\">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Stewart|title=Derek Bailey interview|work=The Sunday Times|date=19 January 1997}}</ref> He first, unsuccessfully, attempted to discover the name by asking a six-year-old boy in Bailey's local newsagent, who played jungle and drum and bass on his personal stereo, but discovered the name 'drum and bass' when reading about it in ''[[The Times]]''.<ref name=\"Lee1\" /> Bailey began making tapes of his guitar improvisations to jungle music on the radio.<ref name=\"Lee1\" /> His attraction to drum and bass was the genre's rawness and non-musical qualities. He explained:\n{{quote|\"The general bustle, it doesn't hang about, it moves. [...] It's most common to get eight bars and then repeat it, but that isn't the case in drum'n'bass as I heard it. There were structures, but not logical structures. For me, that was one of its attractions, it wasn\u2019t music. I also liked its ambiguities about the time. If you had a drummer like that, he would never play with a bass player like that. It's a really fantastic feel.\"<ref name=\"Lee1\" />}}\n\nBailey's experiments also included an additional, 'random' element as a result of the broken cassette player he had been using to tape the pirate radio broadcast. He explained: \"I thought, 'This sounds great', and then I realised it was playing back faster than it was originally.\"<ref name=\"Lee1\" /> American avant-garde musician [[John Zorn]] approached Bailey shortly afterwards, asking him to record three albums with alternate rhythm sections\u2013including [[dub music|dub]] bassist [[Bill Laswell]], [[noise rock]] group [[Ruins (Japanese band)|Ruins]] and drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]]. Bailey's \"accelerated\" jungle radio bootlegs \"seemed to offer amazing possibilities\" for the project,<ref name=\"Lee1\" /> so the guitarist sent a tape of his drum and bass-backed improvisations to Zorn and suggested to him that he could make an album of it. Zorn agreed, ensuring Bailey that the project would be quick to record and release.<ref name=\"efi\">{{cite web|last1=Jaworzyn|first1=Stefan|title=Who's afraid of the big bad junglists?|url=http://www.efi.group.shef.ac.uk/fulltext/jungle.html|website=Efi|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref> Zorn tracked down D.J.

As with other Internet hoaxes presented as challenges such as \"[[Blue Whale (game)|Blue Whale]]\", players are then instructed to perform a succession of tasks, refusal to do so being met with threats. Messages are subsequently accompanied by frightening or [[Graphic violence|gory]] pictures.<ref name=fox/><ref name=news9/><ref name=BATimes/> Although the panic eventually died down throughout the rest of 2018, it returned in a much more pervasive form in early 2019, when it was claimed that Momo was being inserted into seemingly innocuous [[YouTube]] and [[YouTube Kids]] videos about [[Peppa Pig]] and ''[[Fortnite]]''; these claims were repeated by the group National Online Safety.<ref name=\"RS\" /><ref name=\"cbss\" /><ref name=\"O'Malley\"/>\n\nAlthough authorities have not confirmed any physical harm resulting from this, or even that a sustained exchange of messages took place between the Momo character and anybody, police forces and school administrations on several continents have issued warnings about the Momo Challenge and repeated common advice about Internet safety. WhatsApp is encouraging its users to block phone numbers engaging in this practice and to report them to the company.<ref name=fox/><ref name=york/>\n\nCommenting on the numerous rumours of suicide related to the Momo Challenge, web security experts and [[folklore studies|folklorists]] studying [[urban legend]] have stated that the phenomenon is likely a case of [[moral panic]]: a sensationalized hoax fuelled by unverified media reports.<ref name=Atl/><ref name=BB/> [[Benjamin Radford]] says \"the Blue Whale Game and the Momo Challenge have all the hallmarks of a classic moral panic\",<ref name=BR/> \"fuelled by parents' fears in wanting to know what their kids are up to. There's an inherent fear in what young people are doing with technology.\"<ref name=RS/><ref name=panic/> By September 2018, most phone numbers supposedly associated with \"Momo\" were out of service.<ref name=Magid/><ref name=safeint/><ref name=lemonde/><ref name=wapost/> The founder of fact-checking site [[Snopes]], David Mikkelson, doubts anybody actually came to any harm and said the whole thing \"may primarily be a product of bullies and pranksters latching onto a handy mechanism to goad and torment vulnerable youngsters rather than an intrinsic part of a particular social media challenge.\"<ref name=snopes/>\n\nIn response to the reports in early 2019, [[YouTube]] has said that it has \"not received any links to videos showing or promoting the Momo challenge on YouTube\" but permits news stories and videos intended to raise awareness of and educate against the alleged phenomenon.<ref name=\"O'Malley\" /> The website has demonetized all videos mentioning Momo, including those of news organizations, saying such content violates its advertiser-friendly content guidelines. It has also placed advisory warnings on some Momo videos alerting viewers of \"inappropriate or offensive\" content.<ref name=\"JA Verge\" />\n\n==Spread==\n\n===Asia===\nIn [[India]], the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in [[West Bengal]] indicated on August 29, 2018, that claims reported in the media about the death of two teens being linked to the Momo Challenge were \"far fetched and devoid of any evidence\". CID believes most of the large volume of Momo Challenge invitations in India originate locally as pranks sent to spread panic. A CID spokesperson stated that \"so far, the game has not claimed any victim, nor has anyone approached us saying they have played even the first level of it.\"<ref name=CID/> The CID statement follows weeks of news coverage about unconfirmed cases. After being alerted by a youth who received a Momo Challenge invitation, police in West Bengal issued a warning, and the [[cybercrime]] unit has opened an investigation. The Mumbai police had previously started to warn the population, although no complaints were filed.<ref name=india2/><ref name=india3/><ref name=india4/><ref name=india5/> Police have not confirmed any role the Momo Challenge might have played in the death of a girl in [[Education in India|grade 10]] who committed suicide after leaving a note expressing discouragement with low grades or the suicide of an engineering student in [[Chennai]].<ref name=india1/><ref name=Statesman/><ref name=Odisha2/> The [[Odisha]] Police, while issuing an advisory, are asking the media to refrain from publishing unconfirmed reports linking teen death to the Momo Challenge.<ref name=Odisha/>\n\n[[Pakistan]]'s Minister of Information Technology announced the government intends to draft legislation making it a crime to distribute both the Momo Challenge and the Blue Whale Challenge.<ref name=Pakban1/><ref name=Pakban2/>\n\nPolice authorities in the [[Philippines]] issued warnings to parents to be vigilant of their children's online activity after an 11-year-old boy died from apparent suicide by drug overdose on 11 January 2019, linking the incident to the viral challenge, although no official confirmation of direct relation to the incident has been established by the authorities.<ref name=Phil/><ref name=abs/> In the aftermath of the reports, [[Raffy Tulfo]] and other YouTubers voiced their condolences to the family, encouraging that children be monitored by their parents. They also linked the [[Blue Whale Challenge]] to the incident.<ref name=prot/><ref name=wag/>\n\n===Europe===\nIn [[France]], a group at the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|State Department]] was reviewing the situation daily in late July 2018.<ref name=france/> A complaint was filed in November by a father whose son committed suicide.<ref name=LM/>\n\nIn [[Germany]], the police were only aware of mentions made in chain letters. They are asking the population to act prudently when faced with that kind of cell phone contact.<ref name=merkur/>\n\nThe [[Luxembourg]] police confirmed one case on its territory, but no harm was caused.<ref name=lux/>\n\nThe [[Belgium|Belgian]] Public Prosecutor's Office reported on 6 November 2018 that a 13-year-old boy had been the victim of the Momo Challenge and hung himself.<ref>[https://www.wort.lu/de/lokales/momo-challenge-kein-fall-in-luxemburg-5be1c22d182b657ad3b98ef8? \"Momo Challenge\": Kein Fall in Luxemburg].

November 2018.</ref>{{Better source|reason=Citation is from a news site in Luxemburg, a Belgian source would be better|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[Spain]]'s [[National Police Corps|National Police]] warned people to stay away from new \"challenge\" applications that pop up on WhatsApp, indicating the Momo phenomenon was in vogue among teenagers.<ref name=BBCbr/>\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], some school administrations relayed warnings about the phenomenon.<ref name=york/> Reports on and awareness of the alleged challenge rose in February 2019 after the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] issued a public warning.<ref name=RS/> British authorities say the challenge is being used by [[cybercriminal]]s to gain personal identity information.<ref name=\"O'Malley\" /> Responding to [[Tabloid newspaper|tabloid]] coverage which asserted the challenge to be true, the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]], the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]], and the UK Safer Internet Centre have issued statements that the Momo Challenge is a hoax.<ref name=nspcc/><ref name=Sam/> The parent who alerted the press to the Momo Challenge subsequently said her child had not received messages from \"Momo\", but was merely told about it in a school playground conversation.<ref name=snopes/> Nevertheless, authorities and the media issued online safety precautions. Nicola Harteveld (who said her son was targeted by the challenge) and clinical psychologist Anna Colton warned on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s daytime TV show [[This Morning (TV programme)|''This Morning'']] not to search for Momo online, and advised parents to be aware of their children's activity online.<ref name=itv/>\n\n===North America===\nIn the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Quebec]], local police forces of [[Longueuil]], [[Sherbrooke]] and [[Gatineau]] have indicated that people in their jurisdiction have been approached to participate in the Momo Challenge but did not report any victims. They are asking people not to use the phone number provided in the WhatsApp messages and to send screen capture images of their phone to police authorities. The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and other police forces say they are monitoring the spread of the phenomenon but could not confirm any actual victim.<ref name=long/><ref name=sher/><ref name=gat/>\n\n[[Mexico|Mexican]] authorities investigating Internet crimes distributed detailed information to parents about the methods of the scheme. They suspect it has spread through a Facebook group frequented by young people. They warned those caught in the scheme risked self-harm, hacking and extortion.<ref name=news9/><ref name=heavy/>\n\nIn early August 2018 in the [[United States]], various local police forces warned the population about the dangers of the phenomenon. Some jurisdictions have received several complaints, but no jurisdiction reported anybody being harmed.<ref name=Illinois/> The Momo character has also appeared in the popular game ''[[Minecraft]]'' in the form of in-game skins and unofficial [[Modding|mods]] created by the game's users. A police officer in [[Ohio]] was concerned to see Momo in his son's copy of the game, worried about the possibility that the mod could lead to participation in the Momo Challenge. After news reports started to outline the link between the ''Minecraft'' mod and the Momo Challenge, [[Microsoft]] announced it was taking measures to \"restrict access to the mod\" in question.<ref name=fox2/><ref name=fox3/>\n\n===South America===\nIn [[Argentina]], despite several media reports tentatively establishing a relationship between the Momo Challenge and the suicide of a 12-year-old girl from [[Ingeniero Maschwitz]], no link has been confirmed by authorities.<ref name=news9/><ref name=BATimes/><ref name=popular/>\n\nAuthorities in [[Brazil]] have not confirmed any case linked to the Momo Challenge. The national [[SaferNet]] non-profit organization has been approached by concerned parents and warned that this is only one of a variety of schemes to extort money and information from people.<ref name=BBCbr/>\n\nThe [[Colombia]]n police have not confirmed news reports linking the death of two youths in [[Barbosa, Santander|Barbosa]] to the Momo Challenge in early September.<ref name=Colombia1/>\n\n==Picture==\nEarly news reports stating the image of Momo was of a [[sculpture]] by Japanese artist Midori Hayashi turned out to be incorrect. Hayashi indicated that it was not her piece, and Internet users identified Link Factory, a Japanese special effects company, as the correct author of the sculpture.<ref name=heavy/>\n\nThe sculpture has bulging eyes and a beak-like mouth. Pictures of the sculpture were first posted online in 2016, when it was publicly exhibited.<ref name=news9/><ref name=heavy/> The remainder of the sculpture, not always shown by \"Momo\" accounts of the media, consists of a small, bald, chicken-like body with avian feet and human [[breast]]s.<ref name=\"\u59d1\u7372\u9ce5\" /> A photograph of a sculpture of an ''[[ubume]]'' (a ''[[y\u014dkai]]'' or ghost) was popularly used to depict Momo.<ref name=\"\u59d1\u7372\u9ce5\"/> The firm denies any involvement with the hoax. Japanese artist Keisuke Aiso confirmed in March 2019 that the sculpture had been thrown away in 2018, after its material\u2014[[natural rubber]] and plant oils\u2014had decomposed. Aisawa kept an eye from the sculpture, which he intends to reuse for another creation in the future.<ref name=ao/><ref name=momogone/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[Video game]]s based on the Momo Challenge has been published by various independent developers; in July 2018 by SirFatCat<ref>{{cite web |title=Momo |url=https://gamejolt.com/games/momo/354672 |website=Game Jolt |language=en}}</ref> and Indie_RU,<ref>{{cite web |title=Game Jolt - Indie games for the love of it |url=https://gamejolt.com/games/Momo/359407 |website=Game Jolt |language=en}}</ref> in August 2018 by Dymchick1<ref>{{cite web |title=MOMO.EXE on Steam |url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/923470/MOMOEXE/ |website=Steampowered.com |language=en}}</ref> and in October 2018 by Caffeine.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Momo Game on Steam |url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/954530/The_Momo_Game/ |website=Steampowered.com |language=en}}</ref> The player has to do various tasks and the goal is usually to survive before getting rescued.\n\nThe Momo Challenge will be used as a plot device in an upcoming teen [[horror film]] called [[Getaway (2020 film)|''Getaway'']], produced by Emagine Content, November 11 Pictures, SorenFilms Productions and Lady of the Light Productions.
