{"title_page": "Kazusa Takashima", "text_new": "{{nihongo|'''Kazusa Takashima'''|\u9ad8\u5d8b \u4e0a\u7dcf|Takashima Kazusa|born October 23 in [[Hokkaido]]}} is a Japanese [[Mangaka|manga artist]], famous for her [[yaoi]] [[manga]]. After being a [[doujinshi]] artist from 1999\u20132000, she became an official manga artist in 2001. In addition to this, she has also illustrated a number of [[light novels]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Hokkaido]] on October 23, she began her career in 1999 as a [[Houshin Engi]] [[doujinshi]] artist as well as doing fanart from popular series like [[Hikaru no Go]], [[Shaman King]] and [[Yami no Matsuei]]. Her works were predominantly [[yaoi|BL]]-related.\n\nFinally she got her break when her first original series, [[Harlem Beat wa Yoake Made]] was serialized in [[Kadokawa Shoten|Kadokawa]]'s [[Monthly Asuka]]. After a well received debut, the company decided to publish the series into an actual volume.<ref>[http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/comic/bk_detail.php?pcd=200203000671 Kadokawa: Harlem Beat wa Yoake Made]</ref> After that, she went on to make another of her well-known series: [[Last Client]] which was serialized in [[Libre Publishing|Biblos]]'s ''BexBoy Magazine'' in 2002. In that same year she got [[Wild Rock]] published by [[Libre Publishing|Biblos]] (it went straight to manga form; not serialized). Since then she has published roughly nine distinctive titles through various publishing companies and has been the illustrator of a number of [[light novels]] by various authors, and other media.\n\nShe filed a lawsuit against [[Kayono]] in 2004. The lawsuit was founded on Takashima's belief that Kayono had directly traced over her work ''[[Wild Rock]]'', and used it for her own [[manga]].<ref>[http://kayono_kenshou.at.infoseek.co.jp/kenshougazou.html Kayono Kenshou] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526074907/http://kayono_kenshou.at.infoseek.co.jp/kenshougazou.html |date=2010-05-26 }}</ref> The judge threw out the case (resulting in Takashima losing). Takashima decided to go on hiatus, leaving all of her series unfinished. She resumed work in 2007 with the fourth installment of [[Harlem Beat wa Yoake Made]]. Since then, she has finished the series, [[Wild Rock]] and [[Man's Best Friend (manga)|Man's Best Friend]] have been reprinted, and she did a [[centerfold|pinup]] of Chris (from her series [[Last Client]], which had been left on hiatus) in [[Libre Publishing|Biblos]]'s ''GOLD magazine''.

This, combined with his controversial lifestyle and behaviour, led Soviet authorities to repeatedly persecute and imprison him, and suppress his films.\n\nAlthough he started professional film-making in 1954, Parajanov later disowned all the films he made before 1965 as \"garbage\". After directing ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'' (renamed ''Wild Horses of Fire'' for most foreign distributions) Parajanov became something of an international celebrity and simultaneously a target of attacks from the system. Nearly all of his film projects and plans from 1965 to 1973 were banned, scrapped or closed by the Soviet film administrations, both local (in [[Kiev]] and [[Yerevan]]) and federal ([[Goskino]]), almost without discussion, until he was finally arrested in late 1973 on charges of [[rape]], [[homosexuality]] and [[bribery]]. He was imprisoned until 1977, despite a  pleas for pardon from various artists. Even after his release (he was arrested for the third and last time in 1982) he was a ''[[persona non grata]]'' in Soviet cinema. It was not until the mid-1980s, when the political climate started to relax, that he could resume directing. Still, it required the help of influential Georgian actor [[Dodo Abashidze]] and other friends to have his last feature films greenlighted. His health seriously weakened by four years in labor camps and nine months in prison in Tbilisi, Parajanov died of [[lung cancer]] in 1990, at a time when, after almost 20 years of suppression, his films were being featured at foreign film festivals. \nIn January 1988, he said in an interview, \"Everyone knows that I have three Motherlands. I was born in Georgia, worked in Ukraine and I'm going to die in Armenia.\"<ref>[http://www.parajanov.com/interview.html Parajanov Interview]</ref>\nSergei Parajanov is buried at [[Komitas Pantheon]] in Yerevan.<ref>[http://hush.am/index.php?route=product/hush&grave_id=hush710d9f2e5366a40&gcemetery=Komitas+Pantheon Parajanov's memorial tombstone at Komitas Pantheon]</ref>\n\nParajanov's films won prizes at [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]], [[Istanbul International Film Festival]], [[Nika Awards]], [[Rotterdam International Film Festival]], [[Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo International Film Festival]] and others. Parajanov's most comprehensive retrospective in the UK took place in 2010 at [[BFI Southbank]], the [[BFI]]'s London flagship venue. The retrospective was curated by Layla Alexander-Garrett and contemporary art curator and Parajanov specialist Elisabetta Fabrizi (BFI Head of Exhibitions) who also commissioned a Parajanov-inspired new commission in the [[BFI Gallery]] by contemporary artist [[Matt Collishaw]] ('Retrospectre'). A symposium was dedicated to Paradjanov's ouvre bringing together world experts to discuss and celebrate the director's contribution to cinema and art.<ref>Fabrizi, Elisabetta, 'The BFI Gallery Book', BFI, London, 2011. </ref>. The director's retrospective was the best grossing season at BFI Southbank in the 2010-11 financial year.\n\n==Early life and films==\n[[Image:ParajanovHouseTbilisi.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial plaque on the Parajanov family house in Tbilisi (7 Kote Meskhi St.)]]\nParajanov was born '''Sarkis Hovsepi Parajaniants''' (\u054d\u0561\u0580\u0563\u056b\u057d \u0540\u0578\u057e\u057d\u0565\u0583\u056b \u0553\u0561\u0580\u0561\u057b\u0561\u0576\u0575\u0561\u0576\u0581) to artistically gifted [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents, Iosif Paradjanov and Siranush Bejanova, in [[Tbilisi, Georgia]]. (The family name of Parajaniants is attested by a surviving historical document at the Sergei Parajanov Museum in Yerevan.)<ref>Sergei Paradzhanov and Zaven Sarkisian, ''Kaleidoskop Paradzhanov: Risunok, kollazh, assambliazh'' (Yerevan: Muzei Sergeiia Paradzhanova, 2008), p.8</ref> He gained access to art from an early age. In 1945, he traveled to Moscow, enrolled in the directing department at the [[VGIK]], one of the oldest and highly respected film schools in [[Europe]], and studied under the tutelage of directors [[Igor Savchenko]] and [[Aleksandr Dovzhenko]].\n\nIn 1948 he was convicted of [[homosexuality|homosexual acts]] (which were illegal at the time in the Soviet Union) with a [[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]] officer named Nikolai Mikava in Tbilisi. He was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released under an amnesty after three months.<ref>[http://www.segodnya.ua/news/851530.html Segodnya.ua]</ref> In video interviews, friends and relatives contest the truthfulness of anything he was charged with. They speculate the punishment may have been a form of political retaliation for his rebellious views.\n\nIn 1950 Parajanov married his first wife, Nigyar Kerimova, in [[Moscow]]. She came from a [[Tatar|Muslim Tatar]] family and converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] to marry Parajanov. She was later murdered by her relatives because of her conversion. After her murder Parajanov left [[Russia]] for Kiev, [[Ukraine]], where he produced a few documentaries (''Dumka'', ''Golden Hands'', ''Natalia Uzhvy'') and a handful of narrative films: ''Andriesh'' (based on a fairy tale by the Moldovan writer [[Emilian Bukov]]), ''The Top Guy'' (a [[kolkhoz]] musical), ''Ukrainian Rhapsody'' (a wartime melodrama), and ''[[Flower on the Stone]]'' (about a religious cult infiltrating a mining town in the [[Donets Basin]]). He became fluent in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and married his second wife, Svitlana Ivanivna Shcherbatiuk, also known as Svetlana Sherbatiuk or Svetlana Parajanov, in 1956. Shcherbatiuk gave birth to a son, Suren, in 1958.<ref>[http://www.parajanov.com/suren.html Suren Parajanov]</ref>\n\n==Break from Soviet Realism==\n\n[[Image:Sayat nova.jpg|thumb|left|Parajanov's muse, Georgian actress [[Sofiko Chiaureli]] in ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'']]\n\n[[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s first film ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' had an enormous impact on Parajanov's self-discovery as a filmmaker. Later the influence became mutual, and he and Tarkovsky became close friends. Another influence was Italian filmmaker [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], who Parajanov would later describe as \"like a God\" to him and a director of \"majestic style\".<ref>{{cite AV media |date=1994 |title=Paradjanov: A Requiem |medium=Documentary |publisher=KINO Productions |ref= }}</ref> In 1965 Parajanov abandoned [[socialist realism]] and directed the poetic ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'', his first film over which he had complete creative control. It won numerous international awards and, unlike the subsequent ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'', was relatively well received by the Soviet authorities. The Script Editorial Board at Goskino of Ukraine praised the film for \"conveying the poetic quality and philosophical depth of M. Kotsiubynsky\u2019s tale through the language of cinema,\" and called it \"a brilliant creative success of the Dovzhenko studio.\" Moscow also agreed to Goskino of Ukraine's request to release the film with its original Ukrainian soundtrack intact, rather than redub the dialogue into Russian for Soviet-wide release, in order to preserve its Ukrainian flavor.<ref>RGALI (Russian State Archive of Art and Literature), Goskino production and censorship files: f. 2944, op. 4, d. 280.</ref> (Russian dubbing was standard practice at that time for non-Russian Soviet films when they were distributed outside the republic of origin.)\n\nParajanov departed Kiev shortly afterwards for his ancestors' homeland, [[Armenia]]. In 1969, he embarked on ''Sayat Nova'', a film that many consider to be his crowning achievement, though it was shot under relatively poor conditions and had a very small budget.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/hollo961.htm Sergei Parajanov \u2013 Interview with Ron Holloway, 1988] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206074545/http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/hollo961.htm |date=2007-12-06 }}</ref> Soviet censors intervened and banned ''Sayat Nova'' for its allegedly inflammatory content. Parajanov re-edited his footage and renamed the film ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]''. Critic Alexei Korotyukov remarked: \"Paradjanov made films not about how things are, but how they would have been had he been God.\" {{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Mikhail Vartanov]] wrote in 1969 that \"Besides the film language suggested by Griffith and Eisenstein, the world cinema has not discovered anything revolutionarily new until ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'' ...\".<ref name=\"Parajanov.com\">[http://www.parajanov.com/main.html Parajanov.com]</ref>\n\n==Imprisonment and later work==\n\n[[Image:Parajanov Tbilisi.JPG|thumb|left|Parajanov's monument in Tbilisi]]\n\n[[File:\u0553\u0561\u0580\u0561\u057b\u0561\u0576\u0578\u057e.jpg|thumb|Parajanov's statue in front of his museum in Yerevan]]\n\nBy December 1973, the Soviet authorities had grown increasingly suspicious of Parajanov's perceived subversive proclivities, particularly his bisexuality, and sentenced him to five years in a hard labor camp in [[Siberia]] for \"a rape of a Communist Party member, and the propagation of pornography.\"<ref name=\"mig.com.ua\">[http://www.mig.com.ua/events.php?act=1&cat=1057&eventID=10849  ''\u041e\u0441\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u041f\u0421\u0421'' (in Russian), ''Moskovskiy Komsomolets'', 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070810210559/http://www.mig.com.ua/events.php?act=1&cat=1057&eventID=10849 |date=2007-08-10 }}</ref> Three days before Parajanov was sentenced, [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, asserting that \"In the last ten years Sergei Paradjanov has made only two films: ''Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors'' and ''The Colour of Pomegranates''. They have influenced cinema first in [[Ukraine]], second in this country as a whole, and third in the world at large. Artistically, there are few people in the entire world who could replace Paradjanov. He is guilty \u2013 guilty of his solitude. We are guilty of not thinking of him daily and of failing to discover the significance of a master.\" An eclectic group of artists, filmmakers and activists protested, to little avail, on behalf of Parajanov, among them [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Fran\u00e7oise Sagan]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and [[Mikhail Vartanov]].\n\nParajanov served four years out of his five-year sentence, and later credited his early release to the efforts of the [[France|French]] [[Surrealist]] poet and novelist [[Louis Aragon]], the Russian poet [[Elsa Triolet]] (Aragon's wife), and the American writer [[John Updike]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> His early release was authorized by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], presumably as a consequence of Brezhnev's chance meeting with Aragon and Triolet at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow. When asked by Brezhnev if he could be of any assistance, Aragon requested the release of Parajanov, which was effected by December 1977.<ref name=\"mig.com.ua\"/>\n\nWhile he was incarcerated, Parajanov produced a large number of miniature doll-like sculptures (some of which were lost) and some 800 drawings and collages, many of which were later displayed in [[Yerevan]], where the [[Sergei Parajanov Museum]] is now permanently located.<ref>[http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/paradjanov_the_magnificent Frieze Magazine, Paradjanov the Magnificent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142206/http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/paradjanov_the_magnificent/ |date=2008-04-16 }}</ref> (The museum, opened in 1991, a year after Parajanov\u2019s death, hosts more than 200 works as well as furnishings from his home in [[Tbilisi]].) His efforts in the camp were repeatedly compromised by prison guards, who deprived him of materials and called him mad, their cruelty only subsiding after a statement from Moscow admitted that \"the director is very talented.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nAfter his return from prison to Tbilisi, the close watch of Soviet censors prevented Parajanov from continuing his cinematic pursuits and steered him towards the artistic outlets he had nurtured during his time in prison. He crafted extraordinarily intricate collages, created a large collection of abstract drawings and pursued numerous other avenues of non-cinematic art, sewing more dolls and some whimsical suits.\n\nIn February 1982 Parajanov was once again imprisoned, on charges of bribery, which happened to coincide with his return to Moscow for the premiere of a play commemorating [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] at the [[Taganka Theatre]], and was effected with some degree of trickery. Despite another stiff sentence, he was freed in less than a year, with his health seriously weakened.<ref name=\"mig.com.ua\"/>\n\nIn 1985, the slow thaw within the [[Soviet Union]] spurred Parajanov to resume his passion for cinema. With the encouragement of various [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] intellectuals, he created the multi-award-winning film ''[[The Legend of Suram Fortress]]'', based on a novella by [[Daniel Chonkadze]], his first return to cinema since ''Sayat Nova'' fifteen years earlier. In 1988, Parajanov made another multi-award-winning film, ''[[Ashik Kerib (film)|Ashik Kerib]]'', based on a story by [[Mikhail Lermontov]]. It is the story of a wandering minstrel, set in the [[Azeri]] culture. Parajanov dedicated the film to his close friend [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and \"to all the children of the world\".\n\nParajanov then attempted to complete his final project. He died of [[cancer]] in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]], on July 20, 1990, aged 66, leaving this final work, ''The Confession'', unfinished. It survives in its original negative as ''[[Parajanov: The Last Spring (film)]]'', assembled by his close friend [[Mikhail Vartanov]] in 1992. [[Federico Fellini]], [[Tonino Guerra]], [[Francesco Rosi]], [[Alberto Moravia]], [[Giulietta Masina]], [[Marcello Mastroianni]] and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] were among those who publicly mourned his death.<ref name=\"Parajanov.com\"/> They sent a telegram to Russia with the following statement: \"The world of cinema has lost a magician\".<ref name=\"Parajanov.com\"/>\n\n== Influences and legacy==\n[[File:Sergei Parajanov's tombstone at Komitas Pantheon.jpg|thumb|upright|Parajanov's tombstone in [[Yerevan]]]]\nDespite having studied film at the [[VGIK]], Parajanov discovered his artistic path only after seeing [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s dreamlike first film ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]''. Parajanov was highly appreciated by Tarkovsky himself in \"[[Voyage in Time]]\" (\"Always with huge gratitude and pleasure I remember the films of Sergei Parajanov which I love very much.

This, combined with his controversial lifestyle and behaviour, led Soviet authorities to repeatedly persecute and imprison him, and suppress his films.\n\nAlthough he started professional film-making in 1954, Parajanov later disowned all the films he made before 1965 as \"garbage\". After directing ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'' (renamed ''Wild Horses of Fire'' for most foreign distributions) Parajanov became something of an international celebrity and simultaneously a target of attacks from the system. Nearly all of his film projects and plans from 1965 to 1973 were banned, scrapped or closed by the Soviet film administrations, both local (in [[Kiev]] and [[Yerevan]]) and federal ([[Goskino]]), almost without discussion, until he was finally arrested in late 1973 on charges of [[rape]], [[homosexuality]] and [[bribery]]. He was imprisoned until 1977, despite a  pleas for pardon from various artists. Even after his release (he was arrested for the third and last time in 1982) he was a ''[[persona non grata]]'' in Soviet cinema. It was not until the mid-1980s, when the political climate started to relax, that he could resume directing. Still, it required the help of influential Georgian actor [[Dodo Abashidze]] and other friends to have his last feature films greenlighted. His health seriously weakened by four years in labor camps and nine months in prison in Tbilisi, Parajanov died of [[lung cancer]] in 1990, at a time when, after almost 20 years of suppression, his films were being featured at foreign film festivals. \nIn January 1988, he said in an interview, \"Everyone knows that I have three Motherlands. I was born in Georgia, worked in Ukraine and I'm going to die in Armenia.\"<ref>[http://www.parajanov.com/interview.html Parajanov Interview]</ref>\nSergei Parajanov is buried at [[Komitas Pantheon]] in Yerevan.<ref>[http://hush.am/index.php?route=product/hush&grave_id=hush710d9f2e5366a40&gcemetery=Komitas+Pantheon Parajanov's memorial tombstone at Komitas Pantheon]</ref>\n\nParajanov's films won prizes at [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]], [[Istanbul International Film Festival]], [[Nika Awards]], [[Rotterdam International Film Festival]], [[Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo International Film Festival]] and others. Parajanov's most comprehensive retrospective in the UK took place in 2010 at [[BFI Southbank]], the [[BFI]]'s London flagship venue. Curated by contemporary art curator and Parajanov specialist Elisabetta Fabrizi in collaboration with the Paradjanov Festival, the screenings were complemented by a Parajanov inspired new commission in the [[BFI Gallery]] by contemporary artist [[Matt Collishaw]] ('Retrospectre'), and a symposium dedicated to Paradjanov's ouvre which brought together world experts to discuss and celebrate the director's contribution to cinema and art.<ref>Fabrizi, Elisabetta, 'The BFI Gallery Book', BFI, London, 2011. </ref>. The director's retrospective was the best grossing season at BFI Southbank in the 2010-11 financial year.\n\n==Early life and films==\n[[Image:ParajanovHouseTbilisi.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial plaque on the Parajanov family house in Tbilisi (7 Kote Meskhi St.)]]\nParajanov was born '''Sarkis Hovsepi Parajaniants''' (\u054d\u0561\u0580\u0563\u056b\u057d \u0540\u0578\u057e\u057d\u0565\u0583\u056b \u0553\u0561\u0580\u0561\u057b\u0561\u0576\u0575\u0561\u0576\u0581) to artistically gifted [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents, Iosif Paradjanov and Siranush Bejanova, in [[Tbilisi, Georgia]]. (The family name of Parajaniants is attested by a surviving historical document at the Sergei Parajanov Museum in Yerevan.)<ref>Sergei Paradzhanov and Zaven Sarkisian, ''Kaleidoskop Paradzhanov: Risunok, kollazh, assambliazh'' (Yerevan: Muzei Sergeiia Paradzhanova, 2008), p.8</ref> He gained access to art from an early age. In 1945, he traveled to Moscow, enrolled in the directing department at the [[VGIK]], one of the oldest and highly respected film schools in [[Europe]], and studied under the tutelage of directors [[Igor Savchenko]] and [[Aleksandr Dovzhenko]].\n\nIn 1948 he was convicted of [[homosexuality|homosexual acts]] (which were illegal at the time in the Soviet Union) with a [[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]] officer named Nikolai Mikava in Tbilisi. He was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released under an amnesty after three months.<ref>[http://www.segodnya.ua/news/851530.html Segodnya.ua]</ref> In video interviews, friends and relatives contest the truthfulness of anything he was charged with. They speculate the punishment may have been a form of political retaliation for his rebellious views.\n\nIn 1950 Parajanov married his first wife, Nigyar Kerimova, in [[Moscow]]. She came from a [[Tatar|Muslim Tatar]] family and converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] to marry Parajanov. She was later murdered by her relatives because of her conversion. After her murder Parajanov left [[Russia]] for Kiev, [[Ukraine]], where he produced a few documentaries (''Dumka'', ''Golden Hands'', ''Natalia Uzhvy'') and a handful of narrative films: ''Andriesh'' (based on a fairy tale by the Moldovan writer [[Emilian Bukov]]), ''The Top Guy'' (a [[kolkhoz]] musical), ''Ukrainian Rhapsody'' (a wartime melodrama), and ''[[Flower on the Stone]]'' (about a religious cult infiltrating a mining town in the [[Donets Basin]]). He became fluent in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and married his second wife, Svitlana Ivanivna Shcherbatiuk, also known as Svetlana Sherbatiuk or Svetlana Parajanov, in 1956. Shcherbatiuk gave birth to a son, Suren, in 1958.<ref>[http://www.parajanov.com/suren.html Suren Parajanov]</ref>\n\n==Break from Soviet Realism==\n\n[[Image:Sayat nova.jpg|thumb|left|Parajanov's muse, Georgian actress [[Sofiko Chiaureli]] in ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'']]\n\n[[Andrey Tarkovsky]]'s first film ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' had an enormous impact on Parajanov's self-discovery as a filmmaker. Later the influence became mutual, and he and Tarkovsky became close friends. Another influence was Italian filmmaker [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], who Parajanov would later describe as \"like a God\" to him and a director of \"majestic style\".<ref>{{cite AV media |date=1994 |title=Paradjanov: A Requiem |medium=Documentary |publisher=KINO Productions |ref= }}</ref> In 1965 Parajanov abandoned [[socialist realism]] and directed the poetic ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]'', his first film over which he had complete creative control. It won numerous international awards and, unlike the subsequent ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'', was relatively well received by the Soviet authorities. The Script Editorial Board at Goskino of Ukraine praised the film for \"conveying the poetic quality and philosophical depth of M. Kotsiubynsky\u2019s tale through the language of cinema,\" and called it \"a brilliant creative success of the Dovzhenko studio.\" Moscow also agreed to Goskino of Ukraine's request to release the film with its original Ukrainian soundtrack intact, rather than redub the dialogue into Russian for Soviet-wide release, in order to preserve its Ukrainian flavor.<ref>RGALI (Russian State Archive of Art and Literature), Goskino production and censorship files: f. 2944, op. 4, d. 280.</ref> (Russian dubbing was standard practice at that time for non-Russian Soviet films when they were distributed outside the republic of origin.)\n\nParajanov departed Kiev shortly afterwards for his ancestors' homeland, [[Armenia]]. In 1969, he embarked on ''Sayat Nova'', a film that many consider to be his crowning achievement, though it was shot under relatively poor conditions and had a very small budget.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/hollo961.htm Sergei Parajanov \u2013 Interview with Ron Holloway, 1988] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206074545/http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/hollo961.htm |date=2007-12-06 }}</ref> Soviet censors intervened and banned ''Sayat Nova'' for its allegedly inflammatory content. Parajanov re-edited his footage and renamed the film ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]''. Critic Alexei Korotyukov remarked: \"Paradjanov made films not about how things are, but how they would have been had he been God.\" {{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Mikhail Vartanov]] wrote in 1969 that \"Besides the film language suggested by Griffith and Eisenstein, the world cinema has not discovered anything revolutionarily new until ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'' ...\".<ref name=\"Parajanov.com\">[http://www.parajanov.com/main.html Parajanov.com]</ref>\n\n==Imprisonment and later work==\n\n[[Image:Parajanov Tbilisi.JPG|thumb|left|Parajanov's monument in Tbilisi]]\n\n[[File:\u0553\u0561\u0580\u0561\u057b\u0561\u0576\u0578\u057e.jpg|thumb|Parajanov's statue in front of his museum in Yerevan]]\n\nBy December 1973, the Soviet authorities had grown increasingly suspicious of Parajanov's perceived subversive proclivities, particularly his bisexuality, and sentenced him to five years in a hard labor camp in [[Siberia]] for \"a rape of a Communist Party member, and the propagation of pornography.\"<ref name=\"mig.com.ua\">[http://www.mig.com.ua/events.php?act=1&cat=1057&eventID=10849  ''\u041e\u0441\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u041f\u0421\u0421'' (in Russian), ''Moskovskiy Komsomolets'', 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070810210559/http://www.mig.com.ua/events.php?act=1&cat=1057&eventID=10849 |date=2007-08-10 }}</ref> Three days before Parajanov was sentenced, [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, asserting that \"In the last ten years Sergei Paradjanov has made only two films: ''Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors'' and ''The Colour of Pomegranates''. They have influenced cinema first in [[Ukraine]], second in this country as a whole, and third in the world at large. Artistically, there are few people in the entire world who could replace Paradjanov. He is guilty \u2013 guilty of his solitude. We are guilty of not thinking of him daily and of failing to discover the significance of a master.\" An eclectic group of artists, filmmakers and activists protested, to little avail, on behalf of Parajanov, among them [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Fran\u00e7oise Sagan]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and [[Mikhail Vartanov]].\n\nParajanov served four years out of his five-year sentence, and later credited his early release to the efforts of the [[France|French]] [[Surrealist]] poet and novelist [[Louis Aragon]], the Russian poet [[Elsa Triolet]] (Aragon's wife), and the American writer [[John Updike]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> His early release was authorized by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], presumably as a consequence of Brezhnev's chance meeting with Aragon and Triolet at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow. When asked by Brezhnev if he could be of any assistance, Aragon requested the release of Parajanov, which was effected by December 1977.<ref name=\"mig.com.ua\"/>\n\nWhile he was incarcerated, Parajanov produced a large number of miniature doll-like sculptures (some of which were lost) and some 800 drawings and collages, many of which were later displayed in [[Yerevan]], where the [[Sergei Parajanov Museum]] is now permanently located.<ref>[http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/paradjanov_the_magnificent Frieze Magazine, Paradjanov the Magnificent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142206/http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/paradjanov_the_magnificent/ |date=2008-04-16 }}</ref> (The museum, opened in 1991, a year after Parajanov\u2019s death, hosts more than 200 works as well as furnishings from his home in [[Tbilisi]].) His efforts in the camp were repeatedly compromised by prison guards, who deprived him of materials and called him mad, their cruelty only subsiding after a statement from Moscow admitted that \"the director is very talented.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nAfter his return from prison to Tbilisi, the close watch of Soviet censors prevented Parajanov from continuing his cinematic pursuits and steered him towards the artistic outlets he had nurtured during his time in prison. He crafted extraordinarily intricate collages, created a large collection of abstract drawings and pursued numerous other avenues of non-cinematic art, sewing more dolls and some whimsical suits.\n\nIn February 1982 Parajanov was once again imprisoned, on charges of bribery, which happened to coincide with his return to Moscow for the premiere of a play commemorating [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] at the [[Taganka Theatre]], and was effected with some degree of trickery. Despite another stiff sentence, he was freed in less than a year, with his health seriously weakened.<ref name=\"mig.com.ua\"/>\n\nIn 1985, the slow thaw within the [[Soviet Union]] spurred Parajanov to resume his passion for cinema. With the encouragement of various [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] intellectuals, he created the multi-award-winning film ''[[The Legend of Suram Fortress]]'', based on a novella by [[Daniel Chonkadze]], his first return to cinema since ''Sayat Nova'' fifteen years earlier. In 1988, Parajanov made another multi-award-winning film, ''[[Ashik Kerib (film)|Ashik Kerib]]'', based on a story by [[Mikhail Lermontov]]. It is the story of a wandering minstrel, set in the [[Azeri]] culture. Parajanov dedicated the film to his close friend [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] and \"to all the children of the world\".\n\nParajanov then attempted to complete his final project. He died of [[cancer]] in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]], on July 20, 1990, aged 66, leaving this final work, ''The Confession'', unfinished. It survives in its original negative as ''[[Parajanov: The Last Spring (film)]]'', assembled by his close friend [[Mikhail Vartanov]] in 1992. [[Federico Fellini]], [[Tonino Guerra]], [[Francesco Rosi]], [[Alberto Moravia]], [[Giulietta Masina]], [[Marcello Mastroianni]] and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] were among those who publicly mourned his death.<ref name=\"Parajanov.com\"/> They sent a telegram to Russia with the following statement: \"The world of cinema has lost a magician\".<ref name=\"Parajanov.com\"/>\n\n== Influences and legacy==\n[[File:Sergei Parajanov's tombstone at Komitas Pantheon.jpg|thumb|upright|Parajanov's tombstone in [[Yerevan]]]]\nDespite having studied film at the [[VGIK]], Parajanov discovered his artistic path only after seeing [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s dreamlike first film ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]''. Parajanov was highly appreciated by Tarkovsky himself in \"[[Voyage in Time]]\" (\"Always with huge gratitude and pleasure I remember the films of Sergei Parajanov which I love very much.

His English name, \"Zoroaster\", derives from a later (5th century BC) [[Greek language|Greek]] transcription, ''Z\u014droastr\u0113s'' ({{lang|grc|\u0396\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2}}),<ref name=\"Schlerath_1977_133_135\">{{harvnb|Schlerath|1977|pp=133\u2013135}}</ref> as used in [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]]'s ''[[Xanthus (historian)#Lydiaca|Lydiaca]]'' (Fragment 32) and in [[Plato]]'s ''[[First Alcibiades]]'' (122a1). This form appears subsequently in the Latin ''{{lang|la|Z\u014droastr\u0113s}}'' and, in later Greek orthographies, as \u0396\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 ''Z\u014droastris''. The Greek form of the name appears to be based on a phonetic transliteration or semantic substitution of Avestan ''zara\u03d1-'' with the Greek \u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 ''z\u014dros'' (literally \"undiluted\") and the Avestan ''-u\u0161tra'' with \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ''astron'' (\"[[star]]\").\n\nIn Avestan, ''Zara\u03d1u\u0161tra'' is generally accepted to derive from an Old Iranian ''*Zaratu\u0161tra-''; The element half of the name (''-u\u0161tra-'') is thought to be the Indo-Iranian root for \"camel\", with the entire name meaning \"he who can manage camels\".<ref name = \"Schmitt_2003\"/>{{Ref label|ushtra_camel|a|none}}\nReconstructions from later Iranian languages\u2014particularly from the [[Iranian languages#Middle Iranian languages|Middle Persian]] (300 BCE) ''Zardusht'',{{explain|date=October 2015}} which is the form that the name took in the 9th- to 12th-century Zoroastrian texts\u2014suggest that ''*Zaratu\u0161tra-'' might be a [[Indo-European ablaut#Zero grade|zero-grade]] form of ''*Zarantu\u0161tra-''.<ref name = \"Schmitt_2003\"/>\nSubject then to whether ''Zara\u03d1u\u0161tra'' derives from ''*Zarantu\u0161tra-'' or from ''*Zaratu\u0161tra-'', several interpretations have been proposed.{{Ref label|name_contra|b|none}}\n\nIf ''Zarantu\u0161tra'' is the original form, it may mean\n\"with old/aging camels\",<ref name = \"Schmitt_2003\"/> related to [[Avestan language|Avestic]] ''zarant-''<ref name = \"Schlerath_1977_133_135\"/> (''cf.''

Accessed on 31 August 2016.</ref>]]\nLike the Greeks of classical antiquity, [[Islam]]ic tradition understands Zoroaster to be the founding prophet of the Magians (via Aramaic, Arabic ''[[Majus]]'', collective ''Majusya''). The 11th-century Cordoban [[Ibn Hazm]] (Zahiri school) contends that ''Kitabi'' \"of the Book\" cannot apply in light of the Zoroastrian assertion that their books were destroyed by Alexander. Citing the authority of the 8th-century [[Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi|al-Kalbi]], the 9th- and 10th-century Sunni historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] (i.648)<ref name=\"apud_B\u00fcchner_1936_105\">Qtd. in {{harvnb|B\u00fcchner|1936|p=105}}.</ref> reports that Zara<!-- with 'a' -->dusht bin Isfiman (an [[Arabic]] adaptation of \"Zarathustra Spitama\") was an inhabitant of Israel and a servant of one of the disciples of the prophet [[Jeremiah]]. According to this tale, Zaradusht defrauded his master, who cursed him, causing him to become leprous (cf. [[Elisha]]'s servant [[Gehazi]] in Jewish Scripture).\n\nThe apostate Zaradusht then eventually made his way to [[Balkh]] (present day Afghanistan) where he converted Bishtasb (i.e. [[Vishtaspa]]), who in turn compelled his subjects to adopt the religion of the Magians<!--Madjusya-->. Recalling other tradition, al-Tabari (i.681\u2013683<ref name=\"apud_B\u00fcchner_1936_105\"/>) recounts that Zaradusht accompanied a Jewish prophet to Bishtasb/Vishtaspa. Upon their arrival, Zaradusht translated the sage's Hebrew teachings for the king and so convinced him to convert (Tabari also notes that they had previously been [[Sabians|''Sabi''s]]) to the Magian religion.<ref name=\"apud_B\u00fcchner_1936_105\"/>\n\nThe 12th-century [[heresiology|heresiographer]] [[al-Shahrastani]] describes the Majusiya into three sects, the ''Kayumarthiya''<!--(an otherwise undocumented sect that&nbsp;\u2013 per Sharastani&nbsp;\u2013 seems to have had a stronger doctrine of Ahriman's \"non-reality\")-->, the ''[[Zurvanism|Zurwaniya]]'' and the ''Zaradushtiya'', among which Al-Shahrastani asserts that only the last of the three were properly followers of Zoroaster. As regards the recognition of a prophet, Zoroaster has said: \"They ask you as to how should they recognize a prophet and believe him to be true in what he says; tell them what he knows the others do not, and he shall tell you even what lies hidden in your nature; he shall be able to tell you whatever you ask him and he shall perform such things which others cannot perform.\" (Namah Shat Vakhshur Zartust, .5\u20137. 50\u201354) When the companions of Muhammad, on invading Persia, came in contact with the Zoroastrian people and learned these teachings, they at once came to the conclusion that Zoroaster was really a Divinely inspired prophet. Thus they accorded the same treatment to the Zoroastrian people which they did to other \"People of the Book\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThough the name of Zoroaster is not mentioned in the Qur'an, still he was regarded as one of those prophets whose names have not been mentioned in the Qur'an, for there is a verse in the Qur'an: \"And We did send apostles before thee: there are some of them that We have mentioned to thee and there are others whom We have not mentioned to Thee.\" (40 : 78). Accordingly, the Muslims treated the founder of Zoroastrianism as a true prophet and believed in his religion as they did in other inspired creeds, and thus according to the prophecy, protected the Zoroastrian religion. James Darmesteter remarked in the translation of [[Zend Avesta]]: \"When Islam assimilated the Zoroastrians to the People of the Book, it evinced a rare historical sense and solved the problem of the origin of the Avesta.\" (Introduction to Vendidad. p.&nbsp;69.){{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n====Ahmadiyya view====\n[[Ahmadiyya Islam|Ahmadi Muslims]] view Zoroaster as a Prophet of God and describe the expressions of Ahura Mazda, the god of goodness, and Ahraman, the god of evil, as merely referring to the coexistence of forces of good and evil enabling humans to exercise free will.<ref>{{citation|title=The Ahmadiyya Case|publisher=www.aaiil.org|pages=333\u2013|id=GGKEY:19TKD2GN31G}}</ref>[[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], the fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], in his book ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth]]'' views Zoroaster as Prophet of God and describes such the expressions to be a concept which is similar to the concepts in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.<ref name=\"Ahmad1998\">{{citation|author=Tahir Ahmad|title=Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge and Truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbaOQgAACAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Islam International Publications|isbn=978-1-85372-640-8}}</ref>\n\n===In Manichaeism===\n[[Manichaeism]] considered Zoroaster to be a figure (along with the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Jesus]]) in a line of prophets of which [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (216\u2013276) was the culmination.<ref name=\"Widengren_1961_76\">{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|p=76}}.</ref> Zoroaster's ethical dualism is\u2014to an extent\u2014incorporated in Mani's doctrine, which viewed the world as being locked in an epic battle between opposing forces of good and evil.<ref name=\"Widengren_1961_43-45\">{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|pp=43\u201345}}.</ref> Manicheanism also incorporated other elements of Zoroastrian tradition, particularly the names of supernatural beings; however, many of these other Zoroastrian elements are either not part of Zoroaster's own teachings or are used quite differently from how they are used in Zoroastrianism.<ref name=\"Widengren_1961_44-45\">{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|pp=44\u201345}}.</ref><ref name=\"Zaehner_1972_21\">{{harvnb|Zaehner|1972|p=21}}.</ref>\n\n===In the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith===\nZoroaster appears in the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] as a \"[[Manifestation of God]]\", one of a line of prophets who have progressively revealed the Word of God to a gradually maturing humanity.

The cardinal concept of ''a\u0161a''\u2014which is highly nuanced and only vaguely translatable\u2014is at the foundation of all Zoroastrian doctrine, including that of [[Ahura Mazda]] (who is ''a\u0161a''), creation (that is ''a\u0161a''), existence (that is ''a\u0161a''), and as the condition for free will.\n\nThe purpose of humankind, like that of all other creation, is to sustain and align itself to ''a\u0161a''. For humankind, this occurs through active ethical participation in life, ritual, and the exercise of constructive/good thoughts, words and deeds.\n\nElements of Zoroastrian philosophy entered the West through their influence on [[Judaism]] and [[Platonism]] and have been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy.<ref name=\"Blackburn\">{{Citation|title=\"Philosophy\", ''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''|author=Blackburn, Simon|year=1994|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=405}}</ref> Among the classic Greek philosophers, [[Heraclitus]] is often referred to as inspired by Zoroaster's thinking.<ref name=\"August Gladisch\">{{Citation|title=Herakleitos Und Zoroaster: Eine Historische Untersuchung|first=August |last=Gladisch |year=1859|page=IV}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy ranked Zarathustra as first in the chronology of philosophers.<ref>Blackburn, S.

The word ''Mazdayasna'' is [[Avestan]] and is translated as \"Worship of Wisdom/Mazda\" in English.

This personal choice to accept ''asha'' (divine order) and shun ''druj (lies and ignorance)'' is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zoroaster, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy, doing good works, or conducting good rituals) we increase the force of ''[[a\u0161a|asha]]'' in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to [[Frashokereti]]. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make a personal choice to be co-workers, thereby hereby refreshing the world and ourselves.<ref name=\"Dhalla1922\" />\n\n==Iconography==\nAlthough a few recent depictions of Zoroaster show him performing some deed of legend, in general the portrayals merely present him in [[White clothing (religious)|white vestments]] (which are also worn by present-day Zoroastrian priests). He often is seen holding a ''[[barsom|baresman]]'' (Avestan; [[Middle Persian]] ''barsom''), which is generally considered to be another symbol of priesthood, or with a book in hand, which may be interpreted to be the [[Avesta]]. Alternatively, he appears with a mace, the ''varza''\u2014usually stylized as a steel rod crowned by a bull's head\u2014that priests carry in their installation ceremony<!-- the bares*num*-->. In other depictions he appears with a raised hand and thoughtfully lifted finger, as if to make a point.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nZoroaster is rarely depicted as looking directly at the viewer; instead, he appears to be looking slightly upwards, as if beseeching. Zoroaster is almost always depicted with a beard, this along with other factors bearing similarities to 19th-century portraits of [[Jesus]].<ref name=\"Stausberg_2002_I58\">{{harvnb|Stausberg|2002|p=I.58}}</ref>\n\nA common variant of the Zoroaster images derives from a Sassanid-era rock-face carving. In this depiction at [[Taq-e Bostan]], a figure is seen to preside over the coronation of [[Ardashir I]] or [[Ardashir II|II]]. The figure is standing on a lotus, with a ''baresman'' in hand and with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|gloriole]] around his head. Until the 1920s, this figure was commonly thought to be a depiction of Zoroaster, but in recent years is more commonly interpreted to be a depiction of [[Mithra]]. Among the most famous of the European depictions of Zoroaster is that of the figure in [[Raphael]]'s 1509 [[The School of Athens]]. In it, Zoroaster and [[Ptolemy]] are having a discussion in the lower right corner.

Accessed on 31 August 2016.</ref>]]\nLike the Greeks of classical antiquity, [[Islam]]ic tradition understands Zoroaster to be the founding prophet of the Magians (via Aramaic, Arabic ''[[Majus]]'', collective ''Majusya''). The 11th-century Cordoban [[Ibn Hazm]] (Zahiri school) contends that ''Kitabi'' \"of the Book\" cannot apply in light of the Zoroastrian assertion that their books were destroyed by Alexander. Citing the authority of the 8th-century [[Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi|al-Kalbi]], the 9th- and 10th-century Sunni historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] (i.648)<ref name=\"apud_B\u00fcchner_1936_105\">Qtd. in {{harvnb|B\u00fcchner|1936|p=105}}.</ref> reports that Zara<!-- with 'a' -->dusht bin Isfiman (an [[Arabic]] adaptation of \"Zarathustra Spitama\") was an inhabitant of Israel and a servant of one of the disciples of the prophet [[Jeremiah]]. According to this tale, Zaradusht defrauded his master, who cursed him, causing him to become leprous (cf. [[Elisha]]'s servant [[Gehazi]] in Jewish Scripture).\n\nThe apostate Zaradusht then eventually made his way to [[Balkh]] (present day Afghanistan) where he converted Bishtasb (i.e. [[Vishtaspa]]), who in turn compelled his subjects to adopt the religion of the Magians<!--Madjusya-->. Recalling other tradition, al-Tabari (i.681\u2013683<ref name=\"apud_B\u00fcchner_1936_105\"/>) recounts that Zaradusht accompanied a Jewish prophet to Bishtasb/Vishtaspa. Upon their arrival, Zaradusht translated the sage's Hebrew teachings for the king and so convinced him to convert (Tabari also notes that they had previously been [[Sabians|''Sabi''s]]) to the Magian religion.<ref name=\"apud_B\u00fcchner_1936_105\"/>\n\nThe 12th-century [[heresiology|heresiographer]] [[al-Shahrastani]] describes the Majusiya into three sects, the ''Kayumarthiya''<!--(an otherwise undocumented sect that&nbsp;\u2013 per Sharastani&nbsp;\u2013 seems to have had a stronger doctrine of Ahriman's \"non-reality\")-->, the ''[[Zurvanism|Zurwaniya]]'' and the ''Zaradushtiya'', among which Al-Shahrastani asserts that only the last of the three were properly followers of Zoroaster. As regards the recognition of a prophet, Zoroaster has said: \"They ask you as to how should they recognize a prophet and believe him to be true in what he says; tell them what he knows the others do not, and he shall tell you even what lies hidden in your nature; he shall be able to tell you whatever you ask him and he shall perform such things which others cannot perform.\" (Namah Shat Vakhshur Zartust, .5\u20137. 50\u201354) When the companions of Muhammad, on invading Persia, came in contact with the Zoroastrian people and learned these teachings, they at once came to the conclusion that Zoroaster was really a Divinely inspired prophet. Thus they accorded the same treatment to the Zoroastrian people which they did to other \"People of the Book\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThough the name of Zoroaster is not mentioned in the Qur'an, still he was regarded as one of those prophets whose names have not been mentioned in the Qur'an, for there is a verse in the Qur'an: \"And We did send apostles before thee: there are some of them that We have mentioned to thee and there are others whom We have not mentioned to Thee.\" (40 : 78). Accordingly, the Muslims treated the founder of Zoroastrianism as a true prophet and believed in his religion as they did in other inspired creeds, and thus according to the prophecy, protected the Zoroastrian religion. James Darmesteter remarked in the translation of [[Zend Avesta]]: \"When Islam assimilated the Zoroastrians to the People of the Book, it evinced a rare historical sense and solved the problem of the origin of the Avesta.\" (Introduction to Vendidad. p.&nbsp;69.){{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n====Ahmadiyya view====\n[[Ahmadiyya Islam|Ahmadi Muslims]] view Zoroaster as a Prophet of God and describe the expressions of Ahura Mazda, the god of goodness, and Ahraman, the god of evil, as merely referring to the coexistence of forces of good and evil enabling humans to exercise free will.<ref>{{citation|title=The Ahmadiyya Case|publisher=www.aaiil.org|pages=333\u2013|id=GGKEY:19TKD2GN31G}}</ref>[[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], the fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], in his book ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth]]'' views Zoroaster as Prophet of God and describes such the expressions to be a concept which is similar to the concepts in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.<ref name=\"Ahmad1998\">{{citation|author=Tahir Ahmad|title=Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge and Truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbaOQgAACAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Islam International Publications|isbn=978-1-85372-640-8}}</ref>\n\n===In Manichaeism===\n[[Manichaeism]] considered Zoroaster to be a figure (along with the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Jesus]]) in a line of prophets of which [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (216\u2013276) was the culmination.<ref name=\"Widengren_1961_76\">{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|p=76}}.</ref> Zoroaster's ethical dualism is\u2014to an extent\u2014incorporated in Mani's doctrine, which viewed the world as being locked in an epic battle between opposing forces of good and evil.<ref name=\"Widengren_1961_43-45\">{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|pp=43\u201345}}.</ref> Manicheanism also incorporated other elements of Zoroastrian tradition, particularly the names of supernatural beings; however, many of these other Zoroastrian elements are either not part of Zoroaster's own teachings or are used quite differently from how they are used in Zoroastrianism.<ref name=\"Widengren_1961_44-45\">{{harvnb|Widengren|1961|pp=44\u201345}}.</ref><ref name=\"Zaehner_1972_21\">{{harvnb|Zaehner|1972|p=21}}.</ref>\n\n===In the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith===\nZoroaster appears in the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] as a \"[[Manifestation of God]]\", one of a line of prophets who have progressively revealed the Word of God to a gradually maturing humanity.

The cardinal concept of ''a\u0161a''\u2014which is highly nuanced and only vaguely translatable\u2014is at the foundation of all Zoroastrian doctrine, including that of [[Ahura Mazda]] (who is ''a\u0161a''), creation (that is ''a\u0161a''), existence (that is ''a\u0161a''), and as the condition for free will.\n\nThe purpose of humankind, like that of all other creation, is to sustain and align itself to ''a\u0161a''. For humankind, this occurs through active ethical participation in life, ritual, and the exercise of constructive/good thoughts, words and deeds.\n\nElements of Zoroastrian philosophy entered the West through their influence on [[Judaism]] and [[Platonism]] and have been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy.<ref name=\"Blackburn\">{{Citation|title=\"Philosophy\", ''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''|author=Blackburn, Simon|year=1994|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=405}}</ref> Among the classic Greek philosophers, [[Heraclitus]] is often referred to as inspired by Zoroaster's thinking.<ref name=\"August Gladisch\">{{Citation|title=Herakleitos Und Zoroaster: Eine Historische Untersuchung|first=August |last=Gladisch |year=1859|page=IV}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy ranked Zarathustra as first in the chronology of philosophers.<ref>Blackburn, S.

The word ''Mazdayasna'' is [[Avestan]] and is translated as \"Worship of Wisdom/Mazda\" in English. The encyclopedia [[Natural History (Pliny)]] claims that Zoroastrians later educated the Greeks who, starting with [[Pythagoras]], used a similar term, philosophy, or \"love of wisdom\" to describe the search for ultimate truth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20XXX|title=Pliny Natural History Vol 8; Book XXX|last=Jones|first=W.H.S.|date=1963|publisher=Heinemann|access-date=December 28, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20XXX|archivedate=January 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nZoroaster emphasized the freedom of the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept ''asha'' (divine order) and shun ''druj (lies and ignorance)'' is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zoroaster, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy, doing good works, or conducting good rituals) we increase the force of ''[[a\u0161a|asha]]'' in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to [[Frashokereti]].

He often is seen holding a ''[[barsom|baresman]]'' (Avestan; [[Middle Persian]] ''barsom''), which is generally considered to be another symbol of priesthood, or with a book in hand, which may be interpreted to be the [[Avesta]]. Alternatively, he appears with a mace, the ''varza''\u2014usually stylized as a steel rod crowned by a bull's head\u2014that priests carry in their installation ceremony<!-- the bares*num*-->. In other depictions he appears with a raised hand and thoughtfully lifted finger, as if to make a point.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nZoroaster is rarely depicted as looking directly at the viewer; instead, he appears to be looking slightly upwards, as if beseeching. Zoroaster is almost always depicted with a beard, this along with other factors bearing similarities to 19th-century portraits of [[Jesus]].<ref name=\"Stausberg_2002_I58\">{{harvnb|Stausberg|2002|p=I.58}}</ref>\n\nA common variant of the Zoroaster images derives from a Sassanid-era rock-face carving. In this depiction at [[Taq-e Bostan]], a figure is seen to preside over the coronation of [[Ardashir I]] or [[Ardashir II|II]]. The figure is standing on a lotus, with a ''baresman'' in hand and with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|gloriole]] around his head. Until the 1920s, this figure was commonly thought to be a depiction of Zoroaster, but in recent years is more commonly interpreted to be a depiction of [[Mithra]]. Among the most famous of the European depictions of Zoroaster is that of the figure in [[Raphael]]'s 1509 [[The School of Athens]]. In it, Zoroaster and [[Ptolemy]] are having a discussion in the lower right corner. The prophet is holding a star-studded globe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Zoroaster 1.jpg|Zoroastrian devotional art depicting the religion's founder with white clothing and a long beard\nFile:ClavisArtis.MS.Verginelli-Rota.V1.003r.jpg|Depiction of Zoroaster in ''{{ill|Clavis Artis|it}}'', an alchemy manuscript published in Germany in the late 17th or early 18th century and [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudoepigraphically]] attributed to Zoroaster\nFile:An Image from Zarathustra.jpg|An image of Zoroaster on display at the [[Yazd Atash Behram]] (Zoroastrian [[fire temple]]) in [[Yazd]], [[Yazd province]], Iran\nFile:An image of Zoroaster on mirrored etched glass at the Zoroastrian fire temple, Taft, Iran.jpg|An image of Zoroaster on mirrored etched glass at the Zoroastrian fire temple in [[Taft, Yazd|Taft]], Iran\n</gallery>\n\n==Western civilization==\n[[File:Sanzio 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The School of Athens: a gathering of renaissance artists in the guise of philosophers from antiquity, in an idealized classical interior, featuring the scene with Zoroaster holding a planet or cosmos.]]\n\n===In classical antiquity===\n{{See also|Magi}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{primary sources | section|date=March 2017}}\n{{original research|section|date=March 2017}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n}}\nThe Greeks\u2014in the [[Hellenization|Hellenistic sense]] of the term\u2014had an understanding of Zoroaster as expressed by [[Plutarch]], [[Diogenes Laertius]], and [[Agathias]]<ref>See [[Plutarch]]'s ''Isis and Osiris'' 46-7, [[Diogenes Laertius]] 1.6\u20139, and [[Agathias]] 2.23-5.</ref> that saw him, at the core, to be the \"prophet and founder of the religion of the Iranian peoples,\" Beck notes that \"the rest was mostly fantasy\".<ref name=\"Beck_525\">{{harvnb|Beck|1991|p=525}}.</ref> Zoroaster was set in the ancient past, six to seven millennia before the Common Era, and was described as a king of [[Bactria]] or a [[Babylonia]]n (or teacher of Babylonians), and with a biography typical of a [[Neopythagorean]] sage, i.e. having a mission preceded by ascetic withdrawal and enlightenment.<ref name = \"Beck_525\"/> However, at first mentioned in the context of dualism, in [[Moralia]], Plutarch presents Zoroaster as {{anchor|Zaratras}}\"Zaratras,\" not realizing the two to be the same, and he is described as a \"teacher of [[Pythagoras]]\".<ref name=PlutarchMoraliaBrenk/><ref name=\"Tuplin2007\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cwFPDgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA246&dq=Apuleius%20pythagoras%20zoroaster&pg=PA246#v=onepage&q=Apuleius%20pythagoras%20zoroaster&f=false|year=2007|first=Christopher|last=Tuplin|publisher=ISD LLC|title=Persian Responses: Political and Cultural Interaction with(in) the Achaemenid Empire|isbn=9781910589465}}</ref>\n\nZoroaster has also been described as a sorcerer-astrologer{{snd}}the creator of both magic and astrology.
