Directed by [[Jules Bass]], it was written by [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]] and [[Romeo Muller]], based on the stories of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. It features songs by Jules Bass and Maury Laws. The film's opening features the cast in puppet and live form plus caricatures of the cast by [[Al Hirschfeld]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is early in the 19th century. The thirteen-year-old [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (called \"Chris\" for short; portrayed and voiced by [[Paul O'Keefe]]) is known in his native village of [[Odense]], [[Denmark]], as an incurable daydreamer. Actually, the boy's reveries are an escape from the hardships of his family's life.\n \nChris's father, Papa Andersen ([[Jack Gilford]]), who is separated from his wife and living in Copenhagen, is a gentle, humorous, absent-minded, and stern but very poor shoemaker. He cannot even afford the delicious works of the Pieman ([[Ray Bolger]]), and he is forced to suffer the abuses of haughty customers, such as the ill-tempered Mrs. Klopplebobbler ([[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]).\n \nOne night, having heard tales of a legendary Garden of Paradise from his father, Chris runs away, determined to find the fabled Garden. He begins his adventure at the river, where he is joined by the devoted friend of all daydreamers, the Sandman (voiced by [[Cyril Ritchard]]), who promises to help Chris make his wishes come true by spinning some daydreams. Chris falls asleep in the boat and thus begins his first daydream. He goes sailing through a river, and out into the ocean.\n \nSuddenly, a fierce storm throws Chris into the centre of a whirlpool, and he sinks, unconscious, to the Animagic world, beginning through the ocean floor. He is found by the Little Mermaid (voiced by [[Hayley Mills]]), who, against the advice of Father Neptune (voiced by [[Burl Ives]]), exchanges a vow with the Sea Witch (voiced by [[Tallulah Bankhead]]) for a potion with which to revive the boy. The vow demands that if Chris will not remain with her in the underwater world, the Little Mermaid will become an outcast, neither of the earth nor of the sea.\n \nChris is revived, but he decides to continue his search for the Garden of Paradise, leaving the Little Mermaid stranded forever on a rock. As she sadly watches him go, she sings \"Wishes and Teardrops.\"\n \nWhen Chris's father sees the note that his son wrote, he immediately rushes out to search for him.\n \nMeanwhile, Chris sees a baby duckling that is neglected by its family, and adopts it. This will become the basis for his fairy tale \"The Ugly Duckling\".\nNext, Chris meets two crafty Tailors (voiced by [[Terry-Thomas]] and [[Victor Borge]]). They persuade him to serve as their apprentice and join them on a journey to an Emperor who is famous for his luxurious clothing. They find the Emperor (voiced by [[Ed Wynn]]) in his castle, while his suitors are singing the song \"Simply Wonderful,\" a song with which he expresses displeasure with some new royal robes. The fast-talking Tailors have gold lavished on them when they promise the Emperor a fabulous, invisible garment. They proclaim: \"Anyone who can't see it is a fool!\". Naturally, everyone pretends he can see it.\n \nThe next day, the Emperor dons his new \"clothes\" to appear in a Royal Parade, which is led by the Pieman singing \"Who Can Tell.\" When a small child exclaims, \"The Emperor is naked!\", everyone realizes he indeed has been a fool, and Chris and the Tailors are chased out of the city, where he comes separated from the Tailors, and trips over a log, where his second daydream ends.\n \nBack in the human world, Chris is arrested on false charges of poaching by a Game Warden, known in a future fairy tale as \"Big Claus\" (Robert Harter), and is taken to the village jail. He hopes for a turn in his fortunes, singing \"Luck to Sell.\" When he is set to work cutting logs, he begins to dream of escape and discovers tiny Thumbelina (voiced by [[Patty Duke]]) sitting on a tulip petal.\n \nMeanwhile, Chris's father, who has lost his boat after landing on an island, soon sees Chris's boat. He paddles clumsily on the river until he lands up in the river with a long pole. When he reaches the island, he too is immediately arrested by the same Game Warden (Big Claus) on the false charge of fishing in prohibited waters (\"No Fishing\") and is taken prisoner.\n \nChris's new friend gives him a magic seed to shrink him to her size, as she sings \"Happy Guy,\" and they sail off, back again to the Animagic world, in her walnut-shell boat. They lose their way and have a scary encounter with a big bullfrog, who tries to go after the two of them, but finally are given shelter by a sneaky Rat (voiced by [[Boris Karloff]]), who plots to sell Thumbelina as a bride to a miserly Mole (voiced by [[Sessue Hayakawa]]). Before Chris and Thumbelina encounter the mole, they come across an unconscious sparrow that Thumbelina thinks is dead. When they encounter the Mole in order to receive the medicine for the Rat, the Mole joins three Bats in singing \"Isn't It Cozy,\" with a bunch of spiders and insects. After the two of them leave the Mole, they come across the same sparrow, and discover that her heart is beating and she has a chance to live. That evening, Thumbelina states that the sparrow, when she is well, has promised to transport her to a \"Garden of Paradise.\" However, when she states that it's for the \"Little People,\" Chris is turned off, because he does not want to be identified as \"Little\". That evening, while Thumbelina is asleep, Chris breaks out alone and takes the walnut-shell boat upstream. He encounters the same scary bullfrog, which causes the boat to collapse.\n \nChris asks why things went wrong with his journey, and again meets the Sandman, who decides to lead him into the Garden of Paradise on the condition that Chris will not eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. If he does, he will be lost forever in the Valley of Nothingness. Chris romps in the magnificent Garden, but a mischievous boy named Puck teases him into trying the forbidden fruit. The world around him explodes and he is plunged into darkness.\n \nChris, finally back in the human world as before, is awoken by the Game Warden and is scolded for not working. Papa Andersen finds him, and explains to Chris about his arrest. The only way to release the two prisoners is if the father pays for the bail, but the father has no money, and the Warden forewarns them that they will be prisoners for a long time. However, the father remembers the wedding ring that was given to him by Chris's mother, stating that it is just a piece of metal. The Warden accepts the ring, releasing both the father and son from their labor, and the father takes his son home. Once they return home, Chris is being taught basic mathematics (\"Doing the Table\") when the Sandman makes a last appearance to remind the world that Chris \"did finally find his Garden of Paradise. Not in the way he dreamed, but through his wonderful and ever-lasting fairy stories.\"\n\n==Musical numbers==\n#\"Daydreamer\"&nbsp;\u2013 [[Robert Goulet]]\n#\"Overture\"&nbsp;\u2013 [[Maury Laws]]\n#\"Wishes and Teardrops\"&nbsp;\u2013 The Little Mermaid\n#\"Simply Wonderful\"&nbsp;\u2013 The Emperor and His Three Minstrels\n#\"Who Can Tell\"&nbsp;\u2013 The Pieman of Odense\n#\"Luck to Sell\"&nbsp;\u2013 Chris\n#\"Happy Guy\"&nbsp;\u2013 Thumbelina, Chris and Chorus\n#\"Isn't It Cozy?\"&nbsp;\u2013 Three Bats and the Mole\n#\"Finale (The Daydreamer)\"&nbsp;\u2013 Chorus\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Paul O'Keefe]] as \"Chris\" (Hans Christian Andersen)\n*[[Jack Gilford]] as Papa Andersen\n*[[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]] as Mrs. Klopplebobbler\n*[[Sessue Hayakawa]] as The Mole\n*[[Patty Duke]] as Thumbelina\n*[[Boris Karloff]] as The Rat\n*[[Hayley Mills]] as The Little Mermaid\n*[[Burl Ives]] as Father Neptune\n*[[Tallulah Bankhead]] as The Sea Witch\n*[[Victor Borge]] as The Second Tailor\n*[[Ed Wynn]] as The Emperor\n*[[Ray Bolger]] as The Pieman\n*[[Cyril Ritchard]] as The Sandman\n*[[Terry-Thomas]] as The First Tailor\n*Robert Harter as Big Claus the game warden\n\n===Additional voices===\n*[[Billie Mae Richards]]\n*[[Larry D.

Speaking in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 8 March, the [[Minister of War]], [[John Profumo]], stated that there was not going to be a further extensive reorganisation of army units. However, talking of the need to increase flexibility in the services, he noted that the [[regimental system]] of the infantry could be said to \"stand in the way of change\". He stated that the transition from the regimental to the [[brigade system]] \"had on the whole been going well\" and it was now time to see if there were \"tangible advantages from the point of view of recruiting and flexibility\" to be gained from a \"large regiment system\".<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref>\n\nOn 16 March ''[[The Times]]'' reported that the [[War Office]] were in the early stages of planning for the creation of large regiments. The plan involved the conversion of the existing brigades into regiments, with each of the regiments forming a numbered battalion of the large regiment. The creation of the multi-battalion regiments would allow the infantry to be expanded or reduced as needed. This could be done by the increase or decrease in the number of battalions of each regiment, rather than by the emotive process of merging or disbanding historic single-battalion regiments. The report noted that this process had effectively already begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, where regiments had been redesignated or amalgamated as the [[1st East Anglian Regiment|1st]], [[2nd East Anglian Regiment|2nd]] and [[3rd East Anglian Regiment]]s and [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry|1st]], [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|2nd]] and [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|3rd Green Jackets]].<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref>\n\n==The first large regiments==\n[[File:Royal Anglian Regiment cap badge.gif|thumb|The Royal Anglian Regiment was the first 'large' regiment to be created, through the amalgamation of the four regiments of the East Anglian Brigade]]\nIn 1963, the first preparations for the introduction of large regiments began with the disbanding of the Forester Brigade. The [[Royal Lincolnshire Regiment]] had transferred to the East Anglian Brigade and amalgamated with the [[Northamptonshire Regiment]] in 1958. Five years later, the three remaining battalions were also moved, with the Royal Warwickshire Regiment moving to the Fusilier Brigade (and being renamed as the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers); the Royal Leicestershire Regiment to the East Anglian Brigade; and the Sherwood Foresters to the Mercian Brigade.\n\nIn February 1964, approval for the creation of the first large regiment was given. The [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] was to be formed from the four regular battalions of the East Anglian Brigade.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref> The regiment was formed on 1 September. In May 1965 it was announced that the regiments of the Green Jackets Brigade were to become the three-battalion [[Royal Green Jackets]] from 1 January 1966.<ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref>\n\nIn September 1965, figures showed that the new large regiments were recruiting more successfully than the remaining single-battalion regiments, some of which were only at rifle [[Company (military unit)|company]] strength. In particular the [[Welsh Brigade|Welsh]], [[North Irish Brigade|North Irish]] and [[Lancastrian Brigade]]s were under strength. It was thought that the [[Yorkshire Brigade]] and [[Home Counties Brigade]] were likely to form large regiments in the near future, while plans to merge the battalions of the [[Highland Brigade (Scottish)|Highland Brigade]] were only being delayed by failure to agree on a common [[tartan]] to be worn. While the [[Army Board]] could not compel regiments to amalgamate, it was their stated ''\"wish and intention\"'' that they should. The survival of the weaker brigades was under doubt, while a feasibility study into the formation of a single \"Corps of Infantry\" was initiated.<ref>Infantry may be reshaped, ''The Times'', 30 September 1965</ref>\n\nIn June 1966, it was announced that the regiments of the Home Counties Brigade had agreed to form the third large regiment.<ref>New Home Counties large regiment, ''The Times'', 1 July 1966</ref> Accordingly, on 31 December, the four regiments became The [[Queen's Regiment]].\n\nBy July 1967, three more Brigades had opted to become large regiments. All three mergers occurred in 1968: the [[Fusilier Brigade]] became the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] on 23 April, the North Irish Brigade became the [[Royal Irish Rangers]] on 1 July and the [[Light Infantry Brigade]] became [[The Light Infantry]] on 10 July.\n\nThe Defence White Paper of 1967 reduced the number of infantry battalions, with the large regiments all losing one battalion in 1968. The six brigades that had chosen not to form large regiments were also to lose a battalion: the decision to amalgamate a pair of regiments or to disband the junior regiment being left to the council of colonels of the brigade.<ref>Defence White Paper: sweeping changes in Britain's forces, ''The Times'', 19 July 1967</ref>{{efn|name=amalgamate1|group=note|In the end, three new single battalion regiments were created out of this process - the [[South Wales Borderers]] and the [[Welch Regiment]] united to form the [[Royal Regiment of Wales]] in 1969, while the [[Lancashire Regiment]] and the [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]] amalgamated into the [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]], and the [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and the [[Sherwood Foresters]] were united as the [[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment]], both in 1970. A further amalgamation was planned between the [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]].

The lack of stability for the families of soldiers due to constant moving of locations was also cited as a disadvantage. In the future, battalions would retain the same role and largely the same location.

Speaking in the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 8 March, the [[Minister of War]], [[John Profumo]], stated that there was not going to be a further extensive reorganisation of army units. However, talking of the need to increase flexibility in the services, he noted that the [[regimental system]] of the infantry could be said to \"stand in the way of change\". He stated that the transition from the regimental to the [[brigade system]] \"had on the whole been going well\" and it was now time to see if there were \"tangible advantages from the point of view of recruiting and flexibility\" to be gained from a \"large regiment system\".<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref>\n\nOn 16 March ''[[The Times]]'' reported that the [[War Office]] were in the early stages of planning for the creation of large regiments. The plan involved the conversion of the existing brigades into regiments, with each of the regiments forming a numbered battalion of the large regiment. The creation of the multi-battalion regiments would allow the infantry to be expanded or reduced as needed. This could be done by the increase or decrease in the number of battalions of each regiment, rather than by the emotive process of merging or disbanding historic single-battalion regiments. The report noted that this process had effectively already begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, where regiments had been redesignated or amalgamated as the [[1st East Anglian Regiment|1st]], [[2nd East Anglian Regiment|2nd]] and [[3rd East Anglian Regiment]]s and [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry|1st]], [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|2nd]] and [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)|3rd Green Jackets]].<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref>\n\n==The first large regiments==\n[[File:Royal Anglian Regiment cap badge.gif|thumb|The Royal Anglian Regiment was the first 'large' regiment to be created, through the amalgamation of the four regiments of the East Anglian Brigade]]\nIn 1963, the first preparations for the introduction of large regiments began with the disbanding of the Forester Brigade. The [[Royal Lincolnshire Regiment]] had transferred to the East Anglian Brigade and amalgamated with the [[Northamptonshire Regiment]] in 1958. Five years later, the three remaining battalions were also moved, with the Royal Warwickshire Regiment moving to the Fusilier Brigade (and being renamed as the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers); the Royal Leicestershire Regiment to the East Anglian Brigade; and the Sherwood Foresters to the Mercian Brigade.\n\nIn February 1964, approval for the creation of the first large regiment was given. The [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] was to be formed from the four regular battalions of the East Anglian Brigade.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref> The regiment was formed on 1 September. In May 1965 it was announced that the regiments of the Green Jackets Brigade were to become the three-battalion [[Royal Green Jackets]] from 1 January 1966.<ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref>\n\nIn September 1965, figures showed that the new large regiments were recruiting more successfully than the remaining single-battalion regiments, some of which were only at rifle [[Company (military unit)|company]] strength. In particular the [[Welsh Brigade|Welsh]], [[North Irish Brigade|North Irish]] and [[Lancastrian Brigade]]s were under strength. It was thought that the [[Yorkshire Brigade]] and [[Home Counties Brigade]] were likely to form large regiments in the near future, while plans to merge the battalions of the [[Highland Brigade (Scottish)|Highland Brigade]] were only being delayed by failure to agree on a common [[tartan]] to be worn. While the [[Army Board]] could not compel regiments to amalgamate, it was their stated ''\"wish and intention\"'' that they should. The survival of the weaker brigades was under doubt, while a feasibility study into the formation of a single \"Corps of Infantry\" was initiated.<ref>Infantry may be reshaped, ''The Times'', 30 September 1965</ref>\n\nIn June 1966, it was announced that the regiments of the Home Counties Brigade had agreed to form the third large regiment.<ref>New Home Counties large regiment, ''The Times'', 1 July 1966</ref> Accordingly, on 31 December, the four regiments became The [[Queen's Regiment]].\n\nBy July 1967, three more Brigades had opted to become large regiments. All three mergers occurred in 1968: the [[Fusilier Brigade]] became the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] on 23 April, the North Irish Brigade became the [[Royal Irish Rangers]] on 1 July and the [[Light Infantry Brigade]] became [[The Light Infantry]] on 10 July.\n\nThe Defence White Paper of 1967 reduced the number of infantry battalions, with the large regiments all losing one battalion in 1968. The six brigades that had chosen not to form large regiments were also to lose a battalion: the decision to amalgamate a pair of regiments or to disband the junior regiment being left to the council of colonels of the brigade.<ref>Defence White Paper: sweeping changes in Britain's forces, ''The Times'', 19 July 1967</ref>{{efn|name=amalgamate1|group=note|In the end, three new single battalion regiments were created out of this process - the [[South Wales Borderers]] and the [[Welch Regiment]] united to form the [[Royal Regiment of Wales]] in 1969, while the [[Lancashire Regiment]] and the [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]] amalgamated into the [[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]], and the [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and the [[Sherwood Foresters]] were united as the [[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment]], both in 1970.

The Royal Irish Rangers was allocated, along with the single battalion regiments from the North of England, to the [[King's Division]].

This goes for everyone of us \u2013 but particularly for youths and adults who fall in love with someone of the same sex.}}\n\n[[File:Gay Kids.jpg|thumb|The display outside the [[Museum of Cultural History, Oslo|Museum of Cultural History]], May 2009.]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gaykids.no/ Official webpage]\n\n[[Category:2008 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Norwegian books]]\n[[Category:Non-fiction books about same-sex sexuality]]\n[[Category:Children's books with LGBT themes]]\n[[Category:LGBT young adult literature]]\n[[Category:LGBT literature in Norway]]\n[[Category:LGBT youth]]\n[[Category:Norwegian children's literature]]\n[[Category:Children's non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:2008 children's books]]\n[[Category:2000s LGBT literature]]\n", "name_user": "24.129.255.182", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Kids"}

She grew up especially close to her younger brother, Bartley Crum Jr. Their father was active in politics as a confidant to [[Wendell Willkie]] during the [[1940 U.S. presidential election]] campaign, and served on the 1945 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] that advised President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] to support the creation of a [[Jewish state]]. The elder Crum gained notoriety for being one of the six lawyers who defended the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] during the [[Red Scare]] at the start of the [[Cold War]] in 1947. His career suffered during the fallout from the Blacklist, and the family moved from California to New York in late 1948.<ref name=Anything/>\n\nIn California, Bosworth had been educated at [[Miss Burke's School]] and the [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York City)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]]. At age 13, intending to become an actress, she adopted her mother's maiden name as her surname. When the family relocated to New York, Bosworth first attended the [[Chapin School]] and then the [[Ecole Internationale de Gen\u00e8ve|Ecole International]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Bosworth studied at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], graduating in 1955 with a major in dance and writing.\n\n==Career==\n===Acting===\nWhile still a student at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth began modeling for the [[John Robert Powers Agency]]. She was hired by [[Diane Arbus|Diane]] and [[Allan Arbus]] to pose for a magazine ad for the [[Greyhound bus]] company. Allan drove everyone, including his and Diane's assistant Tad Yamashiro (who later became an exhibited photographer himself), from [[Manhattan]] to the Ardsley Acres section of [[Ardsley, New York]] for the photo shoot.\n\nShortly after her college graduation, Bosworth became a member of the [[Actors Studio]] in Manhattan, where she studied under master teacher [[Lee Strasberg]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Garfield|first=David|year=1980|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|page=277|isbn=978-0025426504}}.</ref> [[Arthur Penn]] cast her as the lead in her first professional play, a pre-Broadway tryout of [[James Leo Herlihy]]\u2019s ''Blue Denim'', about the consequences of teenage pregnancy and abortion. Bosworth appeared in several Broadway shows during the 1950s and 1960s, including ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', ''[[Small War on Murray Hill]]'' (directed by [[Garson Kanin]]), and [[Jean Kerr]]'s ''[[Mary Mary|Mary, Mary]]'' (where she understudied from 1961-1965 before being cast as the lead for the end of the play's run). She played [[Elaine Stritch]]'s sister in the drama ''The Sin of Pat Muldoon'' and a motormouthed teen based on the young [[Nora Ephron]] in [[Phoebe Ephron]]'s comedy ''Howie''. During this period Bosworth also toured in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', playing Laura to [[Helen Hayes]]'s Amanda, and ''Remains to be Seen'' opposite Tommy Sands. She worked regularly on popular television series including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[Young Doctor Malone|Young Dr. Malone]]'', and ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]''. Bosworth can also be seen in the film ''[[Four Boys and a Gun]]'' as [[James Franciscus]]'s wife, and as a disgruntled redhead in the audience of [[Bert Stern]]\u2019s 1960 cult documentary ''[[Jazz on a Summer's Day]]'', about the 1958 [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nAs an actress, Bosworth is perhaps best known for playing Sister Simone, the young friend of [[Audrey Hepburn|Audrey Hepburn's]] character Sister Luke, in ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'' (1959).  Directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]], the film was a major box office success and nominated for multiple Academy Awards.

Shortly after, she boarded a plane to [[Rome]] to meet Fred Zinnemann, where she began to hemorrhage. In Rome, she was sent to a hospital convent where she was to learn about being a nun.

She gained notice as a writer with several Broadway-focused features and interviews published in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] and the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]''. Later in the decade, she became editor of ''[[Screen Stars]]'' magazine and worked at Magazine Management Company alongside [[Mario Puzo]], who was then beginning drafts of his novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. From 1969 to 1972 Bosworth was senior editor of ''[[McCall's]]''; she served as managing editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' from 1972 to 1974. ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' founder [[Bob Guccione]] hired Bosworth as executive editor of the erotic women's magazine ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'' from 1974 to 1976.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The X-Rated Emperor|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/02/guccione200502|issn=0733-8899|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|location=United States|date=November 10, 2009|| publication-date=February 2005|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, Bosworth reviewed numerous books for the ''The New York Times'', wrote freelance art pieces for the ''Times'', ''[[Time Life]]'', and other national magazines, and contributed a monthly column on arts and entertainment to ''[[Working Woman (magazine)|Working Woman]]'' magazine.\n\nBosworth was an editor at ''[[Mirabella]]'' from 1993 to 1995. She was first hired as a contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1984, under [[Tina Brown]]\u2019s editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under [[Graydon Carter]]\u2019s leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of [[Elia Kazan]] and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', won Bosworth the [[Front Page Award]] from the Newswomen's Club of New York.\n\n===Author===\nBosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on [[Montgomery Clift]] (1978), [[Diane Arbus]] (1984), [[Marlon Brando]] (2000) and [[Jane Fonda]] (2011). Her book, ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography'' explores how the actor's introverted approach to his craft influenced [[James Dean]] and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift's lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift's family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift's close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth's biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus's 1971 suicide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|title=Diane Arbus: A Biography|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0394504049}}</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have... more than enough material for several art legends... Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography... as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=Anything/> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nDuring Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would continue to inform Bosworth's work throughout her life.\n\nDuring her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright [[Mel Arrighi]] in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from [[emphysema]] on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer [[Tom Palumbo]], whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the [[Actors Studio]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], including a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'' starring [[Laura Linney]] as Nina and [[Tammy Grimes]] as Arkadina. They married in 2000. Palumbo died due to complications from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center.\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to [[pneumonia]] and complications from  [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], at the age of 86.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html|title=Patricia Bosworth, Actress-Turned-Author, Dies at 86|first=Elsa|last=Dixler|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.

She was first hired as a contributing editor at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1984, under [[Tina Brown]]\u2019s editorship of the magazine, and served in that capacity until 1991. She continued to freelance for the magazine until 1997, when she rejoined as contributing editor under [[Graydon Carter]]\u2019s leadership, a position she held to the end of her life. Her profile of [[Elia Kazan]] and his reflections on the Hollywood Blacklist, published in a spring 1999 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', won Bosworth the [[Front Page Award]] from the Newswomen's Club of New York.\n\n===Author===\nBosworth was the author of bestselling biographies on [[Montgomery Clift]] (1978), [[Diane Arbus]] (1984), [[Marlon Brando]] (2000) and [[Jane Fonda]] (2011). Her book, ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography'' explores how the actor's introverted approach to his craft influenced [[James Dean]] and many others. Bosworth, whose father had been Clift's lawyer in the late 1940s, had total access to Clift's family while doing research for the project. She also spoke to many of Clift's close friends and colleagues.\n\nBosworth's biography of [[Diane Arbus|Arbus]], a photographer known for her poetic approach to eccentric and abnormal subjects, was a nuanced appraisal of the artist that also investigated the lurid details of her life, culminating in Arbus's 1971 suicide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|title=Diane Arbus: A Biography|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|year=1984|isbn=978-0394504049}}</ref> The book was critically acclaimed. [[Andrew Holleran]] of ''New York'' magazine said it was \"a biography that seems to have... more than enough material for several art legends... Patricia Bosworth has created a spellbinding portrait.\" ''[[Washington Post Book World]]'' reviewed it as \"fascinating\" and \"a compelling biography... as valuable in its insights into the cultural history of the 50s and 60s as its understanding of the special place Arbus occupies in it.\" However, the book also proved to be extremely controversial, and did not receive formal approval from the Arbus estate. Bosworth's work is still widely considered to be the definitive biography of Arbus; it was the inspiration for [[Steven Shainberg]]\u2019s 2006 film ''Fur'', which starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as Diane Arbus and [[Ty Burrell]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as her husband and lover respectively.\n\nAccording to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Bosworth's biography on [[Marlon Brando]] \"offers a vivid reminder of the personal and professional highlights of Brando's life ...  [It is] an informative biography of Brando that, because of the limited format of the Penguin Lives series, hints at but cannot do justice to the great unruliness of Brando's career and life. She provides a fine, detailed sketch of his [[New York City|New York]] days when he took acting classes with [[Harry Belafonte]], Elaine Stritch, [[Gene Saks]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Kim Stanley]], and presents a great portrait of the craziness on the set of ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (co-star [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]] announced that they got along 'because we're both [[bisexual]]')\", but in only 228 pages, the author \"can't approach the complexity of her earlier work.\"\n\nBosworth spent ten years completing a biography of [[Jane Fonda]], with whom she had attended sessions at the Actors Studio in the 1950s and 60s. Fonda granted Bosworth total access; they met frequently throughout the research process for the book. Bosworth's biography, ''Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman'', was on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list in 2011 and was named one of [[Kirkus Reviews]]\u2019 Best Six Books of the Year.\n\nIn addition to her biographies, Bosworth was the author of two memoirs. The first, ''Anything Your Little Heart Desires: An American Family Story'', was published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1997. It tells the story of Bosworth's father, Bartley Crum, and how his decision to defend the Hollywood Ten at the height of McCarthyism destroyed his career, ultimately leading to his suicide.<ref name=Anything/> ''Anything'' was featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and was named a Notable Book of the Year in 1997. Following publication of this memoir, Bosworth became an active spokeswoman for suicide survivors and [[suicide prevention]]. She received the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]]\u2019s Lifesavers Award in 1998.\n\nHer book ''The Men in My Life: A Memoir of Love and Art in 1950s Manhattan'' was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2017. It examines Bosworth's career as an actress, her early transition into journalism, and her first and second marriages, as well as how she survived the suicides of both her brother and father.\n\nIn 2018, Bosworth released ''Dreamer With a Thousand Thrills: The Rediscovered Photographs of Tom Palumbo'', published by [[powerHouse Books]]. The book features Palumbo's fashion photographs and celebrity portraits from the 1950s and 60s, as well as several works that were never published during his lifetime.\n\nBosworth was working on her latest project, ''Protest Song'', at the time of her death. ''Protest Song'' ([[Farrar, Straus, & Giroux]]) is about [[Paul Robeson]]'s work to create federal anti-lynching legislation, which her father collaborated on, and [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s subsequent successful campaign to blacklist Robeson. Similar anti-lynching legislation to that proposed by Robeson and Crum was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2020.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nDuring Bosworth's sophomore year at Sarah Lawrence, her beloved brother Bart Jr. committed suicide at [[Reed College]] in Portland, Oregon. This event, and their father's suicide six years later in 1959, would continue to inform Bosworth's work throughout her life.\n\nDuring her first year at Sarah Lawrence, Bosworth eloped with an art student. The marriage turned abusive and was annulled after sixteen months. Bosworth married novelist and playwright [[Mel Arrighi]] in 1966; the two collaborated on several projects outside of their individual work. Arrighi died due to cardiac arrest and complications from [[emphysema]] on September 17, 1986. In the late 1980s, Bosworth was reintroduced to photographer [[Tom Palumbo]], whom she had met decades earlier when Palumbo had been on staff at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. Palumbo was then seguing from photography into directing theatre. He and Bosworth worked on a number of plays together for the [[Actors Studio]] and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], including a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'' starring [[Laura Linney]] as Nina and [[Tammy Grimes]] as Arkadina. They married in 2000. Palumbo died due to complications from [[Lewy Body Dementia]] on October 13, 2008. After Palumbo's death, Bosworth joined the board of the Lewy Body Dementia Resource Center.\n\nBosworth died on April 2, 2020, at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai West hospital]] in New York City, due to [[pneumonia]] and complications from  [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], at the age of 86.<ref name=\"Bosworth\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/books/patricia-bosworth-dead-virus.html|title=Patricia Bosworth, Actress-Turned-Author, Dies at 86|first=Elsa|last=Dixler|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n* ''Montgomery Clift: A Biography''.

Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the [[Napoleonic Wars#War between Britain and France, 1803\u20131814|Napoleonic Wars]], while historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right.\n\nFrom the outbreak of war with [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]], Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France, which the US contested as illegal under international law. To man the blockade, Britain [[impressment|pressed]] American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy. American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake\u2013Leopard'' affair]], which happened five years before the war. The British were in turn outraged by the [[Little Belt affair|''Little Belt'' affair]] in 1811, in which 11 British sailors died.{{sfn|Hooks|2012}}{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=22}} Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier, hindering American expansion and provoking resentment.{{sfn|Stagg|1983|p=4}} Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of [[British North America]] (Canada) contributed to the American decision to go to war. However, the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British. On June 18, 1812, President [[James Madison]] signed into law the American declaration of war, after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress.{{sfn|Woodworth|1812}}\n\nWith most of its army in Europe fighting [[Napoleon]], Britain adopted a defensive strategy, with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier along with help from Native American allies. American prosecution of the war effort suffered from [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|its unpopularity]], especially in New England, where it was referred to as \"Mr. Madison's War\". American defeats at the [[Siege of Detroit]] and the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] thwarted attempts to seize [[Upper Canada]], improving British morale. American attempts also failed to invade [[Lower Canada]] and capture [[Montreal]]. In 1813, the Americans won the [[Battle of Lake Erie]], gaining control of the lake, and they defeated [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]] at the [[Battle of the Thames]], defeating the largest Native ally of Britain and securing a primary war goal. The Americans made a final attempt to invade Canada but fought to a draw at the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]] during the summer of 1814. At sea, the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports, cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will. In 1814, one of these raids [[Burning of Washington|burned the capital]], but the Americans later repulsed British attempts to [[Battle of Plattsburgh|invade New York]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Maryland]], ending invasions from Canada into the northern and mid-Atlantic states. In early 1815, the Americans [[Battle of New Orleans|decisively defeated]] the invading British Army attacking New Orleans, Louisiana. Fighting also took place in [[Spanish Florida]]; a [[Battle of Pensacola (1814)|two-day battle]] for the city of Pensacola ended in Spanish surrender.{{sfn|Heidler|p=45}}\n\nIn Britain, there was mounting opposition to wartime taxation, and merchants demanded to reopen trade with America. With the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|abdication of Napoleon]], Britain's war with France ended and Britain ceased impressment of American sailors. This made the original cause of the war irrelevant. The British were then able to increase the strength of the blockade on the United States coast, smothering American maritime trade, but their attempts failed to invade America, at which point both sides began to desire peace.{{sfn|Fowler|2017|pages=23\u201324}}\n\nPeace negotiations began in August 1814, and the [[Treaty of Ghent]] was signed on December 24, 1814. News of the peace did not reach America for some time. In February 1815, news reached the East Coast concerning the great victory at New Orleans\u2014at the same time as news of the Christmas peace treaty. The Americans triumphantly celebrated the restoration of their national honour, leading to the collapse of anti-war sentiment and the beginning of the [[Era of Good Feelings]], a period of national unity. The treaty was unanimously ratified by the US Senate on February 17, 1815, ending the war with no boundary changes.{{sfn|order of the Senate of the United States|1828|pages=619\u2013620}}\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|Origins of the War of 1812}}\nHistorians have long debated the relative weight of the multiple reasons underlying the origin of the War of 1812. This section summarizes several contributing factors which resulted in the declaration of war by the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Trautsch|1y=2013|1pp=273\u2013293|2a1=Egan|2y=1974|3a1=Goodman|3y=1941|3pp=171\u2013186}}{{sfn| Silverstone |2004|page=95}}\n\n===Honour and the second war of independence===\nAs Risjord (1961) notes, a powerful motivation for the Americans was the desire to uphold national honour in the face of what they considered to be British insults, such as the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair]].{{sfn|Risjord|1961|pp=196\u2013210}} [[H. W. Brands]] writes: \"The other war hawks spoke of the struggle with Britain as a second war of independence; [Andrew] Jackson, who still bore scars from the first war of independence, held that view with special conviction. The approaching conflict was about violations of American rights, but it was also about vindication of American identity.\"{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=163}} Americans at the time and historians since{{sfn|Swanson |1945}} have often called it the United States' \"Second War of Independence\".{{sfn|Hickey|2013}}\n\nThe British, at the same time, were offended by what they considered insults, such as the [[Little Belt affair|\"Little Belt\" affair]]. This gave them a particular interest in capturing the United States flagship ''President'', which they succeeded in doing in 1815.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}\n\n===Impressment and naval actions===\nIn 1807, Britain introduced a series of trade restrictions via the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders in Council]] to impede neutral trade with France, whom Britain was fighting in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The United States contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.{{sfn|Fanis|2011|p=94}} Historian Reginald Horsman states that \"a large section of influential British opinion, both in the government and in the country, thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy.\"{{sfn|Horsman|1962|p=264}} The American merchant marine had nearly doubled between 1802 and 1810, making it by far the largest neutral fleet. Britain was the largest trading partner, receiving 80 percent of American cotton and 50 percent of other American exports, and the British public and press were resentful of the growing mercantile and commercial competition.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=281}} The United States' view was that Britain's restrictions violated its right to trade with others.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy expanded to 176 [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] and 600 ships overall, requiring 140,000 sailors to man them.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=382}} The Royal Navy could man its ships with volunteers in peacetime, but it competed in wartime with merchant shipping and privateers for a small pool of experienced sailors, so it  turned to [[impressment]] from ashore and from foreign and domestic shipping when it could not operate its ships with volunteers alone.\n\nThe United States believed that British deserters had a right to become American citizens, but Britain did not recognize a right whereby a British subject could relinquish his citizenship and become a citizen of another country. The British Navy, therefore, considered any American citizen liable for impressment if he was born British. Aggravating the situation was the United States' reluctance to issue formal naturalization papers, and the widespread use of unofficial or forged identity or [[protection papers]] among sailors.{{sfn|Rodger|2005|pages=565\u2013566}} This made it difficult for the Royal Navy to distinguish Americans from non-Americans and led it to impress some Americans who had never been British. Some gained freedom on appeal.{{sfn|Latimer|2007|p=17}} The Admiralty estimated that there were 11,000 naturalized sailors on United States ships in 1805, and US Secretary of the Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]] stated that 9,000 US sailors had been born in Great Britain or Ireland.{{sfn|Caffrey|1977|p=60}} Captain [[Isaac Chauncey]] found in 1808 that 58-percent of sailors based in New York City were either naturalized citizens or recent immigrants. Of these 150 naturalized sailors, 80 were from Ireland and 54 from other parts of the United Kingdom.\n[[File:Story of one hundred years - A comprehensive review of the political and military events, the social, intellectual and material progress, and the general state of mankind in all lands.

The [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake''\u2013''Leopard'' affair]] and other acts of impressment angered the American public.]]\nAmerican anger grew when British frigates were stationed just outside US harbours and in view of US shores to search ships and impress men while within US territorial waters.{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=278\u2013279}} Well-publicized impressment actions outraged the American public, such as the [[Leander affair|''Leander'' affair]] and the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake''\u2013''Leopard'' affair]].{{sfn|Black|2002|p=44}}{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=104}}\n\nThe British public were outraged in their turn by the ''Little Belt'' affair, in which a large American ship clashed with a small British sloop, resulting in the deaths of 11 British sailors. Both sides claimed that the other fired first, but the British public in particular blamed the US for attacking a smaller vessel, with calls in some newspapers for revenge,{{sfn|Hooks|2012}}{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=22}} while the US was encouraged by the fact that they had won a victory over the Royal Navy.{{sfn|Hooks|2009|p=ii}} The US Navy also forcibly recruited British sailors, but the British government saw impressment as commonly accepted practice and preferred to rescue British sailors from American impressment on a case-by-case basis.{{sfn| Deeben|2012}}\n\n===British support of Indian raids===\n{{Warof1812-Origins}}\nThe [[Northwest Territory]] consisted of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and was the battleground for conflict between the United States and various Indian tribes.{{sfn|White|2010|p=416}} The British Empire had ceded the area to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, both sides ignoring the fact that the land was partly inhabited by various tribes, including the [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Winnebago people|Winnebago]], [[Shawnee]], [[Fox people|Fox]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Lenape|Delaware]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]. Some warriors had left their tribes to follow [[Tenskwatawa]], the Shawnee prophet and the brother of [[Tecumseh]]. Tenskwatawa had a vision of purifying his society by expelling the \"children of the Evil Spirit\", by which he meant the American settlers.{{sfn|Willig|2008|p=207}} The Indians wanted to create their own state in the Northwest to end the American threat forever, as it became clear that the Americans wanted all of the land in the Old Northwest for national growth.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}} Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh formed a confederation of numerous tribes to block American expansion. The British saw the Indian tribes as valuable allies and a buffer to their Canadian colonies, so they began to provide arms and ammunition to the Indians; the subsequent Indian attacks on American settlers in the Northwest further aggravated tensions between Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Hitsman|1965|p=27}} Raiding grew more common in 1810 and 1811; westerners in Congress found the raids intolerable and wanted them permanently ended.{{sfnm|1a1=Heidler|1a2=Heidler|1y=1997|1pp=253, 504|2a1=Zuehlke|2y=2007|2p=62}} British policy was divided towards the Indians. On the one hand, the British wanted to encourage Indian raids in order to keep the Americans fighting in the Northwest; they also wanted to preserve a region which provided rich profits for Canadian fur traders. On the other hand, they feared that too much support for the Indians would cause a war with the United States.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}} Tecumseh's plans for an Indian state in the Northwest would benefit British North America by making it more defensible, but the defeats suffered by Tecumseh's confederation made the British leery of going too far to support what was probably a losing cause. British diplomats attempted to defuse tensions on the frontier in the months preceding the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}}\n[[File:\"A Scene on the Frontiers as Practiced by the Humane British and Their Worthy Allies!\".jpg|thumb|Americans believed that British officers paid their Indian allies to scalp American soldiers, c. 1812]]\nThe confederation's raids hindered American expansion into rich farmlands in the Northwest Territory.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=253, 392}} Pratt writes:\n\n{{quote|There is ample proof that the British authorities did all in their power to hold or win the allegiance of the Indians of the Northwest with the expectation of using them as allies in the event of war. Indian allegiance could be held only by gifts, and to an Indian no gift was as acceptable as a lethal weapon. Guns and ammunition, tomahawks and scalping knives were dealt out with some liberality by British agents.{{sfn|Pratt|1955|p=126}}}}\n\nHowever, the frontiersmen, according to the U.S. Army Center of Military History, had no doubt that their troubles with the Indians \"were the result of British intrigue\", and many settlers began circulating stories of British Army muskets and equipment being found on the field after Indian raids. Thus, \"the westerners were convinced that their problems could best be solved by forcing the British out of Canada\". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH/AMH-06.htm|title=American Military History, Army Historical Series, Chapter 6 |publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe British had the longstanding goal of creating a large Indian state to cover much of Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. They made the demand as late as the fall of 1814 at the peace conference, but they lost control of western Ontario in 1813 at key battles on and around Lake Erie. These battles destroyed the [[Tecumseh's Confederacy|Indian confederacy]] which had been the main ally of the British in that region, weakening its negotiating position. Much of the area remained under British or British-allied Indian control until the end of the war, but the British dropped the demands.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1989|1pp=46\u201363, esp. |pp= 61\u201363|2a1=Carroll|2y=2001|2p=23}}\n\n===American expansionism===\n[[File:KENSETT MAP CANADA 1812.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map of the Canadas from 1812.

The Loyalists were hostile to union with the United States, while the immigrant settlers were generally uninterested in politics and remained neutral or supported the British during the war. The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army. Americans believed that many men in Upper Canada would rise up and greet an American army as liberators. One reason that American forces retreated after one successful battle inside Canada was that they could not obtain supplies from the locals.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=206}} But the Americans thought that the possibility of local support suggested an easy conquest, as [[Thomas Jefferson]] believed: \"The acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent.\"{{sfn|Hickey|2012|p=68}}\n[[File:Reproduction-of-the-1805-Rembrandt-Peale-painting-of-Thomas-Jefferson-New-York-Historical-Society 1.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Jefferson]], the third President of the United States (1801\u20131809), believed that the acquisition of the Canadas was a \"mere matter of marching\".]]\n\nSome American border businessmen supported annexation because they wanted to gain control of Great Lakes trade.{{sfn|Nugent|2008|p=75}} Carl Benn notes that the War Hawks' desire to annex the Canadas was similar to the enthusiasm for the annexation of [[Spanish Florida]] by inhabitants of the American South; both expected war to facilitate expansion into long-desired lands and end support for hostile Indian tribes (Tecumseh's Confederacy in the North and the [[Creek people|Creek]] in the South).{{sfn |Benn |Marston |2006}} Tennessee Congressman [[Felix Grundy]] considered it essential to acquire Canada to ''preserve'' domestic political balance, arguing that annexing Canada would maintain the free state-slave state balance, which might otherwise be thrown off by the acquisition of Florida and the settlement of the southern areas of the new [[Louisiana Purchase]].{{sfn| Heller|2010|page=98}}\n\nHowever, historian Richard Maass argues that the expansionist theme is a myth which goes against the \"relative consensus among experts that the primary U.S. objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions\". He argues that consensus among scholars is that the United States went to war \"because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table, and threatening the Royal Navy's Canadian supply base was their last hope.\" Maass agrees that expansionism might have tempted Americans on a theoretical level, but he finds that \"leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so\", particularly because such expansion \"focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements\" of Canada. But Maass notes that many historians continue to believe that expansionism was a cause.{{sfn|Maass|2014|pp=70\u201397}}\n\nHorsman argues that expansionism played a role as a secondary cause after maritime issues, noting that many historians have mistakenly rejected expansionism as a cause for the war. He notes that it was considered key to maintaining sectional balance between free and slave states thrown off by American settlement of the Louisiana Territory, and widely supported by dozens of War Hawk congressmen such as John A. Harper, Felix Grundy, Henry Clay, and Richard M. Johnson, who voted for war with expansion as a key aim.\n\n{{quote|In disagreeing with those interpretations that have simply stressed expansionism and minimized maritime causation, historians have ignored deep-seated American fears for national security, dreams of a continent completely controlled by the republican United States, and the evidence that many Americans believed that the War of 1812 would be the occasion for the United States to achieve the long-desired annexation of Canada\u2026 Thomas Jefferson well-summarized American majority opinion about the war\u2026 to say \"that the cession of Canada\u2026 must be a [[sine qua non]] at a treaty of peace\".{{sfn| Horsman|1987}}}}\nHowever, Horsman states that in his view \"the desire for Canada did not cause the War of 1812\" and that \"The United States did not declare war because it wanted to obtain Canada, but the acquisition of Canada was viewed as a major collateral benefit of the conflict.\"{{sfn|Horsman |1987}}\n[[File:Peter Buell Porter.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter B.

Johnson]], [[John A. Harper]], and [[Peter B. Porter]]. A few Southerners opposed this, fearing an imbalance of free and slave states if Canada was annexed. Anti-Catholicism also caused many to oppose annexing the mainly Catholic Lower Canada, believing its French-speaking inhabitants unfit \"for republican citizenship\". Even major figures such as [[Henry Clay]] and [[James Monroe]] expected to keep at least Upper Canada in the event of an easy conquest. As a result, notable American generals such as [[William Hull]] issued proclamations to Canadians during the war promising republican liberation through incorporation into the United States. General [[Alexander Smyth]] similarly declared to his troops when they invaded Canada that \"you will enter a country that is to become one of the United States. You will arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens.\" A lack of clarity about American intentions undercut these appeals, however.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=137\u2013139}}\n\nDavid and Jeanne Heidler argue that \"most historians agree that the War of 1812 was not caused by expansionism but instead reflected a real concern of American patriots to defend United States' neutral rights from the overbearing tyranny of the British Navy.

They argue that the \"enduring debate\" is over the relative importance of expansionism as a factor, and whether \"expansionism played a greater role in causing the War of 1812 than American concern about protecting neutral maritime rights.\"{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2002|p=4}}\n\n===U.S. political conflict===\n{{main|Federalist Party|Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States}}\n[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[James Madison]], the fourth President of the United States (1809\u20131817).

The Federalist Party favoured a strong central government and closer ties to Britain, while the Democratic-Republican Party favoured a smaller central government, preservation of states' rights (including slavery), westward expansion, and a stronger break with Britain. By 1812, the Federalist Party had weakened considerably, and the Republicans were in a strong position, with James Madison completing his first term of office and control of Congress.{{sfn|Taylor|2010}} Support for the American cause was weak in Federalist areas of the Northeast throughout the war; fewer men volunteered to serve and the banks avoided financing the war. The negativism of the Federalists ruined the party's reputation, exemplified by the [[Hartford Convention]] of 1814\u201315, and it survived only in scattered areas. By 1815, there was broad support for the war from all parts of the country. This allowed the triumphant Democratic-Republicans to adopt some Federalist policies, such as the national bank which Madison re-established in 1816.{{sfn|Hickey|1978|pp=23\u201339}}{{sfn|Banner|1970}}\n\n==Forces==\n{{Insufficient inline citations|section|date=February 2020}}\n===American===\nThe United States Navy had 7,250 sailors and Marines in 1812. It was a well-trained and professional force which fought well against the Barbary pirates and France in the [[Quasi War]]. The Navy had 13 ocean-going warships, three of them \"super-frigates\". Its principal problem was a lack of funding, as many in Congress did not see the need for a strong navy.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=20}} The American warships were well-built ships that were at least equal to British ships of a similar class, as British shipbuilding emphasized quantity over quality.

Indian chiefs sought to fight only under favorable conditions; they would avoid any battle that promised heavy losses.

The naturally cautious Pr\u00e9vost followed these instructions, concentrating on defending Lower Canada at the expense of Upper Canada (which was more vulnerable to American attacks) and allowing few offensive actions.\n\nThe United States was not prepared to prosecute a war, for Madison had assumed that the state militias would easily seize Canada and that negotiations would follow. In 1812, the regular army consisted of fewer than 12,000 men.

They were repulsed with serious losses, marking the end of their Ohio campaign.\n\nCaptain [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] fought the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] on September 10, 1813. His decisive victory at \"[[Put-in-Bay]]\" ensured American military control of the lake, improved American morale after a series of defeats, and compelled the British to fall back from Detroit. This enabled General Harrison to launch another invasion of Upper Canada, which culminated in the American victory at the [[Battle of the Thames]] on October 5, 1813; [[Tecumseh]] was killed there.\n\n====Niagara frontier, 1813====\n[[File:Niagara River 1812.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The [[Niagara Peninsula]] during the War of 1812]]\nBritish and American leaders placed great importance on gaining control of the Great Lakes and the [[St. Lawrence River]] because of the difficulties of land-based communication. The British already had a small squadron of warships on [[Lake Ontario]] when the war began, and they had the initial advantage. The Americans established a Navy yard at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York]], a port on Lake Ontario. Commodore Isaac Chauncey took charge of the thousands of sailors and shipwrights assigned there and recruited from New York, and they completed a warship in a mere 45 days. Ultimately, almost 3,000 men worked at the shipyard, building 11 warships and many smaller boats and transports. Having regained the advantage by their rapid building program, on April 27, 1813, Chauncey and Dearborn attacked [[York, Upper Canada|York]], the capital of [[Upper Canada]]. In addition to the sailors, Army forces were stationed at Sackett's Harbor, where they camped out through the town, far surpassing the small population of 900. Officers were housed with families. [[Madison Barracks]] was later built at Sackett's Harbor as a fort on Lake Ontario.\n\nOn May 25, 1813, the American Lake Ontario squadron and Fort Niagara began bombarding [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=37}} An American amphibious force assaulted Fort George on the northern end of the Niagara River on May 27 and captured it without serious losses.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The British also abandoned Fort Erie and headed towards the Burlington Heights.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The British position was on the verge of collapse in Upper Canada; the Iroquois Indians considered changing sides and ignored a British appeal to come to their aid.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The Americans did not pursue the retreating British forces, however, until they had largely escaped and organized a counter-offensive at the [[Battle of Stoney Creek]] on June 5. The British launched a surprise attack at Stoney Creek at 2 a.m., leading to much confused fighting{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} and a strategic British victory.\n\nThe Americans pulled back to Forty Mile Creek rather than continuing their advance into Upper Canada.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} At this point, the Indians living on the Grand River reserve, many from the Six Nations of the Iroquois, began to come out to fight for the British, as an American victory no longer seemed inevitable.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The Iroquois ambushed an American patrol at Forty Mile Creek, while the Royal Navy squadron based in Kingston sailed in and bombarded the American camp. General Dearborn retreated to Fort George, mistakenly believing that he was outnumbered and outgunned.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=41}} British Brigadier General John Vincent was encouraged by the fact that more and more Indians were now arriving to assist him, providing about 800 additional men.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=41}}\n[[File:Laura Secord warns Fitzgibbons, 1813.jpg|thumb|[[Laura Secord]] providing advance warning to [[James FitzGibbon]], which led to a British-Indian victory at the [[Battle of Beaver Dams]], June 1813]]\nAn American force surrendered on June 24 to a smaller British force due to advance warning by [[Laura Secord]] at the [[Battle of Beaver Dams]], marking the end of the American offensive into Upper Canada.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=41}} British Major General Francis de Rottenberg did not have the strength to retake Fort George, so he instituted a blockade, hoping to starve the Americans into surrender.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=44}} Meanwhile, Commodore [[James Lucas Yeo]] had taken charge of the British ships on the lake and mounted a counterattack, which the Americans repulsed at the [[Battle of Sackett's Harbor]]. Thereafter, Chauncey and Yeo's squadrons fought two indecisive actions, neither commander seeking a fight to the finish.\n\nLate in 1813, the Americans abandoned the Canadian territory that they occupied around Fort George. They set fire to the village of Newark (now [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]]) on December 10, 1813, incensing the Canadians and politicians in control. Many of the inhabitants were left without shelter, freezing to death in the snow. The British retaliated following their [[Capture of Fort Niagara]] on December 18, 1813. The British and their Indian allies stormed the neighbouring town of [[Lewiston, New York]] on December 19, torching homes and killing about a dozen civilians. The British were pursuing the surviving residents when a small force of [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] warriors intervened, buying enough time for the civilians to escape to safer ground.{{sfn|Historic Lewiston, New}}{{sfn|Prohaska|2010}} The British attacked and burned [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] on Lake Erie on December 30, 1813.\n\n====St. Lawrence and Lower Canada, 1813====\nThe British were vulnerable over the stretch of the St. Lawrence between Upper Canada and the United States. Over the winter of 1812\u201313, the Americans launched a series of raids from [[Ogdensburg, New York]] which hampered British supply traffic up the river. On February 21, Sir George Pr\u00e9vost passed through [[Prescott, Ontario]] on the opposite bank of the river with reinforcements for Upper Canada. When he left the next day, the reinforcements and local militia attacked in the [[Battle of Ogdensburg]], and the Americans were forced to retire.\n\n[[File:Battle of Chateauguay.jpg|thumb|In October 1813, a force of Canadian [[Fencibles]], militiamen, and [[Mohawk people|Mohawks]] repelled an American attempt to take Montreal at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay|Chateauguay River.]]]]\n\nThe Americans made two more thrusts against Montreal in 1813.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} The plan eventually agreed upon was for Major General [[Wade Hampton I|Wade Hampton]] to march north from Lake Champlain and join a force under General [[James Wilkinson]] that would embark in boats and sail from Sackett's Harbor on Lake Ontario and descend the St. Lawrence. Hampton was delayed by bad roads and supply problems and also had an intense dislike of Wilkinson, which limited his desire to support his plan. [[Charles de Salaberry]] defeated Hampton's force of 4,000 at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay|Chateauguay River]] on October 25 with a smaller force of [[Canadian Voltigeurs]] and [[Mohawks]]. Salaberry's force of Lower Canada militia and Indians numbered only 339, but had a strong defensive position.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} Wilkinson's force of 8,000 set out on October 17 but was also delayed by bad weather. Wilkinson heard that a British force was pursuing him under Captain [[William Mulcaster]] and Lieutenant Colonel [[Joseph Wanton Morrison]], and he was forced to land near [[Morrisburg, Ontario]] by November 10, about 150 kilometres (90&nbsp;mi) from Montreal. On November 11, his rear guard of 2,500 attacked Morrison's force of 800 at [[Battle of Crysler's Farm|Crysler's Farm]] and was repulsed with heavy losses.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} He learned that Hampton could not renew his advance, retreated to the U.S., and settled into winter quarters.

They had occupied southwestern Upper Canada after their victory in Moraviantown, and they believed that taking the rest of the province would force the British to cede it to them. The end of the war in Europe in April 1814 meant that the British could deploy their Army to North America, so the Americans were anxious to secure Upper Canada to negotiate from a position of strength. They planned to invade via the Niagara frontier while sending another force to recapture Mackinac;{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=47}} the British were supplying the Indians in the Old Northwest from Montreal via Mackinac.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=48}} They renewed their attack on the Niagara peninsula and quickly captured [[Fort Erie]] on July 3, 1814, with the garrison quickly surrendering to the Americans.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=49}} General Phineas Riall rushed towards the frontier, unaware of Fort Erie's fall or the size of the American force, and engaged in battle.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=49\u201350}} Winfield Scott then gained a victory over a British force at the [[Battle of Chippawa]] on July 5. The Americans brought out overwhelming firepower against the attacking British, who lost about 600 dead to the 350 dead on the American side. An attempt to advance further ended with a hard-fought but inconclusive [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]] on July 25. Both sides stood their ground; American General Jacob Brown pulled back to Fort George after the battle, and the British did not pursue them.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=51}}\n[[File:British taking of the Northeast Bastion during the night assault on Fort Erie, August 14, 1814.png|thumb|British forces attempted to [[Siege of Fort Erie|storm Fort Erie]] on August 14, 1814 but were repelled by its American defenders.]]\nThe outnumbered Americans withdrew but withstood a prolonged [[Siege of Fort Erie]]. The British tried to storm Fort Erie on August 14, 1814 but suffered heavy losses, losing 950 killed, wounded, and captured compared to only 84 dead and wounded on the American side. The British were further weakened by exposure and shortage of supplies in their siege lines. Eventually they raised the siege, but American Major General [[George Izard]] took over command on the Niagara front and followed up only halfheartedly. An American raid along the Grand River destroyed many farms and weakened British logistics. In October 1814, the Americans advanced into Upper Canada and engaged in skirmishes at Cook's Mill, but they pulled back when they heard that the new British warship HMS ''St. Lawrence'' was on its way, armed with 104 guns and launched in Kingston that September. The Americans lacked provisions and eventually destroyed Fort Erie and retreated across the Niagara.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=52}}\n\nMeanwhile, 15,000 British troops were sent to North America under four of Wellington's ablest brigade commanders after Napoleon abdicated. Fewer than half were veterans of the Peninsula and the rest came from garrisons. Pr\u00e9vost was ordered to neutralize American power on the lakes by burning Sackets Harbor to gain naval control of Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the Upper Lakes, and to defend Lower Canada from attack. He did defend Lower Canada but otherwise failed to achieve his objectives,{{sfn|Grodzinski|2010|pp=560\u2013561}} so he decided to invade New York State. His army outnumbered the American defenders of [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]], but he was worried about his flanks, so he decided that he needed naval control of Lake Champlain. The British squadron on the lake under Captain [[George Downie]] was more evenly matched by the Americans under Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough \n[[File:Battleofpburg.jpg|thumb|Pr\u00e9vost's defeat at Plattsburgh led him to call off the invasion of New York.]]\n[[File:Flag of The Veteran Exempts of Battle of Plattsburgh.svg|thumb|Flag Flown at the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]]]\nUpon reaching Plattsburgh, Pr\u00e9vost delayed the assault until Downie arrived in the hastily completed 36-gun frigate {{HMS|Confiance|1814|6}}. Pr\u00e9vost forced Downie into a premature attack but then unaccountably failed to provide the promised military backing. Downie was killed and his naval force defeated at the naval Battle of Plattsburgh in Plattsburgh Bay on September 11, 1814. The Americans now had control of Lake Champlain; [[Theodore Roosevelt]] later termed it \"the greatest naval battle of the war\".{{sfn|Roosevelt|1902 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/navalwarorhisto00roosgoog#page/n120/mode/1up 108]}} General [[Alexander Macomb (general)|Alexander Macomb]] led the successful land defence. Pr\u00e9vost then turned back, to the astonishment of his senior officers, saying that it was too hazardous to remain on enemy territory after the loss of naval supremacy. He was recalled to London where a naval court-martial decided that defeat had been caused principally by Pr\u00e9vost urging the squadron into premature action and then failing to afford the promised support from the land forces. He died suddenly, just before his court-martial was to convene. His reputation sank to a new low, as Canadians claimed that their militia under Brock did the job but Pr\u00e9vost failed. Recent historians have been more kindly, however. Burroughs argues that his preparations were energetic, well-conceived, and comprehensive for defending the Canadas with limited means, and he achieved the primary objective of preventing an American conquest.{{sfn|Burroughs|1983}}\n\n[[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Hardy]] invaded the northern part of [[Massachusetts]] (Maine) on July 11 and took Fort Sullivan at [[Eastport, Maine|Eastport]].

[[Fort Belle Fontaine]] was an old trading post converted to an Army post in 1804, and this served as regional headquarters.

[[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]] played a leadership role.{{sfn|Cole | 1921|pp= 69\u201374.}}\n\nLittle of note took place on Lake Huron in 1813, but the American victory on Lake Erie and the recapture of Detroit isolated the British there. During the ensuing winter, a Canadian party under Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert McDouall]] established a new supply line from York to [[Nottawasaga Bay]] on [[Georgian Bay]]. He arrived at Fort Mackinac with supplies and reinforcements, then sent an expedition to recapture the trading post of [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]] in the far west. The [[Siege of Prairie du Chien]] ended in a British victory on July 20, 1814.\n\nEarlier in July, the Americans sent a force of five vessels from Detroit to recapture Mackinac. A mixed force of regulars and volunteers from the militia landed on the island on August 4. They did not attempt to achieve surprise, and Indians ambushed them in the brief [[Battle of Mackinac Island (1814)|Battle of Mackinac Island]] and forced them to re-embark. The Americans discovered the new base at Nottawasaga Bay, and they destroyed its fortifications on August 13 along with the schooner [[Nancy (1789 ship)|''Nancy'']] that they found there. They then returned to Detroit, leaving two gunboats to blockade Mackinac. On September 4, the gunboats were taken unawares and captured by British boarding parties from canoes and small boats. These [[Engagements on Lake Huron]] left Mackinac under British control.\n\nThe British garrison at Prairie du Chien also fought off another attack by Major [[Zachary Taylor]]. American troops retreating from the [[Battle of Credit Island]] on the upper Mississippi attempted to make a stand at [[Fort Johnson]], but they soon abandoned the fort and most of the upper Mississippi valley.{{sfn|Nolan|2009|pp=85\u201394}} In this distant theater, the British retained the upper hand until the end of the war through the allegiance of several Indian tribes that received British gifts and arms, enabling them to take control of parts of Michigan and Illinois and the whole of Wisconsin.{{sfn|Concise Historical Atlas|1998|p=85}}\n\nAmerican forces were driven from the Upper Mississippi region, but they held on to eastern Missouri and the St. Louis area.

Most of these were involved in blockading the French navy and protecting British trade against French privateers, but the Royal Navy still had 85 vessels in American waters, counting all North American and Caribbean waters.{{efn|Admiralty reply to British press criticism{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=180}})}} However, the Royal Navy's American squadron based in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] numbered one small [[ship of the line]], seven [[frigate]]s, nine smaller [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] and [[brig]]s, and five [[schooner]]s.{{sfn|Gwyn|2003|p=134}} By contrast, the United States Navy was composed of 8 frigates, 14 smaller sloops and brigs, and no ships of the line. The U.S. had embarked on a major shipbuilding program before the war at [[Sackets Harbor, New York]] and continued to produce new ships. Three of the existing American frigates were exceptionally large and powerful for their class, larger than any British frigate in America. The standard British frigate of the time was rated as a 38 gun ship, usually carrying up to 50 guns, with its main battery consisting of 18-pounder. USS ''Constitution'', ''President'', and ''United States'', in comparison, were rated as 44-gun ships, carrying 56\u201360 guns with a main battery of 24-pounders.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=50}}\n\nThe British strategy was to protect their own merchant shipping between Halifax and the West Indies, and to enforce a blockade of major American ports to restrict American trade. Because of their numerical inferiority, the American strategy was to cause disruption through hit-and-run tactics, such as the capturing prizes and engaging Royal Navy vessels only under favourable circumstances. Days after the formal declaration of war, however, America put out two small squadrons, including the frigate ''President'' and the sloop {{USS|Hornet|1805|2}} under Commodore [[John Rodgers (1772\u20131838)|John Rodgers]], and the frigates ''United States'' and {{USS|Congress|1799|2}}, with the brig {{USS|Argus|1803|2}} under Captain [[Stephen Decatur]]. These were initially concentrated as one unit under Rodgers, who intended to force the Royal Navy to concentrate its own ships to prevent isolated units being captured by his powerful force.\n\nLarge numbers of American merchant ships were returning to the United States with the outbreak of war, and the Royal Navy could not watch all the ports on the American seaboard if they were concentrated together. Rodgers' strategy worked, in that the Royal Navy concentrated most of its frigates off [[New York Harbor]] under Captain [[Philip Broke]], allowing many American ships to reach home. But Rodgers' own cruise captured only five small merchant ships, and the Americans never subsequently concentrated more than two or three ships together as a unit.{{sfn|Black|2008}}\n\n====Single-ship actions====\nBoth American and British naval honour had been challenged in the lead-up to the war. The [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair]] had left the United States insulted by the Royal Navy's impressment of sailors, and the appropriate method for the American Navy to redeem itself was by duelling. Similarly, British honour was challenged in the ''Little Belt'' affair where the United States frigate {{USS|President|1800|2}} fired on the British sloop {{HMS|Little Belt}} because ''President'' mistook ''Little Belt'' for the British frigate {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}}. Captain James Dacres of ''Guerriere'' began a cycle of frigate duels by challenging ''President'' to a single ship duel to avenge the losses aboard ''Little Belt''. Commodore [[John Rodgers (1772\u20131838)|John Rodgers]] of ''President'' declined the challenge because he feared that the rest of the British squadron under Commodore [[Philip Broke]] might intervene.{{sfn| Toll| 2006}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} {{sfn|James| 1817}}\n[[File:USS Constitution vs Guerriere.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Constitution}} defeats {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}} in a [[USS Constitution vs HMS Guerriere|single-ship engagement]].

On July 17, Commodore Broke's British squadron gave chase off New York, including ''Guerriere'', but ''Constitution'' evaded her pursuers after two days. Borke detached ''Guerriere'' from his squadron to seek out repairs, as she had weak scantlings (beams fastened with a thickened clamp rather than vertical and horizontal knees){{sfn|Gardiner|2000}} and had become leaky and rotten.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James|1817}} She had also been struck by lightning, severely damaging her masts.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} Captain Dacres was eager to engage the American frigate and to redeem British honour, as ''Constitution'' was the sister ship of ''President'' and would serve equally well as an American ship to duel.

''Shannon'' had been at sea for a long time, and her hull had begun to rot, further exaggerating the disparity in scantling strength.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} Nevertheless, this engagement proved to the only single-ship action where both ships were of essentially equal force during the War of 1812. British citizens reacted with celebration and relief that the run of American victories had ended.{{sfn|Forester|1970|pp=131\u2013132}} Notably, this action was by ratio one of the bloodiest contests recorded during this age of sail due to the close-range engagement, the boarding (hand-to-hand combat) and Broke's philosophy of artillery being \"Kill the men and the ship is yours\", with more dead and wounded than HMS ''Victory'' suffered in four hours of combat at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]. Captain Lawrence was killed, and Captain Broke was so badly wounded that he never again held a sea command.{{sfn|Gardiner|1996|p=61}} The Americans then did as the British had done in 1812 and banned single-ship duels after this engagement.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1882}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}\n[[File:George-ropes-battle-of-valparaiso.png|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Valpara\u00edso]] ended the American naval threat to British interests in the south [[Pacific Ocean]].]]\nIn January 1813, the American frigate {{USS|Essex|1799|2}}, under the command of Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]], sailed into the Pacific to harass British shipping.

Unlike the previous engagements, ''President'' was not taken in a duel. Following the both Royal Navy's requirements, ''President'' was pursued by a squadron consisting of four frigates, one being a 56-gun razee. ''President'' was an extremely fast ship and successfully outsailed the fast British squadron with the exception of {{HMS|Endymion|1797|6}} which has been regarded as the fastest ship in the age of fighting sail.{{sfn|Gardiner |2000}}{{Verify source|date=February 2019}} Captain Henry Hope of ''Endymion'' had fitted his ship with Phillip Broke's technology as Captain Hillyar had done on ''Phoebe''. This gave him the slight advantage at range and slowed ''President''. Commodore Decatur on ''President'' had the advantage in scantling strength, firepower, crew, and tonnage, but not in maneuverability. Despite having fewer guns, ''Endymion'' was armed with 24-pounders just like ''President''. This meant that ''Endymion'' shot could pierce the hull of ''President'' unlike ''Guerriere''{{'}}s which bounced of ''Constitution''{{'}}s hull or ''Java''{{'}}s that failed to cut through ''Constitution''{{'}}s mast.

Decatur surrendered without a fight.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James |1817}} Decatur had surrendered the United States finest frigate and flagship ''President'' to a smaller ship, but part of a squadron of greater force.\n\nDecatur gave unreliable accounts of the battle stating that ''President'' was already \"severely damaged\" by a grounding before the engagement, but undamaged after the engagement with ''Endymion''. He stated ''Pomone'' caused \"significant\" losses aboard ''President'', although ''President''{{'}}s crew claim they were below deck gathering their belongings as they had already surrendered. Despite saying \"I surrender my ship to the captain of the black frigate\", Decatur also writes that he said, \"I surrender to the squadron\". Nevertheless, many historians such as Ian Toll, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[William James (naval historian)|William James]] quote Decatur's remarks to either enforce that ''Endymion'' alone took ''President'' or that ''President'' surrendered to the whole squadron, when actually it was something in-between.{{sfn|James |1817}}{{sfn|Roosevelt|1882}}{{sfn|Toll |2006}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}\n\nSuccess in single ship battles raised American morale after the repeated failed invasion attempts in Upper and Lower Canada.

American privateers reported taking 1300 British merchant vessels, compared to 254 taken by the U.S. Navy,{{sfn|American Merchant Marine}}{{sfn|Franklin}}{{sfn|Brewer |2004}} although the insurer [[Lloyd's of London]] reported that only 1,175 British ships were taken, 373 of which were recaptured, for a total loss of 802.{{sfn|Latimer|2007 |p= 242}} The Canadian historian Carl Benn wrote that American privateers took 1,344 British ships, of which 750 were retaken by the British.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} However the British were able to limit privateering losses by the strict enforcement of [[convoy]] by the Royal Navy and by capturing 278 American privateers. Due to the massive size of the British merchant fleet, American captures only affected 7.5% of the fleet, resulting in no supply shortages or lack of reinforcements for British forces in North America.{{sfn|Lambert|2012|pp=394\u2013395}} Of 526 American privateers, 148 were captured by the Royal Navy and only 207 ever took a prize.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}}\n\nDue to the large size of their navy, the British did not rely as much on privateering. The majority of the 1,407 captured American merchant ships were taken by the Royal Navy. The war was the last time the British allowed privateering, since the practice was coming to be seen as politically inexpedient and of diminishing value in maintaining its naval supremacy. However privateering remained popular in British colonies. It was the last hurrah for privateers in [[Bermuda]] who vigorously returned to the practice after experience in previous wars.{{sfn|Strannack|1909|p={{page needed|date=June 2013}}}} The nimble [[Bermuda sloop]]s captured 298 American ships. Privateer schooners based in [[British North America]], especially from [[Nova Scotia]] took 250 American ships and proved especially effective in crippling American coastal trade and capturing American ships closer to shore than the Royal Navy cruisers.{{sfn|Faye|1997|p=171}}\n\n====Blockade====\n[[File:Principal Campaigns of the War of 1812.gif|left|thumb|A map of the American coastline. British naval strategy was to protect their shipping in North America, and enforce a naval blockade on the U.S.]]\nThe [[Blockade|naval blockade]] of the United States began informally in 1812 and expanded to cut off more ports as the war progressed.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} Twenty ships were on station in 1812 and 135 were in place by the end of the conflict.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} In March 1813, the Royal Navy punished the Southern states, who were most vocal about annexing British North America, by blockading Charleston, Port Royal, Savannah and New York City as well.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} However, as additional ships were sent to North America in 1813, the Royal Navy was able to tighten the blockade and extend it, first to the coast south of [[Narragansett, Rhode Island|Narragansett]] by November 1813 and to the entire American coast on May 31, 1814.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} In May 1814, following the abdication of Napoleon, and the end of the supply problems with Wellington's army, New England was blockaded.{{sfn| Grodzinski}}\n\nThe British government, having need of American foodstuffs for its army in Spain, benefited from the willingness of the New Englanders to trade with them, so no blockade of New England was at first attempted.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} The [[Delaware River]] and Chesapeake Bay were declared in a state of blockade on December 26, 1812. Illicit trade was carried on by collusive captures arranged between American traders and British officers. American ships were fraudulently transferred to neutral flags. Eventually, the U.S. government was driven to issue orders to stop illicit trading; this put only a further strain on the commerce of the country. The overpowering strength of the British fleet enabled it to occupy the Chesapeake and to attack and destroy numerous docks and harbours.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=849}}\n\nThe blockade of American ports later tightened to the extent that most American merchant ships and naval vessels were confined to port.

Others, mainly from New England, were issued licences to trade by Admiral Sir [[John Borlase Warren]], commander in chief on the American station in 1813. This allowed Wellington's army in Spain to receive American goods and to maintain the New Englanders' [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|opposition to the war]]. The blockade nevertheless resulted in American exports decreasing from $130&nbsp;million in 1807 to $7&nbsp;million in 1814. Most of these were food exports that ironically went to supply their enemies in Britain or British colonies.{{sfn|Leckie|1998|p=255}} The blockade had a devastating effect on the American economy with the value of American exports and imports falling from $114 million in 1811 down to $20 million by 1814 while the US Customs took in $13 million in 1811 and $6 million in 1814, despite the fact that Congress had voted to double the rates.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=56\u201357}} The British blockade further damaged the American economy by forcing merchants to abandon the cheap and fast coastal trade to the slow and more expensive inland roads.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}} In 1814, only 1 out of 14 American merchantmen risked leaving port as a high probability that any ship leaving port would be seized.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}}<ref>\"War of 1812.\" in ''Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History,'' edited by Thomas Riggs, (2nd ed., vol. 3, Gale, 2015), pp. 1446-1449.

The blockading British fleet in [[Chesapeake Bay]] received increasing numbers of enslaved black Americans during 1813.

About 2,400 of the escaped slaves and their families who were carried on ships of the Royal Navy following their escape settled in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] during and after the war. From May 1814, younger men among the volunteers were recruited into a new [[Corps of Colonial Marines]]. They fought for Britain throughout the Atlantic campaign, including the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] and the attacks on Washington, D.C. and Battle of Baltimore, later settling in Trinidad after rejecting British government orders for transfer to the [[West India Regiments]], forming the community of the [[Merikins]]. The slaves who escaped to the British represented the largest emancipation of African Americans before the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Black Sailors Soldiers|2012}}\n\n====Occupation of Maine====\nMaine, then part of Massachusetts, was a base for smuggling and illegal trade between the U.S. and the British. Until 1813 the region was generally quiet except for privateer actions near the coast. In September 1813, there was a notable naval action when the U.S. Navy's brig {{USS|Enterprise|1799|2}} [[Capture of HMS Boxer|fought and captured]] the Royal Navy brig {{HMS|Boxer|1812|2}} off Pemaquid Point.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=75\u201391}} The first British assault came in July 1814, when Sir [[Thomas Masterman Hardy]] took Moose Island ([[Eastport, Maine]]) without a shot, with the entire American garrison of [[Fort Sullivan (Maine)|Fort Sullivan]]\u2014which became the British Fort Sherbrooke\u2014surrendering.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=81\u201394}} Next, from his base in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], in September 1814, Sir [[John Coape Sherbrooke]] led 3,000 British troops in the \"Penobscot Expedition\". In 26 days, he raided and looted [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]], [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], and [[Machias, Maine|Machias]], destroying or capturing 17 American ships. He won the [[Battle of Hampden]] (losing two killed while the Americans lost one killed). Retreating American forces were forced to destroy the frigate {{USS|Adams|1799|2}}. The British occupied the town of [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] and most of eastern Maine for the rest of the war, re-establishing the colony of [[New Ireland (Maine)|New Ireland]]. The Treaty of Ghent returned this territory to the United States, though [[Machias Seal Island]] has remained in dispute. The British left in April 1815, at which time they took \u00a310,750 obtained from tariff duties at Castine. This money, called the \"Castine Fund\", was used to establish [[Dalhousie University]], in Halifax, Nova Scotia.{{sfn|Harvey|1938|pp=207\u2013213}}\n\n===={{anchor|Chesapeake Campaign|Expedition to the Chesapeake}}Chesapeake campaign and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"====\nThe strategic location of the Chesapeake Bay near America's new national capital, Washington, D.C. on the major tributary of the [[Potomac River]], made it a prime target for the British. Starting in March 1813, a squadron under Rear Admiral [[George Cockburn]] started a blockade of the mouth of the Bay at [[Hampton Roads]] harbour and raided towns along the Bay from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], to [[Raid on Havre de Grace|Havre de Grace, Maryland]].\n[[File:British Burning Washington.jpg|thumb|left|Following their victory at the [[Battle of Bladensburg]], the British entered Washington, D.C., [[Burning of Washington|burning down buildings]] including the [[White House]].]]\nOn July 4, 1813, Commodore [[Joshua Barney]], a Revolutionary War naval hero, convinced the Navy Department to build the [[Chesapeake Bay Flotilla]], a squadron of twenty barges powered by small sails or oars (sweeps) to defend the Chesapeake Bay. Launched in April 1814, the squadron was quickly cornered in the [[Patuxent River]], and while successful in harassing the Royal Navy, they were powerless to stop the British campaign that ultimately led to the \"[[Burning of Washington]]\". This expedition, led by Cockburn and General [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]], was carried out between August 19 and 29, 1814, as the result of the hardened British policy of 1814. As part of this, Admiral Warren had been replaced as commander in chief by Admiral Alexander Cochrane, with reinforcements and orders to coerce the Americans into a favourable peace.\n\nA force of 2,500 soldiers under General Ross had just arrived in Bermuda aboard {{HMS|Royal Oak|1809|6}}, three frigates, three sloops and ten other vessels. Released from the [[Peninsular War]] by victory, the British intended to use them for diversionary raids along the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. In response to Pr\u00e9vost's request, they decided to employ this force, together with the naval and military units already on the station, to strike at the national capital.\n\nOn August 24, U.S. Secretary of War [[John Armstrong Jr]]. insisted that the British were going to attack Baltimore rather than Washington, even when British army and naval units were obviously on their way to Washington. The inexperienced state militia was easily routed in the Battle of Bladensburg, opening the route to Washington. While First Lady [[Dolley Madison]] saved valuables from what is now the \"[[White House]]\", senior officials fled to Virginia. {{sfn|Defense Burning of}} Secretary of the Navy [[William Jones (statesman)|William Jones]] ordered setting fire to the [[Washington Navy Yard]] to prevent the capture of supplies.{{sfn|Herrick|2005|page=90}} The nation's public buildings were destroyed by the British (and by a furious thunderstorm that ruined a great deal of property, although it did quench the flames).

Watching the bombardment from a truce ship, [[Francis Scott Key]] was inspired to write the four-stanza poem that later became, ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''.]]\nThe British moved on to their major target, the heavily fortified major city of Baltimore. They delayed their movement allowing Baltimore an opportunity to strengthen the fortifications and bring in new federal troops and state militia units. The \"[[Battle of Baltimore|Battle for Baltimore]]\" began with the British landing on September 12, 1814, at [[Fort Howard (Maryland)|North Point]], where they were met by American militia further up the \"Patapsco Neck\" peninsula. An exchange of fire began, with casualties on both sides. The British Army commander Major Gen. [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]] was killed by snipers. The British paused, then continued to march northwestward to face the stationed Maryland and Baltimore City militia units at \"Godly Wood.\" The [[Battle of North Point]] was fought for several afternoon hours in a musketry and artillery duel. The British also planned to simultaneously attack Baltimore by water on the following day, September 13, to support their military facing the massed, heavily dug-in and fortified American units of approximately 15,000 with about a hundred cannon gathered along the eastern heights of the city named \"Loudenschlager's Hill\" (later \"Hampstead Hill\" \u2013 now part of [[Patterson Park]]). The Baltimore defences had been planned in advance and overseen by the state militia commander, Maj. Gen. [[Samuel Smith (Maryland)|Samuel Smith]]. The Royal Navy was unable to reduce [[Fort McHenry]] at the entrance to Baltimore Harbor in support of an attack from the northeast by the British Army.\n\nThe British naval guns, mortars and new \"[[Congreve rockets]]\" had a longer range than the American cannon onshore. The ships mostly stood out of range of the Americans, who returned very little fire. The fort was not heavily damaged except for a burst over a rear brick wall knocking out some field pieces but with few casualties. The British eventually realized that they could not force the passage to attack Baltimore in coordination with the land force. A last ditch night feint and barge attack during a heavy rain storm was led by Capt. [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]] around the fort up the Middle Branch of the river to the west. Split and misdirected partly in the storm, it turned back after suffering heavy casualties from the alert gunners of [[Fort Covington]] and [[Battery Babcock]]. The British called off the attack and sailed downriver to pick up their army, which had retreated from the east side of Baltimore. All the lights were extinguished in Baltimore the night of the attack, and the fort was bombarded for 25 hours. The only light was given off by the exploding shells over Fort McHenry, illuminating the flag that was still flying over the fort. The defence of the fort inspired the American lawyer [[Francis Scott Key]] to write \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\", a poem that was later set to music as \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\".{{sfn|Coleman|2015|pp=599\u2013629}}\n\n===Southern theater===\nBecause of the region's polyglot population, both the British and the Americans perceived the war in the Gulf South as a fundamentally different conflict from the one occurring in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] and Chesapeake.{{sfn|Millett|2013}}{{rp|31}}\n\n====Creek War====\n{{Main|Creek War}}\nBefore 1813, the war between the Creeks (or [[Muscogee]]) had been largely an internal affair sparked by the ideas of Tecumseh farther north in the Mississippi Valley. A faction known as the [[Red Sticks]], so named for the colour of their war stics, had broken away from the rest of the Creek Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. The Red Sticks were allied with Tecumseh, who about a year before 1813 had visited the Creeks and encouraged greater resistance to the Americans.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=23\u201325}} The Creek Nation was a trading partner of the United States, actively involved with Spanish and British trade as well. The Red Sticks, as well as many southern Muscogeean people like the [[Seminole]], had a long history of alliance with the Spanish and British Empires.{{sfn|Braund | 1993}} This alliance helped the North American and European powers protect each other's claims to territory in the south.{{sfn|Hurt |2002}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Burnt Corn]], between [[Red Sticks]] and U.S. troops, occurred in the southern parts of Alabama on July 27, 1813. It prompted the state of Georgia as well as the Mississippi territory militia to immediately take major action against Creek offensives. The Red Sticks chiefs gained power in the east along the [[Alabama River|Alabama]], [[Coosa River|Coosa]], and [[Tallapoosa River]]s \u2013 Upper Creek territory. The Lower Creek lived along the [[Chattahoochee River]]. Many Creeks tried to remain friendly to the United States, and some were organized by federal Indian Agent [[Benjamin Hawkins]] to aid the 6th Military District under [[Thomas Pinckney|General Thomas Pinckney]] and the state militias. The United States combined forces were large.

The army, led by [[John Floyd (Georgia politician)|General John Floyd]], went to the heart of the \"Creek Holy Grounds\" and won a major offensive against one of the largest Creek towns at [[Battle of Autosee]], killing an estimated two hundred people.

The main focus on British foreign policy was the Congress of Vienna, during which British diplomats had clashed with Russian and Prussian diplomats over the terms of the peace with France, and there were fears that Britain might have go to war with Russia and Prussia. Now each side was tired of the war. Export trade was all but paralyzed and after Napoleon fell in 1814 France was no longer an enemy of Britain, so the Royal Navy no longer needed to stop American shipments to France, and it no longer needed to impress more seamen. It had ended the practices that so angered the Americans in 1812. The British were preoccupied in rebuilding Europe after the apparent final defeat of Napoleon.{{sfn|Mahan|1905}}\n\nBritish negotiators were urged by Lord Liverpool to offer a ''status quo'' and dropped their demands for the creation of an Indian barrier state, which was in any case hopeless after the collapse of Tecumseh's alliance. This allowed negotiations to resume at the end of October. British diplomats soon offered the ''status quo'' to the U.S. negotiators, who accepted them. Prisoners were to be exchanged and captured slaves returned to the United States or paid for by Britain. At this point, the number of slaves was approximately 6,000. Britain eventually refused the demand, allowing many to either emigrate to Canada or Trinidad.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nOn December 24, 1814 the diplomats had finished and signed the Treaty of Ghent. The treaty was ratified by the British three days later on December 27{{sfnm|1a1=Hickey|1y=2006|1p=295|2a1=Updyke|2y=1915|2p=360|3a1=Perkins|3y=1964|3pp=129\u2013130}} and arrived in Washington on February 17, where it was quickly ratified and went into effect, thus finally ending the war. The terms called for all occupied territory to be returned, the prewar boundary between Canada and the United States to be restored, and the Americans were to gain fishing rights in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]].\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent failed to secure official British acknowledgement of American maritime rights or ending impressment. However, in the century of peace until World War I these rights were not seriously violated. The defeat of Napoleon made irrelevant all of the naval issues over which the United States had fought. The Americans had achieved their goal of ending the Indian threat; furthermore the American armies had scored enough victories (especially at New Orleans) to satisfy honour and the sense of becoming fully independent from Britain.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=208\u20139}}\n\n==Losses and compensation==\n{|align=right class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"F1F1F1\"\n|-\n|colspan=4 style=\"text-align: center;\" |'''''Casualties in the War of 1812'''''\n|-\n!

The Treaty of Ghent established the ''status quo ante bellum''; that is, there were no territorial losses by either side. The issue of impressment was made moot when the Royal Navy, no longer needing sailors, stopped impressment after the defeat of Napoleon in spring 1814 ended the war. (Napoleon unexpectedly returned in 1815, after the final end of the war of 1812.)\n\nThe long-term results of the war were generally satisfactory to both sides. Except for occasional border disputes and some tensions during the [[American Civil War]], relations between the U.S. and Britain remained peaceful for the rest of the 19th century, and the two countries became [[Special Relationship|close allies]] in the 20th century. Historian Troy Bickham argues that each participant defined success in a different way. The new American Republic could claim victory in the sense that its independence from London was assured, and the Indian barrier to Westward expansion was removed. The memory of the conflict played a major role in helping to consolidate a Canadian national identity after 1867. The British retained Canada, but their attention was overwhelmingly devoted to celebrating the defeat of Napoleon. The general consensus is that the Native Americans were the big losers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Troy Bickham|title=The Weight of Vengeance: The United States, the British Empire, and the War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QM755oY5k98C&pg=PT262|year=2012|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=262\u201380|isbn=9780199942626}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]] between the United States and Britain was enacted in 1817. It demilitarized the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, where many British naval arrangements and forts still remained. The treaty laid the basis for a demilitarized boundary. It remains in effect to this day.\n\nAlthough Britain had defeated the American invasions of Canada, its own invasions were defeated in Maryland, New York and Louisiana. After two decades of intense warfare against France, Britain was in no mood to have more conflicts with the United States. Instead it focused on expanding the British Empire into India. Britain never seriously challenged the US over land claims after 1846: it had hoped to keep Texas Independent from the United States and had some hopes of taking California from Mexico. From the 1890s, as the United States emerged as the world's leading industrial power, Britain wanted American friendship in a hypothetical European war. Border adjustments between the U.S. and British North America were made in the [[Treaty of 1818]]. [[Eastport, Maine|Eastport]], Massachusetts, was returned to the U.S. in 1818; [[Missouri Compromise|it became part]] of the new State of [[Maine]] in 1820. A border dispute along the Maine\u2013New Brunswick border was settled by the 1842 [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]] after the bloodless [[Aroostook War]], and the border in the [[Oregon Country]] was settled by splitting the disputed area in half by the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]]. A further dispute about the line of the border through the island in the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] resulted in another almost bloodless standoff in the [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]] of 1859. The line of the border was finally settled by an international arbitration commission in 1872.\n\n===Bermuda===\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=March 2020}}\nBermuda had been largely left to the defences of its own militia and privateers before U.S. independence, but the Royal Navy had begun buying up land and operating from there in 1795, as its location was a useful substitute for the lost U.S. ports. It originally was intended to be the winter headquarters of the North American Squadron, but the war saw it rise to a new prominence. As construction work progressed through the first half of the 19th century, Bermuda became the permanent naval headquarters in Western waters, housing the Admiralty and serving as a base and dockyard. The military garrison was built up to protect the naval establishment, heavily fortifying the archipelago that came to be described as the \"Gibraltar of the West\". Defence infrastructure remained the central leg of Bermuda's economy until after World War II.\n\n===The Canadas===\n[[File:Fort Henry, Kingston.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Henry National Historic Site|Fort Henry]] at Kingston in 1836.

In the decades following the war, several projects were undertaken to improve the defence of the colonies against the United States. They include work on [[La Citadelle]] at [[Quebec City]], [[Fort Henry National Historic Site|Fort Henry]] at Kingston, and rebuilding [[Fort York]] at York. Additionally, work began on the [[Halifax Citadel]] to defend the port against foreign navies. From 1826 to 1832, the Rideau Canal was built to provide a secure waterway not at risk from American cannon fire. To defend the western end of the canal, the British Army also built [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] at Kingston.{{sfn|Hayes|2008|p=117}}\n\n===Indigenous nations===\nThe Native Americans allied to the British lost their cause. The British proposal to create a \"neutral\" Indian zone in the American West was rejected at the Ghent peace conference and never resurfaced. After 1814 the natives, who lost most of their fur-gathering territory, became an undesirable burden to British policymakers. The latter now looked to the United States for markets and raw materials.{{sfn|Calloway|1986|pp=1\u201320}} The United States further disrupted trade along the northern border by prohibiting British fur traders from operating in the US, whereas before the war, both populations had freely moved back and forth across the border.\n\nBritish agents in the field continued to meet regularly with their former American Indian partners, but they did not supply arms or encouragement and there were no American Indian campaigns to stop U.S. expansionism in the Midwest. Abandoned by their powerful sponsor, American Great Lakes\u2013area Indians ultimately migrated or reached accommodations with the American authorities and settlers.{{sfn|Calloway|1986|pp=1\u201320}}\n\n===Great Britain===\nThe war is seldom remembered in Great Britain. The massive ongoing conflict in Europe against the French Empire under [[Napoleon]] ensured that the British did not consider the War of 1812 against America as more than a sideshow.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=304}} Britain's blockade of French trade had been entirely successful, and the Royal Navy was the world's dominant nautical power (and remained so for another century). While the land campaigns had contributed to saving Canada, the Royal Navy had shut down American commerce, bottled up the U.S. Navy in port, and widely suppressed privateering. British businesses, some affected by rising insurance costs, were demanding peace so that trade could resume with the U.S.{{sfnm|1a1=Heidler|1a2=Heidler|1y=2002|1p=7|2a1=Latimer|2y=2009|2p=88}} The peace was generally welcomed by the British, though there was disquiet about the rapid growth of the U.S. However, the two nations quickly resumed trade after the end of the war and, over time, a growing friendship.{{sfn|Stearns|2008|p=547}}\n\nHickey argues that for Britain:\n{{quote|the most important lesson of all [was] that the best way to defend Canada was to accommodate the United States. This was the principal rationale for Britain's long-term policy of rapprochement with the United States in the nineteenth century and explains why they were so often willing to sacrifice other imperial interests to keep the republic happy.{{sfn|Hickey|2014}}}}\n\n===United States===\n[[File:4th-of-July-1819-Philadelphia-John-Lewis-Krimmel.JPG|thumb|[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations in 1819.

Several war heroes used their fame to win election to national office. Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison both took advantage of their military successes to win the presidency, while Richard Mentor Johnson used his wartime exploits to help attain the vice presidency.\n\nDuring the war, New England states became increasingly frustrated over how the war was being conducted and how the conflict was affecting them. They complained that the U.S. government was not investing enough in the states' defences militarily and financially, and that the states should have more control over their militias. The increased taxes, the British blockade, and the occupation of some of New England by enemy forces also agitated public opinion in the states.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=255ff}} As a result, at the [[Hartford Convention]] (December 1814{{snd}}January 1815) Federalist delegates deprecated the war effort and sought more autonomy for the New England states. They did not call for secession but word of the angry anti-war resolutions appeared at the same time that peace was announced and the victory at New Orleans was known. The upshot was that the Federalists were permanently discredited and quickly disappeared as a major political force.{{sfn|Cogliano|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnJJ-GDktHgC&pg=PA234 234]}}\n\nThis war enabled thousands of slaves to escape to British lines or ships for freedom, despite the difficulties. The planters' complacency about slave contentment was shocked at the sight of their slaves fleeing, risking so much to be free.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The British aided numerous Black Refugees in resettling in New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, where [[Black Loyalists]] had also been granted land after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nAfter the decisive defeat of the Creek Indians at the battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, some Creek warriors escaped to join the [[Seminole]] in Florida, who had been forming as an ethnic group since the late 18th century. The remaining Creek chiefs signed away about half their lands, comprising 23,000,000 acres, covering much of southern Georgia and two thirds of modern Alabama. The Creek were separated from any future help from the Spanish in Florida, and from the Choctaw and Chickasaw to the west. During the war the United States seized [[Mobile, Alabama]], which was a strategic location as it provided an oceanic outlet for export from the cotton lands to the north.  Most were yet to be developed, but US control of this territory increased pressure on remaining Creek, as European Americans began to migrate in number into the area.\n\nJackson invaded Florida in 1818, demonstrating to Spain that it could no longer control that territory with a small force. Spain sold Florida to the United States in 1819 under the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] following the [[First Seminole War]]. Pratt concludes:\n\n{{quote|Thus indirectly the War of 1812 brought about the acquisition of Florida.... To both the Northwest and the South, therefore, the War of 1812 brought substantial benefits.

Each young country saw its self-perceived victory, and settling of the border between them, as an important foundation of its growing nationhood. The British, on the other hand, who had been preoccupied by Napoleon's challenge in Europe, paid little attention to what was to them a peripheral and secondary dispute, a distraction from the principal task at hand.\n\n===American===\nWhile American popular memory includes the British capture and the burning of Washington in August 1814,{{sfn|Defense Burning of}} which necessitated its extensive renovation, it focused on the victories at Baltimore, Plattsburg, and New Orleans to present the war as a successful effort to assert American national honour, the \"second war of independence\" in which the mighty British empire was humbled and humiliated.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=82\u201383}} In a speech before Congress on February 18, 1815, President [[James Madison]] proclaimed the war a complete American victory.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}}\n\nThis interpretation of the war was and remains the dominant American view of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} The American newspaper the ''Niles Register'', in an editorial on September 14, 1816, announced that the Americans had crushed the British, declaring \"...we did virtually dictate the treaty of Ghent to the British\".{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} A minority of Americans, mostly associated with the Federalists, considered the war a defeat and an act of folly on Madison's part, caustically asking if the Americans were \"dictating\" the terms of the treaty of Ghent, why the British Crown did not cede British North America to the United States?{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} However, the Federalist view of the war is not the mainstream American memory of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} Congressman [[George Troup]], who said in a speech in 1815 that the Treaty of Ghent was \"the glorious termination of the most glorious war ever waged by any people\", expressed American popular opinion and memory of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}}\n\nAmericans also celebrated the successful American defence of [[Fort McHenry]] in September 1814, which inspired the lyrics of what was adopted as the U.S. national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".{{sfn|Star-Spangled Banner War}} The successful captains of the U.S. Navy became popular heroes, and commemorative plates were produced with the likenesses of Decatur, Issac Hull, and [[Charles Stewart (1778\u20131869)|Charles Stewart]] on them, becoming popular items. Many of these plates were manufactured in England. The navy became a cherished institution, lauded for the victories that it won against all odds.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=456}} After engagements during the final actions of the war, U.S. Marines had acquired a well-deserved reputation as excellent marksmen, especially in ship-to-ship actions. {{sfn|Simmons|2003}}\n\n===Canadian===\n[[File:Couplandart.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Douglas Coupland]]'s '[[Monument to the War of 1812]]' (2008) in Toronto; depicts a larger-than-life Canadian soldier triumphing over an American; both are depicted as metallic toy soldiers of the sort small children play with.]]\n\nIn British North America, the War of 1812 was seen by Loyalists as a victory, as they had claimed they had successfully defended their country from an American takeover.{{sfn|Kaufman|1997|pp=110\u2013135}} A long-term consequence of the Canadian militia's success was the view, widely held in Canada at least until the First World War, that Canada did not need a regular professional army.{{sfn|Cmh: Origins of|2007}} While Canadian militia units had played instrumental roles in several engagements, such as at the Battle of the Chateauguay, it was the regular units of the British Army, including its \"Fencible\" regiments which were recruited within North America, which ensured that Canada was successfully defended.\n\nThe U.S. Army had done poorly, on the whole, in several attempts to invade Canada, and the Canadians had fought bravely to defend their territory. But the British did not doubt that the thinly populated territory would remain vulnerable in a third war. \"We cannot keep Canada if the Americans declare war against us again\", Admiral Sir [[David Milne (Royal Navy officer)|David Milne]] wrote to a correspondent in 1817,{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=458\u2013459}} although the [[Rideau Canal]] was built for just such a scenario.\n\nBy the 21st century it was a forgotten war in Britain,{{sfn|Lambert|2012|p=1}} although still remembered in Canada, especially Ontario. In a 2009 poll, 37% of Canadians said the war was a Canadian victory, 9% said the U.S. won, 15% called it a draw, and 39% said they knew too little to comment.{{sfn|Boswell|2009}} A 2012 poll found that in a list of items that could be used to define Canadians' identity, the belief that Canada successfully repelled an American invasion in the War of 1812 places second (25%).{{sfn|Ipsos Reid}}\n\n===Historians' views===\nHistorians have differing and complex interpretations of the war.{{sfn|Trautsch|2014}} In recent decades the view of the majority of historians has been that the war ended in stalemate, with the Treaty of Ghent closing a war that had become militarily inconclusive. Neither side wanted to continue fighting since the main causes had disappeared and since there were no large lost territories for one side or the other to reclaim by force. Insofar as they see the war's resolution as allowing two centuries of peaceful and mutually beneficial intercourse between the U.S., Britain and Canada, these historians often conclude that all three nations were the \"real winners\" of the War of 1812. These writers often add that the war could have been avoided in the first place by better diplomacy. It is seen as a mistake for everyone concerned because it was badly planned and marked by multiple fiascos and failures on both sides, as shown especially by the repeated American failures to seize parts of Canada, and the failed British attack on New Orleans and upstate New York.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2002|p=137}}{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=74}}\n\nHowever, other scholars hold that the war constituted a British victory and an American defeat. They argue that the British achieved their military objectives in 1812 (by stopping the repeated American invasions of Canada) and retaining their Canadian colonies. In contrast, they say, the Americans suffered a defeat when their armies failed to achieve their war goal of seizing part or all of Canada. Additionally, they argue the U.S. lost as it failed to stop impressment, which the British refused to repeal until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, arguing that the U.S. actions had no effect on the Orders in Council, which were rescinded before the war started.{{sfnm|1a1=Benn|1y=2002|p=83|2a1=Latimer|2y=2007|2p=3}}\n\nHistorian Troy Bickham, author of ''The Weight of Vengeance: The United States, the British Empire, and the War of 1812'', sees the British as having fought to a much stronger position than the United States.\n\n<blockquote>Even tied down by ongoing wars with Napoleonic France, the British had enough capable officers, well-trained men, and equipment to easily defeat a series of American invasions of Canada. In fact, in the opening salvos of the war, the American forces invading Upper Canada were pushed so far back that they ended up surrendering Michigan Territory. The difference between the two navies was even greater. While the Americans famously (shockingly for contemporaries on both sides of the Atlantic) bested British ships in some one-on-one actions at the war's start, the Royal Navy held supremacy throughout the war, blockading the U.S. coastline and ravaging coastal towns, including Washington, D.C. Yet in late 1814, the British offered surprisingly generous peace terms despite having amassed a large invasion force of veteran troops in Canada, naval supremacy in the Atlantic, an opponent that was effectively bankrupt, and an open secessionist movement in New England.</blockquote>\n\nHe considers that the British offered the United States generous terms, in place of their initially harsh terms (which included massive forfeiture of land to Canada and the American Indians), because the \"reigning Liverpool ministry in Britain held a loose grip on power and feared the war-weary, tax-exhausted public\". The war was also technically a British victory \"because the United States failed to achieve the aims listed in its declaration of war\".{{sfn|Bickham|2017}}\n\nA second minority view is that both the U.S. and Britain won the war\u2014that is, both achieved their main objectives, as the U.S. restored its independence and honour, and opened the way to westward expansion, while Britain defeated Napoleon and ruled the seas.{{sfn|Turner |2000}} American historian Norman K. Risjord argues that the main motivation was restoring the nation's honour in the face of relentless British aggression toward American neutral rights on the high seas, and in the Western lands. The results in terms of honour satisfied the War Hawks.{{sfn|Risjord|1961| pp=196\u2013210}} American historian Donald Hickey asks, \"Did the cost in blood and treasure justify the U.S. decision to go to war? Most Republicans thought it did. In the beginning they called the contest a 'second war of independence', and while Britain's maritime practices never truly threatened the Republic's independence, the war did in a broad sense vindicate U.S. sovereignty. But it ended in a draw on the battlefield.\"{{sfn|Hickey|2013|loc=Introduction}} Historians argue that it was an American success to end the threat of Indian raids, kill the British plan for a semi-independent Indian sanctuary, and hereby to open an unimpeded path for westward expansion.{{efn|''The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' concludes, \"British plans for an American Indian buffer state were dropped, and American Indian nations within U.S. borders lost their last major remaining European diplomatic partner, clearing a path for American westward expansion.\"{{sfn|Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|page=343}}&nbsp;}} [[Winston Churchill]] concluded:\n<blockquote>The lessons of the war were taken to heart. Anti-American feeling in Great Britain ran high for several years, but the United States were never again refused proper treatment as an independent power.{{sfn|Churchill|1958|page=366}}</blockquote>\n\nAmerican naval historian George C. Daughan argues that the US achieved enough of its war goals to claim a victorious result of the conflict, and subsequent impact it had on the negotiations in Ghent. Daughan uses official correspondences from President Madison to the delegates at Ghent strictly prohibiting negotiations with regards to maritime law, stating:{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=328}}\n\n<blockquote>Madison's latest dispatches [arrived July 25\u201327, 1814] permitted them [the delegates] to simply ignore the entire question of maritime rights. Free trade with liberated Europe had already been restored, and the Admiralty no longer needed impressment to man its warships. The president felt that with Europe at peace the issues of neutral trading rights and impressment could safely be set aside in the interests of obtaining peace... Thus, from the start of the negotiations, the disagreements that started the war and sustained it were acknowledged by both parties to be no longer important.</blockquote>\n\nThe British permanently stopped impressing Americans, although they never publicly rescinding the possibility of resuming that practice. The US delegates at the meeting understood it to be a dead issue after the 1814 surrender of Napoleon.{{sfn|Rutland | 1994 | p=200}} In addition, the successful defence of Baltimore, Plattsburgh, and Fort Erie (a strategic fortress located in Upper Canada on the Niagara River, and occupied during the third and most successful offensive into Canada) had very favorable influence on the negotiations for the Americans and prompted several famous responses from both sides. Henry Clay wrote to the delegates in October 1814, \"for in our own country, my dear sir, at last must we conquer the peace.\"{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=353}} With growing pressure in Britain, the Duke of Wellington, when asked to command the forces in America, wrote to Liverpool on November 9, 1814, \"I confess that I think you have no right, from the state of the war, to demand any concession of territory from America&nbsp;... You have not been able to carry&nbsp;... [the war] into the enemy's territory, notwithstanding your military success and now undoubted military superiority, and have not even cleared your own territory on the point of attack [Fort Erie]&nbsp;... Why Stipulate for ''uti possidetis''?\"{{sfn|Mills|1921|pp=19\u201332}} The argument that the US failed to capture any Canadian territory that influenced the negotiations is an outdated and highly criticized position, argues Daughan. He cites the ''Edinburgh Review'', a British newspaper, who had remained silent about the war with America for two years, wrote \"the British government had embarked on a war of conquest, after the American government had dropped its maritime demands, and the British had lost. It was folly to attempt to invade and conquer the United States. To do so would result in the same tragedy as the first war against them, and with the same result.\"{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=359}}\n\n====National bias of historians====\nHistorians have different views on who won the War of 1812, and there is an element of national bias to this.{{sfn|Trautsch|2014}} British and Canadian historians follow the view that the war was a British victory, and some US historians also support this view. {{sfn|Boswell|2011}} The opposing position, held by most US historians along with some Canadians and British, is that the result was a stalemate. Only US historians follow the minority view that the US was the victorious party in the war.{{sfn|Hattendorf|2012}}{{sfn|Simon|2012}}{{sfn|Boswell|2011}}{{sfn|Foreman|2014}} Similarly, a survey of school textbooks found that historians from Canada, Britain, and the United States emphasize different aspects of the war according to their national narratives; some British texts will scarcely mention the war.''{{sfn|Mowat|1965|p=35}}''\n\n====Indians as losers====\nHistorians generally agree that the real losers of the War of 1812 were the Indians (called First Nations in Canada). Hickey says:\n\n{{quote|The big losers in the war were the Indians. As a proportion of their population, they had suffered the heaviest casualties. Worse, they were left without any reliable European allies in North America&nbsp;... The crushing defeats at the Thames and Horseshoe Bend left them at the mercy of the Americans, hastening their confinement to reservations and the decline of their traditional way of life.{{sfn|Hickey|2013|loc=Introduction. |p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2bBHL2ePWcC&pg=PT22 22]}}{{sfn|Thompson|Randall|2008|page=23}}{{sfn|Bowman|Greenblatt|2003|p=142}}{{sfn|Kessel|Wooster|2005|page=145}}}}\n[[File:Jackson and Weatherford.jpg|thumb|[[William Weatherford]] surrendering to Andrew Jackson at the end of the Creek War. The peace imposed on the Creek saw them cede half of their territory to the United States.]]\nThe Indians of the Old Northwest (the modern Midwest) had hoped to create an Indian state to be a British protectorate.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=85}} American settlers into the Middle West had been repeatedly blocked and threatened by Indian raids before 1812, and that now came to an end. Throughout the war the British had played on terror of the tomahawks and scalping knives of their Indian allies; it worked especially at Hull's surrender at Detroit. By 1813 Americans had killed Tecumseh and broken his coalition of tribes. Jackson then defeated the Creek in the Southwest. Historian John Sugden notes that in both theaters, the Indians' strength had been broken prior to the arrival of the major British forces in 1814.{{sfn|Sugden|1982|p=311}} The one campaign that the Americans had decisively won was the campaign in the Old Northwest, which put the British in a weak hand to insist upon an Indian state in the Old Northwest.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=85}}\n\nNotwithstanding the sympathy and support from commanders (such as Brock,{{efn|{{harvtxt|Sugden|1982|pp=301\u2013302}} mentions that 'Brock had urged the British government to protect his Indian allies in peace negotiations, and by the end of 1812 he had obtained from Earl Bathurst, colonial secretary, a promise to that effect.'}} Cochrane and Nicolls), the policymakers in London reneged in assisting the Indians, as making peace was a higher priority for the politicians. At the peace conference the British demanded an independent Indian state in the Midwest, but, although the British and their Indian allies maintained control over the territories in question (i.e. most of the [[Upper Midwest]]), British diplomats did not press the demand after an American refusal, effectively abandoning their Indian allies. The withdrawal of British protection gave the Americans a free hand, which resulted in the removal of most of the tribes to [[Indian Territory]] (present-day [[Oklahoma]]).{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=435\u2013439}} In that sense according to historian Alan Taylor, the final victory at New Orleans had \"enduring and massive consequences\".{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=421}} It gave the Americans \"continental predominance\" while it left the Indians dispossessed, powerless, and vulnerable.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=437}}\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent technically required the United States to cease hostilities and \"forthwith to restore to such Tribes or Nations respectively all possessions, rights and privileges which they may have enjoyed, or been entitled to in 1811\"; the United States ignored this article of the treaty and proceeded to expand into this territory regardless; Britain was unwilling to provoke further war to enforce it. A shocked [[Henry Goulburn]], one of the British negotiators at Ghent, remarked:\n\n{{quote|Till I came here, I had no idea of the fixed determination which there is in the heart of every American to extirpate the Indians and appropriate their territory.{{sfn|Treaty of Ghent}}}}\n\nThe Creek War came to an end, with the Treaty of Fort Jackson being imposed upon the Indians. About half of the Creek territory was ceded to the United States, with no payment made to the Creeks. This was, in theory, invalidated by Article 9 of the Treaty of Ghent. {{sfn|Sugden|1982|p=304}} The British failed to press the issue, and did not take up the Indian cause as an infringement of an international treaty. Without this support, the Indians' lack of power was apparent and the stage was set for further incursions of territory by the United States in subsequent decades.

Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the [[Napoleonic Wars#War between Britain and France, 1803\u20131814|Napoleonic Wars]], while historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right.\n\nFrom the outbreak of war with [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]], Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France, which the US contested as illegal under international law. To man the blockade, Britain [[impressment|pressed]] American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy. American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake\u2013Leopard'' affair]], which happened five years before the war. The British were in turn outraged by the [[Little Belt affair|''Little Belt'' affair]] in 1811, in which 11 British sailors died.{{sfn|Hooks|2012}}{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=22}} Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier, hindering American expansion and provoking resentment.{{sfn|Stagg|1983|p=4}} Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of [[British North America]] (Canada) contributed to the American decision to go to war. However, the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British. On June 18, 1812, President [[James Madison]] signed into law the American declaration of war, after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress.{{sfn|Woodworth|1812}}\n\nWith most of its army in Europe fighting [[Napoleon]], Britain adopted a defensive strategy, with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier along with help from Native American allies. American prosecution of the war effort suffered from [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|its unpopularity]], especially in New England, where it was referred to as \"Mr. Madison's War\". American defeats at the [[Siege of Detroit]] and the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] thwarted attempts to seize [[Upper Canada]], improving British morale. American attempts also failed to invade [[Lower Canada]] and capture [[Montreal]]. In 1813, the Americans won the [[Battle of Lake Erie]], gaining control of the lake, and they defeated [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]] at the [[Battle of the Thames]], defeating the largest Native ally of Britain and securing a primary war goal. The Americans made a final attempt to invade Canada but fought to a draw at the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]] during the summer of 1814. At sea, the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports, cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will. In 1814, one of these raids [[Burning of Washington|burned the capital]], but the Americans later repulsed British attempts to [[Battle of Plattsburgh|invade New York]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Maryland]], ending invasions from Canada into the northern and mid-Atlantic states. In early 1815, the Americans [[Battle of New Orleans|decisively defeated]] the invading British Army attacking New Orleans, Louisiana. Fighting also took place in [[Spanish Florida]]; a [[Battle of Pensacola (1814)|two-day battle]] for the city of Pensacola ended in Spanish surrender.{{sfn|Heidler|p=45}}\n\nIn Britain, there was mounting opposition to wartime taxation, and merchants demanded to reopen trade with America. With the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|abdication of Napoleon]], Britain's war with France ended and Britain ceased impressment of American sailors. This made the original cause of the war irrelevant. The British were then able to increase the strength of the blockade on the United States coast, smothering American maritime trade, but their attempts failed to invade America, at which point both sides began to desire peace.{{sfn|Fowler|2017|pages=23\u201324}}\n\nPeace negotiations began in August 1814, and the [[Treaty of Ghent]] was signed on December 24, 1814. News of the peace did not reach America for some time. In February 1815, news reached the East Coast concerning the great victory at New Orleans\u2014at the same time as news of the Christmas peace treaty. The Americans triumphantly celebrated the restoration of their national honour, leading to the collapse of anti-war sentiment and the beginning of the [[Era of Good Feelings]], a period of national unity. The treaty was unanimously ratified by the US Senate on February 17, 1815, ending the war with no boundary changes.{{sfn|order of the Senate of the United States|1828|pages=619\u2013620}}\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|Origins of the War of 1812}}\nHistorians have long debated the relative weight of the multiple reasons underlying the origin of the War of 1812. This section summarizes several contributing factors which resulted in the declaration of war by the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Trautsch|1y=2013|1pp=273\u2013293|2a1=Egan|2y=1974|3a1=Goodman|3y=1941|3pp=171\u2013186}}{{sfn| Silverstone |2004|page=95}}\n\n===Honour and the second war of independence===\nAs Risjord (1961) notes, a powerful motivation for the Americans was the desire to uphold national honour in the face of what they considered to be British insults, such as the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair]].{{sfn|Risjord|1961|pp=196\u2013210}} [[H. W. Brands]] writes: \"The other war hawks spoke of the struggle with Britain as a second war of independence; [Andrew] Jackson, who still bore scars from the first war of independence, held that view with special conviction. The approaching conflict was about violations of American rights, but it was also about vindication of American identity.\"{{sfn|Brands|2005|p=163}} Americans at the time and historians since{{sfn|Swanson |1945}} have often called it the United States' \"Second War of Independence\".{{sfn|Hickey|2013}}\n\nThe British, at the same time, were offended by what they considered insults, such as the [[Little Belt affair|\"Little Belt\" affair]]. This gave them a particular interest in capturing the United States flagship ''President'', which they succeeded in doing in 1815.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}\n\n===Impressment and naval actions===\nIn 1807, Britain introduced a series of trade restrictions via the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders in Council]] to impede neutral trade with France, whom Britain was fighting in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The United States contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.{{sfn|Fanis|2011|p=94}} Historian Reginald Horsman states that \"a large section of influential British opinion, both in the government and in the country, thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy.\"{{sfn|Horsman|1962|p=264}} The American merchant marine had nearly doubled between 1802 and 1810, making it by far the largest neutral fleet. Britain was the largest trading partner, receiving 80 percent of American cotton and 50 percent of other American exports, and the British public and press were resentful of the growing mercantile and commercial competition.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=281}} The United States' view was that Britain's restrictions violated its right to trade with others.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy expanded to 176 [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] and 600 ships overall, requiring 140,000 sailors to man them.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=382}} The Royal Navy could man its ships with volunteers in peacetime, but it competed in wartime with merchant shipping and privateers for a small pool of experienced sailors, so it  turned to [[impressment]] from ashore and from foreign and domestic shipping when it could not operate its ships with volunteers alone.\n\nThe United States believed that British deserters had a right to become American citizens, but Britain did not recognize a right whereby a British subject could relinquish his citizenship and become a citizen of another country. The British Navy, therefore, considered any American citizen liable for impressment if he was born British. Aggravating the situation was the United States' reluctance to issue formal naturalization papers, and the widespread use of unofficial or forged identity or [[protection papers]] among sailors.{{sfn|Rodger|2005|pages=565\u2013566}} This made it difficult for the Royal Navy to distinguish Americans from non-Americans and led it to impress some Americans who had never been British. Some gained freedom on appeal.{{sfn|Latimer|2007|p=17}} The Admiralty estimated that there were 11,000 naturalized sailors on United States ships in 1805, and US Secretary of the Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]] stated that 9,000 US sailors had been born in Great Britain or Ireland.{{sfn|Caffrey|1977|p=60}} Captain [[Isaac Chauncey]] found in 1808 that 58-percent of sailors based in New York City were either naturalized citizens or recent immigrants. Of these 150 naturalized sailors, 80 were from Ireland and 54 from other parts of the United Kingdom.\n[[File:Story of one hundred years - A comprehensive review of the political and military events, the social, intellectual and material progress, and the general state of mankind in all lands.

The [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake''\u2013''Leopard'' affair]] and other acts of impressment angered the American public.]]\nAmerican anger grew when British frigates were stationed just outside US harbours and in view of US shores to search ships and impress men while within US territorial waters.{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=278\u2013279}} Well-publicized impressment actions outraged the American public, such as the [[Leander affair|''Leander'' affair]] and the [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair|''Chesapeake''\u2013''Leopard'' affair]].{{sfn|Black|2002|p=44}}{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=104}}\n\nThe British public were outraged in their turn by the ''Little Belt'' affair, in which a large American ship clashed with a small British sloop, resulting in the deaths of 11 British sailors. Both sides claimed that the other fired first, but the British public in particular blamed the US for attacking a smaller vessel, with calls in some newspapers for revenge,{{sfn|Hooks|2012}}{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=22}} while the US was encouraged by the fact that they had won a victory over the Royal Navy.{{sfn|Hooks|2009|p=ii}} The US Navy also forcibly recruited British sailors, but the British government saw impressment as commonly accepted practice and preferred to rescue British sailors from American impressment on a case-by-case basis.{{sfn| Deeben|2012}}\n\n===British support of Indian raids===\n{{Warof1812-Origins}}\nThe [[Northwest Territory]] consisted of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and was the battleground for conflict between the United States and various Indian tribes.{{sfn|White|2010|p=416}} The British Empire had ceded the area to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, both sides ignoring the fact that the land was partly inhabited by various tribes, including the [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Winnebago people|Winnebago]], [[Shawnee]], [[Fox people|Fox]], [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Lenape|Delaware]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]. Some warriors had left their tribes to follow [[Tenskwatawa]], the Shawnee prophet and the brother of [[Tecumseh]]. Tenskwatawa had a vision of purifying his society by expelling the \"children of the Evil Spirit\", by which he meant the American settlers.{{sfn|Willig|2008|p=207}} The Indians wanted to create their own state in the Northwest to end the American threat forever, as it became clear that the Americans wanted all of the land in the Old Northwest for national growth.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}} Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh formed a confederation of numerous tribes to block American expansion. The British saw the Indian tribes as valuable allies and a buffer to their Canadian colonies, so they began to provide arms and ammunition to the Indians; the subsequent Indian attacks on American settlers in the Northwest further aggravated tensions between Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Hitsman|1965|p=27}} Raiding grew more common in 1810 and 1811; westerners in Congress found the raids intolerable and wanted them permanently ended.{{sfnm|1a1=Heidler|1a2=Heidler|1y=1997|1pp=253, 504|2a1=Zuehlke|2y=2007|2p=62}} British policy was divided towards the Indians. On the one hand, the British wanted to encourage Indian raids in order to keep the Americans fighting in the Northwest; they also wanted to preserve a region which provided rich profits for Canadian fur traders. On the other hand, they feared that too much support for the Indians would cause a war with the United States.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}} Tecumseh's plans for an Indian state in the Northwest would benefit British North America by making it more defensible, but the defeats suffered by Tecumseh's confederation made the British leery of going too far to support what was probably a losing cause. British diplomats attempted to defuse tensions on the frontier in the months preceding the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=18}}\n[[File:\"A Scene on the Frontiers as Practiced by the Humane British and Their Worthy Allies!\".jpg|thumb|Americans believed that British officers paid their Indian allies to scalp American soldiers, c. 1812]]\nThe confederation's raids hindered American expansion into rich farmlands in the Northwest Territory.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=253, 392}} Pratt writes:\n\n{{quote|There is ample proof that the British authorities did all in their power to hold or win the allegiance of the Indians of the Northwest with the expectation of using them as allies in the event of war. Indian allegiance could be held only by gifts, and to an Indian no gift was as acceptable as a lethal weapon. Guns and ammunition, tomahawks and scalping knives were dealt out with some liberality by British agents.{{sfn|Pratt|1955|p=126}}}}\n\nHowever, the frontiersmen, according to the U.S. Army Center of Military History, had no doubt that their troubles with the Indians \"were the result of British intrigue\", and many settlers began circulating stories of British Army muskets and equipment being found on the field after Indian raids. Thus, \"the westerners were convinced that their problems could best be solved by forcing the British out of Canada\". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH/AMH-06.htm|title=American Military History, Army Historical Series, Chapter 6 |publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe British had the longstanding goal of creating a large Indian state to cover much of Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. They made the demand as late as the fall of 1814 at the peace conference, but they lost control of western Ontario in 1813 at key battles on and around Lake Erie. These battles destroyed the [[Tecumseh's Confederacy|Indian confederacy]] which had been the main ally of the British in that region, weakening its negotiating position. Much of the area remained under British or British-allied Indian control until the end of the war, but the British dropped the demands.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1989|1pp=46\u201363, esp. |pp= 61\u201363|2a1=Carroll|2y=2001|2p=23}}\n\n===American expansionism===\n[[File:KENSETT MAP CANADA 1812.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map of the Canadas from 1812.

The Loyalists were hostile to union with the United States, while the immigrant settlers were generally uninterested in politics and remained neutral or supported the British during the war. The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army. Americans believed that many men in Upper Canada would rise up and greet an American army as liberators. One reason that American forces retreated after one successful battle inside Canada was that they could not obtain supplies from the locals.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=206}} But the Americans thought that the possibility of local support suggested an easy conquest, as [[Thomas Jefferson]] believed: \"The acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent.\"{{sfn|Hickey|2012|p=68}}\n[[File:Reproduction-of-the-1805-Rembrandt-Peale-painting-of-Thomas-Jefferson-New-York-Historical-Society 1.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Jefferson]], the third President of the United States (1801\u20131809), believed that the acquisition of the Canadas was a \"mere matter of marching\".]]\n\nSome American border businessmen supported annexation because they wanted to gain control of Great Lakes trade.{{sfn|Nugent|2008|p=75}} Carl Benn notes that the War Hawks' desire to annex the Canadas was similar to the enthusiasm for the annexation of [[Spanish Florida]] by inhabitants of the American South; both expected war to facilitate expansion into long-desired lands and end support for hostile Indian tribes (Tecumseh's Confederacy in the North and the [[Creek people|Creek]] in the South).{{sfn |Benn |Marston |2006}} Tennessee Congressman [[Felix Grundy]] considered it essential to acquire Canada to ''preserve'' domestic political balance, arguing that annexing Canada would maintain the free state-slave state balance, which might otherwise be thrown off by the acquisition of Florida and the settlement of the southern areas of the new [[Louisiana Purchase]].{{sfn| Heller|2010|page=98}}\n\nHowever, historian Richard Maass argues that the expansionist theme is a myth which goes against the \"relative consensus among experts that the primary U.S. objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions\". He argues that consensus among scholars is that the United States went to war \"because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table, and threatening the Royal Navy's Canadian supply base was their last hope.\" Maass agrees that expansionism might have tempted Americans on a theoretical level, but he finds that \"leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so\", particularly because such expansion \"focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements\" of Canada. But Maass notes that many historians continue to believe that expansionism was a cause.{{sfn|Maass|2014|pp=70\u201397}}\n\nHorsman argues that expansionism played a role as a secondary cause after maritime issues, noting that many historians have mistakenly rejected expansionism as a cause for the war. He notes that it was considered key to maintaining sectional balance between free and slave states thrown off by American settlement of the Louisiana Territory, and widely supported by dozens of War Hawk congressmen such as John A. Harper, Felix Grundy, Henry Clay, and Richard M. Johnson, who voted for war with expansion as a key aim.\n\n{{quote|In disagreeing with those interpretations that have simply stressed expansionism and minimized maritime causation, historians have ignored deep-seated American fears for national security, dreams of a continent completely controlled by the republican United States, and the evidence that many Americans believed that the War of 1812 would be the occasion for the United States to achieve the long-desired annexation of Canada\u2026 Thomas Jefferson well-summarized American majority opinion about the war\u2026 to say \"that the cession of Canada\u2026 must be a [[sine qua non]] at a treaty of peace\".{{sfn| Horsman|1987}}}}\nHowever, Horsman states that in his view \"the desire for Canada did not cause the War of 1812\" and that \"The United States did not declare war because it wanted to obtain Canada, but the acquisition of Canada was viewed as a major collateral benefit of the conflict.\"{{sfn|Horsman |1987}}\n[[File:Peter Buell Porter.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter B. Porter]], and many [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] congressmen, sought to \"oust the British from the continent\" and \"annex Canada\".]]\n\nHistorian [[Alan Taylor (historian)|Alan Taylor]] says that many [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] congressmen \"longed to oust the British from the continent and to annex Canada\", such as [[Richard M. Johnson]], [[John A. Harper]], and [[Peter B. Porter]]. A few Southerners opposed this, fearing an imbalance of free and slave states if Canada was annexed. Anti-Catholicism also caused many to oppose annexing the mainly Catholic Lower Canada, believing its French-speaking inhabitants unfit \"for republican citizenship\". Even major figures such as [[Henry Clay]] and [[James Monroe]] expected to keep at least Upper Canada in the event of an easy conquest. As a result, notable American generals such as [[William Hull]] issued proclamations to Canadians during the war promising republican liberation through incorporation into the United States. General [[Alexander Smyth]] similarly declared to his troops when they invaded Canada that \"you will enter a country that is to become one of the United States. You will arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens.\" A lack of clarity about American intentions undercut these appeals, however.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=137\u2013139}}\n\nDavid and Jeanne Heidler argue that \"most historians agree that the War of 1812 was not caused by expansionism but instead reflected a real concern of American patriots to defend United States' neutral rights from the overbearing tyranny of the British Navy. That is not to say that expansionist aims would not potentially result from the war.\"{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2003|page=9}} However, they also argue otherwise, saying that \"acquiring Canada would satisfy America's expansionist desires\", also describing it as a key goal of western expansionists who, they argue, believed that \"eliminating the British presence in Canada would best accomplish\" their goal of halting British support for Indian raids. They argue that the \"enduring debate\" is over the relative importance of expansionism as a factor, and whether \"expansionism played a greater role in causing the War of 1812 than American concern about protecting neutral maritime rights.\"{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2002|p=4}}\n\n===U.S. political conflict===\n{{main|Federalist Party|Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States}}\n[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[James Madison]], the fourth President of the United States (1809\u20131817). Madison was the leader of the Democratic-Republican Party, whose power base came from southern and western states]]\nThe U.S. was in a period of significant political conflict between the [[Federalist Party]] (based mainly in the Northeast) and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] (with its greatest power base in the South and West). The Federalist Party favoured a strong central government and closer ties to Britain, while the Democratic-Republican Party favoured a smaller central government, preservation of states' rights (including slavery), westward expansion, and a stronger break with Britain. By 1812, the Federalist Party had weakened considerably, and the Republicans were in a strong position, with James Madison completing his first term of office and control of Congress.{{sfn|Taylor|2010}} Support for the American cause was weak in Federalist areas of the Northeast throughout the war; fewer men volunteered to serve and the banks avoided financing the war. The negativism of the Federalists ruined the party's reputation, exemplified by the [[Hartford Convention]] of 1814\u201315, and it survived only in scattered areas. By 1815, there was broad support for the war from all parts of the country. This allowed the triumphant Democratic-Republicans to adopt some Federalist policies, such as the national bank which Madison re-established in 1816.{{sfn|Hickey|1978|pp=23\u201339}}{{sfn|Banner|1970}}\n\n==Forces==\n{{Insufficient inline citations|section|date=February 2020}}\n===American===\nThe United States Navy had 7,250 sailors and Marines in 1812. It was a well-trained and professional force which fought well against the Barbary pirates and France in the [[Quasi War]]. The Navy had 13 ocean-going warships, three of them \"super-frigates\". Its principal problem was a lack of funding, as many in Congress did not see the need for a strong navy.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=20}} The American warships were well-built ships that were at least equal to British ships of a similar class, as British shipbuilding emphasized quantity over quality. However, the biggest ships in the American Navy were [[frigate]]s, and it had no ships-of-the-line capable of engaging in a fleet action with the Royal Navy.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=20\u201321}} On the high seas, the Americans could only pursue a strategy of [[commerce raiding]], capturing or sinking British merchantmen with their frigates and privateers.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=20 & 54\u201355}} The Navy was largely concentrated on the Atlantic coast before the war; it had only two gunboats on Lake Champlain, one brig on Lake Ontario, and another brig in Lake Erie when the war began.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=21}}\n\nThe United States Army was much larger than the British Army in North America, and the soldiers were well-trained and brave. Many men carried their own long rifles, while the British were issued muskets (except for one unit of 500 riflemen). However, leadership was inconsistent in the American officer corps; some officers proved themselves to be outstanding, but many others were inept, owing their positions to political favors.<!--- like every army on the planet! ---> Congress was hostile to a standing army, and the government called out 450,000 men from the state militias during the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=21}} However, the state militias were poorly trained, armed, and led.

However, America was a secondary concern as long as the war continued with France.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=21}} In 1813, France had 80 ships-of-the-line and was building another 35, and containing the French fleet had to be the main British naval concern.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=21}} In Upper Canada, the British had the Provincial Marine which was essential for keeping the army supplied, since the roads were abysmal in Upper Canada.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=21}} The Royal Navy had two schooners on Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence, while the Provincial Marine maintained four small warships on Lake Erie.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=21}}\n\nThe British Army in North America was a very professional and well-trained force, but it suffered from being outnumbered.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=21}} The militias of Upper Canada and Lower Canada had a much lower level of military effectiveness.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=21}} Nevertheless, Canadian militia and locally recruited regular units known as \"[[Fencibles]]\" were often more reliable{{vague|date=June 2019}} than American militia, particularly when defending their own territory.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} As such, they played pivotal roles in various engagements, including at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay]], where Canadian and Indian forces stopped a much larger American force without assistance from regular British units.\n\n===Indian===\nThe Indian allies of the British avoided pitched battles and relied on irregular warfare, including raids and ambushes which took advantage of their knowledge of terrain. Indian chiefs sought to fight only under favorable conditions; they would avoid any battle that promised heavy losses. The main Indian weapons were a mixture of muskets, rifles, bows, tomahawks, knives, swords, and clubs. Indian warriors were brave, but their tactics favored defense rather than offense.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=25}}\n\nIn the words of Benn, the Indians fighting with the Americans provided the U.S. with their \"most effective light troops\", while the British desperately needed the Indian tribes as allies to compensate for their numerical inferiority. Regardless of which side they fought for, the highly decentralized bands and tribes considered themselves to be allies and not subordinates. Indian chiefs did what they thought best for their tribes, much to the annoyance of both American and British generals, who often complained about their unreliability.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=25}}\n\n==Declaration of war==\n{{multiple image\n |align=right\n |direction=horizontal\n |image1=1812 War Declaration.jpg\n |width1=159\n |footer=The U.S. Declaration of War (left) and [[Issac Brock]]'s Proclamation in response to it (right)\n |image2=Proclamation Province of Upper Canada by Isaac Brock.jpg\n |width2=140\n}}\n{{Wikisource|US Declaration of War against the United Kingdom}}\nOn June 1, 1812, President James Madison sent a message to Congress recounting American grievances against Great Britain, though not specifically calling for a declaration of war.

The Senate concurred in the declaration by a 19 to 13 (59%) vote in favour. The conflict began formally on June 18, 1812, when Madison signed the measure into law and proclaimed it the next day.{{sfn|Woodworth|1812}} This was the first time that the United States had declared war on another nation, and the Congressional vote was the closest vote in American history to formally declare war.{{sfn|Summer 1812: Congress}} The [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991]] was a closer vote, but it was not a formal declaration of war.{{sfn|Clymer|1991}} None of the 39 Federalists in Congress voted in favour of the war, and critics subsequently referred to it as \"Mr. Madison's War\",{{sfn|Summer 1812: Congress}}\n\nPrime Minister [[Spencer Perceval]] had been assassinated in London on May 11, which resulted in [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] coming to power, and he wanted a more practical relationship with the United States. On June 23, he issued a repeal of the Orders in Council, but the United States was unaware of this, as it took three weeks for the news to cross the Atlantic.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=329}} On June 28, 1812, {{HMS|Colibri|1809|6}} was despatched from Halifax to New York under a flag of truce. She anchored off [[Sandy Hook]] on July 9 and left three days later carrying a copy of the declaration of war, British ambassador to the United States [[Augustus Foster]], and consul Colonel Barclay. She arrived in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] eight days later. The news of the declaration took even longer to reach London.\n\nHowever, British commander [[Isaac Brock]] in Upper Canada received the news much faster, and he issued a proclamation alerting the citizenry of the state of war and urging all military personnel \"to be vigilant in the discharge of their duty\" to prevent communication with the enemy and to arrest anyone suspected of helping the Americans.{{sfn|Proclamation: Province of|2008}}{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=311}} He also issued orders to the commander of the British post at [[Fort St. Joseph (Ontario)|Fort St. Joseph]] to initiate offensive operations against American forces in northern Michigan, who were not yet aware of their own government's declaration of war. The resulting [[Siege of Fort Mackinac]] on July 17 was the first major land engagement of the war, and ended in an easy British victory.{{sfn|Battle of Mackinac}}\n\n==Course of war==\n{{See also|Timeline of the War of 1812}}\n\nThe war was conducted in three theaters:\n# The [[Great Lakes]] and the Canadian frontier\n# At sea, principally the Atlantic Ocean and the American east coast\n# The Southern states and southwestern territories\n\n===Unpreparedness===\n[[File:SirGeorgePrevostByRobertField.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor General [[George Pr\u00e9vost]] was urged to maintain a defensive strategy, as British forces were already preoccupied with the Napoleonic Wars.]]\nThe war had been preceded by years of angry diplomatic dispute, yet neither side was ready for war when it came. Britain was heavily engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, most of the British Army was deployed in the [[Peninsular War]] in Portugal and Spain, and the Royal Navy was compelled to blockade most of the coast of Europe.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=847}} The number of British regular troops present in Canada in July 1812 was officially stated to be 6,034, supported by Canadian militia.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|pp=72\u201375}} Throughout the war, the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies was [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Earl Bathurst]], and he could spare few troops to reinforce North America during the first two years of the war; he urged Lieutenant General Sir [[George Pr\u00e9vost]] to maintain a defensive strategy. The naturally cautious Pr\u00e9vost followed these instructions, concentrating on defending Lower Canada at the expense of Upper Canada (which was more vulnerable to American attacks) and allowing few offensive actions.\n\nThe United States was not prepared to prosecute a war, for Madison had assumed that the state militias would easily seize Canada and that negotiations would follow. In 1812, the regular army consisted of fewer than 12,000 men. Congress authorized the expansion of the army to 35,000 men, but the service was voluntary and unpopular; it offered poor pay, and there were initially few trained and experienced officers.{{sfn|Quimby|1997|pp=2\u201312}} The militia objected to serving outside their home states, they were undisciplined, and they performed poorly against British forces when outside their home states.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=847}} \n\nAmerican prosecution of the war suffered from its unpopularity, especially in [[New England]] where anti-war speakers were vocal. Massachusetts Congressmen [[Ebenezer Seaver]] and [[William Widgery]] were \"publicly insulted and hissed\" in Boston, while a mob seized Plymouth's Chief Justice [[Charles Turner Jr.|Charles Turner]] on August 3, 1812 \"and kicked [him] through the town\".{{sfn|Adams|1918|p=400}} The United States had great difficulty financing its war.

Procter left the prisoners with an inadequate guard who could not defend them from their own Indian allies, who [[River Raisin Massacre|slaughtered 60 captive Americans]].{{sfn|Kentucky History: War of 1812}} The defeat ended Harrison's campaign against Detroit, but \"Remember the River Raisin!\" became a rallying cry for the Americans.\n[[File:Battle erie.jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Hazard Perry]]'s message to William Henry Harrison after the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] began with: \"We have met the enemy and they are ours\".{{sfn|We Have Met}}]]\nIn May 1813, Procter and Tecumseh set [[Siege of Fort Meigs|siege to Fort Meigs]] in northwestern Ohio. The Indians ambushed American reinforcements who arrived during the siege, but the fort still held out. The Indians eventually began to disperse, forcing Procter and Tecumseh to return north to Canada. Along the way they attempted to [[Battle of Fort Stephenson|storm Fort Stephenson]], a small American post on the [[Sandusky River]] near [[Lake Erie]]. They were repulsed with serious losses, marking the end of their Ohio campaign.\n\nCaptain [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] fought the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] on September 10, 1813. His decisive victory at \"[[Put-in-Bay]]\" ensured American military control of the lake, improved American morale after a series of defeats, and compelled the British to fall back from Detroit. This enabled General Harrison to launch another invasion of Upper Canada, which culminated in the American victory at the [[Battle of the Thames]] on October 5, 1813; [[Tecumseh]] was killed there.\n\n====Niagara frontier, 1813====\n[[File:Niagara River 1812.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The [[Niagara Peninsula]] during the War of 1812]]\nBritish and American leaders placed great importance on gaining control of the Great Lakes and the [[St. Lawrence River]] because of the difficulties of land-based communication. The British already had a small squadron of warships on [[Lake Ontario]] when the war began, and they had the initial advantage. The Americans established a Navy yard at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York]], a port on Lake Ontario. Commodore Isaac Chauncey took charge of the thousands of sailors and shipwrights assigned there and recruited from New York, and they completed a warship in a mere 45 days. Ultimately, almost 3,000 men worked at the shipyard, building 11 warships and many smaller boats and transports. Having regained the advantage by their rapid building program, on April 27, 1813, Chauncey and Dearborn attacked [[York, Upper Canada|York]], the capital of [[Upper Canada]]. In addition to the sailors, Army forces were stationed at Sackett's Harbor, where they camped out through the town, far surpassing the small population of 900. Officers were housed with families. [[Madison Barracks]] was later built at Sackett's Harbor as a fort on Lake Ontario.\n\nOn May 25, 1813, the American Lake Ontario squadron and Fort Niagara began bombarding [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=37}} An American amphibious force assaulted Fort George on the northern end of the Niagara River on May 27 and captured it without serious losses.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The British also abandoned Fort Erie and headed towards the Burlington Heights.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The British position was on the verge of collapse in Upper Canada; the Iroquois Indians considered changing sides and ignored a British appeal to come to their aid.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The Americans did not pursue the retreating British forces, however, until they had largely escaped and organized a counter-offensive at the [[Battle of Stoney Creek]] on June 5. The British launched a surprise attack at Stoney Creek at 2 a.m., leading to much confused fighting{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} and a strategic British victory.\n\nThe Americans pulled back to Forty Mile Creek rather than continuing their advance into Upper Canada.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} At this point, the Indians living on the Grand River reserve, many from the Six Nations of the Iroquois, began to come out to fight for the British, as an American victory no longer seemed inevitable.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=40}} The Iroquois ambushed an American patrol at Forty Mile Creek, while the Royal Navy squadron based in Kingston sailed in and bombarded the American camp. General Dearborn retreated to Fort George, mistakenly believing that he was outnumbered and outgunned.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=41}} British Brigadier General John Vincent was encouraged by the fact that more and more Indians were now arriving to assist him, providing about 800 additional men.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=41}}\n[[File:Laura Secord warns Fitzgibbons, 1813.jpg|thumb|[[Laura Secord]] providing advance warning to [[James FitzGibbon]], which led to a British-Indian victory at the [[Battle of Beaver Dams]], June 1813]]\nAn American force surrendered on June 24 to a smaller British force due to advance warning by [[Laura Secord]] at the [[Battle of Beaver Dams]], marking the end of the American offensive into Upper Canada.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=41}} British Major General Francis de Rottenberg did not have the strength to retake Fort George, so he instituted a blockade, hoping to starve the Americans into surrender.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=44}} Meanwhile, Commodore [[James Lucas Yeo]] had taken charge of the British ships on the lake and mounted a counterattack, which the Americans repulsed at the [[Battle of Sackett's Harbor]]. Thereafter, Chauncey and Yeo's squadrons fought two indecisive actions, neither commander seeking a fight to the finish.\n\nLate in 1813, the Americans abandoned the Canadian territory that they occupied around Fort George. They set fire to the village of Newark (now [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]]) on December 10, 1813, incensing the Canadians and politicians in control. Many of the inhabitants were left without shelter, freezing to death in the snow. The British retaliated following their [[Capture of Fort Niagara]] on December 18, 1813. The British and their Indian allies stormed the neighbouring town of [[Lewiston, New York]] on December 19, torching homes and killing about a dozen civilians. The British were pursuing the surviving residents when a small force of [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] warriors intervened, buying enough time for the civilians to escape to safer ground.{{sfn|Historic Lewiston, New}}{{sfn|Prohaska|2010}} The British attacked and burned [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] on Lake Erie on December 30, 1813.\n\n====St. Lawrence and Lower Canada, 1813====\nThe British were vulnerable over the stretch of the St. Lawrence between Upper Canada and the United States. Over the winter of 1812\u201313, the Americans launched a series of raids from [[Ogdensburg, New York]] which hampered British supply traffic up the river. On February 21, Sir George Pr\u00e9vost passed through [[Prescott, Ontario]] on the opposite bank of the river with reinforcements for Upper Canada. When he left the next day, the reinforcements and local militia attacked in the [[Battle of Ogdensburg]], and the Americans were forced to retire.\n\n[[File:Battle of Chateauguay.jpg|thumb|In October 1813, a force of Canadian [[Fencibles]], militiamen, and [[Mohawk people|Mohawks]] repelled an American attempt to take Montreal at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay|Chateauguay River.]]]]\n\nThe Americans made two more thrusts against Montreal in 1813.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} The plan eventually agreed upon was for Major General [[Wade Hampton I|Wade Hampton]] to march north from Lake Champlain and join a force under General [[James Wilkinson]] that would embark in boats and sail from Sackett's Harbor on Lake Ontario and descend the St. Lawrence. Hampton was delayed by bad roads and supply problems and also had an intense dislike of Wilkinson, which limited his desire to support his plan. [[Charles de Salaberry]] defeated Hampton's force of 4,000 at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay|Chateauguay River]] on October 25 with a smaller force of [[Canadian Voltigeurs]] and [[Mohawks]]. Salaberry's force of Lower Canada militia and Indians numbered only 339, but had a strong defensive position.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} Wilkinson's force of 8,000 set out on October 17 but was also delayed by bad weather. Wilkinson heard that a British force was pursuing him under Captain [[William Mulcaster]] and Lieutenant Colonel [[Joseph Wanton Morrison]], and he was forced to land near [[Morrisburg, Ontario]] by November 10, about 150 kilometres (90&nbsp;mi) from Montreal. On November 11, his rear guard of 2,500 attacked Morrison's force of 800 at [[Battle of Crysler's Farm|Crysler's Farm]] and was repulsed with heavy losses.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=45}} He learned that Hampton could not renew his advance, retreated to the U.S., and settled into winter quarters. He resigned his command after a failed attack on a British outpost at [[Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814)|Lacolle Mills]].{{sfn|Army and Navy Journal Incorporated|1865|pages=469}}\n\n====Niagara and Plattsburgh Campaigns, 1814====\n[[File:Battle of Lundys Lane.jpg|thumb|left|American infantry prepare to attack during the [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]] in July 1814]]\nThe Americans chose again to invade the Niagara frontier to take Upper Canada. They had occupied southwestern Upper Canada after their victory in Moraviantown, and they believed that taking the rest of the province would force the British to cede it to them. The end of the war in Europe in April 1814 meant that the British could deploy their Army to North America, so the Americans were anxious to secure Upper Canada to negotiate from a position of strength. They planned to invade via the Niagara frontier while sending another force to recapture Mackinac;{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=47}} the British were supplying the Indians in the Old Northwest from Montreal via Mackinac.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=48}} They renewed their attack on the Niagara peninsula and quickly captured [[Fort Erie]] on July 3, 1814, with the garrison quickly surrendering to the Americans.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=49}} General Phineas Riall rushed towards the frontier, unaware of Fort Erie's fall or the size of the American force, and engaged in battle.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=49\u201350}} Winfield Scott then gained a victory over a British force at the [[Battle of Chippawa]] on July 5. The Americans brought out overwhelming firepower against the attacking British, who lost about 600 dead to the 350 dead on the American side. An attempt to advance further ended with a hard-fought but inconclusive [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]] on July 25. Both sides stood their ground; American General Jacob Brown pulled back to Fort George after the battle, and the British did not pursue them.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=51}}\n[[File:British taking of the Northeast Bastion during the night assault on Fort Erie, August 14, 1814.png|thumb|British forces attempted to [[Siege of Fort Erie|storm Fort Erie]] on August 14, 1814 but were repelled by its American defenders.]]\nThe outnumbered Americans withdrew but withstood a prolonged [[Siege of Fort Erie]]. The British tried to storm Fort Erie on August 14, 1814 but suffered heavy losses, losing 950 killed, wounded, and captured compared to only 84 dead and wounded on the American side. The British were further weakened by exposure and shortage of supplies in their siege lines. Eventually they raised the siege, but American Major General [[George Izard]] took over command on the Niagara front and followed up only halfheartedly. An American raid along the Grand River destroyed many farms and weakened British logistics. In October 1814, the Americans advanced into Upper Canada and engaged in skirmishes at Cook's Mill, but they pulled back when they heard that the new British warship HMS ''St. Lawrence'' was on its way, armed with 104 guns and launched in Kingston that September. The Americans lacked provisions and eventually destroyed Fort Erie and retreated across the Niagara.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=52}}\n\nMeanwhile, 15,000 British troops were sent to North America under four of Wellington's ablest brigade commanders after Napoleon abdicated. Fewer than half were veterans of the Peninsula and the rest came from garrisons. Pr\u00e9vost was ordered to neutralize American power on the lakes by burning Sackets Harbor to gain naval control of Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the Upper Lakes, and to defend Lower Canada from attack. He did defend Lower Canada but otherwise failed to achieve his objectives,{{sfn|Grodzinski|2010|pp=560\u2013561}} so he decided to invade New York State. His army outnumbered the American defenders of [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]], but he was worried about his flanks, so he decided that he needed naval control of Lake Champlain. The British squadron on the lake under Captain [[George Downie]] was more evenly matched by the Americans under Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough \n[[File:Battleofpburg.jpg|thumb|Pr\u00e9vost's defeat at Plattsburgh led him to call off the invasion of New York.]]\n[[File:Flag of The Veteran Exempts of Battle of Plattsburgh.svg|thumb|Flag Flown at the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]]]\nUpon reaching Plattsburgh, Pr\u00e9vost delayed the assault until Downie arrived in the hastily completed 36-gun frigate {{HMS|Confiance|1814|6}}. Pr\u00e9vost forced Downie into a premature attack but then unaccountably failed to provide the promised military backing. Downie was killed and his naval force defeated at the naval Battle of Plattsburgh in Plattsburgh Bay on September 11, 1814. The Americans now had control of Lake Champlain; [[Theodore Roosevelt]] later termed it \"the greatest naval battle of the war\".{{sfn|Roosevelt|1902 |p=[https://archive.org/stream/navalwarorhisto00roosgoog#page/n120/mode/1up 108]}} General [[Alexander Macomb (general)|Alexander Macomb]] led the successful land defence. Pr\u00e9vost then turned back, to the astonishment of his senior officers, saying that it was too hazardous to remain on enemy territory after the loss of naval supremacy. He was recalled to London where a naval court-martial decided that defeat had been caused principally by Pr\u00e9vost urging the squadron into premature action and then failing to afford the promised support from the land forces. He died suddenly, just before his court-martial was to convene. His reputation sank to a new low, as Canadians claimed that their militia under Brock did the job but Pr\u00e9vost failed. Recent historians have been more kindly, however. Burroughs argues that his preparations were energetic, well-conceived, and comprehensive for defending the Canadas with limited means, and he achieved the primary objective of preventing an American conquest.{{sfn|Burroughs|1983}}\n\n[[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Hardy]] invaded the northern part of [[Massachusetts]] (Maine) on July 11 and took Fort Sullivan at [[Eastport, Maine|Eastport]].

[[Fort Belle Fontaine]] was an old trading post converted to an Army post in 1804, and this served as regional headquarters.

[[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]] played a leadership role.{{sfn|Cole | 1921|pp= 69\u201374.}}\n\nLittle of note took place on Lake Huron in 1813, but the American victory on Lake Erie and the recapture of Detroit isolated the British there. During the ensuing winter, a Canadian party under Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert McDouall]] established a new supply line from York to [[Nottawasaga Bay]] on [[Georgian Bay]]. He arrived at Fort Mackinac with supplies and reinforcements, then sent an expedition to recapture the trading post of [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]] in the far west. The [[Siege of Prairie du Chien]] ended in a British victory on July 20, 1814.\n\nEarlier in July, the Americans sent a force of five vessels from Detroit to recapture Mackinac. A mixed force of regulars and volunteers from the militia landed on the island on August 4. They did not attempt to achieve surprise, and Indians ambushed them in the brief [[Battle of Mackinac Island (1814)|Battle of Mackinac Island]] and forced them to re-embark. The Americans discovered the new base at Nottawasaga Bay, and they destroyed its fortifications on August 13 along with the schooner [[Nancy (1789 ship)|''Nancy'']] that they found there. They then returned to Detroit, leaving two gunboats to blockade Mackinac. On September 4, the gunboats were taken unawares and captured by British boarding parties from canoes and small boats. These [[Engagements on Lake Huron]] left Mackinac under British control.\n\nThe British garrison at Prairie du Chien also fought off another attack by Major [[Zachary Taylor]]. American troops retreating from the [[Battle of Credit Island]] on the upper Mississippi attempted to make a stand at [[Fort Johnson]], but they soon abandoned the fort and most of the upper Mississippi valley.{{sfn|Nolan|2009|pp=85\u201394}} In this distant theater, the British retained the upper hand until the end of the war through the allegiance of several Indian tribes that received British gifts and arms, enabling them to take control of parts of Michigan and Illinois and the whole of Wisconsin.{{sfn|Concise Historical Atlas|1998|p=85}}\n\nAmerican forces were driven from the Upper Mississippi region, but they held on to eastern Missouri and the St. Louis area.

Most of these were involved in blockading the French navy and protecting British trade against French privateers, but the Royal Navy still had 85 vessels in American waters, counting all North American and Caribbean waters.{{efn|Admiralty reply to British press criticism{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=180}})}} However, the Royal Navy's American squadron based in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] numbered one small [[ship of the line]], seven [[frigate]]s, nine smaller [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] and [[brig]]s, and five [[schooner]]s.{{sfn|Gwyn|2003|p=134}} By contrast, the United States Navy was composed of 8 frigates, 14 smaller sloops and brigs, and no ships of the line. The U.S. had embarked on a major shipbuilding program before the war at [[Sackets Harbor, New York]] and continued to produce new ships. Three of the existing American frigates were exceptionally large and powerful for their class, larger than any British frigate in America. The standard British frigate of the time was rated as a 38 gun ship, usually carrying up to 50 guns, with its main battery consisting of 18-pounder. USS ''Constitution'', ''President'', and ''United States'', in comparison, were rated as 44-gun ships, carrying 56\u201360 guns with a main battery of 24-pounders.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=50}}\n\nThe British strategy was to protect their own merchant shipping between Halifax and the West Indies, and to enforce a blockade of major American ports to restrict American trade. Because of their numerical inferiority, the American strategy was to cause disruption through hit-and-run tactics, such as the capturing prizes and engaging Royal Navy vessels only under favourable circumstances. Days after the formal declaration of war, however, America put out two small squadrons, including the frigate ''President'' and the sloop {{USS|Hornet|1805|2}} under Commodore [[John Rodgers (1772\u20131838)|John Rodgers]], and the frigates ''United States'' and {{USS|Congress|1799|2}}, with the brig {{USS|Argus|1803|2}} under Captain [[Stephen Decatur]]. These were initially concentrated as one unit under Rodgers, who intended to force the Royal Navy to concentrate its own ships to prevent isolated units being captured by his powerful force.\n\nLarge numbers of American merchant ships were returning to the United States with the outbreak of war, and the Royal Navy could not watch all the ports on the American seaboard if they were concentrated together. Rodgers' strategy worked, in that the Royal Navy concentrated most of its frigates off [[New York Harbor]] under Captain [[Philip Broke]], allowing many American ships to reach home. But Rodgers' own cruise captured only five small merchant ships, and the Americans never subsequently concentrated more than two or three ships together as a unit.{{sfn|Black|2008}}\n\n====Single-ship actions====\nBoth American and British naval honour had been challenged in the lead-up to the war. The [[Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair]] had left the United States insulted by the Royal Navy's impressment of sailors, and the appropriate method for the American Navy to redeem itself was by duelling. Similarly, British honour was challenged in the ''Little Belt'' affair where the United States frigate {{USS|President|1800|2}} fired on the British sloop {{HMS|Little Belt}} because ''President'' mistook ''Little Belt'' for the British frigate {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}}. Captain James Dacres of ''Guerriere'' began a cycle of frigate duels by challenging ''President'' to a single ship duel to avenge the losses aboard ''Little Belt''. Commodore [[John Rodgers (1772\u20131838)|John Rodgers]] of ''President'' declined the challenge because he feared that the rest of the British squadron under Commodore [[Philip Broke]] might intervene.{{sfn| Toll| 2006}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} {{sfn|James| 1817}}\n[[File:USS Constitution vs Guerriere.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Constitution}} defeats {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}} in a [[USS Constitution vs HMS Guerriere|single-ship engagement]].

On July 17, Commodore Broke's British squadron gave chase off New York, including ''Guerriere'', but ''Constitution'' evaded her pursuers after two days. Borke detached ''Guerriere'' from his squadron to seek out repairs, as she had weak scantlings (beams fastened with a thickened clamp rather than vertical and horizontal knees){{sfn|Gardiner|2000}} and had become leaky and rotten.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James|1817}} She had also been struck by lightning, severely damaging her masts.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} Captain Dacres was eager to engage the American frigate and to redeem British honour, as ''Constitution'' was the sister ship of ''President'' and would serve equally well as an American ship to duel. ''Constitution'' had nearly 50 percent more men, more firepower, heavier tonnage, and heavier scantlings (which determine how much damage enemy shot does to a ship) than ''Guerriere''.\n\n''Constitution'' sighted ''Guerriere'' 400 miles off the coast of Nova Scotia on August 19, and the two ships engaged in [[USS Constitution vs HMS Guerriere|a 35-minute battle]].

The British [[Capture of USS Chesapeake|capture of ''Chesapeake'']] was one of the bloodiest contests in the age of sail.|alt=Sailors in combat on the deck of a ship]]\nCommodore Philip Broke had lost ''Guerriere'' to ''Constitution'' from his very own squadron. He knew that Dacres of ''Guerriere'' intended to duel the American frigate to avenge the losses on ''Little Belt'' caused by USS ''President'' in 1811. Since, ''Constitution'' had taken ''Guerriere'', Broke intended to redeem Dacres' honour by taking ''Constitution'', which was undergoing repairs in Boston in early 1813. Broke found that ''Constitution'' was not ready for sea. Instead, he decided to challenge {{USS|Chesapeake|1799|2}} as Broke was short on water and provisions and could not wait for ''Constitution''.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} Captain [[James Lawrence]] of ''Chesapeake'' was misguided by propaganda intended to boost American morale (and successfully did) that claimed that the three frigate duels of 1812 were of equal force leading Lawrence to believe taking Broke's {{HMS|Shannon|1806|3}} would be easy.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James| 1817}} Lawrence even went to the extent of preemptively arranging for a banquet to be held for his victorious crew.{{sfn|James |1817}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|Roosevelt|1882}}{{sfn|Toll |2006}} Broke, on the other hand, had spent years training his crew and developing artillery innovations on his ship, making ''Shannon'' particularly well prepared for battle.{{sfn|James |1817}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|Roosevelt|1882}}{{sfn|Toll |2006}} On June 1, 1813, ''Shannon'' took ''Chesapeake'' in [[Capture of USS Chesapeake|a battle]] that lasted less than fifteen minutes in [[Boston Harbor]].

Don't give up the ship!\"{{sfn|Roosevelt|1882}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James| 1817}}{{sfn|Toll |2006}} The two frigates were of near-identical armament and length. ''Chesapeake''{{'}}s crew was larger, had greater tonnage and was of greater scantling strength (which led to the British claiming she was overbuilt{{sfn|Gardiner |2000}}{{Verify source|date=February 2019}}), but many of her crew had not served or trained together. ''Shannon'' had been at sea for a long time, and her hull had begun to rot, further exaggerating the disparity in scantling strength.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} Nevertheless, this engagement proved to the only single-ship action where both ships were of essentially equal force during the War of 1812. British citizens reacted with celebration and relief that the run of American victories had ended.{{sfn|Forester|1970|pp=131\u2013132}} Notably, this action was by ratio one of the bloodiest contests recorded during this age of sail due to the close-range engagement, the boarding (hand-to-hand combat) and Broke's philosophy of artillery being \"Kill the men and the ship is yours\", with more dead and wounded than HMS ''Victory'' suffered in four hours of combat at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]. Captain Lawrence was killed, and Captain Broke was so badly wounded that he never again held a sea command.{{sfn|Gardiner|1996|p=61}} The Americans then did as the British had done in 1812 and banned single-ship duels after this engagement.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1882}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}\n[[File:George-ropes-battle-of-valparaiso.png|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Valpara\u00edso]] ended the American naval threat to British interests in the south [[Pacific Ocean]].]]\nIn January 1813, the American frigate {{USS|Essex|1799|2}}, under the command of Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]], sailed into the Pacific to harass British shipping. Many British whaling ships carried [[letters of marque]] allowing them to prey on American whalers, and they nearly destroyed the industry. ''Essex'' challenged this practice. She inflicted considerable damage on British interests.\n''Essex'' consort {{USS|Essex Junior}} (armed with twenty guns) were [[Battle of Valpara\u00edso|captured]] off [[Valpara\u00edso]], [[Chile]], by the British frigate {{HMS|Phoebe|1795|6}} and the sloop {{HMS|Cherub|1806|6}} on March 28, 1814 in what statistically appeared to be a battle of equal force as ''Essex'' and ''Phoebe'' were of similar tonnage, scantling, and broadside weight as well as ''Cherub'' and ''Essex Junior'' (with the exception of scantling, which ''Essex Junior'' was much more lightly built than ''Cherub)''.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}} Once again the Americans had more men. Nevertheless, ''Phoebe'' was armed with long guns which none of the other ships engaged had. Furthermore, Captain Hillyar had used Phillip Broke's methods of artillery on ''Phoebe'' and ''Cherub'' with tangent and dispart sights.{{sfn|Voelcker 2013}}{{Verify source|date=February 2019}} This gave the British ships a significant advantage at the range at which the battle was fought.

Unlike the previous engagements, ''President'' was not taken in a duel. Following the both Royal Navy's requirements, ''President'' was pursued by a squadron consisting of four frigates, one being a 56-gun razee. ''President'' was an extremely fast ship and successfully outsailed the fast British squadron with the exception of {{HMS|Endymion|1797|6}} which has been regarded as the fastest ship in the age of fighting sail.{{sfn|Gardiner |2000}}{{Verify source|date=February 2019}} Captain Henry Hope of ''Endymion'' had fitted his ship with Phillip Broke's technology as Captain Hillyar had done on ''Phoebe''. This gave him the slight advantage at range and slowed ''President''. Commodore Decatur on ''President'' had the advantage in scantling strength, firepower, crew, and tonnage, but not in maneuverability. Despite having fewer guns, ''Endymion'' was armed with 24-pounders just like ''President''. This meant that ''Endymion'' shot could pierce the hull of ''President'' unlike ''Guerriere''{{'}}s which bounced of ''Constitution''{{'}}s hull or ''Java''{{'}}s that failed to cut through ''Constitution''{{'}}s mast. Following Broke's philosophy of \"Kill the man and the ship is your's\", ''Endymion'' fired into ''President''{{'}}s hull severely damaging her (shot holes below the waterline, 10/15 starboard guns on the gundeck disabled, water in the hold, and shot from ''Endymion'' found inside ''President''{{'}}s [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|magazine]].{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}). Decatur knew his only hope was to dismantle ''Endymion'' and sail away from the rest of the squadron. When he failed, he surrendered his ship to \"the captain of the black frigate (''Endymion'')\". Decatur took advantage of the fact ''Endymion'' had no boats that were intact and attempted to sneak away under the cover of night, only to be caught up by HMS ''Pomone''. Decatur surrendered without a fight.{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}{{sfn|James |1817}} Decatur had surrendered the United States finest frigate and flagship ''President'' to a smaller ship, but part of a squadron of greater force.\n\nDecatur gave unreliable accounts of the battle stating that ''President'' was already \"severely damaged\" by a grounding before the engagement, but undamaged after the engagement with ''Endymion''. He stated ''Pomone'' caused \"significant\" losses aboard ''President'', although ''President''{{'}}s crew claim they were below deck gathering their belongings as they had already surrendered. Despite saying \"I surrender my ship to the captain of the black frigate\", Decatur also writes that he said, \"I surrender to the squadron\". Nevertheless, many historians such as Ian Toll, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[William James (naval historian)|William James]] quote Decatur's remarks to either enforce that ''Endymion'' alone took ''President'' or that ''President'' surrendered to the whole squadron, when actually it was something in-between.{{sfn|James |1817}}{{sfn|Roosevelt|1882}}{{sfn|Toll |2006}}{{sfn|Lambert|2012}}\n\nSuccess in single ship battles raised American morale after the repeated failed invasion attempts in Upper and Lower Canada. However, these victories had no military effect on the war at sea as they did not alter the balance of naval power, impede British supplies and reinforcements, or even raise insurance rates for British trade.{{sfn|Lambert|2012|p=102}} During the war, the United States Navy captured 165 British merchantmen (although privateers captured many more), while the Royal Navy captured 1,400 American merchantmen.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} More significantly, the British blockade of the Atlantic coast caused the majority warships to be unable to put to sea and shut down American imports and exports..\n\n====Privateering====\n[[File:Clipper Built Privateer Schooner.gif|thumb|[[Baltimore Clipper]]s were a series of schooners used by American [[privateers]] during the war.]]\nThe operations of American privateers proved a more significant threat to British trade than the U.S. Navy. They operated throughout the Atlantic and continued until the close of the war, most notably from ports such as [[Baltimore]]. American privateers reported taking 1300 British merchant vessels, compared to 254 taken by the U.S. Navy,{{sfn|American Merchant Marine}}{{sfn|Franklin}}{{sfn|Brewer |2004}} although the insurer [[Lloyd's of London]] reported that only 1,175 British ships were taken, 373 of which were recaptured, for a total loss of 802.{{sfn|Latimer|2007 |p= 242}} The Canadian historian Carl Benn wrote that American privateers took 1,344 British ships, of which 750 were retaken by the British.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} However the British were able to limit privateering losses by the strict enforcement of [[convoy]] by the Royal Navy and by capturing 278 American privateers. Due to the massive size of the British merchant fleet, American captures only affected 7.5% of the fleet, resulting in no supply shortages or lack of reinforcements for British forces in North America.{{sfn|Lambert|2012|pp=394\u2013395}} Of 526 American privateers, 148 were captured by the Royal Navy and only 207 ever took a prize.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}}\n\nDue to the large size of their navy, the British did not rely as much on privateering. The majority of the 1,407 captured American merchant ships were taken by the Royal Navy. The war was the last time the British allowed privateering, since the practice was coming to be seen as politically inexpedient and of diminishing value in maintaining its naval supremacy. However privateering remained popular in British colonies. It was the last hurrah for privateers in [[Bermuda]] who vigorously returned to the practice after experience in previous wars.{{sfn|Strannack|1909|p={{page needed|date=June 2013}}}} The nimble [[Bermuda sloop]]s captured 298 American ships. Privateer schooners based in [[British North America]], especially from [[Nova Scotia]] took 250 American ships and proved especially effective in crippling American coastal trade and capturing American ships closer to shore than the Royal Navy cruisers.{{sfn|Faye|1997|p=171}}\n\n====Blockade====\n[[File:Principal Campaigns of the War of 1812.gif|left|thumb|A map of the American coastline. British naval strategy was to protect their shipping in North America, and enforce a naval blockade on the U.S.]]\nThe [[Blockade|naval blockade]] of the United States began informally in 1812 and expanded to cut off more ports as the war progressed.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} Twenty ships were on station in 1812 and 135 were in place by the end of the conflict.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} In March 1813, the Royal Navy punished the Southern states, who were most vocal about annexing British North America, by blockading Charleston, Port Royal, Savannah and New York City as well.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} However, as additional ships were sent to North America in 1813, the Royal Navy was able to tighten the blockade and extend it, first to the coast south of [[Narragansett, Rhode Island|Narragansett]] by November 1813 and to the entire American coast on May 31, 1814.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} In May 1814, following the abdication of Napoleon, and the end of the supply problems with Wellington's army, New England was blockaded.{{sfn| Grodzinski}}\n\nThe British government, having need of American foodstuffs for its army in Spain, benefited from the willingness of the New Englanders to trade with them, so no blockade of New England was at first attempted.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=55}} The [[Delaware River]] and Chesapeake Bay were declared in a state of blockade on December 26, 1812. Illicit trade was carried on by collusive captures arranged between American traders and British officers. American ships were fraudulently transferred to neutral flags. Eventually, the U.S. government was driven to issue orders to stop illicit trading; this put only a further strain on the commerce of the country. The overpowering strength of the British fleet enabled it to occupy the Chesapeake and to attack and destroy numerous docks and harbours.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=849}}\n\nThe blockade of American ports later tightened to the extent that most American merchant ships and naval vessels were confined to port. The American frigates {{USS|United States}} and {{USS|Macedonian}} ended the war blockaded and [[hulk (ship type)|hulked]] in [[New London, Connecticut]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=55\u201356}} USS ''United States'' and USS ''Macedonian'' attempted to set sail to raid British shipping in the Caribbean, but were forced to turn back when confronted with a British squadron, and by the end of the war, the United States had six frigates and four ships-of-the-line sitting in port.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=56}} Some merchant ships were based in Europe or Asia and continued operations. Others, mainly from New England, were issued licences to trade by Admiral Sir [[John Borlase Warren]], commander in chief on the American station in 1813. This allowed Wellington's army in Spain to receive American goods and to maintain the New Englanders' [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|opposition to the war]]. The blockade nevertheless resulted in American exports decreasing from $130&nbsp;million in 1807 to $7&nbsp;million in 1814. Most of these were food exports that ironically went to supply their enemies in Britain or British colonies.{{sfn|Leckie|1998|p=255}} The blockade had a devastating effect on the American economy with the value of American exports and imports falling from $114 million in 1811 down to $20 million by 1814 while the US Customs took in $13 million in 1811 and $6 million in 1814, despite the fact that Congress had voted to double the rates.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=56\u201357}} The British blockade further damaged the American economy by forcing merchants to abandon the cheap and fast coastal trade to the slow and more expensive inland roads.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}} In 1814, only 1 out of 14 American merchantmen risked leaving port as a high probability that any ship leaving port would be seized.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}}<ref>\"War of 1812.\" in ''Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History,'' edited by Thomas Riggs, (2nd ed., vol. 3, Gale, 2015), pp. 1446-1449.

The blockading British fleet in [[Chesapeake Bay]] received increasing numbers of enslaved black Americans during 1813. By British government order they were treated as free persons when reaching British hands.{{sfn|Weiss|2013}}{{sfn|Malcomson |2012|p= 366}} Alexander Cochrane's [[Black Refugee (War of 1812)|proclamation of April 2, 1814]], invited Americans who wished to emigrate to join the British, and though not explicitly mentioning slaves was taken by all as addressed to them. About 2,400 of the escaped slaves and their families who were carried on ships of the Royal Navy following their escape settled in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] during and after the war. From May 1814, younger men among the volunteers were recruited into a new [[Corps of Colonial Marines]]. They fought for Britain throughout the Atlantic campaign, including the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] and the attacks on Washington, D.C. and Battle of Baltimore, later settling in Trinidad after rejecting British government orders for transfer to the [[West India Regiments]], forming the community of the [[Merikins]]. The slaves who escaped to the British represented the largest emancipation of African Americans before the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Black Sailors Soldiers|2012}}\n\n====Occupation of Maine====\nMaine, then part of Massachusetts, was a base for smuggling and illegal trade between the U.S. and the British. Until 1813 the region was generally quiet except for privateer actions near the coast. In September 1813, there was a notable naval action when the U.S. Navy's brig {{USS|Enterprise|1799|2}} [[Capture of HMS Boxer|fought and captured]] the Royal Navy brig {{HMS|Boxer|1812|2}} off Pemaquid Point.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=75\u201391}} The first British assault came in July 1814, when Sir [[Thomas Masterman Hardy]] took Moose Island ([[Eastport, Maine]]) without a shot, with the entire American garrison of [[Fort Sullivan (Maine)|Fort Sullivan]]\u2014which became the British Fort Sherbrooke\u2014surrendering.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=81\u201394}} Next, from his base in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], in September 1814, Sir [[John Coape Sherbrooke]] led 3,000 British troops in the \"Penobscot Expedition\". In 26 days, he raided and looted [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]], [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], and [[Machias, Maine|Machias]], destroying or capturing 17 American ships. He won the [[Battle of Hampden]] (losing two killed while the Americans lost one killed). Retreating American forces were forced to destroy the frigate {{USS|Adams|1799|2}}. The British occupied the town of [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] and most of eastern Maine for the rest of the war, re-establishing the colony of [[New Ireland (Maine)|New Ireland]]. The Treaty of Ghent returned this territory to the United States, though [[Machias Seal Island]] has remained in dispute. The British left in April 1815, at which time they took \u00a310,750 obtained from tariff duties at Castine. This money, called the \"Castine Fund\", was used to establish [[Dalhousie University]], in Halifax, Nova Scotia.{{sfn|Harvey|1938|pp=207\u2013213}}\n\n===={{anchor|Chesapeake Campaign|Expedition to the Chesapeake}}Chesapeake campaign and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"====\nThe strategic location of the Chesapeake Bay near America's new national capital, Washington, D.C. on the major tributary of the [[Potomac River]], made it a prime target for the British. Starting in March 1813, a squadron under Rear Admiral [[George Cockburn]] started a blockade of the mouth of the Bay at [[Hampton Roads]] harbour and raided towns along the Bay from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], to [[Raid on Havre de Grace|Havre de Grace, Maryland]].\n[[File:British Burning Washington.jpg|thumb|left|Following their victory at the [[Battle of Bladensburg]], the British entered Washington, D.C., [[Burning of Washington|burning down buildings]] including the [[White House]].]]\nOn July 4, 1813, Commodore [[Joshua Barney]], a Revolutionary War naval hero, convinced the Navy Department to build the [[Chesapeake Bay Flotilla]], a squadron of twenty barges powered by small sails or oars (sweeps) to defend the Chesapeake Bay. Launched in April 1814, the squadron was quickly cornered in the [[Patuxent River]], and while successful in harassing the Royal Navy, they were powerless to stop the British campaign that ultimately led to the \"[[Burning of Washington]]\". This expedition, led by Cockburn and General [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]], was carried out between August 19 and 29, 1814, as the result of the hardened British policy of 1814. As part of this, Admiral Warren had been replaced as commander in chief by Admiral Alexander Cochrane, with reinforcements and orders to coerce the Americans into a favourable peace.\n\nA force of 2,500 soldiers under General Ross had just arrived in Bermuda aboard {{HMS|Royal Oak|1809|6}}, three frigates, three sloops and ten other vessels. Released from the [[Peninsular War]] by victory, the British intended to use them for diversionary raids along the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. In response to Pr\u00e9vost's request, they decided to employ this force, together with the naval and military units already on the station, to strike at the national capital.\n\nOn August 24, U.S. Secretary of War [[John Armstrong Jr]]. insisted that the British were going to attack Baltimore rather than Washington, even when British army and naval units were obviously on their way to Washington. The inexperienced state militia was easily routed in the Battle of Bladensburg, opening the route to Washington. While First Lady [[Dolley Madison]] saved valuables from what is now the \"[[White House]]\", senior officials fled to Virginia. {{sfn|Defense Burning of}} Secretary of the Navy [[William Jones (statesman)|William Jones]] ordered setting fire to the [[Washington Navy Yard]] to prevent the capture of supplies.{{sfn|Herrick|2005|page=90}} The nation's public buildings were destroyed by the British (and by a furious thunderstorm that ruined a great deal of property, although it did quench the flames).

Watching the bombardment from a truce ship, [[Francis Scott Key]] was inspired to write the four-stanza poem that later became, ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]''.]]\nThe British moved on to their major target, the heavily fortified major city of Baltimore. They delayed their movement allowing Baltimore an opportunity to strengthen the fortifications and bring in new federal troops and state militia units. The \"[[Battle of Baltimore|Battle for Baltimore]]\" began with the British landing on September 12, 1814, at [[Fort Howard (Maryland)|North Point]], where they were met by American militia further up the \"Patapsco Neck\" peninsula. An exchange of fire began, with casualties on both sides. The British Army commander Major Gen. [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]] was killed by snipers. The British paused, then continued to march northwestward to face the stationed Maryland and Baltimore City militia units at \"Godly Wood.\" The [[Battle of North Point]] was fought for several afternoon hours in a musketry and artillery duel. The British also planned to simultaneously attack Baltimore by water on the following day, September 13, to support their military facing the massed, heavily dug-in and fortified American units of approximately 15,000 with about a hundred cannon gathered along the eastern heights of the city named \"Loudenschlager's Hill\" (later \"Hampstead Hill\" \u2013 now part of [[Patterson Park]]). The Baltimore defences had been planned in advance and overseen by the state militia commander, Maj. Gen. [[Samuel Smith (Maryland)|Samuel Smith]]. The Royal Navy was unable to reduce [[Fort McHenry]] at the entrance to Baltimore Harbor in support of an attack from the northeast by the British Army.\n\nThe British naval guns, mortars and new \"[[Congreve rockets]]\" had a longer range than the American cannon onshore. The ships mostly stood out of range of the Americans, who returned very little fire. The fort was not heavily damaged except for a burst over a rear brick wall knocking out some field pieces but with few casualties. The British eventually realized that they could not force the passage to attack Baltimore in coordination with the land force. A last ditch night feint and barge attack during a heavy rain storm was led by Capt. [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]] around the fort up the Middle Branch of the river to the west. Split and misdirected partly in the storm, it turned back after suffering heavy casualties from the alert gunners of [[Fort Covington]] and [[Battery Babcock]]. The British called off the attack and sailed downriver to pick up their army, which had retreated from the east side of Baltimore. All the lights were extinguished in Baltimore the night of the attack, and the fort was bombarded for 25 hours. The only light was given off by the exploding shells over Fort McHenry, illuminating the flag that was still flying over the fort. The defence of the fort inspired the American lawyer [[Francis Scott Key]] to write \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\", a poem that was later set to music as \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\".{{sfn|Coleman|2015|pp=599\u2013629}}\n\n===Southern theater===\nBecause of the region's polyglot population, both the British and the Americans perceived the war in the Gulf South as a fundamentally different conflict from the one occurring in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] and Chesapeake.{{sfn|Millett|2013}}{{rp|31}}\n\n====Creek War====\n{{Main|Creek War}}\nBefore 1813, the war between the Creeks (or [[Muscogee]]) had been largely an internal affair sparked by the ideas of Tecumseh farther north in the Mississippi Valley. A faction known as the [[Red Sticks]], so named for the colour of their war stics, had broken away from the rest of the Creek Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. The Red Sticks were allied with Tecumseh, who about a year before 1813 had visited the Creeks and encouraged greater resistance to the Americans.{{sfn|Wilentz|2005|pp=23\u201325}} The Creek Nation was a trading partner of the United States, actively involved with Spanish and British trade as well. The Red Sticks, as well as many southern Muscogeean people like the [[Seminole]], had a long history of alliance with the Spanish and British Empires.{{sfn|Braund | 1993}} This alliance helped the North American and European powers protect each other's claims to territory in the south.{{sfn|Hurt |2002}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Burnt Corn]], between [[Red Sticks]] and U.S. troops, occurred in the southern parts of Alabama on July 27, 1813. It prompted the state of Georgia as well as the Mississippi territory militia to immediately take major action against Creek offensives. The Red Sticks chiefs gained power in the east along the [[Alabama River|Alabama]], [[Coosa River|Coosa]], and [[Tallapoosa River]]s \u2013 Upper Creek territory. The Lower Creek lived along the [[Chattahoochee River]]. Many Creeks tried to remain friendly to the United States, and some were organized by federal Indian Agent [[Benjamin Hawkins]] to aid the 6th Military District under [[Thomas Pinckney|General Thomas Pinckney]] and the state militias. The United States combined forces were large. At its peak the Red Stick faction had 4,000 warriors, only a quarter of whom had muskets.{{sfn|Adams|1918|p=785}}\n[[File:Fort Mims massacre 1813.jpg|thumb|left|In 1813, Creek warriors [[Fort Mims massacre|attacked Fort Mims]], and killed a total of 400 to 500 people.

The army, led by [[John Floyd (Georgia politician)|General John Floyd]], went to the heart of the \"Creek Holy Grounds\" and won a major offensive against one of the largest Creek towns at [[Battle of Autosee]], killing an estimated two hundred people.

The main focus on British foreign policy was the Congress of Vienna, during which British diplomats had clashed with Russian and Prussian diplomats over the terms of the peace with France, and there were fears that Britain might have go to war with Russia and Prussia. Now each side was tired of the war. Export trade was all but paralyzed and after Napoleon fell in 1814 France was no longer an enemy of Britain, so the Royal Navy no longer needed to stop American shipments to France, and it no longer needed to impress more seamen. It had ended the practices that so angered the Americans in 1812. The British were preoccupied in rebuilding Europe after the apparent final defeat of Napoleon.{{sfn|Mahan|1905}}\n\nBritish negotiators were urged by Lord Liverpool to offer a ''status quo'' and dropped their demands for the creation of an Indian barrier state, which was in any case hopeless after the collapse of Tecumseh's alliance. This allowed negotiations to resume at the end of October. British diplomats soon offered the ''status quo'' to the U.S. negotiators, who accepted them. Prisoners were to be exchanged and captured slaves returned to the United States or paid for by Britain. At this point, the number of slaves was approximately 6,000. Britain eventually refused the demand, allowing many to either emigrate to Canada or Trinidad.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nOn December 24, 1814 the diplomats had finished and signed the Treaty of Ghent. The treaty was ratified by the British three days later on December 27{{sfnm|1a1=Hickey|1y=2006|1p=295|2a1=Updyke|2y=1915|2p=360|3a1=Perkins|3y=1964|3pp=129\u2013130}} and arrived in Washington on February 17, where it was quickly ratified and went into effect, thus finally ending the war. The terms called for all occupied territory to be returned, the prewar boundary between Canada and the United States to be restored, and the Americans were to gain fishing rights in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]].\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent failed to secure official British acknowledgement of American maritime rights or ending impressment. However, in the century of peace until World War I these rights were not seriously violated. The defeat of Napoleon made irrelevant all of the naval issues over which the United States had fought. The Americans had achieved their goal of ending the Indian threat; furthermore the American armies had scored enough victories (especially at New Orleans) to satisfy honour and the sense of becoming fully independent from Britain.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=208\u20139}}\n\n==Losses and compensation==\n{|align=right class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"F1F1F1\"\n|-\n|colspan=4 style=\"text-align: center;\" |'''''Casualties in the War of 1812'''''\n|-\n!

The Treaty of Ghent established the ''status quo ante bellum''; that is, there were no territorial losses by either side. The issue of impressment was made moot when the Royal Navy, no longer needing sailors, stopped impressment after the defeat of Napoleon in spring 1814 ended the war. (Napoleon unexpectedly returned in 1815, after the final end of the war of 1812.)\n\nThe long-term results of the war were generally satisfactory to both sides. Except for occasional border disputes and some tensions during the [[American Civil War]], relations between the U.S. and Britain remained peaceful for the rest of the 19th century, and the two countries became [[Special Relationship|close allies]] in the 20th century. Historian Troy Bickham argues that each participant defined success in a different way. The new American Republic could claim victory in the sense that its independence from London was assured, and the Indian barrier to Westward expansion was removed. The memory of the conflict played a major role in helping to consolidate a Canadian national identity after 1867. The British retained Canada, but their attention was overwhelmingly devoted to celebrating the defeat of Napoleon. The general consensus is that the Native Americans were the big losers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Troy Bickham|title=The Weight of Vengeance: The United States, the British Empire, and the War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QM755oY5k98C&pg=PT262|year=2012|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=262\u201380|isbn=9780199942626}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]] between the United States and Britain was enacted in 1817. It demilitarized the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, where many British naval arrangements and forts still remained. The treaty laid the basis for a demilitarized boundary. It remains in effect to this day.\n\nAlthough Britain had defeated the American invasions of Canada, its own invasions were defeated in Maryland, New York and Louisiana. After two decades of intense warfare against France, Britain was in no mood to have more conflicts with the United States. Instead it focused on expanding the British Empire into India. Britain never seriously challenged the US over land claims after 1846: it had hoped to keep Texas Independent from the United States and had some hopes of taking California from Mexico. From the 1890s, as the United States emerged as the world's leading industrial power, Britain wanted American friendship in a hypothetical European war. Border adjustments between the U.S. and British North America were made in the [[Treaty of 1818]]. [[Eastport, Maine|Eastport]], Massachusetts, was returned to the U.S. in 1818; [[Missouri Compromise|it became part]] of the new State of [[Maine]] in 1820. A border dispute along the Maine\u2013New Brunswick border was settled by the 1842 [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]] after the bloodless [[Aroostook War]], and the border in the [[Oregon Country]] was settled by splitting the disputed area in half by the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]]. A further dispute about the line of the border through the island in the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] resulted in another almost bloodless standoff in the [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]] of 1859. The line of the border was finally settled by an international arbitration commission in 1872.\n\n===Bermuda===\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=March 2020}}\nBermuda had been largely left to the defences of its own militia and privateers before U.S. independence, but the Royal Navy had begun buying up land and operating from there in 1795, as its location was a useful substitute for the lost U.S. ports. It originally was intended to be the winter headquarters of the North American Squadron, but the war saw it rise to a new prominence. As construction work progressed through the first half of the 19th century, Bermuda became the permanent naval headquarters in Western waters, housing the Admiralty and serving as a base and dockyard. The military garrison was built up to protect the naval establishment, heavily fortifying the archipelago that came to be described as the \"Gibraltar of the West\". Defence infrastructure remained the central leg of Bermuda's economy until after World War II.\n\n===The Canadas===\n[[File:Fort Henry, Kingston.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Henry National Historic Site|Fort Henry]] at Kingston in 1836.

In the decades following the war, several projects were undertaken to improve the defence of the colonies against the United States. They include work on [[La Citadelle]] at [[Quebec City]], [[Fort Henry National Historic Site|Fort Henry]] at Kingston, and rebuilding [[Fort York]] at York. Additionally, work began on the [[Halifax Citadel]] to defend the port against foreign navies. From 1826 to 1832, the Rideau Canal was built to provide a secure waterway not at risk from American cannon fire. To defend the western end of the canal, the British Army also built [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] at Kingston.{{sfn|Hayes|2008|p=117}}\n\n===Indigenous nations===\nThe Native Americans allied to the British lost their cause. The British proposal to create a \"neutral\" Indian zone in the American West was rejected at the Ghent peace conference and never resurfaced. After 1814 the natives, who lost most of their fur-gathering territory, became an undesirable burden to British policymakers. The latter now looked to the United States for markets and raw materials.{{sfn|Calloway|1986|pp=1\u201320}} The United States further disrupted trade along the northern border by prohibiting British fur traders from operating in the US, whereas before the war, both populations had freely moved back and forth across the border.\n\nBritish agents in the field continued to meet regularly with their former American Indian partners, but they did not supply arms or encouragement and there were no American Indian campaigns to stop U.S. expansionism in the Midwest. Abandoned by their powerful sponsor, American Great Lakes\u2013area Indians ultimately migrated or reached accommodations with the American authorities and settlers.{{sfn|Calloway|1986|pp=1\u201320}}\n\n===Great Britain===\nThe war is seldom remembered in Great Britain. The massive ongoing conflict in Europe against the French Empire under [[Napoleon]] ensured that the British did not consider the War of 1812 against America as more than a sideshow.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=304}} Britain's blockade of French trade had been entirely successful, and the Royal Navy was the world's dominant nautical power (and remained so for another century). While the land campaigns had contributed to saving Canada, the Royal Navy had shut down American commerce, bottled up the U.S. Navy in port, and widely suppressed privateering. British businesses, some affected by rising insurance costs, were demanding peace so that trade could resume with the U.S.{{sfnm|1a1=Heidler|1a2=Heidler|1y=2002|1p=7|2a1=Latimer|2y=2009|2p=88}} The peace was generally welcomed by the British, though there was disquiet about the rapid growth of the U.S. However, the two nations quickly resumed trade after the end of the war and, over time, a growing friendship.{{sfn|Stearns|2008|p=547}}\n\nHickey argues that for Britain:\n{{quote|the most important lesson of all [was] that the best way to defend Canada was to accommodate the United States. This was the principal rationale for Britain's long-term policy of rapprochement with the United States in the nineteenth century and explains why they were so often willing to sacrifice other imperial interests to keep the republic happy.{{sfn|Hickey|2014}}}}\n\n===United States===\n[[File:4th-of-July-1819-Philadelphia-John-Lewis-Krimmel.JPG|thumb|[[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations in 1819.

Several war heroes used their fame to win election to national office. Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison both took advantage of their military successes to win the presidency, while Richard Mentor Johnson used his wartime exploits to help attain the vice presidency.\n\nDuring the war, New England states became increasingly frustrated over how the war was being conducted and how the conflict was affecting them. They complained that the U.S. government was not investing enough in the states' defences militarily and financially, and that the states should have more control over their militias. The increased taxes, the British blockade, and the occupation of some of New England by enemy forces also agitated public opinion in the states.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=255ff}} As a result, at the [[Hartford Convention]] (December 1814{{snd}}January 1815) Federalist delegates deprecated the war effort and sought more autonomy for the New England states. They did not call for secession but word of the angry anti-war resolutions appeared at the same time that peace was announced and the victory at New Orleans was known. The upshot was that the Federalists were permanently discredited and quickly disappeared as a major political force.{{sfn|Cogliano|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnJJ-GDktHgC&pg=PA234 234]}}\n\nThis war enabled thousands of slaves to escape to British lines or ships for freedom, despite the difficulties. The planters' complacency about slave contentment was shocked at the sight of their slaves fleeing, risking so much to be free.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The British aided numerous Black Refugees in resettling in New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, where [[Black Loyalists]] had also been granted land after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nAfter the decisive defeat of the Creek Indians at the battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, some Creek warriors escaped to join the [[Seminole]] in Florida, who had been forming as an ethnic group since the late 18th century. The remaining Creek chiefs signed away about half their lands, comprising 23,000,000 acres, covering much of southern Georgia and two thirds of modern Alabama. The Creek were separated from any future help from the Spanish in Florida, and from the Choctaw and Chickasaw to the west. During the war the United States seized [[Mobile, Alabama]], which was a strategic location as it provided an oceanic outlet for export from the cotton lands to the north.  Most were yet to be developed, but US control of this territory increased pressure on remaining Creek, as European Americans began to migrate in number into the area.\n\nJackson invaded Florida in 1818, demonstrating to Spain that it could no longer control that territory with a small force. Spain sold Florida to the United States in 1819 under the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] following the [[First Seminole War]]. Pratt concludes:\n\n{{quote|Thus indirectly the War of 1812 brought about the acquisition of Florida.... To both the Northwest and the South, therefore, the War of 1812 brought substantial benefits. It broke the power of the Creek Confederacy and opened to settlement a great province of the future Cotton Kingdom.{{sfn|Pratt|1955|p= 138.}}}}\n\n==Memory and historiography==\n===Popular views===\n{{Unreferenced|date=March 2020}}\n{{Original research section|date=March 2020}}\nDuring the 19th century, residents of both the United States and Canada widely believed that their own countries had won the war. Each young country saw its self-perceived victory, and settling of the border between them, as an important foundation of its growing nationhood. The British, on the other hand, who had been preoccupied by Napoleon's challenge in Europe, paid little attention to what was to them a peripheral and secondary dispute, a distraction from the principal task at hand.\n\n===American===\nWhile American popular memory includes the British capture and the burning of Washington in August 1814,{{sfn|Defense Burning of}} which necessitated its extensive renovation, it focused on the victories at Baltimore, Plattsburg, and New Orleans to present the war as a successful effort to assert American national honour, the \"second war of independence\" in which the mighty British empire was humbled and humiliated.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=82\u201383}} In a speech before Congress on February 18, 1815, President [[James Madison]] proclaimed the war a complete American victory.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}}\n\nThis interpretation of the war was and remains the dominant American view of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} The American newspaper the ''Niles Register'', in an editorial on September 14, 1816, announced that the Americans had crushed the British, declaring \"...we did virtually dictate the treaty of Ghent to the British\".{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} A minority of Americans, mostly associated with the Federalists, considered the war a defeat and an act of folly on Madison's part, caustically asking if the Americans were \"dictating\" the terms of the treaty of Ghent, why the British Crown did not cede British North America to the United States?{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} However, the Federalist view of the war is not the mainstream American memory of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}} Congressman [[George Troup]], who said in a speech in 1815 that the Treaty of Ghent was \"the glorious termination of the most glorious war ever waged by any people\", expressed American popular opinion and memory of the war.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=83}}\n\nAmericans also celebrated the successful American defence of [[Fort McHenry]] in September 1814, which inspired the lyrics of what was adopted as the U.S. national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".{{sfn|Star-Spangled Banner War}} The successful captains of the U.S. Navy became popular heroes, and commemorative plates were produced with the likenesses of Decatur, Issac Hull, and [[Charles Stewart (1778\u20131869)|Charles Stewart]] on them, becoming popular items. Many of these plates were manufactured in England. The navy became a cherished institution, lauded for the victories that it won against all odds.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=456}} After engagements during the final actions of the war, U.S. Marines had acquired a well-deserved reputation as excellent marksmen, especially in ship-to-ship actions. {{sfn|Simmons|2003}}\n\n===Canadian===\n[[File:Couplandart.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Douglas Coupland]]'s '[[Monument to the War of 1812]]' (2008) in Toronto; depicts a larger-than-life Canadian soldier triumphing over an American; both are depicted as metallic toy soldiers of the sort small children play with.]]\n\nIn British North America, the War of 1812 was seen by Loyalists as a victory, as they had claimed they had successfully defended their country from an American takeover.{{sfn|Kaufman|1997|pp=110\u2013135}} A long-term consequence of the Canadian militia's success was the view, widely held in Canada at least until the First World War, that Canada did not need a regular professional army.{{sfn|Cmh: Origins of|2007}} While Canadian militia units had played instrumental roles in several engagements, such as at the Battle of the Chateauguay, it was the regular units of the British Army, including its \"Fencible\" regiments which were recruited within North America, which ensured that Canada was successfully defended.\n\nThe U.S. Army had done poorly, on the whole, in several attempts to invade Canada, and the Canadians had fought bravely to defend their territory. But the British did not doubt that the thinly populated territory would remain vulnerable in a third war. \"We cannot keep Canada if the Americans declare war against us again\", Admiral Sir [[David Milne (Royal Navy officer)|David Milne]] wrote to a correspondent in 1817,{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=458\u2013459}} although the [[Rideau Canal]] was built for just such a scenario.\n\nBy the 21st century it was a forgotten war in Britain,{{sfn|Lambert|2012|p=1}} although still remembered in Canada, especially Ontario. In a 2009 poll, 37% of Canadians said the war was a Canadian victory, 9% said the U.S. won, 15% called it a draw, and 39% said they knew too little to comment.{{sfn|Boswell|2009}} A 2012 poll found that in a list of items that could be used to define Canadians' identity, the belief that Canada successfully repelled an American invasion in the War of 1812 places second (25%).{{sfn|Ipsos Reid}}\n\n===Historians' views===\nHistorians have differing and complex interpretations of the war.{{sfn|Trautsch|2014}} In recent decades the view of the majority of historians has been that the war ended in stalemate, with the Treaty of Ghent closing a war that had become militarily inconclusive. Neither side wanted to continue fighting since the main causes had disappeared and since there were no large lost territories for one side or the other to reclaim by force. Insofar as they see the war's resolution as allowing two centuries of peaceful and mutually beneficial intercourse between the U.S., Britain and Canada, these historians often conclude that all three nations were the \"real winners\" of the War of 1812. These writers often add that the war could have been avoided in the first place by better diplomacy. It is seen as a mistake for everyone concerned because it was badly planned and marked by multiple fiascos and failures on both sides, as shown especially by the repeated American failures to seize parts of Canada, and the failed British attack on New Orleans and upstate New York.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2002|p=137}}{{sfn|Howe|2007|p=74}}\n\nHowever, other scholars hold that the war constituted a British victory and an American defeat. They argue that the British achieved their military objectives in 1812 (by stopping the repeated American invasions of Canada) and retaining their Canadian colonies. In contrast, they say, the Americans suffered a defeat when their armies failed to achieve their war goal of seizing part or all of Canada. Additionally, they argue the U.S. lost as it failed to stop impressment, which the British refused to repeal until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, arguing that the U.S. actions had no effect on the Orders in Council, which were rescinded before the war started.{{sfnm|1a1=Benn|1y=2002|p=83|2a1=Latimer|2y=2007|2p=3}}\n\nHistorian Troy Bickham, author of ''The Weight of Vengeance: The United States, the British Empire, and the War of 1812'', sees the British as having fought to a much stronger position than the United States.\n\n<blockquote>Even tied down by ongoing wars with Napoleonic France, the British had enough capable officers, well-trained men, and equipment to easily defeat a series of American invasions of Canada. In fact, in the opening salvos of the war, the American forces invading Upper Canada were pushed so far back that they ended up surrendering Michigan Territory. The difference between the two navies was even greater. While the Americans famously (shockingly for contemporaries on both sides of the Atlantic) bested British ships in some one-on-one actions at the war's start, the Royal Navy held supremacy throughout the war, blockading the U.S. coastline and ravaging coastal towns, including Washington, D.C. Yet in late 1814, the British offered surprisingly generous peace terms despite having amassed a large invasion force of veteran troops in Canada, naval supremacy in the Atlantic, an opponent that was effectively bankrupt, and an open secessionist movement in New England.</blockquote>\n\nHe considers that the British offered the United States generous terms, in place of their initially harsh terms (which included massive forfeiture of land to Canada and the American Indians), because the \"reigning Liverpool ministry in Britain held a loose grip on power and feared the war-weary, tax-exhausted public\". The war was also technically a British victory \"because the United States failed to achieve the aims listed in its declaration of war\".{{sfn|Bickham|2017}}\n\nA second minority view is that both the U.S. and Britain won the war\u2014that is, both achieved their main objectives, as the U.S. restored its independence and honour, and opened the way to westward expansion, while Britain defeated Napoleon and ruled the seas.{{sfn|Turner |2000}} American historian Norman K. Risjord argues that the main motivation was restoring the nation's honour in the face of relentless British aggression toward American neutral rights on the high seas, and in the Western lands. The results in terms of honour satisfied the War Hawks.{{sfn|Risjord|1961| pp=196\u2013210}} American historian Donald Hickey asks, \"Did the cost in blood and treasure justify the U.S. decision to go to war? Most Republicans thought it did. In the beginning they called the contest a 'second war of independence', and while Britain's maritime practices never truly threatened the Republic's independence, the war did in a broad sense vindicate U.S. sovereignty. But it ended in a draw on the battlefield.\"{{sfn|Hickey|2013|loc=Introduction}} Historians argue that it was an American success to end the threat of Indian raids, kill the British plan for a semi-independent Indian sanctuary, and hereby to open an unimpeded path for westward expansion.{{efn|''The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' concludes, \"British plans for an American Indian buffer state were dropped, and American Indian nations within U.S. borders lost their last major remaining European diplomatic partner, clearing a path for American westward expansion.\"{{sfn|Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|page=343}}&nbsp;}} [[Winston Churchill]] concluded:\n<blockquote>The lessons of the war were taken to heart. Anti-American feeling in Great Britain ran high for several years, but the United States were never again refused proper treatment as an independent power.{{sfn|Churchill|1958|page=366}}</blockquote>\n\nAmerican naval historian George C. Daughan argues that the US achieved enough of its war goals to claim a victorious result of the conflict, and subsequent impact it had on the negotiations in Ghent. Daughan uses official correspondences from President Madison to the delegates at Ghent strictly prohibiting negotiations with regards to maritime law, stating:{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=328}}\n\n<blockquote>Madison's latest dispatches [arrived July 25\u201327, 1814] permitted them [the delegates] to simply ignore the entire question of maritime rights. Free trade with liberated Europe had already been restored, and the Admiralty no longer needed impressment to man its warships. The president felt that with Europe at peace the issues of neutral trading rights and impressment could safely be set aside in the interests of obtaining peace... Thus, from the start of the negotiations, the disagreements that started the war and sustained it were acknowledged by both parties to be no longer important.</blockquote>\n\nThe British permanently stopped impressing Americans, although they never publicly rescinding the possibility of resuming that practice. The US delegates at the meeting understood it to be a dead issue after the 1814 surrender of Napoleon.{{sfn|Rutland | 1994 | p=200}} In addition, the successful defence of Baltimore, Plattsburgh, and Fort Erie (a strategic fortress located in Upper Canada on the Niagara River, and occupied during the third and most successful offensive into Canada) had very favorable influence on the negotiations for the Americans and prompted several famous responses from both sides. Henry Clay wrote to the delegates in October 1814, \"for in our own country, my dear sir, at last must we conquer the peace.\"{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=353}} With growing pressure in Britain, the Duke of Wellington, when asked to command the forces in America, wrote to Liverpool on November 9, 1814, \"I confess that I think you have no right, from the state of the war, to demand any concession of territory from America&nbsp;... You have not been able to carry&nbsp;... [the war] into the enemy's territory, notwithstanding your military success and now undoubted military superiority, and have not even cleared your own territory on the point of attack [Fort Erie]&nbsp;... Why Stipulate for ''uti possidetis''?\"{{sfn|Mills|1921|pp=19\u201332}} The argument that the US failed to capture any Canadian territory that influenced the negotiations is an outdated and highly criticized position, argues Daughan. He cites the ''Edinburgh Review'', a British newspaper, who had remained silent about the war with America for two years, wrote \"the British government had embarked on a war of conquest, after the American government had dropped its maritime demands, and the British had lost. It was folly to attempt to invade and conquer the United States. To do so would result in the same tragedy as the first war against them, and with the same result.\"{{sfn|Daughan|2011|p=359}}\n\n====National bias of historians====\nHistorians have different views on who won the War of 1812, and there is an element of national bias to this.{{sfn|Trautsch|2014}} British and Canadian historians follow the view that the war was a British victory, and some US historians also support this view. {{sfn|Boswell|2011}} The opposing position, held by most US historians along with some Canadians and British, is that the result was a stalemate. Only US historians follow the minority view that the US was the victorious party in the war.{{sfn|Hattendorf|2012}}{{sfn|Simon|2012}}{{sfn|Boswell|2011}}{{sfn|Foreman|2014}} Similarly, a survey of school textbooks found that historians from Canada, Britain, and the United States emphasize different aspects of the war according to their national narratives; some British texts will scarcely mention the war.''{{sfn|Mowat|1965|p=35}}''\n\n====Indians as losers====\nHistorians generally agree that the real losers of the War of 1812 were the Indians (called First Nations in Canada). Hickey says:\n\n{{quote|The big losers in the war were the Indians. As a proportion of their population, they had suffered the heaviest casualties. Worse, they were left without any reliable European allies in North America&nbsp;... The crushing defeats at the Thames and Horseshoe Bend left them at the mercy of the Americans, hastening their confinement to reservations and the decline of their traditional way of life.{{sfn|Hickey|2013|loc=Introduction. |p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2bBHL2ePWcC&pg=PT22 22]}}{{sfn|Thompson|Randall|2008|page=23}}{{sfn|Bowman|Greenblatt|2003|p=142}}{{sfn|Kessel|Wooster|2005|page=145}}}}\n[[File:Jackson and Weatherford.jpg|thumb|[[William Weatherford]] surrendering to Andrew Jackson at the end of the Creek War. The peace imposed on the Creek saw them cede half of their territory to the United States.]]\nThe Indians of the Old Northwest (the modern Midwest) had hoped to create an Indian state to be a British protectorate.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=85}} American settlers into the Middle West had been repeatedly blocked and threatened by Indian raids before 1812, and that now came to an end. Throughout the war the British had played on terror of the tomahawks and scalping knives of their Indian allies; it worked especially at Hull's surrender at Detroit. By 1813 Americans had killed Tecumseh and broken his coalition of tribes. Jackson then defeated the Creek in the Southwest. Historian John Sugden notes that in both theaters, the Indians' strength had been broken prior to the arrival of the major British forces in 1814.{{sfn|Sugden|1982|p=311}} The one campaign that the Americans had decisively won was the campaign in the Old Northwest, which put the British in a weak hand to insist upon an Indian state in the Old Northwest.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=85}}\n\nNotwithstanding the sympathy and support from commanders (such as Brock,{{efn|{{harvtxt|Sugden|1982|pp=301\u2013302}} mentions that 'Brock had urged the British government to protect his Indian allies in peace negotiations, and by the end of 1812 he had obtained from Earl Bathurst, colonial secretary, a promise to that effect.'}} Cochrane and Nicolls), the policymakers in London reneged in assisting the Indians, as making peace was a higher priority for the politicians. At the peace conference the British demanded an independent Indian state in the Midwest, but, although the British and their Indian allies maintained control over the territories in question (i.e. most of the [[Upper Midwest]]), British diplomats did not press the demand after an American refusal, effectively abandoning their Indian allies. The withdrawal of British protection gave the Americans a free hand, which resulted in the removal of most of the tribes to [[Indian Territory]] (present-day [[Oklahoma]]).{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=435\u2013439}} In that sense according to historian Alan Taylor, the final victory at New Orleans had \"enduring and massive consequences\".{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=421}} It gave the Americans \"continental predominance\" while it left the Indians dispossessed, powerless, and vulnerable.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=437}}\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent technically required the United States to cease hostilities and \"forthwith to restore to such Tribes or Nations respectively all possessions, rights and privileges which they may have enjoyed, or been entitled to in 1811\"; the United States ignored this article of the treaty and proceeded to expand into this territory regardless; Britain was unwilling to provoke further war to enforce it. A shocked [[Henry Goulburn]], one of the British negotiators at Ghent, remarked:\n\n{{quote|Till I came here, I had no idea of the fixed determination which there is in the heart of every American to extirpate the Indians and appropriate their territory.{{sfn|Treaty of Ghent}}}}\n\nThe Creek War came to an end, with the Treaty of Fort Jackson being imposed upon the Indians. About half of the Creek territory was ceded to the United States, with no payment made to the Creeks. This was, in theory, invalidated by Article 9 of the Treaty of Ghent. {{sfn|Sugden|1982|p=304}} The British failed to press the issue, and did not take up the Indian cause as an infringement of an international treaty. Without this support, the Indians' lack of power was apparent and the stage was set for further incursions of territory by the United States in subsequent decades.

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

It is characterised by the presence of abundant Cuartz sediments, along with the pesence of Red Clays. The facies of the formation follow a deposition typical of Alluvial Plains.<ref name=Jenny1 /><ref name=Ibouh1 /> It also recovers a succession of reddish brown tones predominantly terrigenous: [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]]s, [[Sandstone]], clays related to  [[Paleosoils]], along with dolomitized [[Limestone]]. The Wazzant formation has a notorious proximal character compared to the Azilal formation.  These deposits fill in many small tear pools in the Atlas Central.<ref>Laville, E. (1978).

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).
