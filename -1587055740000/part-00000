Ward]], that stars [[Tom Berenger]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Wesley Snipes]], [[James Gammon]], [[Bob Uecker]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Dennis Haysbert]], and [[Corbin Bernsen]]. \n\nMade for $11 million, ''Major League'' grossed nearly $50 million in domestic release.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web | title=Major League | website=Box Office Mojo | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=majorleague.htm | accessdate=May 27, 2006}}</ref> ''Major League'' deals with the exploits of a fictionalized version of the [[Cleveland Indians]] [[baseball]] team, and spawned two sequels (''[[Major League II]]'' and ''[[Major League: Back to the Minors|Back to the Minors]]''), neither of which replicated the success of the original film.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[Las Vegas]] [[showgirl]] Rachel Phelps ([[Margaret Whitton]]) inherits the [[Cleveland Indians]] baseball team from her deceased husband. Phelps hates [[Cleveland]] and wants to relocate the team to [[Miami]]. The Indians' contract with Cleveland contains an [[escape clause]] stipulating that the team may relocate if attendance falls below a certain level. That means they have to finish dead last to relocate to Miami. Determined to put together the worst team in the [[Major League Baseball|Major Leagues]], Phelps hires Lou Brown ([[James Gammon]]), the manager for the [[Toledo Mud Hens]], to manage the team and promotes former manager Charlie Donovan ([[Charles Cyphers]]) to general manager.\n\nDuring [[spring training]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], the team's shortcomings become evident. The team's lone star, third baseman Roger Dorn ([[Corbin Bernsen]]), is an egotistical [[prima donna]] whose skills have faded. Staff ace Eddie Harris ([[Chelcie Ross]]) has to rely on illegally doctoring the baseball due to his weakening arm. Pedro Cerrano ([[Dennis Haysbert]]), a voodoo-practicing Cuban import with significant power, cannot hit breaking balls and clashes with the devoutly Christian Harris. Veteran catcher Jake Taylor ([[Tom Berenger]]), a former star  who had spent the last few years playing in the [[Mexican League]] after his knees gave out, has lost so much strength on his throws that he cannot reach second base.\n\nThe two players who draw the most attention are brash young outfielder Willie Mays Hayes ([[Wesley Snipes]]), who simply showed up at spring training without an invite, and pitcher Rick Vaughn ([[Charlie Sheen]]), a convicted felon on work release from a California prison. Hayes claims he can \"run like [[Bob Hayes|Hayes]]\", and proves to be the fastest player on the team, and \"hit like\" his namesake, but is unable to hit the ball very far. Vaughn has a fastball in the mid 90s, but has no control over it, which earns him the nickname \"Wild Thing\".\n\nThe team predictably starts the season on a losing streak. Lou then discovers Vaughn's control issues stem from an uncorrected visual impairment. After being fitted with glasses, Vaughn's performance improves with additional coaching and assistance from Taylor, and the team begins to win. Meanwhile, Taylor tries to reunite with his ex-girlfriend Lynn ([[Rene Russo]]) despite her being engaged to another man.\n\nPhelps, angered by the team's improvement, tries to demoralize them by removing team amenities. She replaces their chartered team jet, first with a rickety propeller plane and then an old bus. She then refuses to fix their workout equipment, and even has the hot water to the locker room turned off. Despite her efforts the team continues to win and brings themselves into contention for the division championship.\n\nEventually Charlie is able to reveal Phelps's plan to Lou. Lou then calls a team meeting and announces that all of the players on the current roster would be released or sent back to the minors at the end of the season no matter the outcome. With nothing to lose, Taylor states to the team that they should focus on winning the pennant. For added motivation, they use a cardboard cutout of Phelps from her showgirl days, peeling off sections of clothing for each game they win.\n\nThe team succeeds in tying the [[American League East]] (AL East) division with the [[New York Yankees]], leading to a [[one-game playoff]] to determine the division championship. However, Lou decides to start Harris in place of Vaughn due to his experience. Vaughn then ends up in bed with a woman who he later finds out is Suzanne Dorn, Roger's wife (Stacy Carroll); who had slept with Vaughn as revenge for her husband being unfaithful during a victory party.\n\nIn the playoff game in Cleveland, the game is scoreless until the top of the seventh when the Yankees take a 2-0 lead, but Cerrano finally gets a good pitch and hits a home run to tie the game in the bottom of the seventh. The ninth inning begins with Harris loading the bases after recording two outs, with their best hitter Clu Haywood on deck.  Lou decides to switch Harris out with Vaughn, who manages to get his revenge on Haywood, striking him out on three straight fastballs. In the bottom of the inning, the Yankees bring out \"The Duke\" ([[Willie Mueller]]), their headhunting closer. The Indians manage to catch the Yankees off guard thanks to Hayes' speed after singling and stealing second base, and an unexpected [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] from Taylor to win the game.\n\nAs the team celebrates, Dorn punches Vaughn in the face for what happened the night before but then quickly pulls him up so they can keep celebrating. Taylor spots Lynn in the stands, no longer wearing her engagement ring. The two rush to hug each other as the city celebrates the victory.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nThe theatrical release includes added scenes of Rachel Phelps showing dismay with the team's success. An alternate scene included on the \"Wild Thing Edition\" DVD shows a very different characterization of Phelps. Lou Brown confronts Phelps over her plan to sabotage the team and announces his resignation. Phelps then reveals the threatened move to Miami was merely a ruse to motivate the team, as the Indians were on the verge of bankruptcy when she inherited them and she could not afford to hire star players or maintain standard amenities. She also tells Lou that she felt he was the right manager to bring the ragtag group together. Lou does not resign, but Phelps reasserts her authority by saying that if he shares any part of their conversation with anyone, she will fire him.<ref name=\"latimes altending\">{{cite web | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2010/07/sports-legend-revealed-the-movie-major-league-originally-had-a-twist-ending.html | title = The film Major League originally had a dramatic twist at the end involving the team's owner. | first = Brian | last = Cronin | date = July 20, 2010 | accessdate = August 10, 2015 | website = [[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref>\n\nThe film's producers said that while the twist ending worked as a resolution of the plot, they scrapped it because [[test screening|test audiences]] preferred the Phelps character as a villain.<ref name=\"latimes altending\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Jake Taylor\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Ricky \"Wild Thing\" Vaughn\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Roger Dorn\n* [[Margaret Whitton]] as Rachel Phelps\n* [[James Gammon]] as Lou Brown\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Lynn Weslin\n* [[Bob Uecker]] as Harry Doyle\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Willie Mays Hayes\n* [[Charles Cyphers]] as Charlie Donovan\n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as Eddie Harris\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Pedro Cerrano\n* [[Andy Romano]] as Pepper Leach\n* Kip Powers as Cooper Vaughn \n* [[Steve Yeager]] as Duke Temple\n* [[Pete Vuckovich]] as Clu Haywood\n* [[Willie Mueller]] as The Duke\n* Stacy Carroll as Suzanne Dorn\n* Todd Johnson as Jeremy Keltner\n* [[Neil Flynn]] as an Indians fan\n* Ed Grode, Jr. as an Indians fan\n* Marc Daniloff as sports reporter\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film's opening montage is a series of somber blue-collar images of the Cleveland landscape synchronized to the score of [[Randy Newman]]'s \"Burn On\": an ode to the infamous day in Cleveland when the heavily polluted [[Cuyahoga River]] caught fire.\n\nMuch of the film's spring training scenes were shot at [[Hi Corbett Field]] in Tucson, Arizona, which was the spring training home for the Cleveland Indians from 1947 to 1992. The production used members of the [[University of Arizona]] Wildcats baseball team as extras. <ref> https://tucson.com/entertainment/movies/modern-movies-that-were-filmed-in-tucson/collection_b9eceffe-63c5-11e5-80d6-8312ff318885.html#1 </ref>\n\nDespite being set in Cleveland, the film was principally shot in Milwaukee because it was cheaper and the producers were unable to work around the schedules of the Cleveland Indians and [[Cleveland Browns]]. [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], then the home of the Brewers (and three [[Green Bay Packers]] games per season), doubles as [[Cleveland Stadium]] for the film, although several exterior shots of Cleveland Stadium were used, including some aerial shots taken during an Indians game. In fact, the sign for the TV station atop the scoreboard is for [[WTMJ-TV|WTMJ]], the NBC affiliate for Milwaukee. One of the ending scenes of the movie is in West Milwaukee's legendary restaurant, 4th Base which showcases their unique horseshoe bar that is shown in the celebration scenes.  Another restaurant scene, at the then Gritz's Pzazz on Milwaukee's north side, is no longer open for business. County Stadium has since been [[demolition|demolished]]: the former playing field is now a [[Little League]] baseball field known as [[Helfaer Field]], while the rest of the former site is now a parking lot for the Brewers' new home, [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]]; the [[FirstEnergy Stadium (Cleveland)|new Cleveland Browns stadium]] (now FirstEnergy Stadium), a football-only facility owned by the City of Cleveland and used by the Browns, sits on the site of its predecessor.<ref>{{cite news|title= Major League - Wild Thing Edition|work= [[DVD Talk]]|date=|url= https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27363/major-league-wild-thing-edition/|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nThe film was notable for featuring several actors who would go on to stardom: Snipes and Russo were relative unknowns before the movie was released, while Haysbert remained best known as Pedro Cerrano until he portrayed [[David Palmer (24 character)|U.S. President David Palmer]] on the television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''.  The longshoreman who is occasionally seen commenting and is shown in the final celebration inside a bar is [[Neil Flynn]], who later achieved fame playing the Janitor in ''[[Scrubs (TV Show)|Scrubs]]'' and then the father Mike in ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]''.  This is Flynn's first credited movie role.\n\nThe film also featured former Major League players, including 1982 American League [[Cy Young Award]] winner [[Pete Vuckovich]] as Yankees first baseman Clu Haywood, former [[Milwaukee Brewers]] pitcher [[Willie Mueller]] as the Yankees pitcher Duke Simpson, known as \"The Duke\", and former [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] catcher [[Steve Yeager]] as third-base coach Duke Temple.  Former catcher and longtime Brewers broadcaster [[Bob Uecker]] played the Indians' broadcaster Harry Doyle. The names of several crewmembers were also used for peripheral players.\n\nSheen himself was a pitcher on his high school's baseball team. At the time of filming ''Major League'', his own fastball topped out at 85 miles per hour. (In 2011, Sheen said that he had used [[Anabolic steroid|steroids]] for nearly two months to improve his athletic abilities in the film.)<ref>{{cite news |author=Marianne Garvey |work=msnbc.com |title=Charlie Sheen used steroids during 'Major League'|date=June 29, 2011 |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43578656/ns/today-entertainment/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701215740/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43578656/ns/today-entertainment/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Reception===\nThe film debuted at No. 1 at the box office<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office: 'Major League' Wins Season Opener|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 11, 1989|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-11/entertainment/ca-1546_1_weeks-movie-million-weekend-box-office|accessdate=May 15, 2012|first=Nina J.|last=Easton}}</ref> and received generally positive reviews.<ref>{{cite news|title= Movie Reviews : 'Major League' in a League by Itself|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 7, 1989|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-07/entertainment/ca-1041_1_major-league|accessdate=May 14, 2012|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Reviews/Film; Idiocies and Idiosyncrasies Of Bungling Ballplayers|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=April 7, 1989|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE3D81539F934A35757C0A96F948260|accessdate=May 14, 2012|first=Caryn|last=James}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Cinema: Don't Run: One Hit, One Error|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 24, 1989|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957509,00.html|accessdate=May 14, 2012|first=Richard|last=Corliss}}</ref> It has an 83% \"fresh\" rating on review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10.

She took over ownership and control of the Rams upon the death of her husband in 1979.\n\nWhen he joined the Cubs in 1989 (the same year the film was released), pitcher [[Mitch Williams]]' extravagant wind-up and release, and his frequent wild pitches, earned him the nickname \"Wild Thing.\" As with Rick Vaughn's character, the [[Wrigley Field]] organist played \"[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]\" as Williams came out of the bullpen. A few years later, in 1993 with the Phillies, Williams started wearing the number 99 on his jersey, the same number that Vaughn wears in the film.<ref>Although, according to an interview on ''[[The Dan Patrick Show]]'' (October 22, 2008), Williams' number change had nothing to do with the ''Major League'' film. Williams said he had wanted the number 99 for years because of his admiration for the football player [[Mark Gastineau]], who also wore number 99. Williams said that he did not change his number until 1993 because that was his first chance to do it.</ref>\n\nIn the years since its release ''Major League'' has become a beloved film of many professional baseball players and announcers, and is often referenced during game broadcasts. For example, in 2014, for the film's 25th anniversary, Major League catcher [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]] filmed a one-man tribute to the film, with Ross playing the part (among others) of Lou Brown, Pedro Cerrano, Willie Mays Hayes, Rick Vaughn, and Roger Dorn.<ref>[http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/17160334/v31760357/david-ross-recreates-major-league \"Ross recreates 'Major League',\"] MLB.com (April 2, 2014).</ref> Additionally, as part of their 2014 \"Archives\" set, the trading card company [[Topps]] celebrated the film's 25th anniversary by creating baseball cards (using the same design as the company's 1989 base set) of Roger Dorn, Jake Taylor, Eddie Harris, Rachel Phelps, Rick Vaughn, and \"Jobu.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140606115422/https://www.topps.com/major-league-25th-anniversary-wax-pack.html \"Major League 25th Anniversary Wax Pack,\"] Topps official website.

Hi Corbett was the spring training home for the Cleveland Indians from 1947 to 1992.  The star of the short film is outfielder Matt \"Mays\" Frazier, who played the role of Snipes' Willie Mays Hayes character from the original film. Rick \"Wild Thing\" Vaughn and Roger Dorn are also parodied, and Arizona head coach Jay Johnson plays the role of Indians manager Lou Brown.<ref> https://www.abc15.com/sports/sports-blogs-local/watch-arizona-wildcats-baseball-team-spoofs-major-league-movie </ref>\n\n''Major League'' became an inspiration for the real Cleveland Indians and the city, given the previously long-standing [[Cleveland sports curse]] that had left Cleveland without any sporting championships in between 1964 and 2016 (when the NBA's [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] won their first title in their 46-year history). The Indians reached the 2016 World Series, but lost to the similarly cursed Cubs.

Ward]], that stars [[Tom Berenger]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Wesley Snipes]], [[James Gammon]], [[Bob Uecker]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Dennis Haysbert]], and [[Corbin Bernsen]]. \n\nMade for $11 million, ''Major League'' grossed nearly $50 million in domestic release.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web | title=Major League | website=Box Office Mojo | url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=majorleague.htm | accessdate=May 27, 2006}}</ref> ''Major League'' deals with the exploits of a fictionalized version of the [[Cleveland Indians]] [[baseball]] team, and spawned two sequels (''[[Major League II]]'' and ''[[Major League: Back to the Minors|Back to the Minors]]''), neither of which replicated the success of the original film.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[Las Vegas]] [[showgirl]] Rachel Phelps ([[Margaret Whitton]]) inherits the [[Cleveland Indians]] baseball team from her deceased husband. Phelps hates [[Cleveland]] and wants to relocate the team to [[Miami]]. The Indians' contract with Cleveland contains an [[escape clause]] stipulating that the team may relocate if attendance falls below a certain level. That means they have to finish dead last to relocate to Miami. Determined to put together the worst team in the [[Major League Baseball|Major Leagues]], Phelps hires Lou Brown ([[James Gammon]]), the manager for the [[Toledo Mud Hens]], to manage the team and promotes former manager Charlie Donovan ([[Charles Cyphers]]) to general manager.\n\nDuring [[spring training]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], the team's shortcomings become evident. The team's lone star, third baseman Roger Dorn ([[Corbin Bernsen]]), is an egotistical [[prima donna]] whose skills have faded. Staff ace Eddie Harris ([[Chelcie Ross]]) has to rely on illegally doctoring the baseball due to his weakening arm. Pedro Cerrano ([[Dennis Haysbert]]), a voodoo-practicing Cuban import with significant power, cannot hit breaking balls and clashes with the devoutly Christian Harris. Veteran catcher Jake Taylor ([[Tom Berenger]]), a former star  who had spent the last few years playing in the [[Mexican League]] after his knees gave out, has lost so much strength on his throws that he cannot reach second base.\n\nThe two players who draw the most attention are brash young outfielder Willie Mays Hayes ([[Wesley Snipes]]), who simply showed up at spring training without an invite, and pitcher Rick Vaughn ([[Charlie Sheen]]), a convicted felon on work release from a California prison. Hayes claims he can \"run like [[Bob Hayes|Hayes]]\", and proves to be the fastest player on the team, and \"hit like\" his namesake, but is unable to hit the ball very far. Vaughn has a fastball in the mid 90s, but has no control over it, which earns him the nickname \"Wild Thing\".\n\nThe team predictably starts the season on a losing streak. Lou then discovers Vaughn's control issues stem from an uncorrected visual impairment. After being fitted with glasses, Vaughn's performance improves with additional coaching and assistance from Taylor, and the team begins to win. Meanwhile, Taylor tries to reunite with his ex-girlfriend Lynn ([[Rene Russo]]) despite her being engaged to another man.\n\nPhelps, angered by the team's improvement, tries to demoralize them by removing team amenities. She replaces their chartered team jet, first with a rickety propeller plane and then an old bus. She then refuses to fix their workout equipment, and even has the hot water to the locker room turned off. Despite her efforts the team continues to win and brings themselves into contention for the division championship.\n\nEventually Charlie is able to reveal Phelps's plan to Lou. Lou then calls a team meeting and announces that all of the players on the current roster would be released or sent back to the minors at the end of the season no matter the outcome. With nothing to lose, Taylor states to the team that they should focus on winning the pennant. For added motivation, they use a cardboard cutout of Phelps from her showgirl days, peeling off sections of clothing for each game they win.\n\nThe team succeeds in tying the [[American League East]] (AL East) division with the [[New York Yankees]], leading to a [[one-game playoff]] to determine the division championship. However, Lou decides to start Harris in place of Vaughn due to his experience. Vaughn then ends up in bed with a woman who he later finds out is Suzanne Dorn, Roger's wife (Stacy Carroll); who had slept with Vaughn as revenge for her husband being unfaithful during a victory party.\n\nIn the playoff game in Cleveland, the game is scoreless until the top of the seventh when the Yankees take a 2-0 lead, but Cerrano finally gets a good pitch and hits a home run to tie the game in the bottom of the seventh. The ninth inning begins with Harris loading the bases after recording two outs, with their best hitter Clu Haywood on deck.  Lou decides to switch Harris out with Vaughn, who manages to get his revenge on Haywood, striking him out on three straight fastballs. In the bottom of the inning, the Yankees bring out \"The Duke\" ([[Willie Mueller]]), their headhunting closer. The Indians manage to catch the Yankees off guard thanks to Hayes' speed after singling and stealing second base, and an unexpected [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] from Taylor to win the game.\n\nAs the team celebrates, Dorn punches Vaughn in the face for what happened the night before but then quickly pulls him up so they can keep celebrating. Taylor spots Lynn in the stands, no longer wearing her engagement ring. The two rush to hug each other as the city celebrates the victory.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nThe theatrical release includes added scenes of Rachel Phelps showing dismay with the team's success. An alternate scene included on the \"Wild Thing Edition\" DVD shows a very different characterization of Phelps. Lou Brown confronts Phelps over her plan to sabotage the team and announces his resignation. Phelps then reveals the threatened move to Miami was merely a ruse to motivate the team, as the Indians were on the verge of bankruptcy when she inherited them and she could not afford to hire star players or maintain standard amenities. She also tells Lou that she felt he was the right manager to bring the ragtag group together. Lou does not resign, but Phelps reasserts her authority by saying that if he shares any part of their conversation with anyone, she will fire him.<ref name=\"latimes altending\">{{cite web | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2010/07/sports-legend-revealed-the-movie-major-league-originally-had-a-twist-ending.html | title = The film Major League originally had a dramatic twist at the end involving the team's owner. | first = Brian | last = Cronin | date = July 20, 2010 | accessdate = August 10, 2015 | website = [[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref>\n\nThe film's producers said that while the twist ending worked as a resolution of the plot, they scrapped it because [[test screening|test audiences]] preferred the Phelps character as a villain.<ref name=\"latimes altending\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tom Berenger]] as Jake Taylor\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Ricky \"Wild Thing\" Vaughn\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Roger Dorn\n* [[Margaret Whitton]] as Rachel Phelps\n* [[James Gammon]] as Lou Brown\n* [[Rene Russo]] as Lynn Weslin\n* [[Bob Uecker]] as Harry Doyle\n* [[Wesley Snipes]] as Willie Mays Hayes\n* [[Charles Cyphers]] as Charlie Donovan\n* [[Chelcie Ross]] as Eddie Harris\n* [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Pedro Cerrano\n* [[Andy Romano]] as Pepper Leach\n* Kip Powers as Cooper Vaughn \n* [[Steve Yeager]] as Duke Temple\n* [[Pete Vuckovich]] as Clu Haywood\n* [[Willie Mueller]] as The Duke\n* Stacy Carroll as Suzanne Dorn\n* Todd Johnson as Jeremy Keltner\n* [[Neil Flynn]] as an Indians fan\n* Ed Grode, Jr. as an Indians fan\n* Marc Daniloff as sports reporter\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film's opening montage is a series of somber blue-collar images of the Cleveland landscape synchronized to the score of [[Randy Newman]]'s \"Burn On\": an ode to the infamous day in Cleveland when the heavily polluted [[Cuyahoga River]] caught fire.\n\nMuch of the film's spring training scenes were shot at [[Hi Corbett Field]] in Tucson, Arizona, which was the spring training home for the Cleveland Indians from 1947 to 1992. The production used members of the [[University of Arizona]] Wildcats baseball team as extras. <ref> https://tucson.com/entertainment/movies/modern-movies-that-were-filmed-in-tucson/collection_b9eceffe-63c5-11e5-80d6-8312ff318885.html#1 </ref>\n\nDespite being set in Cleveland, the film was principally shot in Milwaukee because it was cheaper and the producers were unable to work around the schedules of the Cleveland Indians and [[Cleveland Browns]]. [[Milwaukee County Stadium]], then the home of the Brewers (and three [[Green Bay Packers]] games per season), doubles as [[Cleveland Stadium]] for the film, although several exterior shots of Cleveland Stadium were used, including some aerial shots taken during an Indians game. In fact, the sign for the TV station atop the scoreboard is for [[WTMJ-TV|WTMJ]], the NBC affiliate for Milwaukee. One of the ending scenes of the movie is in West Milwaukee's legendary restaurant, 4th Base which showcases their unique horseshoe bar that is shown in the celebration scenes.  Another restaurant scene, at the then Gritz's Pzazz on Milwaukee's north side, is no longer open for business. County Stadium has since been [[demolition|demolished]]: the former playing field is now a [[Little League]] baseball field known as [[Helfaer Field]], while the rest of the former site is now a parking lot for the Brewers' new home, [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]]; the [[FirstEnergy Stadium (Cleveland)|new Cleveland Browns stadium]] (now FirstEnergy Stadium), a football-only facility owned by the City of Cleveland and used by the Browns, sits on the site of its predecessor.<ref>{{cite news|title= Major League - Wild Thing Edition|work= [[DVD Talk]]|date=|url= https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27363/major-league-wild-thing-edition/|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nThe film was notable for featuring several actors who would go on to stardom: Snipes and Russo were relative unknowns before the movie was released, while Haysbert remained best known as Pedro Cerrano until he portrayed [[David Palmer (24 character)|U.S. President David Palmer]] on the television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''.  The longshoreman who is occasionally seen commenting and is shown in the final celebration inside a bar is [[Neil Flynn]], who later achieved fame playing the Janitor in ''[[Scrubs (TV Show)|Scrubs]]'' and then the father Mike in ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]''.  This is Flynn's first credited movie role.\n\nThe film also featured former Major League players, including 1982 American League [[Cy Young Award]] winner [[Pete Vuckovich]] as Yankees first baseman Clu Haywood, former [[Milwaukee Brewers]] pitcher [[Willie Mueller]] as the Yankees pitcher Duke Simpson, known as \"The Duke\", and former [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] catcher [[Steve Yeager]] as third-base coach Duke Temple.  Former catcher and longtime Brewers broadcaster [[Bob Uecker]] played the Indians' broadcaster Harry Doyle. The names of several crewmembers were also used for peripheral players.\n\nSheen himself was a pitcher on his high school's baseball team. At the time of filming ''Major League'', his own fastball topped out at 85 miles per hour. (In 2011, Sheen said that he had used [[Anabolic steroid|steroids]] for nearly two months to improve his athletic abilities in the film.)<ref>{{cite news |author=Marianne Garvey |work=msnbc.com |title=Charlie Sheen used steroids during 'Major League'|date=June 29, 2011 |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43578656/ns/today-entertainment/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701215740/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43578656/ns/today-entertainment/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Reception===\nThe film debuted at No. 1 at the box office<ref>{{cite news|title= WEEKEND BOX OFFICE : 'Major League' Wins Season Opener|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 11, 1989|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-11/entertainment/ca-1546_1_weeks-movie-million-weekend-box-office|accessdate=May 15, 2012|first=Nina J.|last=Easton}}</ref> and received generally positive reviews.<ref>{{cite news|title= Movie Reviews : 'Major League' in a League by Itself|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 7, 1989|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-07/entertainment/ca-1041_1_major-league|accessdate=May 14, 2012|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Reviews/Film; Idiocies and Idiosyncrasies Of Bungling Ballplayers|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=April 7, 1989|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE3D81539F934A35757C0A96F948260|accessdate=May 14, 2012|first=Caryn|last=James}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Cinema: Don't Run: One Hit, One Error|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 24, 1989|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957509,00.html|accessdate=May 14, 2012|first=Richard|last=Corliss}}</ref> It has an 83% \"fresh\" rating on review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10.

She took over ownership and control of the Rams upon the death of her husband in 1979.\n\nWhen he joined the Cubs in 1989 (the same year the film was released), pitcher [[Mitch Williams]]' extravagant wind-up and release, and his frequent wild pitches, earned him the nickname \"Wild Thing.\" As with Rick Vaughn's character, the [[Wrigley Field]] organist played \"[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]\" as Williams came out of the bullpen. A few years later, in 1993 with the Phillies, Williams started wearing the number 99 on his jersey, the same number that Vaughn wears in the film.<ref>Although, according to an interview on ''[[The Dan Patrick Show]]'' (October 22, 2008), Williams' number change had nothing to do with the ''Major League'' film. Williams said he had wanted the number 99 for years because of his admiration for the football player [[Mark Gastineau]], who also wore number 99. Williams said that he did not change his number until 1993 because that was his first chance to do it.</ref>\n\nIn the years since its release ''Major League'' has become a beloved film of many professional baseball players and announcers, and is often referenced during game broadcasts. For example, in 2014, for the film's 25th anniversary, Major League catcher [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]] filmed a one-man tribute to the film, with Ross playing the part (among others) of Lou Brown, Pedro Cerrano, Willie Mays Hayes, Rick Vaughn, and Roger Dorn.<ref>[http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/17160334/v31760357/david-ross-recreates-major-league \"Ross recreates 'Major League',\"] MLB.com (April 2, 2014).</ref> Additionally, as part of their 2014 \"Archives\" set, the trading card company [[Topps]] celebrated the film's 25th anniversary by creating baseball cards (using the same design as the company's 1989 base set) of Roger Dorn, Jake Taylor, Eddie Harris, Rachel Phelps, Rick Vaughn, and \"Jobu.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140606115422/https://www.topps.com/major-league-25th-anniversary-wax-pack.html \"Major League 25th Anniversary Wax Pack,\"] Topps official website.

Hi Corbett was the spring training home for the Cleveland Indians from 1947 to 1992.  The star of the short film is outfielder Matt \"Mays\" Frazier, who played the role of Snipes' Willie Mays Hayes character from the original film.

Both parties were new organizations, and this was the first Presidential election their nominees contested. Unlike in 1824, Jackson defeated Adams, marking the start of Democratic dominance in Federal politics. \n\nIn 1824, with four major candidates running for President as members of only one national party, Jackson had won a plurality both of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral]] vote and of the popular vote from among the 18 states whose voters chose Presidential electors.  However, with the open support of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Henry Clay]], Adams won the subsequent [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] under the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]].  Many Jackson supporters perceived that his loss, though Constitutional, was unfair and contrary to the popular will, accusing Adams and Clay of having reached a \"[[corrupt bargain]]\" in which Clay helped Adams win the contingent election in return for the position of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Intensifying political rivalry between supporters and opponents of Jackson fractured the once-dominant [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. Jackson and allies such as [[Martin Van Buren]] and Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]] laid the foundations of the Democratic Party, while supporter, states had recently expanded [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights]] to nearly all white men in nearly all elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/democracy-exhibition/vote-voice/getting-vote/demanding-vote/white-manhood-suffrage|title=White Manhood Suffrage|date=3 May 2017|website=National Museum of American History}}</ref> For example, in 1824, state legislatures chose Presidential electors in six states, but by 1828, four had transitioned to voter choice. Also, while nationally organized parties had fielded rival candidates before, 1828 was the first election in which broadly qualified voters effectively chose the President from between nominees of two national parties, whose candidates or electors consistently appeared on all ballots. With greater perceived and real impact, voter participation grew, with 9.5% of Americans casting a vote for President, compared with 3.4% in 1824.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kish|first1=J.N.|title=U.S. Population 1776 to Present|url=https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?dsrcid=225439#rows:id=1|website=Google Fusion Tables|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}</ref> \n\nJackson was aided by the passage of the [[Tariff of Abominations|Tariff of 1828]]. Denounced by opponents as the \"Tariff of Abominations,\" the unpopular tariff and the greater charisma and popular appeal of Jackson helped him dominate the [[Southern United States|South]]<ref>''The Causes of the Civil War''. 3rd ed. New York: Touchstone, 1991</ref> and West. Adams swept [[New England]] but won only three other small states. Jackson became the first President whose home state was neither Massachusetts nor Virginia, while Adams was the second to lose re-election, following his father, [[John Adams]]. The election marked the rise of [[Jacksonian Democracy]] and the transition from the [[First Party System]] to the [[Second Party System]]. Historians debate the significance of the election, with many arguing that it marked the beginning of modern American politics by removing key barriers to voter participation and establishing a stable two-party system.<ref>David Waldstreicher, \"The Birth of Modern Politics: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and the Election of 1828./Vindicating Andrew Jackson: The 1828 Election and the Rise of the Two Party System,\" ''Journal of the Early Republic,'' Winter 2010, Vol. 30 Issue 4, pp 674-678</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nWhile Andrew Jackson won a plurality of electoral votes and the popular vote in the [[1824 United States presidential election|election of 1824]], he lost to John Quincy Adams as the election was deferred to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (by the terms of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], a presidential election in which no candidate wins a majority of the electoral vote is decided by a contingent election in the House of Representatives). [[Henry Clay]], unsuccessful candidate and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] at the time, despised Jackson, in part due to their fight for Western votes during the election, and he chose to support Adams, which led to Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\n\nA few days after the election, Adams appointed Clay his Secretary of State, a position was held by Adams and his three immediate predecessors prior to becoming president. Jackson and his followers promptly accused Clay and Adams of striking a \"[[Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]],\" and continued to lambaste the president until the 1828 election.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1824 election, the national [[Democratic-Republican Party]] collapsed as national politics became increasingly polarized between supporters of Adams and supporters of Jackson. In a prelude to the presidential election, the Jacksonians bolstered their numbers in Congress in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1826|1826 Congressional elections]], with Jackson ally [[Andrew Stevenson]] chosen as the new [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] in 1827 over Adams ally Speaker [[John W.

Giles]] released a letter from Jefferson meant to be kept private to [[Thomas Ritchie (journalist)|Thomas Ritchie]]'s ''Richmond Enquirer''. It was written after Adams's first annual message to Congress and it contained an attack from Jefferson on the incumbent administration. Giles said Jefferson's alarm was with the usurpation of the rights of the states, not with a \"military chieftain.\"<ref name=peterson /> Jefferson wrote, \"take together the decisions of the federal court, the doctrines of the President, and the misconstructions of the constitutional compact acted on by the legislature of the federal bench, and it is but too evident, that the three ruling branches of that department are in combination to strip their colleagues, the State authorities, of the powers reserved by them, and to exercise themselves all functions foreign and domestic.\" Of the Federalists, he continued, \"But this opens with a vast accession of strength from their younger recruits, who, having nothing in them of the feelings or principles of '76, now look to a single and splendid government of an aristocracy, founded on banking institutions, and moneyed incorporations under the guise and cloak of their favored branches of manufactures, commerce and navigation, riding and ruling over the plundered ploughman and beggared yeomanry.\"<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mtj1&fileName=mtj1page055.db&recNum=767 Thomas Jefferson to William Branch Giles, Dec. 26, 1825.] Peterson characterized this letter as \"one of the most influential that Jefferson ever wrote.\"</ref> The Jacksonians and [[states' rights]] men heralded its publication; the Adams men felt it a symptom of senility.<ref name=peterson /> Giles omitted a prior letter of Jefferson's praise of Adams for his role in the [[Embargo Act of 1807|embargo of 1808]]. [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]] soon collected and published Jefferson's correspondence.\n\n=== Results ===\nThe selection of electors began on October 31 with elections in Ohio and Pennsylvania and ended on November 13 with elections in North Carolina. The Electoral College met on December 3. Adams won almost exactly the same states that his father had won in the [[1800 United States presidential election|election of 1800]]: the New England states, New Jersey, and Delaware. In addition, Adams picked up Maryland, but Jackson won everything else, which resulted in a landslide victory for him in the electoral college.\n\nThe Democratic Party in Georgia was hopelessly divided into two factions (Troup vs. Clark). Both factions nominated Jackson for President, and the election was primarily a test of strength of these two factions, with the JQA Electors running a poor third. The winning slate, which received a 3,000 vote majority, <ref> Norwich Courier, December 3 1828 </ref> was not pledged to any Vice Presidential Candidate. Consequently, seven of the nine Presidential Electors who voted for Jackson for President chose William Smith for Vice President.\n\nWith this in mind, Jackson won the popular vote by 12.3%, but the result was far closer than it appeared, as a shift of 20,000 votes in Kentucky, New York and Ohio would have won Adams the election, while a shift of 12,500 votes in New York, Ohio and Louisiana would have left both Calhoun and Rush short of the 131 electoral votes required to win the vice-presidency, forcing a contingent election for vice-president in the Senate.\n\nThis was the last election in which the Democrats won Kentucky until 1856 and the last in which the Democrats won South Carolina until 1840. It is also the only election where Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Vermont voted for the National Republicans and the last time that New Hampshire voted against the Democrats until 1856 and the last time Maine did so until 1840. It was also the only election in which an electoral vote split [[1828 United States presidential election in Maine|occurred in Maine]] until the [[2016 United States presidential election|election of 2016]].\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=<sup>(a)</sup>|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Andrew Jackson]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[Tennessee]]|pv=642,553|pv_pct=55.97%|ev=178|vp_count=2|vp_name=[[John C.

It was held from Friday, October 31 to Tuesday, December 2, 1828. It featured a re-match of the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 election]], as [[President of the United States|President]] [[John Quincy Adams]] of the [[National Republican Party]] faced [[Andrew Jackson]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Both parties were new organizations, and this was the first Presidential election their nominees contested. Unlike in 1824, Jackson defeated Adams, marking the start of Democratic dominance in Federal politics. \n\nIn 1824, with four major candidates running for President as members of only one national party, Jackson had won a plurality both of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral]] vote and of the popular vote from among the 18 states whose voters chose Presidential electors.  However, with the open support of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Henry Clay]], Adams won the subsequent [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] under the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]].  Many Jackson supporters perceived that his loss, though Constitutional, was unfair and contrary to the popular will, accusing Adams and Clay of having reached a \"[[corrupt bargain]]\" in which Clay helped Adams win the contingent election in return for the position of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Intensifying political rivalry between supporters and opponents of Jackson fractured the once-dominant [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. Jackson and allies such as [[Martin Van Buren]] and Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]] laid the foundations of the Democratic Party, while supporter, states had recently expanded [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights]] to nearly all white men in nearly all elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/democracy-exhibition/vote-voice/getting-vote/demanding-vote/white-manhood-suffrage|title=White Manhood Suffrage|date=3 May 2017|website=National Museum of American History}}</ref> For example, in 1824, state legislatures chose Presidential electors in six states, but by 1828, four had transitioned to voter choice. Also, while nationally organized parties had fielded rival candidates before, 1828 was the first election in which broadly qualified voters effectively chose the President from between nominees of two national parties, whose candidates or electors consistently appeared on all ballots. With greater perceived and real impact, voter participation grew, with 9.5% of Americans casting a vote for President, compared with 3.4% in 1824.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kish|first1=J.N.|title=U.S. Population 1776 to Present|url=https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?dsrcid=225439#rows:id=1|website=Google Fusion Tables|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}</ref> \n\nJackson was aided by the passage of the [[Tariff of Abominations|Tariff of 1828]]. Denounced by opponents as the \"Tariff of Abominations,\" the unpopular tariff and the greater charisma and popular appeal of Jackson helped him dominate the [[Southern United States|South]]<ref>''The Causes of the Civil War''. 3rd ed. New York: Touchstone, 1991</ref> and West. Adams swept [[New England]] but won only three other small states. Jackson became the first President whose home state was neither Massachusetts nor Virginia, while Adams was the second to lose re-election, following his father, [[John Adams]]. The election marked the rise of [[Jacksonian Democracy]] and the transition from the [[First Party System]] to the [[Second Party System]]. Historians debate the significance of the election, with many arguing that it marked the beginning of modern American politics by removing key barriers to voter participation and establishing a stable two-party system.<ref>David Waldstreicher, \"The Birth of Modern Politics: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and the Election of 1828./Vindicating Andrew Jackson: The 1828 Election and the Rise of the Two Party System,\" ''Journal of the Early Republic,'' Winter 2010, Vol. 30 Issue 4, pp 674-678</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nWhile Andrew Jackson won a plurality of electoral votes and the popular vote in the [[1824 United States presidential election|election of 1824]], he lost to John Quincy Adams as the election was deferred to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (by the terms of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], a presidential election in which no candidate wins a majority of the electoral vote is decided by a contingent election in the House of Representatives). [[Henry Clay]], unsuccessful candidate and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] at the time, despised Jackson, in part due to their fight for Western votes during the election, and he chose to support Adams, which led to Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\n\nA few days after the election, Adams appointed Clay his Secretary of State, a position was held by Adams and his three immediate predecessors prior to becoming president. Jackson and his followers promptly accused Clay and Adams of striking a \"[[Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]],\" and continued to lambaste the president until the 1828 election.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1824 election, the national [[Democratic-Republican Party]] collapsed as national politics became increasingly polarized between supporters of Adams and supporters of Jackson. In a prelude to the presidential election, the Jacksonians bolstered their numbers in Congress in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1826|1826 Congressional elections]], with Jackson ally [[Andrew Stevenson]] chosen as the new [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] in 1827 over Adams ally Speaker [[John W.

Adams chose [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Richard Rush]], a Pennsylvanian known for his protectionist views, as his running mate. Adams, who was personally popular in New England, hoped to assemble a coalition in which Clay attracted Western voters, Rush attracted voters in the middle states, and Webster won over former members of the [[Federalist Party]].<ref name=\"wald1\">{{cite book|last1=Waldstreicher|first1=David|title=A Companion to John Adams and John Quincy Adams|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=320}}</ref>\n\n== General election ==\n=== Campaign ===\n[[File:Some account of the bloody deeds of General Andrew Jackson, circa 1828.png|thumb|275px|\"Some account of the bloody deeds of General Andrew Jackson\", {{circa|1828}}]]\nThe campaign was marked by large amounts of nasty \"[[mudslinging]].\" Jackson's marriage, for example, came in for vicious attack. When Jackson married his wife [[Rachel Jackson|Rachel]] in 1791, the couple believed that she was divorced, however the divorce was not yet finalized, so he had to remarry her once the legal papers were complete. In the Adams campaign's hands, this became a scandal.

[[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] stated on the floor of the Senate that he \"never will be palsied by any power save the constitution, and the will of my constituents.\" Jackson wrote that a lavish government combined with contempt of the constituents could lead to despotism, if not checked by the \"voice of the people.\"\nModern campaigning was also introduced by Jackson.

Jefferson's son-in-law, former Virginia Governor [[Thomas Mann Randolph Jr.|Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr.]], said in 1826 that Jefferson had a \"strong repugnance\" to Henry Clay.<ref name=peterson /> Randolph publicly stated that Jefferson became friendly to Jackson's candidacy as early as the summer of 1825, perhaps because of the \"corrupt bargain\" charge, and thought of Jackson as \"an honest, sincere, clear-headed and strong-minded man; of the soundest political principles\" and \"the only hope left\" to reverse the increasing powers assumed by the federal government.<ref>[[Merrill D.

Giles]] released a letter from Jefferson meant to be kept private to [[Thomas Ritchie (journalist)|Thomas Ritchie]]'s ''Richmond Enquirer''. It was written after Adams's first annual message to Congress and it contained an attack from Jefferson on the incumbent administration. Giles said Jefferson's alarm was with the usurpation of the rights of the states, not with a \"military chieftain.\"<ref name=peterson /> Jefferson wrote, \"take together the decisions of the federal court, the doctrines of the President, and the misconstructions of the constitutional compact acted on by the legislature of the federal bench, and it is but too evident, that the three ruling branches of that department are in combination to strip their colleagues, the State authorities, of the powers reserved by them, and to exercise themselves all functions foreign and domestic.\" Of the Federalists, he continued, \"But this opens with a vast accession of strength from their younger recruits, who, having nothing in them of the feelings or principles of '76, now look to a single and splendid government of an aristocracy, founded on banking institutions, and moneyed incorporations under the guise and cloak of their favored branches of manufactures, commerce and navigation, riding and ruling over the plundered ploughman and beggared yeomanry.\"<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=mtj1&fileName=mtj1page055.db&recNum=767 Thomas Jefferson to William Branch Giles, Dec. 26, 1825.] Peterson characterized this letter as \"one of the most influential that Jefferson ever wrote.\"</ref> The Jacksonians and [[states' rights]] men heralded its publication; the Adams men felt it a symptom of senility.<ref name=peterson /> Giles omitted a prior letter of Jefferson's praise of Adams for his role in the [[Embargo Act of 1807|embargo of 1808]]. [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]] soon collected and published Jefferson's correspondence.\n\n=== Results ===\nThe selection of electors began on October 31 with elections in Ohio and Pennsylvania and ended on November 13 with elections in North Carolina. The Electoral College met on December 3. Adams won almost exactly the same states that his father had won in the [[1800 United States presidential election|election of 1800]]: the New England states, New Jersey, and Delaware. In addition, Adams picked up Maryland, but Jackson won everything else, which resulted in a landslide victory for him in the electoral college.\n\nThe Democratic Party in Georgia was hopelessly divided into two factions (Troup vs. Clark). Both factions nominated Jackson for President, and the election was primarily a test of strength of these two factions, with the JQA Electors running a poor third. The winning slate, which received a 3,000 vote majority, <ref> Norwich Courier, December 3 1828 </ref> was not pledged to any Vice Presidential Candidate. Consequently, seven of the nine Presidential Electors who voted for Jackson for President chose William Smith for Vice President.\n\nWith this in mind, Jackson won the popular vote by 12.3%, but the result was far closer than it appeared, as a shift of 20,000 votes in Kentucky, New York and Ohio would have won Adams the election, while a shift of 12,500 votes in New York, Ohio and Louisiana would have left both Calhoun and Rush short of the 131 electoral votes required to win the vice-presidency, forcing a contingent election for vice-president in the Senate.\n\nThis was the last election in which the Democrats won Kentucky until 1856 and the last in which the Democrats won South Carolina until 1840. It is also the only election where Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Vermont voted for the National Republicans and the last time that New Hampshire voted against the Democrats until 1856 and the last time Maine did so until 1840. It was also the only election in which an electoral vote split [[1828 United States presidential election in Maine|occurred in Maine]] until the [[2016 United States presidential election|election of 2016]].\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=<sup>(a)</sup>|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Andrew Jackson]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[Tennessee]]|pv=642,553|pv_pct=55.97%|ev=178|vp_count=2|vp_name=[[John C.

''Military Collector's Club of Canada Journal'' (Spring 1997 issue)</ref> There were one to five silver chevrons on drab backing for every two years of service or a maple leaf in silver thread on a drab cloth circle to represent 10 years of service. Chevron points were worn either up or down; even official documents and photos were confused on the matter. Further awards after 10 years were believed covered by the [[Canadian Forces Decoration]], which was awarded after 12 years and a clasp added for every 10 years afterwards.\n\nQualifying service could include prior active service in the active reserves of the Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force or the regular or territorial forces of a fellow Commonwealth member nation. Service in Canadian Army reserve forces units (like the regular reserve, supplementary reserve and reserve militia) did not count. The awarding of Service Stripes ceased in 1968 after the [[unification of the Canadian Armed Forces]].\n\n== Canadian Army distinctive corps insignia ==\nEvery branch or corps of the Canadian Army uses a distinctive colour.

In the guard regiments, warrant officers are known as \"colour sergeants\" and second lieutenants are known as \"ensigns\".\n\n[[File:NAVY-LtCmd-Surgeon.png|thumb|80px|LCdr (medical)'s sleeve variant]]\nExcept for those who acquired the Canadian Forces mess dress between 1968 and 2010, naval officers have always worn the [[Royal Navy]]-style executive curl rank insignia on mess uniforms (see [[Royal Navy officer rank insignia]]). The colour designations for specialist officers are not used except for naval medical officers who may use a variant of the standard rank slip-ons and shoulder boards incorporating a scarlet red background between the gold braid of their rank insignia and naval medical service officers (nursing officers, pharmacy officers, health care administration officers, social work officers, physiotherapy officers, and bioscience officers) who have shoulder boards incorporating a dull cherry red background between the strips of their rank.\n\n==Reinstatement of Royal Canadian Navy rank and insignia==\nWhen the Canadian Navy was established in 1910 it was natural to adopt the same straight rings with the [[executive curl]] for the permanent navy that was designated as the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) in August 1911 and subsequently the \"wavy\" shaped rings for the [[Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve]] (RCNVR) and the rings of narrow interwoven gold lace for the [[Royal Canadian Navy Reserve]] (RCNR). Other variations in rank insignia included sky blue lace with a diamond shaped loop for officers of the [[Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service]], and warranted [[Royal Canadian Sea Cadets|Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps]] officers, who had a small anchor in place of the executive curl.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy was reorganized with a single reserve component. In 1946 the distinctive wavy gold braid of the reserves gave way to the straight braided executive curl of the regular force until 1968. With the integration of the [[Canadian Forces]] the sea element was designated as Canadian Forces Maritime Command. Unembellished straight braid became the common rank insignia for officers of both the regular and reserve forces. The executive curl rank insignia has been in continuous use in the Royal Canadian Navy, but from 1968 to 2010 it appeared only on navy mess dress.\n\nOn 5 March 2010, the Canadian House of Commons passed a motion (moved by [[Guy Lauzon]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://openparliament.ca/hansards/2171/184/only/ |title=Guy Lauzon on Canadian Navy |date=5 March 2010 |work=Hansard |accessdate=10 January 2011}}</ref>) recommending the executive curl be reinstated on the Canadian navy uniform. Subsequently, in recognition of the Canadian Naval centennial, [[Peter MacKay]], [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]], authorized the use of the executive curl for the Canadian Navy on 2 May 2010. The insignia became effective on 11 June 2010, on the occasion of the Pacific Canadian Naval International Fleet Review parade of nations in Victoria, B.C.<ref>Marotte. B. (May. 03, 2010).

On [[Uniforms of the Canadian Armed Forces#Distinctive Environmental Uniform|DEU]] shirts, sweaters, and outerwear; and [[Uniforms of the Canadian Armed Forces#Operational dress|operational dress]] shirts and jackets, rank insignia are worn on [[shoulder mark|slip-ons]] with the word \"CANADA\" or a regimental/branch title embroidered underneath. Flag/general officers' slip-ons include only the crown, crossed sabre and baton, and maple leaves worn on the shoulder straps; they do not include the braid worn on the sleeve. Army NCM slip-ons for DEU shirts, sweaters, and outerwear display only the word \"CANADA\" or a regimental/branch title, rank insignia being worn instead as enamelled metal pins on collar points or lapels.\n\n==Service stripes==\nFrom 1955 to 1968 Militia personnel were permitted to wear service insignia on the right jacket sleeve.<ref>[http://www.canadiansoldiers.com/insignia/service.htm Service Stripes]</ref><ref>Grimshaw, Lou. ''Military Collector's Club of Canada Journal'' (Spring 1997 issue)</ref> There were one to five silver chevrons on drab backing for every two years of service or a maple leaf in silver thread on a drab cloth circle to represent 10 years of service. Chevron points were worn either up or down; even official documents and photos were confused on the matter. Further awards after 10 years were believed covered by the [[Canadian Forces Decoration]], which was awarded after 12 years and a clasp added for every 10 years afterwards.\n\nQualifying service could include prior active service in the active reserves of the Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force or the regular or territorial forces of a fellow Commonwealth member nation. Service in Canadian Army reserve forces units (like the regular reserve, supplementary reserve and reserve militia) did not count. The awarding of Service Stripes ceased in 1968 after the [[unification of the Canadian Armed Forces]].\n\n== Canadian Army distinctive corps insignia ==\nEvery branch or corps of the Canadian Army uses a distinctive colour. Applicable only to officers, they are indicated by coloured borders of rank insignia on DEU shirt and sweater slip-ons and on [[mess dress]].<ref>11110-1 (G7-4), 26 Feb 2014, OPERATION ORDER - CANADIAN ARMY IDENTITY B.

In the guard regiments, warrant officers are known as \"colour sergeants\" and second lieutenants are known as \"ensigns\".\n\n[[File:NAVY-LtCmd-Surgeon.png|thumb|80px|LCdr (medical)'s sleeve variant]]\nExcept for those who acquired the Canadian Forces mess dress between 1968 and 2010, naval officers have always worn the [[Royal Navy]]-style executive curl rank insignia on mess uniforms (see [[Royal Navy officer rank insignia]]). The colour designations for specialist officers are not used except for naval medical officers who may use a variant of the standard rank slip-ons and shoulder boards incorporating a scarlet red background between the gold braid of their rank insignia and naval medical service officers (nursing officers, pharmacy officers, health care administration officers, social work officers, physiotherapy officers, and bioscience officers) who have shoulder boards incorporating a dull cherry red background between the strips of their rank.\n\n==Reinstatement of Royal Canadian Navy rank and insignia==\nWhen the Canadian Navy was established in 1910 it was natural to adopt the same straight rings with the [[executive curl]] for the permanent navy that was designated as the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) in August 1911 and subsequently the \"wavy\" shaped rings for the [[Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve]] (RCNVR) and the rings of narrow interwoven gold lace for the [[Royal Canadian Navy Reserve]] (RCNR). Other variations in rank insignia included sky blue lace with a diamond shaped loop for officers of the [[Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service]], and warranted [[Royal Canadian Sea Cadets|Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps]] officers, who had a small anchor in place of the executive curl.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy was reorganized with a single reserve component. In 1946 the distinctive wavy gold braid of the reserves gave way to the straight braided executive curl of the regular force until 1968. With the integration of the [[Canadian Forces]] the sea element was designated as Canadian Forces Maritime Command. Unembellished straight braid became the common rank insignia for officers of both the regular and reserve forces. The executive curl rank insignia has been in continuous use in the Royal Canadian Navy, but from 1968 to 2010 it appeared only on navy mess dress.\n\nOn 5 March 2010, the Canadian House of Commons passed a motion (moved by [[Guy Lauzon]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://openparliament.ca/hansards/2171/184/only/ |title=Guy Lauzon on Canadian Navy |date=5 March 2010 |work=Hansard |accessdate=10 January 2011}}</ref>) recommending the executive curl be reinstated on the Canadian navy uniform. Subsequently, in recognition of the Canadian Naval centennial, [[Peter MacKay]], [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]], authorized the use of the executive curl for the Canadian Navy on 2 May 2010. The insignia became effective on 11 June 2010, on the occasion of the Pacific Canadian Naval International Fleet Review parade of nations in Victoria, B.C.<ref>Marotte. B. (May. 03, 2010).

Retrieved on: 20 June 2010.</ref>\n\nMore than 54 countries including Canada and 18 other of the 22 Commonwealth navies use the insignia. Most navies that do not use the executive curl insignia substitute a star or other national device above the top row of lace such as the United States Navy and the French Navy.\n\n===Timeline of

This rank insignia is based on the shoulder board rank insignia of Royal Canadian Navy flag officers. The rank insignia of general officers now consists of a crown, crossed sabre and baton, and a series of maple leaves on shoulder straps. Additionally, general officers wear one broad gold band on each of the lower sleeves of the service dress tunic.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/news/2016/04/canadian-army-announces-changes-to-the-general-officer-rank-insignia.html | title=Canadian Army Announces Changes to the General Officer Rank Insignia | publisher=Department of National Defence | date=April 2, 2016 | accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> \n\nOn the centenary of the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], 9 April 2017, the Bath Star pip was replaced by the \"Vimy Star\".

It was developed as a co-production between [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Universal Studios]], [[20th Century Fox]], and the American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It premiered on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada (which was owned by [[Western International Communications|WIC]] at the time before being acquired by [[Canwest Global]] in 2000), 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was also shown in some countries for a limited time in cinemas.\n\nThe film was the first attempt to revive ''Doctor Who'' following its suspension in 1989. It was intended as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a new American-produced ''Doctor Who'' TV series.  It introduced [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] in his only televised appearance as the character until \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" in 2013 (though McGann has portrayed the Doctor also in various audio productions).  It also marks the final appearance of [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the [[Seventh Doctor]], the only appearance of [[Daphne Ashbrook]] as [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Grace Holloway]], and the only appearance of [[Eric Roberts]]'s version of [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].  Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005.<ref name=\"Segal\" /> The only ''Doctor Who'' episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', and a 2003 animation, ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nAlthough the film was primarily produced by different people than the 1963\u20131989 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a \"re-imagining\" or \"[[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\" of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], to date the only episode of ''Doctor Who'' filmed in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{Long plot|episode|date=June 2017}}\n}}\nFollowing [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s trial and execution at the hands of the [[Dalek]]s, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], currently in his [[Seventh Doctor|seventh incarnation]], is transporting the Master's remains to [[Gallifrey]] via his [[TARDIS]]. En route, the box with the remains breaks open and an ooze leaks out, infecting the TARDIS. The Doctor is forced to make an emergency materialisation in San Francisco's [[Chinatown]] on 30 December 1999.\n\nAs he exits and locks the TARDIS, the Doctor is shot by a gang chasing down Chang Lee, a young [[Chinese-American]] man. Lee calls for an ambulance and escorts the unconscious Doctor to a hospital, unaware the ooze from the TARDIS has gotten aboard the ambulance. At the hospital, after the bullets are removed, [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Dr [[Grace Holloway]] attempts surgery to stabilise his unusual heartbeat, but is confused by his strange double-heart anatomy, and accidentally lodges a cardiac probe in the Doctor's body, apparently killing him. The Doctor's body is taken to the morgue, while Lee steals the Doctor's possessions, including the TARDIS key. Meanwhile, the ooze takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce, transforming him into a new body for the Master.\n\nLater, the Doctor's body [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerates]], and the [[Eighth Doctor|new Doctor]], suffering amnesia, gathers clothes from an upcoming fancy dress party. He recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation, and follows her to her car, proving to her he is the same man by pulling out the cardiac probe. Holloway takes him home to recover. Lee returns to the TARDIS where the Master arrives and puts him under his mind control by claiming the Doctor had stolen his body. The Master convinces Lee to open the TARDIS and then to open the [[Eye of Harmony]] within it, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him, and tries to block the scan. He warns Holloway that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken, and potentially destroy the Earth by midnight on New Year's Eve if they cannot close it. However, he needs an [[atomic clock]] to do so, and Holloway finds one on display at  the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.\n\nOutside, they find the ambulance with the Master and Lee waiting for them, offering them a ride. The Doctor does not immediately recognise the Master, but discovers his true identity en route, and he and Holloway escape, but not before the Master can spit an ooze-like substance on Holloway's wrist. The two continue to the Institute and obtain the clock, returning to the TARDIS. The Doctor installs the clock and successfully closes the Eye, but finds the damage to reality too great and that he must revert time before the Eye was opened to prevent the destruction of Earth. As he connects the proper TARDIS circuits to do this, the Master remotely takes control of Holloway's body, causing her eyes to become inhuman, and she strikes the Doctor unconscious.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|275px|thumbnail|The Doctor and the Master in their climactic battle]]\nThe Doctor wakes to find himself chained above the Eye, the Master poised to take his remaining regenerations while Lee and Holloway watch. The Doctor is able to break the Master's control on Lee, and Lee refuses to open the Eye for the Master. The Master kills him, and then releases his control on Holloway to return her eyes to normal. He forces her to open the Eye and then begins drawing the Doctor's lifeforce. Holloway, under her own control, is able to complete the final circuits to put the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern, preventing Earth's destruction, and then goes to free the Doctor. The Master kills her, but this has given enough time for the Doctor to free himself and attack the Master. The Doctor gains the upper hand and pushes the Master into the Eye. The Eye closes and time reverts a few minutes, undoing Lee and Holloway's deaths.\n\nWith no further risk to Earth, the Doctor prepares to leave. Lee returns his possessions, and the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco on the next New Year's Eve. The Doctor offers Holloway the opportunity to travel with him, but she politely refuses, and instead kisses him goodbye.

The device was previously destroyed in [[The Visitation (Doctor Who)| \"The Visitation\"]]. The jelly babies, which the [[Fourth Doctor]] had a fondness for, also reappear during the opening scene and then later during the story.\n\n*The [[Seventh Doctor]] wears his trademark panama hat which he wore throughout his tenure in the Classic Series, which was actually owned by [[Sylvester McCoy]] himself.\n\n*The [[Eighth Doctor]] mentions that he once met [[Leonardo Di Vinci]] when the artist had a cold and had met [[Puccini]] during the last years of the composer's life.\n\n*The [[Eye of Harmony]] in the [[TARDIS|TARDIS' Cloister Room]] was previously located on the Doctor's home planet [[Gallifrey]].\n\n*The [[Eighth Doctor]] shows Grace and Chang Lee where [[Gallifrey]] is, remarking that the planet \"a good ten minutes in this old thing.\"\n\n*The Doctor's romantic nature in this story would later be shown with the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors when the series returned in 2005.\n\n===Cast notes===\n* Yee Jee Tso would later return in 2002 to play Major Jal Brant in the [[Seventh Doctor]] audio drama ''[[Excelis Decays]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/3-Doctor-Who-Excelis-Decays|title=Doctor Who \u2013 Excelis Decays|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref> and Doctor Reece Goddard in the [[Sixth Doctor]] webcast ''[[Real Time (Doctor Who)|Real Time]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/Doctor-Who-Real-Time|title=Doctor Who \u2013 Real Time|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>\n*Daphne Ashbrook would later return in 2004 alongside [[Paul McGann]]'s [[Eighth Doctor]] as Perfection in the audio drama ''[[The Next Life (audio drama)|The Next Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/64-Doctor-Who-The-Next-Life|title=Doctor Who \u2013 The Next Life|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>\n* Tso and Ashbrook returned to Big Finish together playing Captain Ruth Matheson and Warrant Officer Charlie Sato of UNIT in the audio dramas ''Tales From The Vault''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/releases/v/tales-from-the-vault-501 |title=6.01.

It was hoped that, would the telemovie be successful, Fox might be persuaded to reconsider a series; however, the telemovie's ratings performance in America was not strong enough to hold Fox's interest.\n\nThe production budget for the movie (as revealed in the book ''Doctor Who: Regeneration'') was US$5 million, with the [[Fox Network]] spending $2.5 million, [[BBC Television]] contributing $300,000, and the remaining $2.2 million split between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Universal Television]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe producers of the television movie compiled several lists of actors to consider for the part of the Doctor. Among early thoughts were [[Michael Crawford]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Trevor Eve]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], and [[Jonathan Pryce]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All were uninterested in the project, or unavailable for the intended filming dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nCasting sessions took place in March 1994; actors who actually auditioned for the role include [[Liam Cunningham (actor)|Liam Cunningham]], [[Mark McGann]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Tim McInnerny]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], [[Peter Woodward]], [[John Sessions]], [[Anthony Head]], and [[Tony Slattery]]. Paul McGann was first considered around the time of these auditions, but did not formally audition for the part until later.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip Segal |first2=Gary |last2=Russell |authorlink2=Gary Russell |title=Doctor Who:Regeneration |year=2000 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=London |isbn=0-00-710591-6}}</ref>\n\nAmong the actors who were invited to audition for the role of the Doctor but declined the opportunity were [[Christopher Eccleston]]<ref name=\"eccleston\">{{cite journal |author=Hickman, Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Hickman |title=Revolution #9 |page=11 |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=343| location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=[[Panini UK]] |date=26 May 2004 }}</ref> and [[Peter Capaldi]].<ref name=\"capaldi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |title=Capaldi could\u2019ve been the Eighth Doctor! |last1=Bates |first1=Philip |date=1 August 2014 |website=Kasterborous.com |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053048/http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Eccleston and Capaldi would go on to play the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Twelfth Doctor|Twelfth]] incarnations of the Doctor, respectively, in the revived series of ''Doctor Who'' which began in 2005. Eccleston turned down the offer to audition for the TV Movie because at the time he felt he was not yet an established enough actor and did not want to be associated with a \"brand name\" so early in his career.<ref name=\"eccleston\"/> Capaldi declined because he felt it was unlikely that he would be given the part.<ref name=\"capaldi\"/>\n\nOf those actors who originally auditioned for the role of the Doctor, a number would go on to guest star in the series when it returned from 2005:\n*Anthony Head guest starred in the Series 2 episode \"[[School Reunion]]\" as Mr. Finch.\n*Tim McInnerny guest-starred in the Series 4 episode \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\" as Klineman Halpen.\n*Liam Cunningham guest-starred in the Series 7 episode, \"[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]\" as Captain Zhukov. \n*John Sessions guest-starred in the Series 8 episode \"[[Mummy on the Orient Express]]\" as the voice of the homicidal computer GUS.\n\n===Production===\nThe movie was filmed on 35mm film in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], the first time any ''Doctor Who'' story had been filmed in North America.\n\nIn the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Weird Science\", and on the DVD commentary, Sylvester McCoy reveals that during the sequence where he locks the casket with his [[sonic screwdriver]], he held the tool pointing the wrong way around (although in the original series, it is seen being used both ways). The sonic screwdriver was blurred in post-production to conceal the error.\n\n===Post-production===\nThe opening pre-credits sequence went through a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. Tipple is still credited as \"The Old Master\", though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as \"The Old Doctor\"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', as the Master observes [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s Doctor.\n\nInstead of designing a new ''Doctor Who'' logo for this film, it was decided instead to use a modified version of the logo that was used for the [[Jon Pertwee]] era of the original series (with the exception of the final season). This logo, being the last logo used on an \"official\" Doctor Who broadcast before the 2005 revival, was, until 2018, used by the BBC for most ''Doctor Who'' merchandise relating to the first eight Doctors. In 2018, efforts were made to make the show's merchandise more uniform, and so most items of merchandise began to use the logo designed for Jodie Whittaker's time as the Doctor, abandoning the \"Movie\" logo for the first time in 22 years.\n\n[[John Debney]] was commissioned to write the score for this film, and intended to replace [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme with a new composition. Ultimately Debney did in fact use an arrangement of Grainer's music for the theme, although Grainer goes uncredited.\n\n=== Alternative titles and labelling ===\nThere is some disagreement over exactly what the movie should be called. The production documentation only referred to the project as ''Doctor Who''{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Segal suggested the unofficial title ''Enemy Within'' as an alternative at Manopticon 5, apparently after being repeatedly asked what the actual title for the movie was{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Both [[DVD]] releases are labelled ''Doctor Who: The Movie''. The [[VHS]] release contains both the name ''Doctor Who'' and the phrase, ''The Sensational Feature Length Film'' (plausibly read as a subtitle). The most common fan usage appears to refer to it as \"The Television Movie\" or \"TVM\", or variations thereof.\n\nUpon translation into French, this film was renamed ''Le Seigneur du Temps'' (literal translation: \"The Lord of Time\").\n\n\"TVM\" is the production code used in the BBC's online episode guide.<ref name=\"movie\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml\n| title = The TV Movie: Details\n| accessdate = 2007-07-26\n| last = Howe\n| first = David J.\n| authorlink = David J.

This marked the first time that footage from the original BBC series had been shown on a major American network. The advertisements also used a different arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music from that heard in the film.\n\nThe movie received disappointing US ratings. It received 5.6 million viewers, a total 9% share of the audience.<ref name=\"DWM 433 page 53\">{{cite journal| author= Bailey, David|date=April 2011 |title=Doctor Who| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]| publisher=[[Panini Comics]]| issue=#433| page=53}}</ref> However, when shown on [[BBC One]] in the United Kingdom on Monday 27 May at 8.30pm, thirteen days after its American broadcast, it received over 9 million viewers in the UK alone. It received a 75% [[Audience Appreciation]] score.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Third Doctor]] actor [[Jon Pertwee]] died a few days after the US broadcast of the film, and the UK broadcast included an epitaph to the actor. The UK broadcast was also edited for broadcast in a pre-[[Watershed (television)|Watershed]] timeslot, with around 1 minute of cuts made. The scenes where Chang Lee's friends are fired upon was cut because of the BBC's sensitivity about [[gun violence]] following the [[Dunblane massacre]] three months before.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The operating room scene was also extensively cut, in particular shots involving the cardiac probe and the Seventh Doctor's dying scream,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the shot of the Master breaking Chang Lee's neck was also removed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMaureen Paton in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' praised the movie \"At last we have a grown-up hi-tech Doctor Who in Paul McGann...only a low-tech Luddite would miss the endearing amateurism of the old teatime serial format...the makers would be mad not to pursue the option of a series.\"<ref name=\"th\">{{cite book |first1=David J. |last1=Howe |authorlink1=David J.

It was the first novelisation of a televised ''Doctor Who'' story to not be published by [[Target Books]] (or related companies) since ''[[The Crusade (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who and the Crusaders]]'' in 1966.\n\nBasing the adaptation on an early draft of the script, Russell adjusted some details to make it more consistent with the original series, and the novelisation also contains elements that were cut from the shooting script for timing reasons.\n* The novel begins with the Seventh Doctor receiving a telepathic summons from the Master (similar to ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') to collect his remains from Skaro and a short prologue detailing how the Doctor escapes from the planet with the casket. This was originally intended to be a pre-credits sequence in the movie, and was subsequently contradicted by the ending of the novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', where [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] gives the Seventh Doctor the assignment to retrieve the Master's remains.\n* More detail is given to Chang Lee and Grace's backstory, including his recruitment into the Triads and his seeking a father figure as well as flashbacks to Grace's childhood.\n* The Eighth Doctor finds the Seventh Doctor's clothing in the hospital rather than the Fourth Doctor's scarf. Also, the sequence where Chang Lee and the Master see the Seventh Doctor in the Eye of Harmony features all the previous Doctors as originally drafted.\n* The scene where the Doctor and Grace meet the motorcycle police officer is relocated to a traffic jam on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (impossible to film in the movie since it was shot on location in [[Vancouver]]).\n* When the Doctor first kisses Grace, he immediately pulls back, grins apologetically and murmurs, \"I'm sorry, don't know what came over me there.\" This makes the romantic nature of the kiss more ambiguous. Instead of the second kiss at the end, he gives her the Seventh Doctor's straw hat as a memento.\n* The Doctor is still referred to as half-human, to which the Master comments, \"The Doctor once claimed to be more than just a Time Lord \u2014 He should really have said ''less'' than a Time Lord!\" This was a reference to a line cut from ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.\n* Instead of dying and being brought back to life, Grace and Lee are merely rendered unconscious, though aware of what is happening around them. Russell also spends some time showing the Doctor and them discussing what a \"temporal orbit\" is.\n\nThe novelisation was the first ''Doctor Who'' novel published by BBC Books. The book was actually published prior to the conclusion of [[Virgin Books]]' contract for publishing original ''Doctor Who'' fiction, so the next release by BBC Books did not occur for about a year when the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series began with ''[[The Eight Doctors]]''. The novelisation was released as a standalone work and is not considered part of this series. The Eighth Doctor Adventures series ran until 2005 when it was discontinued.\n\nThe novel was also released as an [[Doctor Who audio releases|audio book]] on 2 June 1997, read by Paul McGann. This reading was later included on the 2004 [[MP3 CD]] ''Tales from the TARDIS Volume Two''. A [[Target Books]] edition titled ''The TV Movie'' will be published in paperback 11 March 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1073116/doctor-who--the-tv-movie--target-collection-/9781785945311.html|title=Doctor Who: The TV Movie (Target Collection)|first=Gary|last=Russell|website=www.penguin.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n{{Wikiquote|The Eighth Doctor}}\n{{TardisIndexFile|Doctor Who (1996)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0116118|title=Doctor Who (1996) (TV)}}\n* {{BBCCDW|id=tvmovie|title=The TV movie}}\n\n===Reviews===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110414090315/http://www.whoniverse.org/reviews/TVM.php The Whoniverse's review on ''Doctor Who: The Enemy Within'' DVD]\n\n===BBC novelisation===\n*{{Isfdb title|id=364011|title=Doctor Who}}\n\n{{Doctor Who episodes|-}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Master stories}}\n{{Dalek stories}}\n{{Skaro stories}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation}}\n{{Geoffrey Sax}}\n{{Doctor Who soundtracks|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doctor Who (1996 Film)}}\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Doctor Who]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Eighth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:1996 television films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British television films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:The Master (Doctor Who) television stories]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Jacobs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Geoffrey Sax]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:Films about amnesia]]\n[[Category:New Year films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Television films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Turn of the third millennium]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the character who appeared in two theatrical ''Dr. Who'' films|Dr. Who (Dalek films)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox Doctor Who episode\n| number             = 156\n| serial_name        = Doctor Who: The Television Movie\n| show               = DW\n| type               = television film\n| image              = [[File:Doctor Who 1996 poster.jpg|230px]]\n| caption            = 1996 promotional poster\n| doctors            =\n* [[Paul McGann]] ([[Eighth Doctor]])\n*[[Sylvester McCoy]] ([[Seventh Doctor]])\n| companion          = [[Daphne Ashbrook]] ([[Grace Holloway]])\n| guests             = \n*[[Yee Jee Tso]] \u2013 Chang Lee\n*[[Eric Roberts]] \u2013 [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]]\n*[[John Novak]] \u2013 Salinger\n*Michael David Simms \u2013 Dr. Swift\n*Eliza Roberts \u2013 Miranda\n*Dave Hurtubise \u2013 Professor Wagg\n*Dolores Drake \u2013 Curtis\n*Catherine Lough \u2013 Wheeler\n*[[Will Sasso|William Sasso]] \u2013 Pete\n*Joel Wirkkunen \u2013 Ted\n*Jeremy Radick \u2013 Gareth\n*Bill Croft \u2013 Motorcyclist Policeman\n*[[Mi-Jung Lee]] \u2013 News Anchor\n*Joanna Piros \u2013 News Anchor\n*Dee Jay Jackson \u2013 Security Man\n*Gordon Tipple \u2013 The Master on Trial\n| director           = [[Geoffrey Sax]]\n| writer             = [[Matthew Jacobs]]\n| script_editor      = None\n| producer           = Peter V.

It was developed as a co-production between [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Universal Studios]], [[20th Century Fox]], and the American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It premiered on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada (which was owned by [[Western International Communications|WIC]] at the time before being acquired by [[Canwest Global]] in 2000), 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was also shown in some countries for a limited time in cinemas.\n\nThe film was the first attempt to revive ''Doctor Who'' following its suspension in 1989. It was intended as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a new American-produced ''Doctor Who'' TV series.  It introduced [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] in his only televised appearance as the character until \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" in 2013 (though McGann has portrayed the Doctor also in various audio productions).  It also marks the final appearance of [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the [[Seventh Doctor]], the only appearance of [[Daphne Ashbrook]] as [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Grace Holloway]], and the only appearance of [[Eric Roberts]]'s version of [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].  Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005.<ref name=\"Segal\" /> The only ''Doctor Who'' episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', and a 2003 animation, ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nAlthough the film was primarily produced by different people than the 1963\u20131989 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a \"re-imagining\" or \"[[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\" of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], to date the only episode of ''Doctor Who'' filmed in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{Long plot|episode|date=June 2017}}\n}}\nFollowing [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s trial and execution at the hands of the [[Dalek]]s, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], currently in his [[Seventh Doctor|seventh incarnation]], is transporting the Master's remains to [[Gallifrey]] via his [[TARDIS]]. En route, the box with the remains breaks open and an ooze leaks out, infecting the TARDIS. The Doctor is forced to make an emergency materialisation in San Francisco's [[Chinatown]] on 30 December 1999.\n\nAs he exits and locks the TARDIS, the Doctor is shot by a gang chasing down Chang Lee, a young [[Chinese-American]] man. Lee calls for an ambulance and escorts the unconscious Doctor to a hospital, unaware the ooze from the TARDIS has gotten aboard the ambulance. At the hospital, after the bullets are removed, [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Dr [[Grace Holloway]] attempts surgery to stabilise his unusual heartbeat, but is confused by his strange double-heart anatomy, and accidentally lodges a cardiac probe in the Doctor's body, apparently killing him. The Doctor's body is taken to the morgue, while Lee steals the Doctor's possessions, including the TARDIS key. Meanwhile, the ooze takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce, transforming him into a new body for the Master.\n\nLater, the Doctor's body [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerates]], and the [[Eighth Doctor|new Doctor]], suffering amnesia, gathers clothes from an upcoming fancy dress party. He recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation, and follows her to her car, proving to her he is the same man by pulling out the cardiac probe. Holloway takes him home to recover. Lee returns to the TARDIS where the Master arrives and puts him under his mind control by claiming the Doctor had stolen his body. The Master convinces Lee to open the TARDIS and then to open the [[Eye of Harmony]] within it, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him, and tries to block the scan. He warns Holloway that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken, and potentially destroy the Earth by midnight on New Year's Eve if they cannot close it. However, he needs an [[atomic clock]] to do so, and Holloway finds one on display at  the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.\n\nOutside, they find the ambulance with the Master and Lee waiting for them, offering them a ride. The Doctor does not immediately recognise the Master, but discovers his true identity en route, and he and Holloway escape, but not before the Master can spit an ooze-like substance on Holloway's wrist. The two continue to the Institute and obtain the clock, returning to the TARDIS. The Doctor installs the clock and successfully closes the Eye, but finds the damage to reality too great and that he must revert time before the Eye was opened to prevent the destruction of Earth. As he connects the proper TARDIS circuits to do this, the Master remotely takes control of Holloway's body, causing her eyes to become inhuman, and she strikes the Doctor unconscious.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|275px|thumbnail|The Doctor and the Master in their climactic battle]]\nThe Doctor wakes to find himself chained above the Eye, the Master poised to take his remaining regenerations while Lee and Holloway watch. The Doctor is able to break the Master's control on Lee, and Lee refuses to open the Eye for the Master. The Master kills him, and then releases his control on Holloway to return her eyes to normal. He forces her to open the Eye and then begins drawing the Doctor's lifeforce. Holloway, under her own control, is able to complete the final circuits to put the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern, preventing Earth's destruction, and then goes to free the Doctor. The Master kills her, but this has given enough time for the Doctor to free himself and attack the Master. The Doctor gains the upper hand and pushes the Master into the Eye. The Eye closes and time reverts a few minutes, undoing Lee and Holloway's deaths.\n\nWith no further risk to Earth, the Doctor prepares to leave. Lee returns his possessions, and the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco on the next New Year's Eve. The Doctor offers Holloway the opportunity to travel with him, but she politely refuses, and instead kisses him goodbye. The Doctor departs alone in his TARDIS.\n\n===Continuity===\n\n*At the beginning of the film, the Seventh Doctor uses a brand new version of the [[Sonic Screwdriver]] to seal the Master's remains in a casket.

It was hoped that, would the telemovie be successful, Fox might be persuaded to reconsider a series; however, the telemovie's ratings performance in America was not strong enough to hold Fox's interest.\n\nThe production budget for the movie (as revealed in the book ''Doctor Who: Regeneration'') was US$5 million, with the [[Fox Network]] spending $2.5 million, [[BBC Television]] contributing $300,000, and the remaining $2.2 million split between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Universal Television]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe producers of the television movie compiled several lists of actors to consider for the part of the Doctor. Among early thoughts were [[Michael Crawford]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Trevor Eve]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], and [[Jonathan Pryce]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All were uninterested in the project, or unavailable for the intended filming dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nCasting sessions took place in March 1994; actors who actually auditioned for the role include [[Liam Cunningham (actor)|Liam Cunningham]], [[Mark McGann]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Tim McInnerny]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], [[Peter Woodward]], [[John Sessions]], [[Anthony Head]], and [[Tony Slattery]]. Paul McGann was first considered around the time of these auditions, but did not formally audition for the part until later.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip Segal |first2=Gary |last2=Russell |authorlink2=Gary Russell |title=Doctor Who:Regeneration |year=2000 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=London |isbn=0-00-710591-6}}</ref>\n\nAmong the actors who were invited to audition for the role of the Doctor but declined the opportunity were [[Christopher Eccleston]]<ref name=\"eccleston\">{{cite journal |author=Hickman, Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Hickman |title=Revolution #9 |page=11 |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=343| location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=[[Panini UK]] |date=26 May 2004 }}</ref> and [[Peter Capaldi]].<ref name=\"capaldi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |title=Capaldi could\u2019ve been the Eighth Doctor! |last1=Bates |first1=Philip |date=1 August 2014 |website=Kasterborous.com |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053048/http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Eccleston and Capaldi would go on to play the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Twelfth Doctor|Twelfth]] incarnations of the Doctor, respectively, in the revived series of ''Doctor Who'' which began in 2005. Eccleston turned down the offer to audition for the TV Movie because at the time he felt he was not yet an established enough actor and did not want to be associated with a \"brand name\" so early in his career.<ref name=\"eccleston\"/> Capaldi declined because he felt it was unlikely that he would be given the part.<ref name=\"capaldi\"/>\n\nOf those actors who originally auditioned for the role of the Doctor, a number would go on to guest star in the series when it returned from 2005:\n*Anthony Head guest starred in the Series 2 episode \"[[School Reunion]]\" as Mr. Finch.\n*Tim McInnerny guest-starred in the Series 4 episode \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\" as Klineman Halpen.\n*Liam Cunningham guest-starred in the Series 7 episode, \"[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]\" as Captain Zhukov. \n*John Sessions guest-starred in the Series 8 episode \"[[Mummy on the Orient Express]]\" as the voice of the homicidal computer GUS.\n\n===Production===\nThe movie was filmed on 35mm film in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], the first time any ''Doctor Who'' story had been filmed in North America.\n\nIn the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Weird Science\", and on the DVD commentary, Sylvester McCoy reveals that during the sequence where he locks the casket with his [[sonic screwdriver]], he held the tool pointing the wrong way around (although in the original series, it is seen being used both ways). The sonic screwdriver was blurred in post-production to conceal the error.\n\n===Post-production===\nThe opening pre-credits sequence went through a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. Tipple is still credited as \"The Old Master\", though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as \"The Old Doctor\"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', as the Master observes [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s Doctor.\n\nInstead of designing a new ''Doctor Who'' logo for this film, it was decided instead to use a modified version of the logo that was used for the [[Jon Pertwee]] era of the original series (with the exception of the final season). This logo, being the last logo used on an \"official\" Doctor Who broadcast before the 2005 revival, was, until 2018, used by the BBC for most ''Doctor Who'' merchandise relating to the first eight Doctors. In 2018, efforts were made to make the show's merchandise more uniform, and so most items of merchandise began to use the logo designed for Jodie Whittaker's time as the Doctor, abandoning the \"Movie\" logo for the first time in 22 years.\n\n[[John Debney]] was commissioned to write the score for this film, and intended to replace [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme with a new composition. Ultimately Debney did in fact use an arrangement of Grainer's music for the theme, although Grainer goes uncredited.\n\n=== Alternative titles and labelling ===\nThere is some disagreement over exactly what the movie should be called. The production documentation only referred to the project as ''Doctor Who''{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Segal suggested the unofficial title ''Enemy Within'' as an alternative at Manopticon 5, apparently after being repeatedly asked what the actual title for the movie was{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Both [[DVD]] releases are labelled ''Doctor Who: The Movie''. The [[VHS]] release contains both the name ''Doctor Who'' and the phrase, ''The Sensational Feature Length Film'' (plausibly read as a subtitle). The most common fan usage appears to refer to it as \"The Television Movie\" or \"TVM\", or variations thereof.\n\nUpon translation into French, this film was renamed ''Le Seigneur du Temps'' (literal translation: \"The Lord of Time\").\n\n\"TVM\" is the production code used in the BBC's online episode guide.<ref name=\"movie\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml\n| title = The TV Movie: Details\n| accessdate = 2007-07-26\n| last = Howe\n| first = David J.\n| authorlink = David J.

This marked the first time that footage from the original BBC series had been shown on a major American network. The advertisements also used a different arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music from that heard in the film.\n\nThe movie received disappointing US ratings. It received 5.6 million viewers, a total 9% share of the audience.<ref name=\"DWM 433 page 53\">{{cite journal| author= Bailey, David|date=April 2011 |title=Doctor Who| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]| publisher=[[Panini Comics]]| issue=#433| page=53}}</ref> However, when shown on [[BBC One]] in the United Kingdom on Monday 27 May at 8.30pm, thirteen days after its American broadcast, it received over 9 million viewers in the UK alone. It received a 75% [[Audience Appreciation]] score.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Third Doctor]] actor [[Jon Pertwee]] died a few days after the US broadcast of the film, and the UK broadcast included an epitaph to the actor. The UK broadcast was also edited for broadcast in a pre-[[Watershed (television)|Watershed]] timeslot, with around 1 minute of cuts made. The scenes where Chang Lee's friends are fired upon was cut because of the BBC's sensitivity about [[gun violence]] following the [[Dunblane massacre]] three months before.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The operating room scene was also extensively cut, in particular shots involving the cardiac probe and the Seventh Doctor's dying scream,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the shot of the Master breaking Chang Lee's neck was also removed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMaureen Paton in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' praised the movie \"At last we have a grown-up hi-tech Doctor Who in Paul McGann...only a low-tech Luddite would miss the endearing amateurism of the old teatime serial format...the makers would be mad not to pursue the option of a series.\"<ref name=\"th\">{{cite book |first1=David J. |last1=Howe |authorlink1=David J.

It was the first novelisation of a televised ''Doctor Who'' story to not be published by [[Target Books]] (or related companies) since ''[[The Crusade (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who and the Crusaders]]'' in 1966.\n\nBasing the adaptation on an early draft of the script, Russell adjusted some details to make it more consistent with the original series, and the novelisation also contains elements that were cut from the shooting script for timing reasons.\n* The novel begins with the Seventh Doctor receiving a telepathic summons from the Master (similar to ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') to collect his remains from Skaro and a short prologue detailing how the Doctor escapes from the planet with the casket. This was originally intended to be a pre-credits sequence in the movie, and was subsequently contradicted by the ending of the novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', where [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] gives the Seventh Doctor the assignment to retrieve the Master's remains.\n* More detail is given to Chang Lee and Grace's backstory, including his recruitment into the Triads and his seeking a father figure as well as flashbacks to Grace's childhood.\n* The Eighth Doctor finds the Seventh Doctor's clothing in the hospital rather than the Fourth Doctor's scarf. Also, the sequence where Chang Lee and the Master see the Seventh Doctor in the Eye of Harmony features all the previous Doctors as originally drafted.\n* The scene where the Doctor and Grace meet the motorcycle police officer is relocated to a traffic jam on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (impossible to film in the movie since it was shot on location in [[Vancouver]]).\n* When the Doctor first kisses Grace, he immediately pulls back, grins apologetically and murmurs, \"I'm sorry, don't know what came over me there.\" This makes the romantic nature of the kiss more ambiguous. Instead of the second kiss at the end, he gives her the Seventh Doctor's straw hat as a memento.\n* The Doctor is still referred to as half-human, to which the Master comments, \"The Doctor once claimed to be more than just a Time Lord \u2014 He should really have said ''less'' than a Time Lord!\" This was a reference to a line cut from ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.\n* Instead of dying and being brought back to life, Grace and Lee are merely rendered unconscious, though aware of what is happening around them. Russell also spends some time showing the Doctor and them discussing what a \"temporal orbit\" is.\n\nThe novelisation was the first ''Doctor Who'' novel published by BBC Books. The book was actually published prior to the conclusion of [[Virgin Books]]' contract for publishing original ''Doctor Who'' fiction, so the next release by BBC Books did not occur for about a year when the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series began with ''[[The Eight Doctors]]''. The novelisation was released as a standalone work and is not considered part of this series. The Eighth Doctor Adventures series ran until 2005 when it was discontinued.\n\nThe novel was also released as an [[Doctor Who audio releases|audio book]] on 2 June 1997, read by Paul McGann. This reading was later included on the 2004 [[MP3 CD]] ''Tales from the TARDIS Volume Two''. A [[Target Books]] edition titled ''The TV Movie'' will be published in paperback 11 March 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1073116/doctor-who--the-tv-movie--target-collection-/9781785945311.html|title=Doctor Who: The TV Movie (Target Collection)|first=Gary|last=Russell|website=www.penguin.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n{{Wikiquote|The Eighth Doctor}}\n{{TardisIndexFile|Doctor Who (1996)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0116118|title=Doctor Who (1996) (TV)}}\n* {{BBCCDW|id=tvmovie|title=The TV movie}}\n\n===Reviews===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110414090315/http://www.whoniverse.org/reviews/TVM.php The Whoniverse's review on ''Doctor Who: The Enemy Within'' DVD]\n\n===BBC novelisation===\n*{{Isfdb title|id=364011|title=Doctor Who}}\n\n{{Doctor Who episodes|-}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Master stories}}\n{{Dalek stories}}\n{{Skaro stories}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation}}\n{{Geoffrey Sax}}\n{{Doctor Who soundtracks|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doctor Who (1996 Film)}}\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Doctor Who]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Eighth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:1996 television films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British television films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:The Master (Doctor Who) television stories]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Jacobs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Geoffrey Sax]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:Films about amnesia]]\n[[Category:New Year films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Television films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Turn of the third millennium]]\n", "name_user": "ArkhamBen17", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(film)"}

The surgeon inserts a scope through the penis tip into the urethra. A laser passed through the scope delivers energy to shrink or remove excess tissue that is preventing urine flow.<ref name=mayo1>[https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/prostate-laser-surgery/about/pac-20384874 \"Prostate laser surgery\" mayoclinic.org]</ref>\n\nDifferent types of prostate laser surgery include:\n\n* VLAP technique involving the [[Nd:YAG laser]] with contact on the prostatic tissue.\n\n* [[Photoselective Vaporisation of the Prostate]] (PVP). A laser is used to melt away (vaporize) excess prostate tissue and enlarge the urinary channel.<ref name=mayo1>[https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/prostate-laser-surgery/about/pac-20384874 \"Prostate laser surgery\" mayoclinic.org]</ref> A high-power 180-watt 532&nbsp;nm wavelength laser with a 650-micrometre laser fiber is used. This fiber has an internal reflection with a 70-degree deflecting angle. It is used to vaporize the tissue to the prostatic capsule. GreenLight 532&nbsp;nm lasers target [[haemoglobin]] as the [[chromophore]] and typically have a penetration depth of 0.8&nbsp;mm (twice as deep as holmium).\n\n* [[Holmium Laser Ablation of the Prostate]] (HoLAP) is similar to PVP but uses a different type of laser.<ref name=mayo1/> HoLAP uses a 550&nbsp;um disposable side-firing fiber that directs the beam from a high-power 100-watt laser at a 70-degree angle from the fiber axis. The holmium wavelength is 2,140&nbsp;nm, which falls within the infrared portion of the spectrum and is invisible to the naked eye. Whereas GreenLight relies on haemoglobin as a chromophore, water within the target tissue is the chromophore for Holmium lasers. The penetration depth of Holmium lasers is <0.4&nbsp;mm, avoiding complications associated with tissue necrosis often found with the deeper penetration and lower peak powers of Nd:YAG lasers used in the 1990s.<ref name=\"pmid24972732\" />\n\n* * [[Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate]] (HoLEP) is used to cut and remove the excess tissue that is blocking the urethra. Another instrument is then used to cut the prostate tissue into small pieces that are easily removed. HoLEP can be an option for men who have a severely enlarged prostate.<ref name=mayo1/>  HoLEP is largely similar to the HoLAP procedure; the main difference is that this procedure is typically performed on larger prostates. Instead of ablating the tissue, the laser cuts a portion of the prostate, which is then cut into smaller pieces and flushed with irrigation fluid. As with the HoLAP procedure, there is little bleeding during or after the procedure. Three 2015 reviews found that HoLEP is superior to TURP in some respects and for some patients.<ref name=\"pmid24972732\">{{cite journal| author=Cornu JN, Ahyai S, Bachmann A, de la Rosette J, Gilling P, Gratzke C | title=A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Transurethral Procedures for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Resulting from Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Update. | journal=Eur Urol | year= 2015 | volume= 67 | issue= 6 | pages= 1066\u20131096 | pmid=24972732 | doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2014.06.017 | pmc= | url=http://www.imop.gr/sites/default/files/a_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis_of_functional_outcomes_and_complications_following_transurethral_procedures_for_lower_urinary_tract_symptoms_resulting_from_benign_prostatic_obstruction-an_update.pdf  }} [https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42463454/transurethral-resection-of-the-prostate-for-benign-prostatic-obstruction-will-it-remain-the-gold-standard.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DTransurethral_Resection_of_the_Prostate.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20190803%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20190803T185018Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=69c9e1a637f66784a913c92e5a7759e2e562362f76dd07ae619fb817ff983904 Comment in same issue of the journal].</ref><ref name=\"pmid26918132\">{{cite journal| author=van Rij S, Gilling P| title=Recent advances in treatment for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. | journal=F1000Res | year= 2015 | volume= 4 | issue=  | pages=  1482| pmid=26918132 | doi=10.12688/f1000research.7063.1 | pmc=4754003 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=26918132  }} </ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Michalak|first1=J|last2=Tzou|first2=D|last3=Funk|first3=J|title=HoLEP: the gold standard for the surgical management of BPH in the 21(st) Century.|journal=American Journal of Clinical and Experimental Urology|date=2015|volume=3|issue=1|pages=36\u201342|pmid=26069886|pmc=4446381}}</ref>\n\nBoth wavelengths, GreenLight and Holmium, ablate approximately one to two grams of tissue per minute.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nPost-surgical care often involves placement of a [[Foley catheter]] or a temporary [[prostatic stent]] to permit healing and allow urine to drain from the bladder.\n\n===Non-laser treatments===\nThe two most common types of office-based therapies are [[transurethral microwave thermotherapy]] (TUMT) and [[Transurethral needle ablation of the prostate|transurethral needle ablation]] (TUNA). Both rely on delivering enough energy to create sufficient heat to cause cell death (necrosis) in the prostate. The goal is to cause enough necrosis so that, when the dead tissue is reabsorbed by the body, the prostate shrinks, relieving the obstruction of the urethra. These procedures are typically performed with local anesthesia, and the patient returns home the same day. Some urologists have studied and published long-term data on the outcomes of these procedures, with data out to five years. \n\n* [[Transurethral microwave thermotherapy]] (TUMT) was originally approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1996, with the first generation system by EDAP Technomed.  Since 1996, other companies have received FDA approval for TUMT devices, including Urologix, Dornier, Thermatrix, Celsion, and Prostalund.  Multiple clinical studies have been published on TUMT.  The general principle underlying all the devices is that a microwave antenna that resides in a urethral catheter is placed in the intraprostatic area of the urethra.  The catheter is connected to a control box outside of the patient's body and is energized to emit microwave radiation into the prostate to heat the tissue and cause necrosis.  It is a one-time treatment that takes approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the system used.  It takes approximately 4 to 6 weeks for the damaged tissue to be reabsorbed into the patient's body.  Some of the devices incorporate circulating coolant through the treatment area with the intent of preserving the urethra while the microwave energy heats the prostatic tissue surrounding the urethra.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n* [[Transurethral needle ablation]] (TUNA) operates with a different type of energy, radio frequency (RF) energy, but is designed along the same premise as TUMT devices, that the heat the device generates will cause necrosis of the prostatic tissue and shrink the prostate. The TUNA device is inserted into the urethra using a rigid scope much like a cystoscope. The energy is delivered into the prostate using two needles that emerge from the sides of the device, through the urethral wall and into the prostate. The needle-based ablation devices are very effective at heating a localized area to a high enough temperature to cause necrosis. The treatment is typically performed in one session, but may require multiple sticks of the needles depending on the size of the prostate. The most recent [[American Urological Association]] (AUA) Guidelines for the Treatment of BPH from 2018 stated that \"TUNA is not recommended for the treatment of LUTS/BPH\".<ref name=\"pmid29775639\">{{cite journal| author=Foster HE, Barry MJ, Dahm P, Gandhi MC, Kaplan SA, Kohler TS | title=Surgical Management of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Attributed to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: AUA Guideline. | journal=J Urol | year= 2018 | volume= 200 | issue= 3 | pages= 612\u2013619 | pmid=29775639 | doi=10.1016/j.juro.2018.05.048 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=29775639  | doi-access=free }} </ref>\n\nThe [[American Urological Association]] (AUA) guidelines for the treatment of BPH from 2018 list minimally invasive therapies including TUMT - but not TUNA - as acceptable alternatives for certain patients with BPH.<ref name=\"pmid29775639\" />\n\nHowever, the [[European Association of Urology]] (EAU) has - as of 2019 - removed both TUMT and TUNA from its guidelines.<ref>[https://uroweb.org/guideline/treatment-of-non-neurogenic-male-luts/?type=summary-of-changes EAU: ''Management of Non-neurogenic Male LUTS - Summary of Changes 2019''].</ref>\n\n==Invasive therapies==\nThe two invasive surgical procedures done for BPH: \n\n* [[Transurethral resection of the prostate|Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)]]: In general prior to emergence of laser technologies, TURP had been considered the gold standard of prostate interventions for people who require a procedure.

This fiber has an internal reflection with a 70-degree deflecting angle. It is used to vaporize the tissue to the prostatic capsule. GreenLight 532&nbsp;nm lasers target [[haemoglobin]] as the [[chromophore]] and typically have a penetration depth of 0.8&nbsp;mm (twice as deep as holmium).\n\n* [[Holmium Laser Ablation of the Prostate]] (HoLAP) is similar to PVP but uses a different type of laser.<ref name=mayo1/> HoLAP uses a 550&nbsp;um disposable side-firing fiber that directs the beam from a high-power 100-watt laser at a 70-degree angle from the fiber axis. The holmium wavelength is 2,140&nbsp;nm, which falls within the infrared portion of the spectrum and is invisible to the naked eye. Whereas GreenLight relies on haemoglobin as a chromophore, water within the target tissue is the chromophore for Holmium lasers. The penetration depth of Holmium lasers is <0.4&nbsp;mm, avoiding complications associated with tissue necrosis often found with the deeper penetration and lower peak powers of Nd:YAG lasers used in the 1990s.<ref name=\"pmid24972732\" />\n\n* * [[Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate]] (HoLEP) is used to cut and remove the excess tissue that is blocking the urethra.

HoLEP can be an option for men who have a severely enlarged prostate.<ref name=mayo1/>  HoLEP is largely similar to the HoLAP procedure; the main difference is that this procedure is typically performed on larger prostates. Instead of ablating the tissue, the laser cuts a portion of the prostate, which is then cut into smaller pieces and flushed with irrigation fluid. As with the HoLAP procedure, there is little bleeding during or after the procedure.

Both rely on delivering enough energy to create sufficient heat to cause cell death (necrosis) in the prostate. The goal is to cause enough necrosis so that, when the dead tissue is reabsorbed by the body, the prostate shrinks, relieving the obstruction of the urethra. These procedures are typically performed with local anesthesia, and the patient returns home the same day. Some urologists have studied and published long-term data on the outcomes of these procedures, with data out to five years. \n\n* [[Transurethral microwave thermotherapy]] (TUMT) was originally approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1996, with the first generation system by EDAP Technomed.  Since 1996, other companies have received FDA approval for TUMT devices, including Urologix, Dornier, Thermatrix, Celsion, and Prostalund.  Multiple clinical studies have been published on TUMT.  The general principle underlying all the devices is that a microwave antenna that resides in a urethral catheter is placed in the intraprostatic area of the urethra.  The catheter is connected to a control box outside of the patient's body and is energized to emit microwave radiation into the prostate to heat the tissue and cause necrosis.  It is a one-time treatment that takes approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the system used.  It takes approximately 4 to 6 weeks for the damaged tissue to be reabsorbed into the patient's body.  Some of the devices incorporate circulating coolant through the treatment area with the intent of preserving the urethra while the microwave energy heats the prostatic tissue surrounding the urethra.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n* [[Transurethral needle ablation]] (TUNA) operates with a different type of energy, radio frequency (RF) energy, but is designed along the same premise as TUMT devices, that the heat the device generates will cause necrosis of the prostatic tissue and shrink the prostate. The TUNA device is inserted into the urethra using a rigid scope much like a cystoscope. The energy is delivered into the prostate using two needles that emerge from the sides of the device, through the urethral wall and into the prostate. The needle-based ablation devices are very effective at heating a localized area to a high enough temperature to cause necrosis. The treatment is typically performed in one session, but may require multiple sticks of the needles depending on the size of the prostate.
