An opinion survey was conducted by the firm GfK Knowledge Networks to differentiate between the different attitudes towards gun control. There was a gun policy survey and a mental illness survey. Studies showed that over 85% of those questioned supported national background checks into the mental health records of citizens attempting to purchase a gun. More than 50% of people felt that those with mental health issues were more deviant and threatening than those who had good mental health. The study also found that there is large interest in contributing to mental health awareness as well as simply prohibiting those with mental illness from purchasing guns. Nearly two thirds of respondents supported greater government spending on mental health, with more than 60% of people believing this would reduce gun violence in the USA. (Colleen L.

The study also found that there is large interest in contributing to mental health awareness as well as simply prohibiting those with mental illness from purchasing guns. Nearly two thirds of respondents supported greater government spending on mental health, with more than 60% of people believing this would reduce gun violence in the USA. (Colleen L.

Gary Gray]] (in his directorial debut) and written by [[Ice Cube]] and [[DJ Pooh]]. It follows Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and Smokey ([[Chris Tucker]]), unemployed best friends who must pay a local [[drug dealer]] on the night of Friday. The film is the first installment in the [[Friday (franchise)|''Friday'' franchise]] and co-stars [[Nia Long]], [[Tom Lister Jr.|Tiny \"Zeus\" Lister Jr.]], [[Regina King]], [[Anna Maria Horsford]], [[Bernie Mac]], and [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]].\n\nWhile developing the film, Ice Cube and DJ Pooh expressed discontent regarding the portrayal of the [[hood film|hood in film]], which they came to see as too violent and menacing. As a result, they wished to emphasize the positive aspects of life in the hood, and drew on a number of personal experiences when crafting the characters and plot points. Preparations for the film began after the pair were able to secure funding from [[New Line Cinema]], who granted finance in exchange for a seasoned comedian in one of the lead roles. During casting, Ice Cube and DJ Pooh quickly settled on Tucker.\n\n''Friday'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 26, 1995. It received positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the comedic sequences, writing, and acting performances. The film was also a commercial success, grossing $28.2 million worldwide. It has subsequently obtained a large [[cult following]], inspiring an [[Internet meme]] and several pop-cultural references. The film launched a [[Friday (franchise)|media franchise]] that includes the sequels ''[[Next Friday]]'' (2000) and ''[[Friday After Next]]'' (2002). The sequels have also gained a [[cult following]] status despite their negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nOn Friday in [[South Central Los Angeles]], Craig Jones is newly unemployed after being accused of stealing boxes. He hangs out on his front porch with his best friend, Smokey, a snappy, mischievous drug dealer who sells weed for Big Worm, the psychopathic neighborhood supplier.\n\nThroughout the day, Craig and Smokey observe the goings-on in their neighborhood. They encounter Ezal, who supports his drug habit with petty crime; Debbie, an attractive girl Craig has an interest in; Craig's neighbor, Stanley, whose wealth-like supercilious attitude bemuses Craig; Red, Craig's former co-worker and childhood friend whose bike and chain have been stolen; Deebo, the neighborhood bully who also enlists Smokey's aid in a burglary of Stanley's house; Clever, the neighborhood pastor, who is caught sleeping with Mrs. Parker by her husband; and Felisha, Debbie's sister and Deebo's ladyfriend, who irritates everyone in the neighborhood with her constant begging.\n\nSmokey, who has been smoking rather than selling his consignment of marijuana, has a confrontation with Big Worm. In an attempt to explain his money shortage, Smokey incriminates Craig. Big Worm threatens to kill Craig and Smokey if they do not give him $200 by 10:00 pm. Craig angrily confronts Smokey about his lack of initiative in selling the marijuana before deciding to help Smokey. \n\nCraig unsuccessfully attempts to borrow money from his mother Betty, his sister Dana (who eventually tells their father about the situation at hand), and his insanely jealous ladyfriend, Joi, who is seen cheating on him earlier in the film. Craig's father, Willie, eventually learns of Craig's plan, as well as the fact that Craig is carrying a gun. Willie talks to him, explaining that Craig should use his fists, instead of guns, to resolve his problems, all while telling Craig the story of how Willie's brother lost his life due to gun violence.\n\nLater on, while Craig and Smokey discuss their dilemma, they are interrupted by the arrival of Rita, a girl whom Debbie set Smokey up with earlier. Smokey then discovers she lied about her looks. Instead of resembling [[Janet Jackson]] as she originally claimed, Rita is morbidly obese, bald, and, in Smokey's words, \"looking more like [[Freddie Jackson]]\".\n\nSmokey heads to Debbie's house to complain and notices Red's bike, that Deebo had stolen, on the lawn. He sneaks in and finds Deebo asleep with Felisha. Smokey tries to retrieve the money that he and Deebo stole from Stanley's house earlier, but is interrupted by Ezal. Both escape without the money before Deebo wakes up. Smokey enlists Craig's help to go back and try again, but at that moment, Deebo rides Red's bike past them. \n\nThe two notice a black car driving slowly and hide, suspecting a possible [[drive-by shooting]]. Scared, they run to Craig's room. Then, after Willie confronts them with the situation with Big Worm, and with 10:00 approaching, Craig and Smokey decide to step out. Once outside, they notice a van parked in the middle of the street with its headlights off. The two start to run as Big Worm's men start to shoot at them.\n\nMeanwhile, the neighbors come out of their houses after hearing the gunshots. Debbie then confronts Deebo for assaulting Felisha, after Deebo falsely accuses Felisha of Smokey's attempted theft. Deebo eventually assaults Debbie, as Craig and Smokey arrive.\n\nAngered that Deebo has assaulted Debbie, Craig stands up to him, and threatens him with his gun. Deebo scoffs at the threat and Willie encourages Craig to put the gun down and fight with his hands. Then, Craig and Deebo fight. After nearly losing, Craig emerges victorious by using various objects as weapons. As Debbie tends to Craig, Smokey steals back the money he was robbed of earlier from a knocked-out Deebo and flees the scene. Red retrieves his  stolen chain and bicycle, while Ezal steals Deebo's shoes. Craig and Debbie agree to meet up the following day and Craig breaks up with Joi on the phone.\n\nLater that night, Smokey settles with Big Worm, and ends the feud. He announces that he is giving up drug dealing and going to rehabilitation. After hanging up, Smokey looks up, lights a joint, and [[Fourth wall|tells the audience]], \"I was just bullshittin'! And you know this, man!\", breaking the fourth wall and ending the movie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Craig Jones\n* [[Chris Tucker]] as Smokey \n* [[Nia Long]] as Debbie \n* [[Tiny Lister Jr.]] as Deebo\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Willie Jones\n* [[Anna Maria Horsford]] as Betty Jones\n* [[Regina King]] as Dana Jones\n* [[Paula Jai Parker]] as Joi \n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Pastor Clever\n* [[Faizon Love]] as Big Worm\n* [[DJ Pooh]] as Red      \n* [[Anthony Johnson (actor)|Anthony Johnson]] as Ezal\n* Angela Means as Felisha  <!-- The character's name is Felisha, NOT Felicia, even though the meme is usually \"Bye Felicia!\" -->\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe film also contains cameo appearances from [[F. Gary Gray]] and [[LaWanda Page]].\n\n==Production==\nPrior to ''Friday''{{'}}s release, movies such as ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' (also starring Ice Cube) and ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]]'' portrayed life in the hood as violent and menacing. Ice Cube felt that these films did not portray the full picture of living in the hood, missing a more lighthearted element, with Cube later saying, \"we had fun in the hood. We used to trip off the neighborhood.\"<ref name=\"Oralhistory\">{{cite web|last1=Diaz|first1=Angel|last2=Hahn|first2=Jason Duaine|title=And You Know This, Mannnnn: An Oral History of ''Friday''|url=http://www.complex.com/covers/oral-history-of-friday-20th-anniversary/|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=11 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221154635/https://www.complex.com/covers/oral-history-of-friday-20th-anniversary/|archive-date=December 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Therefore, Cube and DJ Pooh decided to create a film that would portray that environment.<ref name=\"Oralhistory\"/>\n\nThe script was only the third Cube had ever written; the previous two were undeveloped.<ref name=\"Oralhistory\"/> With the film, Ice Cube intended to make a \"hood classic\", one that could be \"[watched] over and over and over again\".<ref name=\"Throwawayline\">{{cite web|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|title=Ice Cube Talks 'Friday': ''Bye Felicia' Is Such a Throwaway Line'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/ice-cube-talks-friday-bye-felicia-is-such-a-throwaway-line-20150420|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref> According to Ice Cube, a majority of the film is autobiographical, with much of it being based on events that occurred in his neighborhood growing up.

Gray had previously worked with Cube on a number of occasions, and was also aiming to establish a foothold in Hollywood, initially through a short film.

Gray explained, \"Ice Cube was the nigga you loved to hate.

Gary Gray]] (in his directorial debut) and written by [[Ice Cube]] and [[DJ Pooh]]. It follows Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and Smokey ([[Chris Tucker]]), unemployed best friends who must pay a local [[drug dealer]] on the night of Friday. The film is the first installment in the [[Friday (franchise)|''Friday'' franchise]] and co-stars [[Nia Long]], [[Tom Lister Jr.|Tiny \"Zeus\" Lister Jr.]], [[Regina King]], [[Anna Maria Horsford]], [[Bernie Mac]], and [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]].\n\nWhile developing the film, Ice Cube and DJ Pooh expressed discontent regarding the portrayal of the [[hood film|hood in film]], which they came to see as too violent and menacing. As a result, they wished to emphasize the positive aspects of life in the hood, and drew on a number of personal experiences when crafting the characters and plot points. Preparations for the film began after the pair were able to secure funding from [[New Line Cinema]], who granted finance in exchange for a seasoned comedian in one of the lead roles. During casting, Ice Cube and DJ Pooh quickly settled on Tucker.\n\n''Friday'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 26, 1995. It received positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the comedic sequences, writing, and acting performances. The film was also a commercial success, grossing $28.2 million worldwide. It has subsequently obtained a large [[cult following]], inspiring an [[Internet meme]] and several pop-cultural references. The film launched a [[Friday (franchise)|media franchise]] that includes the sequels ''[[Next Friday]]'' (2000) and ''[[Friday After Next]]'' (2002). The sequels have also gained a [[cult following]] status despite their negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nOn Friday in [[South Central Los Angeles]], Craig Jones is newly unemployed after being accused of stealing boxes. He hangs out on his front porch with his best friend, Smokey, a snappy, mischievous drug dealer who sells weed for Big Worm, the psychopathic neighborhood supplier.\n\nThroughout the day, Craig and Smokey observe the goings-on in their neighborhood. They encounter Ezal, who supports his drug habit with petty crime; Debbie, an attractive girl Craig has an interest in; Craig's neighbor, Stanley, whose wealth-like supercilious attitude bemuses Craig; Red, Craig's former co-worker and childhood friend whose bike and chain have been stolen; Deebo, the neighborhood bully who also enlists Smokey's aid in a burglary of Stanley's house; Clever, the neighborhood pastor, who is caught sleeping with Mrs. Parker by her husband; and Felisha, Debbie's sister and Deebo's girlfriend, who irritates everyone in the neighborhood with her constant begging.\n\nSmokey, who has been smoking rather than selling his consignment of marijuana, has a confrontation with Big Worm. In an attempt to explain his money shortage, Smokey incriminates Craig. Big Worm threatens to kill Craig and Smokey if they do not give him $200 by 10:00 pm. Craig angrily confronts Smokey about his lack of initiative in selling the marijuana before deciding to help Smokey. \n\nCraig unsuccessfully attempts to borrow money from his mother Betty, his sister Dana (who eventually tells their father about the situation at hand), and his insanely jealous girlfriend, Joi, who is seen cheating on him earlier in the film. Craig's father, Willie, eventually learns of Craig's plan, as well as the fact that Craig is carrying a gun. Willie talks to him, explaining that Craig should use his fists, instead of guns, to resolve his problems, all while telling Craig the story of how Willie's brother lost his life due to gun violence.\n\nLater on, while Craig and Smokey discuss their dilemma, they are interrupted by the arrival of Rita, a girl whom Debbie set Smokey up with earlier. Smokey then discovers she lied about her looks. Instead of resembling [[Janet Jackson]] as she originally claimed, Rita is morbidly obese, bald, and, in Smokey's words, \"looking more like [[Freddie Jackson]]\".\n\nSmokey heads to Debbie's house to complain and notices Red's bike, that Deebo had stolen, on the lawn. He sneaks in and finds Deebo asleep with Felisha. Smokey tries to retrieve the money that he and Deebo stole from Stanley's house earlier, but is interrupted by Ezal. Both escape without the money before Deebo wakes up. Smokey enlists Craig's help to go back and try again, but at that moment, Deebo rides Red's bike past them. \n\nThe two notice a black car driving slowly and hide, suspecting a possible [[drive-by shooting]]. Scared, they run to Craig's room. Then, after Willie confronts them with the situation with Big Worm, and with 10:00 approaching, Craig and Smokey decide to step out. Once outside, they notice a van parked in the middle of the street with its headlights off. The two start to run as Big Worm's men start to shoot at them.\n\nMeanwhile, the neighbors come out of their houses after hearing the gunshots. Debbie then confronts Deebo for assaulting Felisha, after Deebo falsely accuses Felisha of Smokey's attempted theft. Deebo eventually assaults Debbie, as Craig and Smokey arrive.\n\nAngered that Deebo has assaulted Debbie, Craig stands up to him, and threatens him with his gun. Deebo scoffs at the threat and Willie encourages Craig to put the gun down and fight with his hands. Then, Craig and Deebo fight. After nearly losing, Craig emerges victorious by using various objects as weapons. As Debbie tends to Craig, Smokey steals back the money he was robbed of earlier from a knocked-out Deebo and flees the scene. Red retrieves his  stolen chain and bicycle, while Ezal steals Deebo's shoes. Craig and Debbie agree to meet up the following day and Craig breaks up with Joi on the phone.\n\nLater that night, Smokey settles with Big Worm, and ends the feud. He announces that he is giving up drug dealing and going to rehabilitation. After hanging up, Smokey looks up, lights a joint, and [[Fourth wall|tells the audience]], \"I was just bullshittin'! And you know this, man!\", breaking the fourth wall and ending the movie.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Craig Jones\n* [[Chris Tucker]] as Smokey \n* [[Nia Long]] as Debbie \n* [[Tiny Lister Jr.]] as Deebo\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Willie Jones\n* [[Anna Maria Horsford]] as Betty Jones\n* [[Regina King]] as Dana Jones\n* [[Paula Jai Parker]] as Joi \n* [[Bernie Mac]] as Pastor Clever\n* [[Faizon Love]] as Big Worm\n* [[DJ Pooh]] as Red      \n* [[Anthony Johnson (actor)|Anthony Johnson]] as Ezal\n* Angela Means as Felisha  <!-- The character's name is Felisha, NOT Felicia, even though the meme is usually \"Bye Felicia!\" -->\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe film also contains cameo appearances from [[F.

Ice Cube felt that these films did not portray the full picture of living in the hood, missing a more lighthearted element, with Cube later saying, \"we had fun in the hood.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.
