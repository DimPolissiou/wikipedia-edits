The plot centers on a [[pandemic]] of a weaponized strain of [[influenza]] that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.\n\nIn 1990, ''The Stand'' was reprinted as a ''Complete and Uncut Edition''. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to 10 years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' of ''The Stand'' is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.\n\n''The Stand'' was highly appreciated by literary critics and is considered one of King's best novels. It has been included in lists of the best books of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Modern Library]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and the [[BBC]]. Reviewers praised the believability of the story, the relevance of the issues raised and the liveliness of the characters, but criticized the protractedness of individual episodes, the plot dualism and the deliberate denouement. A [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|self-titled miniseries]] based on the novel was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, [[Marvel Comics]] published a [[The Stand (comics)|series of comics]] written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and illustrated by [[Mike Perkins]]. A [[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|miniseries]] to air on [[CBS All Access]] is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nAn extremely contagious and lethal strain of [[influenza]], resistant to antibodies and vaccines, is developed as a [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] within a secret [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] laboratory, and is accidentally released. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its release. The laboratory staff die, but security guard Charles Campion manages to escape and takes his family out of state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. The gas station employees and ambulance workers are infected when they take the dying Campion out of his car and to a hospital. The gas station owner infects his cousin, a highway patrolman, and the virus rapidly spreads uncontrollably from there. The [[United States Army]] attempts to isolate Arnette, going as far as to execute unarmed civilians, but the efforts are in vain \u2013 the virus, christened by journalists as the \"superflu\" or \"Captain Trips\", spreads across the country and travels beyond its borders, triggering a global [[pandemic]] of apocalyptic proportions. Approximately 99.4% of the world's population is infected and killed within a month. A prism of several personal tragedies describes the collapse of society, explosions of violence, the inability of the government and [[martial law]] to stop the pandemic, and the near-extinction of humanity. Many survivors of the virus also die, unable to accept the loss of their loved ones or survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.\n\nStuart Redman, one of the gas station employees, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a specialized center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be made. Redman escapes after the center's staff dies; he is forced to kill one of the members in self-defense. He meets with sociology professor Glen Bateman, pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, and teenage outcast Harold Lauder. Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer, joins the group in the wake of his mother's death. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and become lovers, to Harold's disappointment and resentment. The group share a common dream in which they see a 108-year-old black woman living in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]].<ref>King used Hemingford, NE for both novels, ''The Stand'', and ''It'', America's heartland location for Mother Abagail. '''The Denver Post''', ''USA Weekend'', March 19\u201320, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2.</ref> The woman, Abagail Freemantle \u2013 better known as \"Mother Abagail\" \u2013 becomes the group's spiritual leader. She brings the group to [[Boulder, Colorado]], to which other survivors are attracted by her telepathic appeals. New additions to the group include Nick Andros, a [[deaf-mute]] deputy from Shoyo, Arkansas; Tom Cullen, a kind-hearted, mentally challenged man from May, Oklahoma; Nadine Cross, a teacher from New Hampshire; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer from Oklahoma. The group attempts to build a new society. They call their land the \"Free Zone\", organize funeral brigades and restore a supply of electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Randall Flagg]], a \"dark man\" possessing supernatural abilities, creates his own society from people called by his visions. The people worship Flagg as a messiah and joyfully submit to his fascist dictatorship, in which drug addicts are crucified. Flagg rescues potentially cannibalistic prisoner Lloyd Henreid and makes him his right-hand man. A [[Pyromania|pyromaniac]] nicknamed \"the Trashcan Man\", after destroying oil tanks in [[Gary, Indiana]] and meeting a madman named \"the Kid\", joins Flagg's group and becomes a weapons specialist. Flagg prepares for war with Boulder. Mother Abagail, feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure, disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation. During her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg's territory to act as spies. Harold and Nadine, tempted by Flagg through their dreams, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abagail's return. Before dying of exhaustion, Mother Abagail reports God's will \u2013 Stuart, Glen, Larry and Ralph must go to Las Vegas and destroy Flagg.\n\nStuart breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen. The remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg's army. When Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, he is killed by Lloyd. Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Ralph and Larry. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a retrieved [[nuclear warhead]]. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy in an attempt to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand \u2014 \"the Hand of God\" \u2014 which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg's followers, in addition to Larry and Ralph. The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby. They fear that the child may not possess an immunity to the superflu and may die, implying a permanent end to humanity. Soon after she gives birth to her son, Stuart returns to Boulder, having been rescued first by a dog, Kojak, and then by Tom, the only survivor of the three Free Zone spies. The baby, Peter, manages to fight off the superflu. Stuart and Frannie decide to leave Boulder and move to [[Ogunquit]] as society is slowly reestablished. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes an [[epilogue]] in which Flagg, having survived the nuclear explosion, wakes up somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Regaining his former strength, he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate, dark-skinned people.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Stand characters}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn [[Danse Macabre (book)|''Danse Macabre'']], King writes about the origins of ''The Stand'' at some length. One source was [[Patty Hearst]]'s case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because \"it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions\".\n\nThe author also mentions [[George R. Stewart]]'s novel ''[[Earth Abides]]'', which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:\n\n<blockquote>\nWith my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental CBW spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called ''Earth Abides'', by George R. Stewart.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote\u2014just to write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.\n<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | authorlink = Stephen King\n  | title = Stephen King's Danse Macabre\n  | publisher = Berkeley Trade\n  | page = 370\n  | isbn = 0-425-18160-X }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''The Stand'' was also planned by King as an epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''\u2013type story in a contemporary American setting:\n\n<blockquote>For a long time\u2014ten years, at least\u2014I had wanted to write a fantasy epic like ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', only with an American setting. I just couldn't figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that [[Dugway sheep incident|killed a bunch of sheep]] (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was [[Salt Lake City]].' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], but before it was released, I was deep into ''The Stand'', finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named [[Randall Flagg]]. The land of [[Mordor]] ('where the shadows lie,' according to [[Tolkien]]) was played by Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | title = ''Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'': The Inspiration\n  | url=http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/stand:_the_complete__uncut_edition_the_inspiration.html\n  | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile writing ''The Stand'', King nearly stopped because of [[writer's block]].<ref>''On Writing'', Stephen King, 2000.</ref> Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this.\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThe novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The novel marks the first appearance of [[Randall Flagg]], King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back many times in his later writings.\n\n{{Infobox book|\n| name         = The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition\n| title_orig   =\n| translator   =\n| image        = The Stand Uncut.jpg\n| caption      = ''The Complete and Uncut Edition'' cover\n| author       = [[Stephen King]]\n| cover_artist = John Cayea\n| country      = US\n| language     = English\n| series       =\n| genre        = [[Postapocalyptic]]\n| publisher    = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date = May 1990\n| media_type   = Print\n| pages        = 1,152\n| isbn         = 978-0-385-19957-5\n| preceded_by  =\n| followed_by  =\n}}\n\nIn 1990, an unabridged edition of ''The Stand'' was published, billed as ''The Complete and Uncut Edition''. Published in hardcover by Doubleday in May 1990, this became the longest book published by King at 1,152 pages. When the novel was originally published in 1978, Doubleday warned King that the book's size would make it too expensive for the market to bear.<ref>{{cite book |last= King |first= Stephen |date= 1990 |title= The Stand: The Complete And Uncut Edition |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |page= xiii |isbn=978-0-307-74368-8 }}</ref> As a result, he cut about 400 pages (around 150,000 words) from the original manuscript. This edition reinstates most of the deleted pages (as selected by King), as well as updates the setting from the 1980s to the 1990s. This new edition features a new preface by King, and illustrations by [[Bernie Wrightson]]. Additionally, Doubleday published a deluxe edition of ''The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'', limited to 1,250 numbered copies and 52 lettered copies. This edition, known as the \"Coffin Box\" edition due to the book being housed in a wooden case, was signed by King and Wrightson.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/09/lifetimes/king-stand.html |title=ARMAGEDDON, COMPLETE AND UNCUT|date=1997-03-09| work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.veryfinebooks.com/Stephen_King_The_Stand_Signed_First_Edition_p/sk200.htm |title=Stephen King The Stand Signed Limited Coffin Edition |publisher=VeryFineBooks.com |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedarktower.org/palaver/showwiki.php?title=Stand+The+-+S+L |title=Stand, The \u2013 S/L \u2013 Palaver |publisher=Thedarktower.org |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n''The Stand'' was nominated for the [[World Fantasy Award for Best Novel]] in 1979, and was adapted into both a [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|television miniseries]] for ABC and a [[The Stand (comics)|graphic novel]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].<ref name=\"rama1\"/><ref name=\"WWE-1979\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1979\n| title = 1979 Award Winners & Nominees\n| work = Worlds Without End\n| accessdate=2009-07-22\n}}</ref> In 2003, the novel was listed at number 53 on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read]] poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100_2.shtml|title=The Big Read \u2013 Top 100 Books |date=April 2003 |access-date=October 3, 2017 |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n=== Television ===\n{{Main|The Stand (1994 miniseries)|The Stand (upcoming miniseries)}}\n\nA movie adaptation of ''The Stand'' was in [[development hell]] for over 10 years. During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with [[George A. Romero]] directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not \"want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.\" Eventually King allowed screenwriter [[Rospo Pallenberg]], who was a fan of ''The Stand'', to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, [[Warner Bros.]] backed out of the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060708173256/http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2006 |title=THE RISE AND FALL OF \"THE STAND\" |publisher=subcin.com |author=Hixx, Don Alex |accessdate=2013-04-18 |df=mdy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make ''The Stand'' into an eight-hour [[television miniseries|miniseries]].

The plot centers on a [[pandemic]] of a weaponized strain of [[influenza]] that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.\n\nIn 1990, ''The Stand'' was reprinted as a ''Complete and Uncut Edition''. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to 10 years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' of ''The Stand'' is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.\n\n''The Stand'' was highly appreciated by literary critics and is considered one of King's best novels. It has been included in lists of the best books of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Modern Library]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and the [[BBC]]. Reviewers praised the believability of the story, the relevance of the issues raised and the liveliness of the characters, but criticized the protractedness of individual episodes, the plot dualism and the deliberate denouement. A [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|self-titled miniseries]] based on the novel was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, [[Marvel Comics]] published a [[The Stand (comics)|series of comics]] written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and illustrated by [[Mike Perkins]]. A [[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|miniseries]] to air on [[CBS All Access]] is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nAn extremely contagious and lethal strain of [[influenza]], resistant to antibodies and vaccines, is developed as a [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] within a secret [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] laboratory, and is accidentally released. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its release. The laboratory staff die, but security guard Charles Campion manages to escape and takes his family out of state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. The gas station employees and ambulance workers are infected when they take the dying Campion out of his car and to a hospital. The gas station owner infects his cousin, a highway patrolman, and the virus rapidly spreads uncontrollably from there. The [[United States Army]] attempts to isolate Arnette, going as far as to execute unarmed civilians, but the efforts are in vain \u2013 the virus, christened by journalists as the \"superflu\" or \"Captain Trips\", spreads across the country and travels beyond its borders, triggering a global [[pandemic]] of apocalyptic proportions. Approximately 99.4% of the world's population is infected and killed within a month. A prism of several personal tragedies describes the collapse of society, explosions of violence, the inability of the government and [[martial law]] to stop the pandemic, and the near-extinction of humanity. Many survivors of the virus also die, unable to accept the loss of their loved ones or survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.\n\nStuart Redman, one of the gas station employees, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a specialized center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be made. Redman escapes after the center's staff dies; he is forced to kill one of the members in self-defense. He meets with sociology professor Glen Bateman, pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, and teenage outcast Harold Lauder. Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer, joins the group in the wake of his mother's death. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and become lovers, to Harold's disappointment and resentment. The group share a common dream in which they see a 108-year-old black woman living in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]].<ref>King used Hemingford, NE for both novels, ''The Stand'', and ''It'', America's heartland location for Mother Abagail. '''The Denver Post''', ''USA Weekend'', March 19\u201320, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2.</ref> The woman, Abagail Freemantle \u2013 better known as \"Mother Abagail\" \u2013 becomes the group's spiritual leader. She brings the group to [[Boulder, Colorado]], to which other survivors are attracted by her telepathic appeals. New additions to the group include Nick Andros, a [[deaf-mute]] deputy from Shoyo, Arkansas; Tom Cullen, a kind-hearted, mentally challenged man from May, Oklahoma; Nadine Cross, a teacher from New Hampshire; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer from Oklahoma. The group attempts to build a new society. They call their land the \"Free Zone\", organize funeral brigades and restore a supply of electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Randall Flagg]], a \"dark man\" possessing supernatural abilities, creates his own society from people called by his visions. The people worship Flagg as a messiah and joyfully submit to his fascist dictatorship, in which drug addicts are crucified. Flagg rescues potentially cannibalistic prisoner Lloyd Henreid and makes him his right-hand man. A [[Pyromania|pyromaniac]] nicknamed \"the Trashcan Man\", after destroying oil tanks in [[Gary, Indiana]] and meeting a madman named \"the Kid\", joins Flagg's group and becomes a weapons specialist. Flagg prepares for war with Boulder. Mother Abagail, feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure, disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation. During her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg's territory to act as spies. Harold and Nadine, tempted by Flagg through their dreams, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abagail's return. Before dying of exhaustion, Mother Abagail reports God's will \u2013 Stuart, Glen, Larry and Ralph must go to Las Vegas and destroy Flagg.\n\nStuart breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen. The remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg's army. When Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, he is killed by Lloyd. Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Ralph and Larry. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a retrieved [[nuclear warhead]]. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy in an attempt to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand \u2014 \"the Hand of God\" \u2014 which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg's followers, in addition to Larry and Ralph. The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby. They fear that the child may not possess an immunity to the superflu and may die, implying a permanent end to humanity. Soon after she gives birth to her son, Stuart returns to Boulder, having been rescued first by a dog, Kojak, and then by Tom, the only survivor of the three Free Zone spies. The baby, Peter, manages to fight off the superflu. Stuart and Frannie decide to leave Boulder and move to [[Ogunquit]] as society is slowly reestablished. The ''Complete and Uncut Edition'' includes an [[epilogue]] in which Flagg, having survived the nuclear explosion, wakes up somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Regaining his former strength, he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate, dark-skinned people.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Stand characters}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn [[Danse Macabre (book)|''Danse Macabre'']], King writes about the origins of ''The Stand'' at some length. One source was [[Patty Hearst]]'s case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because \"it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions\".\n\nThe author also mentions [[George R. Stewart]]'s novel ''[[Earth Abides]]'', which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:\n\n<blockquote>\nWith my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental CBW spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called ''Earth Abides'', by George R. Stewart.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote\u2014just to write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.\n<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | authorlink = Stephen King\n  | title = Stephen King's Danse Macabre\n  | publisher = Berkeley Trade\n  | page = 370\n  | isbn = 0-425-18160-X }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''The Stand'' was also planned by King as an epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''\u2013type story in a contemporary American setting:\n\n<blockquote>For a long time\u2014ten years, at least\u2014I had wanted to write a fantasy epic like ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', only with an American setting. I just couldn't figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that [[Dugway sheep incident|killed a bunch of sheep]] (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was [[Salt Lake City]].' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], but before it was released, I was deep into ''The Stand'', finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named [[Randall Flagg]]. The land of [[Mordor]] ('where the shadows lie,' according to [[Tolkien]]) was played by Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | title = ''Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'': The Inspiration\n  | url=http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/stand:_the_complete__uncut_edition_the_inspiration.html\n  | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile writing ''The Stand'', King nearly stopped because of [[writer's block]].<ref>''On Writing'', Stephen King, 2000.</ref> Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this.\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThe novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The novel marks the first appearance of [[Randall Flagg]], King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back many times in his later writings.\n\n{{Infobox book|\n| name         = The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition\n| title_orig   =\n| translator   =\n| image        = The Stand Uncut.jpg\n| caption      = ''The Complete and Uncut Edition'' cover\n| author       = [[Stephen King]]\n| cover_artist = John Cayea\n| country      = US\n| language     = English\n| series       =\n| genre        = [[Postapocalyptic]]\n| publisher    = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date = May 1990\n| media_type   = Print\n| pages        = 1,152\n| isbn         = 978-0-385-19957-5\n| preceded_by  =\n| followed_by  =\n}}\n\nIn 1990, an unabridged edition of ''The Stand'' was published, billed as ''The Complete and Uncut Edition''. Published in hardcover by Doubleday in May 1990, this became the longest book published by King at 1,152 pages. When the novel was originally published in 1978, Doubleday warned King that the book's size would make it too expensive for the market to bear.<ref>{{cite book |last= King |first= Stephen |date= 1990 |title= The Stand: The Complete And Uncut Edition |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |page= xiii |isbn=978-0-307-74368-8 }}</ref> As a result, he cut about 400 pages (around 150,000 words) from the original manuscript. This edition reinstates most of the deleted pages (as selected by King), as well as updates the setting from the 1980s to the 1990s. This new edition features a new preface by King, and illustrations by [[Bernie Wrightson]]. Additionally, Doubleday published a deluxe edition of ''The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'', limited to 1,250 numbered copies and 52 lettered copies.

During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with [[George A. Romero]] directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not \"want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.\" Eventually King allowed screenwriter [[Rospo Pallenberg]], who was a fan of ''The Stand'', to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, [[Warner Bros.]] backed out of the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060708173256/http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2006 |title=THE RISE AND FALL OF \"THE STAND\" |publisher=subcin.com |author=Hixx, Don Alex |accessdate=2013-04-18 |df=mdy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make ''The Stand'' into an eight-hour [[television miniseries|miniseries]].

Robbins belonged to the [[Jim Reeves]] era and wore his embroidered cowboy suits proudly. Best known for the western ballad, ''El Paso'', his career also touched the rock 'n' roll side of country in songs like ''White Sports Coat And A Pink Carnation'', and he kept a touch of the dude about him to the end.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1980, Robbins appeared on the [[PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' (season 5).

The song, originally released on Robbins' 1959 album ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'', gained renewed popularity following its use in the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]''.\n\nHis song \"El Paso\" was featured in the series finale of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] TV series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.  'El Paso' was also featured in the ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' prequel made by the BBC.\n\nRobbins was awarded an honorary degree by [[Northern Arizona University]].\n\nIn 2016, a portion of Glendale Avenue in Robbins' hometown of Glendale, AZ was renamed \"[https://ktar.com/story/1290175/portion-of-glendale-avenue-renamed-for-legendary-country-singer/ Marty Robbins Boulevard]\".\n\n== Political views ==\nMarty Robbins was strongly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] in his political views. He supported [[Barry Goldwater]] in his [[1964 United States presidential election]] campaign as a southern director for \"Stars for Barry\". Two of his patriotic political singles, ''Ain't I Right'' and ''My Own Native Land'' were rejected by Columbia Records as too controversial. In particular, ''Ain't I Right'' was a right-wing protest song that condemned the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war protests]] and talked about fighting communism in the United States. After Columbia Records rejected the songs, Robbins' band member Bobby Sykes recorded the songs for [[Sims Records]] under the name Johnny Freedom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diekman |first=Diane |date=2012 |title=Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGbogMkLPLYC&pg=PA99&dq=marty+robbins+aint+i+right&hl=fi&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpu9-X_NTjAhXbAxAIHYCqD88Q6AEIODAC#v=onepage&q=marty%20robbins%20aint%20i%20right&f=false |location= |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=99 |isbn=978-0252081255 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n==NASCAR==\n{{Infobox NASCAR driver\n|name               = \n|birth_date         = \n|birth_place        = \n|death_date         = \n|death_place        = \n|death_cause        = \n|Total_Cup_Races    = 35\n|Years_In_Cup       = 13\n|Best_Cup_Pos       = 48th ([[1974 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1974]])\n|First_Cup_Race     = [[1966 Nashville 400]] ([[Fairgrounds Speedway|Nashville]])\n|Last_Cup_Race      = [[1982 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1982]] [[AdvoCare 500 (Atlanta)|Atlanta Journal 500]] ([[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]])\n|Cup_Wins           = 0\n|Cup_Top_Tens       = 6\n|Cup_Poles          = 0\n|Total_GNEast_Races = 1\n|Years_In_GNEast    = 1\n|Best_GNEast_Pos    = \n|First_GNEast_Race  = 1972 Gamecock 200 ([[Columbia Speedway|Columbia]])\n|Last_GNEast_Race   = 1972 Gamecock 200 (Columbia)\n|GNEast_Wins        = 0\n|GNEast_Top_Tens    = 1\n|GNEast_Poles       = 0\n|updated            = August 19, 2016\n}}\nRobbins loved [[NASCAR]] racing.  With his musical successes, he was able to finance his avocation.  Robbins always tried to run at the big race tracks ([[Talladega Superspeedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]]) every year and a smattering of the smaller races when time permitted.\n\nRobbins' cars were built and maintained by [[Cotton Owens]].  They were painted two-toned magenta and chartreuse, usually carrying car number 42 (though 6, 22, and 777 were also used).  Over the years, he ran a few makes and models ([[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]s, [[Dodge]]s or [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]]) before buying a 1972-bodied [[Dodge Charger]] from Owens.  Robbins had 6 top-ten finishes as well as a few major wrecks during the 1970s, and he had Owens rebuild the car to update the sheet metal to the 1973\u20131974 Charger specifications, and then finally 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]] sheet metal, which he raced until the end of 1980. Robbins' final NASCAR race car was a 1981 [[Buick Regal]] that he rented and drove in a few races in 1981 and 1982.\n\nIn 1972, at the [[1972 Winston 500|Winston 500]], Robbins stunned the competition by turning laps that were 15&nbsp;mph faster than his qualifying time. After the race, NASCAR tried to bestow the Rookie of the Race award, but he would not accept it.  He had knocked the NASCAR-mandated restrictors out of his [[carburetor]] and admitted he \"just wanted to see what it was like to run up front for once.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cottonowens.com/drivers/Marty_Robbins.php |title=Cotton Owens Garage \u2013 Drivers |publisher=Cotton Owens Garage and Stratatomic LLC |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nRobbins is credited with possibly saving [[Richard Childress]]' life at the 1974 Charlotte 500 by deliberately crashing into a wall rather than t-bone (broadside) Childress's car that was stopped across the track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marty Robbins Saves Life of NASCAR's Richard Childress|url=http://www.savingcountrymusic.com/marty-robbins-saves-life-of-nascars-richard-childress|website=Savingcountrymusic.com|accessdate=2013-09-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, one year after Robbins' death, NASCAR honored him by naming the annual race at [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] the [[Coors 420|Marty Robbins 420]].\n\nRobbins' Dodge Magnum was restored by Owens and donated to the Talladega Museum by his family, and was displayed there from 1983 to 2008.  The car is now in private hands in Southern California and raced on the Vintage NASCAR club circuit.\n\nIn 2014, Robbins' 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] was featured on an episode of [[Discovery Channel]]s TV show ''Fat and Furious: Rolling Thunder''. In that same year, an episode of [[Velocity]]'s ''AmeriCarna'' featured ex-race team owner [[Ray Evernham]] spearheading the restoration of another of Robbins' NASCAR racers, a 1964 [[Plymouth Belvedere]].\n\nFor the 2016 [[Darlington, South Carolina|Darlington]] throwback weekend, [[Kyle Larson]]'s No. 42 [[NASCAR]] [[Xfinity Series]] car was painted purple and gold in honor of Robbins.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Marty Robbins discography}}\nRobbins' discography consists of 52 studio albums, 13 [[compilation album]]s, and 100 singles. In his career, Robbins charted 17 Number One singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as well as 82 Top 40 singles.\n\nRobbins' highest charting album is 1959's ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]''. It charted to #6 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was also certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The album's first single, \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", became a hit on both the country and pop charts, charting to Number One on the Hot Country Songs as well as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. While that would be his only pop Number One, in 1957, \"[[A White Sport Coat]]\" charted to #2, and in 1961, \"[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]\" charted to #3.\n\nHis final Top 10 single was \"Honkytonk Man\" from the 1982 [[Honkytonk Man|eponymous film]] in which Robbins had a role.  He died shortly before its release.  Since his death, four [[Posthumous publication|posthumous]] studio albums have been released, but they made no impact on the charts.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

In 1956, he released his first No. 1 country song, \"[[Singing the Blues]]\" and one year later, released two more No. 1 hits, \"[[A White Sport Coat]]\" and \"[[The Story of My Life (Marty Robbins song)|The Story of My Life]]\". In 1959, Robbins released his signature song, \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", for which he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording]]. Later releases that drew critical acclaim include \"[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]\", \"[[Big Iron]]\" and \"Honkytonk Man\", the latter for which the [[Honkytonk Man|1982 Clint Eastwood film]] is named, and in which Robbins made his final appearance before death.\n\nOver the course of his career, Robbins recorded more than [[Marty Robbins discography|500 songs and 60 albums]], and won two [[Grammy Awards]], was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and was named the 1960s Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. Robbins was a commercial success in both the country and pop genres, and his songs were covered by many other famous artists, including [[Johnny Cash]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. His music continues to have an influence in pop culture today, having recently appeared in several contemporary pop culture features, including the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', and the series finale of [[AMC]]'s ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. \n\n==Biography==\nRobbins was born in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], a suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], Arizona. His mother was mostly of [[Southern Paiute|Paiute Indian]] heritage.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pruett | first = Barbara J. | title = Marty Robbins: Fast Cars and Country Music | website=Books.google.com|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=otDFSIwdsSIC&pg=PA522 | accessdate = 2014-04-24}}</ref> Robbins grew up in a difficult family situation. His father took odd jobs to support the family of 10 children, however his hard drinking led to divorce in 1937. Among his warmer memories of his childhood, Robbins recalled having listened to stories of the [[American West]] told by his maternal grandfather, Texas Bob Heckle, who was a local medicine man.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Rhymes of the Frontier|date=1929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPxoHAAACAAJ|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=2014-10-25}}</ref> At 17, Robbins left his troubled home to serve in the [[United States Navy]] as an [[Landing craft tank|LCT]] [[coxswain]] during [[World War II]]. He was stationed in the [[Solomon Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. To pass the time during the war, he learned to play the guitar, started writing songs,<ref name=pc10/> and came to love [[Hawaiian music]].\n\nRobbins married Marizona \"Mari\" Baldwin on September 27, 1948. They had two children, Ronny and Janet, and were married 34 years until his death. \n\nAfter his [[Military discharge|discharge]] from the military in 1947 and his marriage the following year, Robbins began to play at local [[Music venue|venues]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]],<ref name=pc10/> then moved on to [[Host (radio)|host]] his own show on [[KIHP (AM)|KTYL]] and then his own television show on [[KPHO|KPHO-TV]] in Phoenix. After [[Little Jimmy Dickens]] made a [[guest appearance]] on Robbins' TV show, Dickens got Robbins a [[record deal]] with [[Columbia Records]]. \n\nRobbins became known for his appearances at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee. Music journalist [[Mary Harron]] wrote the following about him in ''The Guardian'':<ref>{{Cite web| title = Marty Robbins: Country Dude of Nashville.

Robbins belonged to the [[Jim Reeves]] era and wore his embroidered cowboy suits proudly. Best known for the western ballad, ''El Paso'', his career also touched the rock 'n' roll side of country in songs like ''White Sports Coat And A Pink Carnation'', and he kept a touch of the dude about him to the end.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1980, Robbins appeared on the [[PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' (season 5). In addition to his recordings and performances, Robbins was an avid [[race car]] driver, [[Competition|competing]] in 35 career [[NASCAR]] [[Grand National Series]] races with six top-10 finishes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Marty_Robbin |title=Career Statistics |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref> including the 1973 [[1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400|Firecracker 400]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1973_Medal_Of_Honor_Firecracker_400/W |title=1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400 |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |date=1973-07-04 |accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref> In 1967, Robbins played himself in the car racing film ''Hell on Wheels''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061757/ |publisher=IMDb.com|title=Hell on Wheels|accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref> Robbins was partial to [[Dodge]]s prepared by NASCAR Hall-of-Famer [[Cotton Owens]], and owned and raced [[Dodge Charger|Chargers]] and then a 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]]. He was also the driver of the 60th [[Indianapolis 500]] [[Buick Century]] [[pace car]] in 1976. His last race was in a [[Junior Johnson]]-built 1982 [[Buick Regal]] in the [[Atlanta Journal 500]] on November 7, 1982, a month before his death.\n\nRobbins developed  cardiovascular disease early in life. After his third heart attack on December 2, 1982, he underwent [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple coronary bypass surgery]]. He did not recover and died six days later, on December 8, at [[St. Thomas Hospital (Nashville, Tennessee)|St. Thomas Hospital]] in Nashville.

Robbins was named Artist of the Decade (1960\u20131969) by the [[Academy of Country Music]], was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1982, was rewarded three awards at the 17th Annual Music City News Country Awards in 1983, and was given a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] in 1998 for his song \"El Paso\".\n\nWhen Robbins was recording his 1961 hit \"Don't Worry\", session guitarist [[Grady Martin]] accidentally created the electric guitar \"[[Distortion (music)|fuzz\" effect]]&nbsp;\u2013 his six-string bass was run through a faulty channel in a [[mixing console]].

[[The Who]]'s 2006 album ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]'' includes the song \"God Speaks of Marty Robbins\".

Both [[Frankie Laine]] and [[Elvis Presley]], among others, recorded versions of Robbins' song \"[[You Gave Me a Mountain]]\", with Laine's recording reaching the pop and adult contemporary charts in 1969. Though Elvis never recorded any of Robbins' songs in the studio, he was a big fan and recorded \"You Gave Me a Mountain\" live in concert several times; it appeared on 15 Presley albums. [[Johnny Cash]] recorded a version of \"[[Big Iron]]\" as part of his American Recordings series, which is included in the ''Cash Unearthed'' box set. Cash also recorded other songs by Robbins, including \"I Couldn't Keep From Crying\", \"Kate\" and \"Song Of The Patriot\". He held Robbins in high esteem, having him guest several times on [[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|his network TV show]]. \"Big Iron\" was also covered by [[Mike Ness]] on his album ''[[Under the Influences]]'', on which he paid homage to country music artists. The song, originally released on Robbins' 1959 album ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'', gained renewed popularity following its use in the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]''.\n\nHis song \"El Paso\" was featured in the series finale of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] TV series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.  'El Paso' was also featured in the ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' prequel made by the BBC.\n\nRobbins was awarded an honorary degree by [[Northern Arizona University]].\n\nIn 2016, a portion of Glendale Avenue in Robbins' hometown of Glendale, AZ was renamed \"[https://ktar.com/story/1290175/portion-of-glendale-avenue-renamed-for-legendary-country-singer/ Marty Robbins Boulevard]\".\n\n== Political views ==\nMarty Robbins was strongly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] in his political views. He supported [[Barry Goldwater]] in his [[1964 United States presidential election]] campaign as a southern director for \"Stars for Barry\". Two of his patriotic political singles, ''Ain't I Right'' and ''My Own Native Land'' were rejected by Columbia Records as too controversial. In particular, ''Ain't I Right'' was a right-wing protest song that condemned the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war protests]] and talked about fighting communism in the United States. After Columbia Records rejected the songs, Robbins' band member Bobby Sykes recorded the songs for [[Sims Records]] under the name Johnny Freedom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diekman |first=Diane |date=2012 |title=Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGbogMkLPLYC&pg=PA99&dq=marty+robbins+aint+i+right&hl=fi&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpu9-X_NTjAhXbAxAIHYCqD88Q6AEIODAC#v=onepage&q=marty%20robbins%20aint%20i%20right&f=false |location= |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=99 |isbn=978-0252081255 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n==NASCAR==\n{{Infobox NASCAR driver\n|name               = \n|birth_date         = \n|birth_place        = \n|death_date         = \n|death_place        = \n|death_cause        = \n|Total_Cup_Races    = 35\n|Years_In_Cup       = 13\n|Best_Cup_Pos       = 48th ([[1974 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1974]])\n|First_Cup_Race     = [[1966 Nashville 400]] ([[Fairgrounds Speedway|Nashville]])\n|Last_Cup_Race      = [[1982 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1982]] [[AdvoCare 500 (Atlanta)|Atlanta Journal 500]] ([[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]])\n|Cup_Wins           = 0\n|Cup_Top_Tens       = 6\n|Cup_Poles          = 0\n|Total_GNEast_Races = 1\n|Years_In_GNEast    = 1\n|Best_GNEast_Pos    = \n|First_GNEast_Race  = 1972 Gamecock 200 ([[Columbia Speedway|Columbia]])\n|Last_GNEast_Race   = 1972 Gamecock 200 (Columbia)\n|GNEast_Wins        = 0\n|GNEast_Top_Tens    = 1\n|GNEast_Poles       = 0\n|updated            = August 19, 2016\n}}\nRobbins loved [[NASCAR]] racing.  With his musical successes, he was able to finance his avocation.  Robbins always tried to run at the big race tracks ([[Talladega Superspeedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]]) every year and a smattering of the smaller races when time permitted.\n\nRobbins' cars were built and maintained by [[Cotton Owens]].  They were painted two-toned magenta and chartreuse, usually carrying car number 42 (though 6, 22, and 777 were also used).  Over the years, he ran a few makes and models ([[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]s, [[Dodge]]s or [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]]) before buying a 1972-bodied [[Dodge Charger]] from Owens.  Robbins had 6 top-ten finishes as well as a few major wrecks during the 1970s, and he had Owens rebuild the car to update the sheet metal to the 1973\u20131974 Charger specifications, and then finally 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]] sheet metal, which he raced until the end of 1980. Robbins' final NASCAR race car was a 1981 [[Buick Regal]] that he rented and drove in a few races in 1981 and 1982.\n\nIn 1972, at the [[1972 Winston 500|Winston 500]], Robbins stunned the competition by turning laps that were 15&nbsp;mph faster than his qualifying time. After the race, NASCAR tried to bestow the Rookie of the Race award, but he would not accept it.  He had knocked the NASCAR-mandated restrictors out of his [[carburetor]] and admitted he \"just wanted to see what it was like to run up front for once.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cottonowens.com/drivers/Marty_Robbins.php |title=Cotton Owens Garage \u2013 Drivers |publisher=Cotton Owens Garage and Stratatomic LLC |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nRobbins is credited with possibly saving [[Richard Childress]]' life at the 1974 Charlotte 500 by deliberately crashing into a wall rather than t-bone (broadside) Childress's car that was stopped across the track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marty Robbins Saves Life of NASCAR's Richard Childress|url=http://www.savingcountrymusic.com/marty-robbins-saves-life-of-nascars-richard-childress|website=Savingcountrymusic.com|accessdate=2013-09-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, one year after Robbins' death, NASCAR honored him by naming the annual race at [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] the [[Coors 420|Marty Robbins 420]].\n\nRobbins' Dodge Magnum was restored by Owens and donated to the Talladega Museum by his family, and was displayed there from 1983 to 2008.  The car is now in private hands in Southern California and raced on the Vintage NASCAR club circuit.\n\nIn 2014, Robbins' 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] was featured on an episode of [[Discovery Channel]]s TV show ''Fat and Furious: Rolling Thunder''. In that same year, an episode of [[Velocity]]'s ''AmeriCarna'' featured ex-race team owner [[Ray Evernham]] spearheading the restoration of another of Robbins' NASCAR racers, a 1964 [[Plymouth Belvedere]].\n\nFor the 2016 [[Darlington, South Carolina|Darlington]] throwback weekend, [[Kyle Larson]]'s No. 42 [[NASCAR]] [[Xfinity Series]] car was painted purple and gold in honor of Robbins.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Marty Robbins discography}}\nRobbins' discography consists of 52 studio albums, 13 [[compilation album]]s, and 100 singles. In his career, Robbins charted 17 Number One singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as well as 82 Top 40 singles.\n\nRobbins' highest charting album is 1959's ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]''. It charted to #6 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was also certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The album's first single, \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", became a hit on both the country and pop charts, charting to Number One on the Hot Country Songs as well as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. While that would be his only pop Number One, in 1957, \"[[A White Sport Coat]]\" charted to #2, and in 1961, \"[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]\" charted to #3.\n\nHis final Top 10 single was \"Honkytonk Man\" from the 1982 [[Honkytonk Man|eponymous film]] in which Robbins had a role.  He died shortly before its release.  Since his death, four [[Posthumous publication|posthumous]] studio albums have been released, but they made no impact on the charts.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

These are consumer-decomposer protists. Two separate types of slime molds exist, the cellular and acellular forms.\n\nSome protists, sometimes called [[ambiregnal]] protists, have been considered to be both protozoa and algae or fungi (e.g., [[slime molds]] and [[flagellate]]d algae), and names for these have been published under either or both of the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|ICN]]'' and the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Corliss, J.O. |year=1995|url=http://biostor.org/reference/2636 |title=The ambiregnal protists and the codes of nomenclature: a brief review of the problem and of proposed solutions|journal=Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature|volume= 52|pages= 11\u201317|doi=10.5962/bhl.part.6717|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>Barnes, Richard Stephen Kent (2001).

For instance, the [[water molds]] are now considered to be [[Oomycete#Phylogenetic relationships|closely related]] to [[Phototroph#Photoautotroph|photosynthetic organisms]] such as [[Brown algae]] and [[Diatoms]], the [[slime mold]]s are [[Slime mold#Modern classification|grouped mainly]] under [[Amoebozoa]], and the [[Amoebozoa]] itself includes only a subset of \"Amoeba\" group, and significant number of erstwhile \"Amoeboid\" [[genera]] are distributed among [[Rhizaria#Groups|Rhizarians]] and [[Amoeba#Classification|other Phyla]].\n\nHowever, the older terms are still used as informal names to describe the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[ecology]] of various protists.

Two separate types of slime molds exist, the cellular and acellular forms.\n\nSome protists, sometimes called [[ambiregnal]] protists, have been considered to be both protozoa and algae or fungi (e.g., [[slime molds]] and [[flagellate]]d algae), and names for these have been published under either or both of the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|ICN]]'' and the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Corliss, J.O. |year=1995|url=http://biostor.org/reference/2636 |title=The ambiregnal protists and the codes of nomenclature: a brief review of the problem and of proposed solutions|journal=Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature|volume= 52|pages= 11\u201317|doi=10.5962/bhl.part.6717|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>Barnes, Richard Stephen Kent (2001).

Its primary purpose is the home venue of the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football]] team; it also serves as the site for the university's Spring Commencement ceremonies each May.\n\nFrom 1996 to 1998, Ohio Stadium was the home venue for the [[Columbus Crew]] of [[Major League Soccer]] prior to the opening of [[Columbus Crew Stadium]] in 1999. The stadium also was the home venue for the OSU track and field teams from 1923 to 2001. In addition to athletics, Ohio Stadium is also a concert venue, with [[U2]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Pink Floyd]], and [[Metallica]] among the many acts to have played at the venue.\n\nThe stadium opened in 1922 as a replacement for [[Ohio Field]] and had a [[seating capacity]] of 66,210. In 1923, a cinder running track was added that was later upgraded to an all-weather track. Seating capacity gradually increased over the years and reached a total of 91,470 possible spectators in 1991. Beginning in 2000, the stadium was renovated and expanded in several phases, removing the track and adding additional seating, which raised the capacity to 101,568 by 2001 and to 102,329 in 2007. In 2014, additional seating was added in the end zone, raising the official capacity to 104,944. Another renovation to add more luxury suites began in 2017 and will eventually lead to a decrease of 2,600 seats.  It is the largest stadium by capacity in the state of Ohio, and the [[List of U.S. stadiums by capacity|third largest]] on-campus football stadium in the United States. Ohio Stadium was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] by the [[National Park Service]] on March 22, 1974.<ref name=nris/>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Ohio Stadium from the air July 2014.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of Ohio Stadium]]\nAs early as 1913, Ohio Field at High Street and Woodruff Avenue was unable to contain the crowds attracted to many Buckeye home football games. This led to faculty discussion of moving the site elsewhere and building a new facility. The growing popularity of football in [[Ohio]] led to the design of a horseshoe-shaped stadium, conceptualized and designed by architect [[Howard Dwight Smith]] in 1918. A public-subscription Stadium Campaign to fund the project began in October 1920 and raised over $1.1&nbsp;million in pledges by January 1921, of which $975,001 were actually honored.\n<ref name=\"ballparks\">{{Cite web |url=http://football.ballparks.com/NCAA/Big10/OhioState/index.htm |title=Ballparks.com - Ohio Stadium |access-date=2006-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022100854/http://football.ballparks.com/NCAA/Big10/OhioState/index.htm |archive-date=2006-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe stadium was built in 1922 by E. H. Latham Company of Columbus, with materials and labor from the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] at a construction cost of $1.34&nbsp;million and a total cost of $1.49&nbsp;million. The stadium's original capacity was 66,210. Upon completion, it was the largest poured concrete structure in the world. Many university officials feared that the stadium would never be filled to capacity.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nSmith employed numerous revolutionary architectural techniques while building the stadium. At the base is a [[slurry wall]] to keep out the waters from the [[Olentangy River]]; the stadium rests on the flood plain. Instead of building a large bowl like the previously constructed [[Yale Bowl]], Ohio Stadium was designed to have an upper deck that would hang over part of the lower deck, giving Ohio Stadium its \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" decks. Instead of employing numerous columns like those at [[Harvard Stadium]], Smith designed double columns that allow for more space between columns. The rotunda at the north end of the stadium, which is now adorned with stained glass murals of the offensive and defensive squads that comprise the Buckeye football team,<ref>{{cite press release|title=Motorists Insurance Gife Supports Ohio Stadium Enhancement and Renovation|publisher=Ohio State University|date=June 5, 2001|url=http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/01-06-05_Ohio_Stadium_Art_Glass_Gift.html|accessdate=August 20, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902170038/http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/01-06-05_Ohio_Stadium_Art_Glass_Gift.html|archivedate=September 2, 2006}}</ref> was designed to look like the dome at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.\n\n==History==\nThe first game in the stadium was against [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] on October 7, 1922, and brought a crowd of around 25,000, which left people concerned because the stadium was half empty. This concern was put to rest at the stadium's formal dedication against Michigan on October 21, which the Wolverines won, 19&ndash;0. The crowd was announced at the game to be 72,000, but no one is really sure how many people made it into the stadium. This attendance mark was broken in a game against Michigan in 1926 when 90,411 came out to support the Buckeyes; this is also the last time standing-room-only tickets were sold for a game.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nThe stadium did not regularly sell out until after World War II, and in the 1920s and 1930s most games only drew in 20,000 or 30,000 fans with many more attending the annual game against Michigan. The 1935 contest with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] was a sellout, with over 81,000 in attendance.\n\nIn 1923, a cinder track was built around the football field, which would later be named after Olympian and Ohio State athlete [[Jesse Owens]]. The stadium was home to the OSU [[track and field]] teams until the opening of [[Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium]] in 2001.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\n===Renovations===\nAs time passed, minor adjustments raised the [[seating capacity]] to more than 90,000. In 1984, a new $2.1&nbsp;million scoreboard was installed. The stadium was heavily renovated from 1998 to 2001. The press box was replaced, additional seating was installed, and 81 luxury suites and 2,500 club seats were added. The south end zone scoreboard was also replaced by a {{convert|90|x|30|ft|adj=on}} video board that is able to show replays, highlights, animations, graphics and statistical information. Additionally, a smaller version of the south end scoreboard was added to the north end and a new LED ribbon board that runs end-zone to end-zone was added to the balcony prior to the 2009 season. In 1998, the track was removed and a {{convert|45|ft|m|sing=on}} [[slurry wall]] was built underneath the field to allow it to be lowered {{convert|14.5|ft|m}}, which places it below the water table. After the 1999 season, the field of play was lowered to add seating closer to the field.<ref>{{cite web |title=Part 2: Stadium Renovation 1998-2000 |url=http://buckeyeturf.osu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&id=907:part-2stadium-renovation-1998-2000&Itemid=170 |author=Sherratt, Pam |work=Buckeye Turf |publisher=[[The Ohio State University]] |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110212219/http://buckeyeturf.osu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&id=907:part-2stadium-renovation-1998-2000&Itemid=170 |archive-date=January 10, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The temporary bleachers in the south end zone were replaced with permanent seating.

The result of the $194&nbsp;million renovation was a capacity that rose to 101,568. 80% of the cost of the renovation was funded by the sale of leases on the suites and club seats, with the remaining 20% funded by donations and the sale of naming rights for portions of the stadium. No public or university money was spent in the renovation process.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nIn 1971, the natural grass field was removed, and [[AstroTurf]] was installed, compliments of a donation by Lou Fisher in dedication to fellow football player Joseph Campanella. A plaque was placed on the southeast corner in memory of Campanella. In 1979, the surface was replaced with SuperTurf. In 1990, natural grass made its return to the Horseshoe, in the form of a special grass called \"Prescription Athletic Turf.\" New field designs were put in place for the 1992 season and existed through the 2006 season. During the 2006 season, problems with the natural grass began to arise. After serious damage to the field during use in the spring of 2006, the field never recovered and had to be re-sodded. That grass never took root because of bad weather, and the university was forced to re-sod the field again only three weeks after the old sod was laid. The university spent approximately $150,000 to perform both soddings. In response to this, OSU replaced the natural grass with [[FieldTurf]] for the 2007 season. This new artificial turf looks and feels like real grass but requires minimal upkeep.\n\nIn March 2012 the university announced a $7&nbsp;million renovation to the scoreboard installed during the 2000\u201301 renovation. The project began April 23 and was completed in time for the 2012 season opener on September 1. The current scoreboard includes a Panasonic HD screen, stretching {{convert|124|by|42|ft}}, and incorporates upgrades to the audio system and the [[LED]] running boards (which are the smaller screens underneath the larger screen that usually display score updates and advertisements). A Pro Sound audio system with 25 different speakers flank the scoreboard. Older speakers throughout the Horseshoe received improvements and will eventually be replaced by new speakers fitted into the existing framework.\n\nPrior to the 2014 season, 2,500 seats were added to the south stands. These seats were built over the entrance tunnels and raised the official capacity of the stadium to 104,851, making it the third largest stadium in the country and the fourth largest stadium in the world. The renovations also included permanent lights added to the northeast and southeast corners of the stadium, as well as atop the press box, and the playing surface was replaced.<ref name=ballparks/><ref name=archivesB>{{cite web |title=2014 Ohio Stadium Renovations |work=Scribd. |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/146179633/Ohio-Stadium |accessdate=June 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611011432/http://www.scribd.com/doc/146179633/Ohio-Stadium |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>[[File:Panoramic view of Ohio Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Panoramic view.|500px]]\n\n=== Timeline of seating capacity<ref>[http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&KEY=&ATCLID=925256 Ohio Stadium - The Ohio State Buckeyes Official Athletics Site - OhioStateBuckeyes.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725033140/http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&KEY=&ATCLID=925256|date=2011-07-25}}</ref> ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}}\"|Capacity\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}}\"|Years\n|-\n|66,210\n|1922\u20131943\n|-\n|72,754\n|1944\u20131947\n|-\n|78,677\n|1948\u20131957\n|-\n|79,658\n|1958\u20131960\n|-\n|79,727\n|1961\n|-\n|81,109\n|1962\u20131968\n|-\n|81,455\n|1969\u20131970\n|-\n|81,475\n|1971\n|-\n|81,667\n|1972\n|-\n|82,567\n|1973\n|-\n|83,080\n|1974\n|-\n|83,112\n|1975\u20131981\n|-\n|85,290\n|1982\u20131984\n|-\n|85,399\n|1985\u20131988\n|-\n|86,071\n|1989\u20131990\n|-\n|91,470\n|1991\u20131994\n|-\n|89,841\n|1995\u20131999\n|-\n|95,346\n|2000\n|-\n|101,568\n|2001\u20132006\n|-\n|102,329\n|2007\u20132014\n|-\n|104,944\n|2014\u20132017\n|-\n|102,082\n|2018\n|-\n|102,780\n|2019\n|}\n\n===Night football games===\nBefore the 2014 renovations, Ohio Stadium did not have permanent lights at the stadium, thus night games were rare. Ohio State's first night game in the stadium was played on September 14, 1985, when the #9 Buckeyes defeated the [[1985 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh Panthers]], 10\u20137. Ohio State did not play another night game at Ohio Stadium until September 11, 1993, when the 16th-ranked Buckeyes defeated #12 [[1993 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] 21\u201312. Ohio State played a total of 12 more night games before permanent lighting was installed, nine of which were against ranked opponents. The Buckeyes are 16-5 (.762) overall and 9-1 (.900) in the Big Ten in night games through September 18, 2017. Ohio State's most recent night game was a 34\u201310 win versus Michigan State on October 5th, 2019.\n\nBelow is a table of teams the Buckeyes have faced in multiple night games at Ohio Stadium.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Matchups!!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Opponent!!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|OSU Record\n|-\n|3||Penn State||2-1\n|-\n|2\n|Nebraska\n|2-0\n|-\n|2||Washington||2-0\n|-\n|2||Wisconsin||2-0\n|}\n\n===Largest attendance===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Rank !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Date !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Attendance !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Result\n|-\n| 1 || November 26, 2016 || 110,045 || #2 Ohio State 30 \u2013 #3 Michigan 27 (2 OT)\n|-\n|2\n|October 28, 2017\n|109,302\n|#6 Ohio State 39 - #2 Penn State 38\n|-\n|3\n|September 9, 2017\n|109,088\n|#5 Oklahoma 31 \u2013 #2 Ohio State 16\n|-\n|4|| November 21, 2015 || 108,975 || #9 Michigan State 17 \u2013 #3 Ohio State 14\n|-\n|5||November 5, 2016||108,750|| #6 Ohio State 62 \u2013 #10 Nebraska 3\n|-\n|6|| November 29, 2014 || 108,610 || #6 Ohio State 42 \u2013 Michigan 28\n|-\n|7|| October 17, 2015 || 108,423 || #1 Ohio State 38 \u2013 Penn State 10\n|-\n|8|| September 16, 2017 || 108,414 || #8 Ohio State 38 \u2013 Army 7\n|-\n|9\n|September 27, 2014\n|108,362<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=400547674|title=Barrett, Elliott lead Buckeyes by Bearcats, 50-28|date=September 27, 2014|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=September 27, 2014|agency=Associated Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929012452/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=400547674|archive-date=September 29, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|#22 Ohio State 50 \u2013 Cincinnati 28\n|-\n|10|| November 7, 2015 || 108,075<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110815aab.html|title=Ohio State Postgame Notes|website=www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com|accessdate=2015-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190842/http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110815aab.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref> || #3 Ohio State 28 \u2013 Minnesota 14\n|}\n\n==Buckeye football==\n[[File:Script Ohio.jpg|thumb|250px|Script Ohio]]\nThe largest crowd in stadium history is 110,045, set November 26, 2016, in a game against Michigan.

Its primary purpose is the home venue of the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football]] team; it also serves as the site for the university's Spring Commencement ceremonies each May.\n\nFrom 1996 to 1998, Ohio Stadium was the home venue for the [[Columbus Crew]] of [[Major League Soccer]] prior to the opening of [[Columbus Crew Stadium]] in 1999. The stadium also was the home venue for the OSU track and field teams from 1923 to 2001. In addition to athletics, Ohio Stadium is also a concert venue, with [[U2]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Pink Floyd]], and [[Metallica]] among the many acts to have played at the venue.\n\nThe stadium opened in 1922 as a replacement for [[Ohio Field]] and had a [[seating capacity]] of 66,210. In 1923, a cinder running track was added that was later upgraded to an all-weather track. Seating capacity gradually increased over the years and reached a total of 91,470 possible spectators in 1991. Beginning in 2000, the stadium was renovated and expanded in several phases, removing the track and adding additional seating, which raised the capacity to 101,568 by 2001 and to 102,329 in 2007. In 2014, additional seating was added in the end zone, raising the official capacity to 104,944. Another renovation to add more luxury suites began in 2017 and will eventually lead to a decrease of 2,600 seats.  It is the largest stadium by capacity in the state of Ohio, and the [[List of U.S. stadiums by capacity|third largest]] on-campus football stadium in the United States. Ohio Stadium was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] by the [[National Park Service]] on March 22, 1974.<ref name=nris/>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Ohio Stadium from the air July 2014.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of Ohio Stadium]]\nAs early as 1913, Ohio Field at High Street and Woodruff Avenue was unable to contain the crowds attracted to many Buckeye home football games. This led to faculty discussion of moving the site elsewhere and building a new facility. The growing popularity of football in [[Ohio]] led to the design of a horseshoe-shaped stadium, conceptualized and designed by architect [[Howard Dwight Smith]] in 1918. A public-subscription Stadium Campaign to fund the project began in October 1920 and raised over $1.1&nbsp;million in pledges by January 1921, of which $975,001 were actually honored.\n<ref name=\"ballparks\">{{Cite web |url=http://football.ballparks.com/NCAA/Big10/OhioState/index.htm |title=Ballparks.com - Ohio Stadium |access-date=2006-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022100854/http://football.ballparks.com/NCAA/Big10/OhioState/index.htm |archive-date=2006-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe stadium was built in 1922 by E. H. Latham Company of Columbus, with materials and labor from the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]] at a construction cost of $1.34&nbsp;million and a total cost of $1.49&nbsp;million. The stadium's original capacity was 66,210. Upon completion, it was the largest poured concrete structure in the world. Many university officials feared that the stadium would never be filled to capacity.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nSmith employed numerous revolutionary architectural techniques while building the stadium. At the base is a [[slurry wall]] to keep out the waters from the [[Olentangy River]]; the stadium rests on the flood plain. Instead of building a large bowl like the previously constructed [[Yale Bowl]], Ohio Stadium was designed to have an upper deck that would hang over part of the lower deck, giving Ohio Stadium its \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" decks. Instead of employing numerous columns like those at [[Harvard Stadium]], Smith designed double columns that allow for more space between columns. The rotunda at the north end of the stadium, which is now adorned with stained glass murals of the offensive and defensive squads that comprise the Buckeye football team,<ref>{{cite press release|title=Motorists Insurance Gife Supports Ohio Stadium Enhancement and Renovation|publisher=Ohio State University|date=June 5, 2001|url=http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/01-06-05_Ohio_Stadium_Art_Glass_Gift.html|accessdate=August 20, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902170038/http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/01-06-05_Ohio_Stadium_Art_Glass_Gift.html|archivedate=September 2, 2006}}</ref> was designed to look like the dome at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.\n\n==History==\nThe first game in the stadium was against [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] on October 7, 1922, and brought a crowd of around 25,000, which left people concerned because the stadium was half empty. This concern was put to rest at the stadium's formal dedication against Michigan on October 21, which the Wolverines won, 19&ndash;0. The crowd was announced at the game to be 72,000, but no one is really sure how many people made it into the stadium. This attendance mark was broken in a game against Michigan in 1926 when 90,411 came out to support the Buckeyes; this is also the last time standing-room-only tickets were sold for a game.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nThe stadium did not regularly sell out until after World War II, and in the 1920s and 1930s most games only drew in 20,000 or 30,000 fans with many more attending the annual game against Michigan. The 1935 contest with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] was a sellout, with over 81,000 in attendance.\n\nIn 1923, a cinder track was built around the football field, which would later be named after Olympian and Ohio State athlete [[Jesse Owens]]. The stadium was home to the OSU [[track and field]] teams until the opening of [[Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium]] in 2001.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\n===Renovations===\nAs time passed, minor adjustments raised the [[seating capacity]] to more than 90,000. In 1984, a new $2.1&nbsp;million scoreboard was installed. The stadium was heavily renovated from 1998 to 2001. The press box was replaced, additional seating was installed, and 81 luxury suites and 2,500 club seats were added. The south end zone scoreboard was also replaced by a {{convert|90|x|30|ft|adj=on}} video board that is able to show replays, highlights, animations, graphics and statistical information. Additionally, a smaller version of the south end scoreboard was added to the north end and a new LED ribbon board that runs end-zone to end-zone was added to the balcony prior to the 2009 season. In 1998, the track was removed and a {{convert|45|ft|m|sing=on}} [[slurry wall]] was built underneath the field to allow it to be lowered {{convert|14.5|ft|m}}, which places it below the water table. After the 1999 season, the field of play was lowered to add seating closer to the field.<ref>{{cite web |title=Part 2: Stadium Renovation 1998-2000 |url=http://buckeyeturf.osu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&id=907:part-2stadium-renovation-1998-2000&Itemid=170 |author=Sherratt, Pam |work=Buckeye Turf |publisher=[[The Ohio State University]] |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110212219/http://buckeyeturf.osu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&id=907:part-2stadium-renovation-1998-2000&Itemid=170 |archive-date=January 10, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The temporary bleachers in the south end zone were replaced with permanent seating. However, the south end of the stadium remains partially open, thus allowing the stadium to maintain its notable horseshoe configuration.<ref name=ballparks/><ref name=archives>{{cite web |title=Renovations of Ohio Stadium |work=The Ohio State University Archives |url=http://library.osu.edu/projects/stadium/renovations6.html |accessdate=October 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109012447/http://library.osu.edu/projects/stadium/renovations6.html |archive-date=2013-01-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> General improvements were made in the seating and concourse areas. The result of the $194&nbsp;million renovation was a capacity that rose to 101,568. 80% of the cost of the renovation was funded by the sale of leases on the suites and club seats, with the remaining 20% funded by donations and the sale of naming rights for portions of the stadium. No public or university money was spent in the renovation process.<ref name=ballparks/>\n\nIn 1971, the natural grass field was removed, and [[AstroTurf]] was installed, compliments of a donation by Lou Fisher in dedication to fellow football player Joseph Campanella. A plaque was placed on the southeast corner in memory of Campanella. In 1979, the surface was replaced with SuperTurf. In 1990, natural grass made its return to the Horseshoe, in the form of a special grass called \"Prescription Athletic Turf.\" New field designs were put in place for the 1992 season and existed through the 2006 season. During the 2006 season, problems with the natural grass began to arise. After serious damage to the field during use in the spring of 2006, the field never recovered and had to be re-sodded. That grass never took root because of bad weather, and the university was forced to re-sod the field again only three weeks after the old sod was laid. The university spent approximately $150,000 to perform both soddings. In response to this, OSU replaced the natural grass with [[FieldTurf]] for the 2007 season. This new artificial turf looks and feels like real grass but requires minimal upkeep.\n\nIn March 2012 the university announced a $7&nbsp;million renovation to the scoreboard installed during the 2000\u201301 renovation. The project began April 23 and was completed in time for the 2012 season opener on September 1. The current scoreboard includes a Panasonic HD screen, stretching {{convert|124|by|42|ft}}, and incorporates upgrades to the audio system and the [[LED]] running boards (which are the smaller screens underneath the larger screen that usually display score updates and advertisements). A Pro Sound audio system with 25 different speakers flank the scoreboard. Older speakers throughout the Horseshoe received improvements and will eventually be replaced by new speakers fitted into the existing framework.\n\nPrior to the 2014 season, 2,500 seats were added to the south stands. These seats were built over the entrance tunnels and raised the official capacity of the stadium to 104,851, making it the third largest stadium in the country and the fourth largest stadium in the world. The renovations also included permanent lights added to the northeast and southeast corners of the stadium, as well as atop the press box, and the playing surface was replaced.<ref name=ballparks/><ref name=archivesB>{{cite web |title=2014 Ohio Stadium Renovations |work=Scribd. |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/146179633/Ohio-Stadium |accessdate=June 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611011432/http://www.scribd.com/doc/146179633/Ohio-Stadium |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>[[File:Panoramic view of Ohio Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|Panoramic view.|500px]]\n\n=== Timeline of seating capacity<ref>[http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&KEY=&ATCLID=925256 Ohio Stadium - The Ohio State Buckeyes Official Athletics Site - OhioStateBuckeyes.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725033140/http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&KEY=&ATCLID=925256|date=2011-07-25}}</ref> ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}}\"|Capacity\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}}\"|Years\n|-\n|66,210\n|1922\u20131943\n|-\n|72,754\n|1944\u20131947\n|-\n|78,677\n|1948\u20131957\n|-\n|79,658\n|1958\u20131960\n|-\n|79,727\n|1961\n|-\n|81,109\n|1962\u20131968\n|-\n|81,455\n|1969\u20131970\n|-\n|81,475\n|1971\n|-\n|81,667\n|1972\n|-\n|82,567\n|1973\n|-\n|83,080\n|1974\n|-\n|83,112\n|1975\u20131981\n|-\n|85,290\n|1982\u20131984\n|-\n|85,399\n|1985\u20131988\n|-\n|86,071\n|1989\u20131990\n|-\n|91,470\n|1991\u20131994\n|-\n|89,841\n|1995\u20131999\n|-\n|95,346\n|2000\n|-\n|101,568\n|2001\u20132006\n|-\n|102,329\n|2007\u20132014\n|-\n|104,944\n|2014\u20132017\n|-\n|102,082\n|2018\n|-\n|102,780\n|2019\n|}\n\n===Night football games===\nBefore the 2014 renovations, Ohio Stadium did not have permanent lights at the stadium, thus night games were rare. Ohio State's first night game in the stadium was played on September 14, 1985, when the #9 Buckeyes defeated the [[1985 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh Panthers]], 10\u20137. Ohio State did not play another night game at Ohio Stadium until September 11, 1993, when the 16th-ranked Buckeyes defeated #12 [[1993 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] 21\u201312. Ohio State played a total of 12 more night games before permanent lighting was installed, nine of which were against ranked opponents. The Buckeyes are 16-5 (.762) overall and 9-1 (.900) in the Big Ten in night games through September 18, 2017. Ohio State's most recent night game was a 34\u201310 win versus Michigan State on October 5th, 2019.\n\nBelow is a table of teams the Buckeyes have faced in multiple night games at Ohio Stadium.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Matchups!!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Opponent!!style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|OSU Record\n|-\n|3||Penn State||2-1\n|-\n|2\n|Nebraska\n|2-0\n|-\n|2||Washington||2-0\n|-\n|2||Wisconsin||2-0\n|}\n\n===Largest attendance===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Rank !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Date !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Attendance !! style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Ohio State Buckeyes|color=white}};\"|Result\n|-\n| 1 || November 26, 2016 || 110,045 || #2 Ohio State 30 \u2013 #3 Michigan 27 (2 OT)\n|-\n|2\n|October 28, 2017\n|109,302\n|#6 Ohio State 39 - #2 Penn State 38\n|-\n|3\n|September 9, 2017\n|109,088\n|#5 Oklahoma 31 \u2013 #2 Ohio State 16\n|-\n|4|| November 21, 2015 || 108,975 || #9 Michigan State 17 \u2013 #3 Ohio State 14\n|-\n|5||November 5, 2016||108,750|| #6 Ohio State 62 \u2013 #10 Nebraska 3\n|-\n|6|| November 29, 2014 || 108,610 || #6 Ohio State 42 \u2013 Michigan 28\n|-\n|7|| October 17, 2015 || 108,423 || #1 Ohio State 38 \u2013 Penn State 10\n|-\n|8|| September 16, 2017 || 108,414 || #8 Ohio State 38 \u2013 Army 7\n|-\n|9\n|September 27, 2014\n|108,362<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=400547674|title=Barrett, Elliott lead Buckeyes by Bearcats, 50-28|date=September 27, 2014|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=September 27, 2014|agency=Associated Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929012452/http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=400547674|archive-date=September 29, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|#22 Ohio State 50 \u2013 Cincinnati 28\n|-\n|10|| November 7, 2015 || 108,075<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110815aab.html|title=Ohio State Postgame Notes|website=www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com|accessdate=2015-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190842/http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110815aab.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref> || #3 Ohio State 28 \u2013 Minnesota 14\n|}\n\n==Buckeye football==\n[[File:Script Ohio.jpg|thumb|250px|Script Ohio]]\nThe largest crowd in stadium history is 110,045, set November 26, 2016, in a game against Michigan.

Holococcoliths are produced only in the haploid phase, lack radial symmetry, and are composed of anywhere from hundreds to thousands of similar minute (ca 0.1&nbsp;\u00b5m) rhombic [[calcite]] crystals.  These crystals are thought to form at least partially outside the cell.  Heterococcoliths occur only in the diploid phase, have radial symmetry, and are composed of relatively few complex crystal units (less than 100).  Although they are rare, combination coccospheres, which contain both holococcoliths and heterococcoliths, have been observed in the plankton recording coccolithophore life cycle transitions.

Most obviously coccoliths may protect the phytoplankton from  predators. It also appears that it helps them to create a more stable [[pH]]. During photosynthesis carbon dioxide is removed from the water, making it more basic. Also calcification removes carbon dioxide, but chemistry behind it leads to the opposite pH reaction; it makes the water more acidic. The combination of photosynthesis and  calcification therefore even out each other regarding pH changes.<ref>[https://theconversation.com/microscopic-marine-plants-bioengineer-their-environment-to-enhance-their-own-growth-63355 Microscopic marine plants bioengineer their environment to enhance their own growth - The Conversation]</ref> In addition, these exoskeletons may confer an advantage in energy production, as coccolithogenesis seems highly coupled with photosynthesis. Organic precipitation of calcium carbonate from bicarbonate solution produces free carbon dioxide directly within the cellular body of the alga, this additional source of gas is then available to the Coccolithophore for photosynthesis.  It has been suggested that they may provide a cell-wall like barrier to isolate intracellular chemistry from the marine environment.<ref name=Westbroek1983>{{citation |journal=Ecological Bulletins |year=1983 |pages= 291\u2013299 |title=Calcification in Coccolithophoridae: Wasteful or Functional? |first=P.|last=Westbroek|display-authors=etal}}</ref> More specific, defensive properties of coccoliths may include protection from osmotic changes, chemical or mechanical shock, and short-wavelength light.<ref name=Jordan2012>{{citation |journal=eLS |year=2012|title=Haptophyta |last=Jordan |first=R.W. |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0001981.pub2 |isbn=978-0470016176}}</ref> It has also been proposed that the added weight of multiple layers of coccoliths allows the organism to sink to lower, more nutrient rich layers of the water and conversely, that coccoliths add buoyancy, stopping the cell from sinking to dangerous depths.<ref name=Irie2010>{{citation |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=e13436 |year=2010 |title=Increasing costs due to ocean acidification drives phytoplankton to be more heavily calcified: optimal growth strategy of coccolithophores |first=Takahiro|last=Irie |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013436|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2010PLoSO...513436I |pmid=20976167 |pmc=2955539}}</ref> Coccolith appendages have also been proposed to serve several functions, such as inhibiting grazing by zooplankton.<ref name=Young2009 />\n\n====Uses====\nCoccoliths are the main component  of the Chalk, a Late Cretaceous rock formation which outcrops widely in southern England and forms the [[White Cliffs of Dover]], and of other similar rocks in many other parts of the world.<ref name=\"hup.harvard.edu\"/> At the present day sedimented coccoliths are a major component of the [[Pelagic sediment#Oozes|calcareous oozes]] that cover up to 35% of the ocean floor and is kilometres thick in places.<ref name=deVargas2007 />  Because of their abundance and wide geographic ranges, the coccoliths which make up the layers of this ooze and the chalky sediment formed as it is compacted serve as valuable [[microfossils]].\n\n===Cellular anatomy===\nEnclosed in each coccosphere is a single cell with [[membrane]] bound [[organelles]].

They will inevitably be affected by the increasing temperatures and thermal stratification of the top layer of the ocean, since these are prime controls on their ecology, although it is not clear whether global warming would result in net increase or decrease of coccolithophores.

Each ratio essentially tips the odds in favor of either [[diatom]]s or other groups of phytoplankton, such as coccolithophores.  A low silicate to nitrogen and phosphorus ratio allows coccolithophores to outcompete other phytoplankton species; however, when silicate to phosphorus to nitrogen ratios are high coccolithophores are outcompeted by diatoms. The increase in agricultural processes lead to [[eutrophication]] of waters and thus, coccolithophore blooms in these high nitrogen and phosphorus, low silicate environments.<ref name=\"Yunev2007\"/>\n\n====Impact on water column productivity====\nThe [[calcite]] in calcium carbonate allows coccoliths to scatter more light  than they absorb.  This has two important consequences: 1) Surface waters become brighter, meaning they have a higher [[albedo]], and 2) there is induced [[photoinhibition]], meaning photosythetic production is diminished due to an excess of light.  In case 1), a high concentration of coccoliths leads to a simultaneous increase in surface water temperature and decrease in the temperature of deeper waters. This results in more [[stratification (water)|stratification]] in the water column and a decrease in the vertical mixing of nutrients.  However, a recent study estimated that the overall effect of coccolithophores on the increased in [[radiative forcing]] of the ocean is less than that from anthropogenic factors.<ref name=Morrissey2012>{{cite book |last1=Morrissey |first1=J.F. |last2=Sumich |first2=J.L. |year=2012 |pages=67 |title=Introduction to the Biology of Marine Life}}</ref> Therefore, the overall result of large blooms of coccolithophores is a decrease in water column productivity, rather than a contribution to global warming.\n\n====Predator-prey interactions====\nTheir predators include the common predators of all phytoplankton including small fish, zooplankton, and shellfish larvae.<ref name=Hogan2009 /><ref name=Houdan2004>{{citation |journal=Journal of Plankton Research |volume=26 |issue=8 |year=2004 |pages=875\u2013883 |title=Toxicity of coastal coccolithophores (Prymnesiophyceae, Haptophyta)  |first=A. |last=Houdan |doi=10.1093/plankt/fbh079 |displayauthors=etal  |doi-access=free }}</ref> Viruses specific to this species have been isolated from several locations worldwide and appear to play a major role in spring bloom dynamics.\n\n=====Toxicity=====\nNo environmental evidence of coccolithophore toxicity has been reported, but they belong to the class Prymnesiophyceae which contain orders with toxic species.

Members of the genus ''Prymnesium'' have been found to produce haemolytic compounds, the agent responsible for toxicity.  Some of these toxic species are responsible for large fish kills and can be accumulated in organisms such as shellfish; transferring it through the food chain.

This may not only affect immediate events such as increases in population or coccolith production, but also may induce [[evolutionary adaptation]] of coccolithophore species over longer periods of time.  For example, coccolithophores use H<sup>+</sup> [[ion channels]] in to constantly pump H<sup>+</sup> ions out of the cell during coccolith production.  This allows them to avoid [[acidosis]], as coccolith production would otherwise produce a toxic excess of H<sup>+</sup> ions.  When the function of these ion channels is disrupted, the coccolithophores stop the calcification process to avoid acidosis, thus forming a [[feedback loop]].<ref name=Beaufort2011>{{citation |journal=Nature |volume=476 |issue=7358 |year=2011 |pages=80\u20133 |title=Sensitivity of coccolithophores to carbonate chemistry and ocean acidification |first=L. |last=Beaufort |doi=10.1038/nature10295|pmid=21814280  |displayauthors=etal  }}</ref> Low ocean [[alkalinity]], impairs ion channel function and therefore places evolutionary selective pressure on coccolithophores and makes them (and other ocean calcifiers) vulnerable to ocean acidification.<ref name=Tyrell1999>{{citation |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=104 |issue=C2 |year=1999 |pages=3223\u20133241 |title=Optical impacts of oceanic coccolithophore blooms |first=T. |last=Tyrell |doi=10.1029/1998jc900052 |displayauthors=1 |last2=Mobley |first2=C.

Heterococcoliths occur only in the diploid phase, have radial symmetry, and are composed of relatively few complex crystal units (less than 100).

Most obviously coccoliths may protect the phytoplankton from  predators. It also appears that it helps them to create a more stable [[pH]]. During photosynthesis carbon dioxide is removed from the water, making it more basic. Also calcification removes carbon dioxide, but chemistry behind it leads to the opposite pH reaction; it makes the water more acidic. The combination of photosynthesis and  calcification therefore even out each other regarding pH changes.<ref>[https://theconversation.com/microscopic-marine-plants-bioengineer-their-environment-to-enhance-their-own-growth-63355 Microscopic marine plants bioengineer their environment to enhance their own growth - The Conversation]</ref> In addition, these exoskeletons may confer an advantage in energy production, as coccolithogenesis seems highly coupled with photosynthesis. Organic precipitation of calcium carbonate from bicarbonate solution produces free carbon dioxide directly within the cellular body of the alga, this additional source of gas is then available to the Coccolithophore for photosynthesis.  It has been suggested that they may provide a cell-wall like barrier to isolate intracellular chemistry from the marine environment.<ref name=Westbroek1983>{{citation |journal=Ecological Bulletins |year=1983 |pages= 291\u2013299 |title=Calcification in Coccolithophoridae: Wasteful or Functional? |first=P.|last=Westbroek|display-authors=etal}}</ref> More specific, defensive properties of coccoliths may include protection from osmotic changes, chemical or mechanical shock, and short-wavelength light.<ref name=Jordan2012>{{citation |journal=eLS |year=2012|title=Haptophyta |last=Jordan |first=R.W. |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0001981.pub2 |isbn=978-0470016176}}</ref> It has also been proposed that the added weight of multiple layers of coccoliths allows the organism to sink to lower, more nutrient rich layers of the water and conversely, that coccoliths add buoyancy, stopping the cell from sinking to dangerous depths.<ref name=Irie2010>{{citation |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=e13436 |year=2010 |title=Increasing costs due to ocean acidification drives phytoplankton to be more heavily calcified: optimal growth strategy of coccolithophores |first=Takahiro|last=Irie |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013436|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2010PLoSO...513436I |pmid=20976167 |pmc=2955539}}</ref> Coccolith appendages have also been proposed to serve several functions, such as inhibiting grazing by zooplankton.<ref name=Young2009 />\n\n====Uses====\nCoccoliths are the main component  of the Chalk, a Late Cretaceous rock formation which outcrops widely in southern England and forms the [[White Cliffs of Dover]], and of other similar rocks in many other parts of the world.<ref name=\"hup.harvard.edu\"/> At the present day sedimented coccoliths are a major component of the [[Pelagic sediment#Oozes|calcareous oozes]] that cover up to 35% of the ocean floor and is kilometres thick in places.<ref name=deVargas2007 />  Because of their abundance and wide geographic ranges, the coccoliths which make up the layers of this ooze and the chalky sediment formed as it is compacted serve as valuable [[microfossils]].\n\n===Cellular anatomy===\nEnclosed in each coccosphere is a single cell with [[membrane]] bound [[organelles]].

A low silicate to nitrogen and phosphorus ratio allows coccolithophores to outcompete other phytoplankton species; however, when silicate to phosphorus to nitrogen ratios are high coccolithophores are outcompeted by diatoms.

Some of these toxic species are responsible for large fish kills and can be accumulated in organisms such as shellfish; transferring it through the food chain.

During calcification two carbon atoms are taken up and one of them becomes trapped as calcium carbonate.  This calcium carbonate sinks to the bottom of the ocean in the form of coccoliths and becomes part of sediment; thus, coccolithophores provide a sink for emitted carbon, mediating the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name=Marsh2003 />\n\n===Evolutionary responses to ocean acidification===\nResearch also suggests that [[ocean acidification]] due to increasing concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere may affect the calcification machinery of coccolithophores.  This may not only affect immediate events such as increases in population or coccolith production, but also may induce [[evolutionary adaptation]] of coccolithophore species over longer periods of time.  For example, coccolithophores use H<sup>+</sup> [[ion channels]] in to constantly pump H<sup>+</sup> ions out of the cell during coccolith production.  This allows them to avoid [[acidosis]], as coccolith production would otherwise produce a toxic excess of H<sup>+</sup> ions.  When the function of these ion channels is disrupted, the coccolithophores stop the calcification process to avoid acidosis, thus forming a [[feedback loop]].<ref name=Beaufort2011>{{citation |journal=Nature |volume=476 |issue=7358 |year=2011 |pages=80\u20133 |title=Sensitivity of coccolithophores to carbonate chemistry and ocean acidification |first=L. |last=Beaufort |doi=10.1038/nature10295|pmid=21814280  |displayauthors=etal  }}</ref> Low ocean [[alkalinity]], impairs ion channel function and therefore places evolutionary selective pressure on coccolithophores and makes them (and other ocean calcifiers) vulnerable to ocean acidification.<ref name=Tyrell1999>{{citation |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=104 |issue=C2 |year=1999 |pages=3223\u20133241 |title=Optical impacts of oceanic coccolithophore blooms |first=T. |last=Tyrell |doi=10.1029/1998jc900052 |displayauthors=1 |last2=Mobley |first2=C.

This lower calcification is assumed to put coccolithophores at ecological disadvantage.

It has been reproduced widely in modern monuments and building elements.\n\n==History==\nThe circular structure, raised on a high squared podium, is the first Greek monument built in the [[Corinthian order]] on its exterior. It was originally crowned with an elaborate floral support for the bronze tripod, the prize awarded to Lysicrates' chorus.  Its frieze sculpture is thought to depict the [[mythology|myth]] of [[Dionysus]] and the Tyrrhenian pirates from the [[Homeric Hymn]]<ref>Barbara Kowalzig, Peter Wilson (eds),Dithyramb in Context,2013, p.46.

Immediately below the architrave and between the column capitals is a second frieze depicting the choragic tripods.

III, pt 2 pp21ff (noted in Cou 1893)..</ref>  The young British architects [[James Stuart (1713\u20131788)|James \"Athenian\" Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett]] published the first measured drawings of the monument in their ''Antiquities of Athens'', London 1762. The monument became famous in France and England through engravings of it, and \"improved\" versions became eye-catching features in several [[Landscape garden|English landscape garden]]s. [[Lord Byron]] stayed at the monastery  during his second visit to Greece. In 1818, friar Francis planted in its gardens the first [[tomato]] plants in Greece. In 1821 the convent, which had enclosed the monument, used as a storage for books, was burned by the Ottomans during the [[Greek War of Independence]], and subsequently demolished, and the monument was inadvertently exposed to the weather.<ref>Cou 1893.</ref> In 1829, the [[monk]]s offered the structure to an Englishman on tour, but it proved to be too cumbersome to disassemble and ship.  [[Lord Elgin]] negotiated unsuccessfully for the monument, by then an icon in the [[Greek Revival]].\n\nFrench [[archaeologist]]s cleared the rubble from the half-buried monument and searched the area for missing architectural parts. In 1876\u20131887, the architects Fran\u00e7ois Boulanger and E. Loviot supervised a restoration under the auspices of the French government.\n\nIn June 2016, [[anarchists]] vandalised the monument with spray paint, writing: \"Your Greek monuments are concentration camps for immigrants\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thepressroom.gr/ellada/vandalisan-me-sprei-agalma-toy-lysikrati|title=\u0392\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ac\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039b\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 |publisher=thepressroom}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.gr/greece/news/article/257521/anarchiki-vandalisan-archeo-mnimio-tou-lisikrati-foto.html|title=\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03bf \u039c\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039b\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7 (\u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf) |publisher=tribune}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n[[File:Lysikrates monument 1900.jpg|thumb|left|200px|View of 1900]]\n\nFamous British versions of the Choragic Monument include the [[Dugald Stewart Monument]] and Burns' Monument both on  [[Calton Hill]] in [[Edinburgh]], on the towers of the former North Kirk in Aberdeen and St Giles Church in Elgin, the Huskisson Memorial in [[St James Cemetery]] Liverpool and in the gardens at [[Shugborough|Shugborough, Staffordshire]], [[Tatton Park]] and [[Alton Towers]] among many others.

His scheme can be seen as a simplification of Holdridge's; more readily accessible, but missing Holdridge's greater specificity.\n\nWhittaker based his approach on theoretical assertions and empirical sampling. He was in a unique position to make such a holistic assertion because he had previously compiled a review of biome classifications.<ref>Whittaker, Robert H., Botanical Review, Classification of Natural Communities, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Jan\u2013Mar 1962), pp. 1\u2013239.</ref>\n\n====Key definitions for understanding Whittaker's scheme====\n* [[Physiognomy]]: the apparent characteristics, outward features, or appearance of ecological communities or species.\n* Biome: a grouping of terrestrial ecosystems on a given continent that is similar in vegetation structure, physiognomy, features of the environment and characteristics of their animal communities.\n* [[Formation (vegetation)|Formation]]: a major kind of community of plants on a given continent.\n* Biome-type: grouping of convergent biomes or formations of different continents, defined by physiognomy.\n* Formation-type: a grouping of convergent formations.\n\nWhittaker's distinction between biome and formation can be simplified: formation is used when applied to [[plant communities]] only, while biome is used when concerned with both plants and animals. Whittaker's convention of biome-type or formation-type is simply a broader method to categorize similar communities.<ref name=\"Whittaker1975\">Whittaker, Robert H. Communities and Ecosystems.

Whittaker considered four main ecoclines in the terrestrial realm.<ref name=\"Whittaker1975\"/>\n# Intertidal levels: The wetness gradient of areas that are exposed to alternating water and dryness with intensities that vary by location from high to low tide\n# Climatic moisture gradient\n# Temperature gradient by altitude\n# Temperature gradient by latitude\n\nAlong these gradients, Whittaker noted several trends that allowed him to qualitatively establish biome-types:\n* The gradient runs from favorable to the extreme, with corresponding changes in productivity.\n* Changes in physiognomic complexity vary with how favorable of an environment exists (decreasing community structure and reduction of stratal differentiation as the environment becomes less favorable).\n* Trends in the diversity of structure follow trends in species diversity; alpha and beta species diversities decrease from favorable to extreme environments.\n* Each growth-form (i.e. grasses, shrubs, etc.) has its characteristic place of maximum importance along the ecoclines.\n* The same growth forms may be dominant in similar environments in widely different parts of the world.\n\nWhittaker summed the effects of gradients (3) and (4) to get an overall temperature gradient and combined this with a gradient (2), the moisture gradient, to express the above conclusions in what is known as the Whittaker classification scheme. The scheme graphs average annual precipitation (x-axis) versus average annual temperature (y-axis) to classify biome-types.\n\n====Biome-types====\n{{Div col}}\n# Tropical rainforest\n# Tropical seasonal rainforest\n#* deciduous\n#* semideciduous\n# Temperate giant rainforest\n# Montane rainforest\n# Temperate deciduous forest\n# Temperate evergreen forest\n#* needleleaf\n#* sclerophyll\n# Subarctic-subalpin needle-leaved forests (taiga)\n# Elfin woodland\n# Thorn forests and woodlands\n# Thorn scrub\n# Temperate woodland\n# Temperate shrublands\n#* deciduous\n#* heath\n#* sclerophyll\n#* subalpine-needleleaf\n#* subalpine-broadleaf\n# Savanna\n# Temperate grassland\n# Alpine grasslands\n# Tundra\n# Tropical desert\n# Warm-temperate desert\n# Cool temperate desert scrub\n# Arctic-alpine desert\n# Bog\n# Tropical fresh-water swamp forest\n# Temperate fresh-water swamp forest\n# Mangrove swamp\n# Salt marsh\n# Wetland<ref>Whittaker, R.

The system, also assessing precipitation and temperature, finds nine major biome types, with the important climate traits and [[vegetation type]]s. The boundaries of each biome correlate to the conditions of moisture and cold stress that are strong determinants of plant form, and therefore the vegetation that defines the region. Extreme conditions, such as flooding in a swamp, can create different kinds of communities within the same biome.<ref name=\"WalterBreckle\"/><ref>Walter, H. 1976.

His scheme can be seen as a simplification of Holdridge's; more readily accessible, but missing Holdridge's greater specificity.\n\nWhittaker based his approach on theoretical assertions and empirical sampling. He was in a unique position to make such a holistic assertion because he had previously compiled a review of biome classifications.<ref>Whittaker, Robert H., Botanical Review, Classification of Natural Communities, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Jan\u2013Mar 1962), pp. 1\u2013239.</ref>\n\n====Key definitions for understanding Whittaker's scheme====\n* [[Physiognomy]]: the apparent characteristics, outward features, or appearance of ecological communities or species.\n* Biome: a grouping of terrestrial ecosystems on a given continent that is similar in vegetation structure, physiognomy, features of the environment and characteristics of their animal communities.\n* [[Formation (vegetation)|Formation]]: a major kind of community of plants on a given continent.\n* Biome-type: grouping of convergent biomes or formations of different continents, defined by physiognomy.\n* Formation-type: a grouping of convergent formations.\n\nWhittaker's distinction between biome and formation can be simplified: formation is used when applied to [[plant communities]] only, while biome is used when concerned with both plants and animals. Whittaker's convention of biome-type or formation-type is simply a broader method to categorize similar communities.<ref name=\"Whittaker1975\">Whittaker, Robert H. Communities and Ecosystems.

Whittaker considered four main ecoclines in the terrestrial realm.<ref name=\"Whittaker1975\"/>\n# Intertidal levels: The wetness gradient of areas that are exposed to alternating water and dryness with intensities that vary by location from high to low tide\n# Climatic moisture gradient\n# Temperature gradient by altitude\n# Temperature gradient by latitude\n\nAlong these gradients, Whittaker noted several trends that allowed him to qualitatively establish biome-types:\n* The gradient runs from favorable to the extreme, with corresponding changes in productivity.\n* Changes in physiognomic complexity vary with how favorable of an environment exists (decreasing community structure and reduction of stratal differentiation as the environment becomes less favorable).\n* Trends in the diversity of structure follow trends in species diversity; alpha and beta species diversities decrease from favorable to extreme environments.\n* Each growth-form (i.e. grasses, shrubs, etc.) has its characteristic place of maximum importance along the ecoclines.\n* The same growth forms may be dominant in similar environments in widely different parts of the world.\n\nWhittaker summed the effects of gradients (3) and (4) to get an overall temperature gradient and combined this with a gradient (2), the moisture gradient, to express the above conclusions in what is known as the Whittaker classification scheme. The scheme graphs average annual precipitation (x-axis) versus average annual temperature (y-axis) to classify biome-types.\n\n====Biome-types====\n{{Div col}}\n# Tropical rainforest\n# Tropical seasonal rainforest\n#* deciduous\n#* semideciduous\n# Temperate giant rainforest\n# Montane rainforest\n# Temperate deciduous forest\n# Temperate evergreen forest\n#* needleleaf\n#* sclerophyll\n# Subarctic-subalpin needle-leaved forests (taiga)\n# Elfin woodland\n# Thorn forests and woodlands\n# Thorn scrub\n# Temperate woodland\n# Temperate shrublands\n#* deciduous\n#* heath\n#* sclerophyll\n#* subalpine-needleleaf\n#* subalpine-broadleaf\n# Savanna\n# Temperate grassland\n# Alpine grasslands\n# Tundra\n# Tropical desert\n# Warm-temperate desert\n# Cool temperate desert scrub\n# Arctic-alpine desert\n# Bog\n# Tropical fresh-water swamp forest\n# Temperate fresh-water swamp forest\n# Mangrove swamp\n# Salt marsh\n# Wetland<ref>Whittaker, R.

His reign saw a consolidation of Byzantine security from external threats. As an able military leader, Constantine took advantage of [[Third Fitna|civil war]] in the Muslim world to make limited offensives on the [[Al-'Awasim|Arab frontier]]. With this eastern frontier secure, he undertook repeated campaigns against the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in the [[Balkans]]. His military activity, and policy of settling Christian populations from the Arab frontier in [[Thrace]], made Byzantium's hold on its Balkan territories more secure. Religious strife and controversy was a prominent feature of his reign. His fervent support of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] and opposition to [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]] led to his vilification by later Byzantine historians and writers, who denigrated him as ''Kopronymos'' or ''Copronymus'' (\u039a\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), meaning ''the dung-named''.It was under his rule that the empire lost the city of rome.\n\n==Early life==\nConstantine was born in [[Constantinople]], the son and successor of Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and his wife [[Maria, wife of Leo III|Maria]]. In August 720, at two years of age, he was associated with his father on the throne, and appointed co-emperor. In Byzantine political theory more than one emperor could share the throne; however, although all were accorded the same ceremonial status, only one emperor wielded ultimate power. As the position of emperor was in theory, and sometimes in practise, elective rather than strictly hereditary, a ruling emperor would often associate a son or other chosen successor with himself as a co-emperor to ensure the eventual succession.<ref>Nicol, p. 72</ref> To celebrate the coronation of his son, Leo III introduced a new silver coin, the ''[[miliaresion]]''; worth a 12th of a gold ''[[Solidus (coin)|nomisma]]'', it soon became an integral part of the Byzantine economy. In 726, Constantine's father issued the ''[[Ecloga]]''; a revised [[legal code]], it was attributed to both father and son jointly. Constantine married [[Tzitzak]], daughter of the [[Khazars|Khazar]] khagan [[Bihar (Khazar)|Bihar]], an important Byzantine ally. His new bride was baptized Irene (''Eir\u0113n\u0113'', \"peace\") in 732. On his father's death, Constantine succeeded as sole emperor on 18 June 741.<ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 165</ref><ref>Finlay, p. 43</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 349</ref><ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 76</ref> \n\nConstantine suffered from a chronic medical condition, possibly [[epilepsy]] or [[leprosy]]; early in his reign this may have been employed by those rebelling against him to question his fitness to be emperor.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 157</ref>\n\n==Rebellion of Artabasdos==\nIn June 742, while Constantine was crossing [[Asia Minor]] to campaign on the eastern frontier against the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] under [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]], his brother-in-law [[Artabasdos]], husband of his older sister, [[Anna, wife of Artabasdos|Anna]], rebelled. Artabasdos was the [[strategos|strat\u0113gos]] (military governor) of the [[Opsikion]] [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] (province) and had effective control of the [[Armeniac Theme|Armeniac theme]]. Artabasdos struck against Constantine when their respective troops combined for the intended campaign; a trusted member of Constantine's retinue, called Beser, was killed in the attack. Constantine escaped and sought refuge in [[Amorium|Amorion]], where he was welcomed by the local soldiers, who had been commanded by Leo III before he became emperor.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, pp. 157\u2013158</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 156\u2013157</ref> Meanwhile, Artabasdos advanced on Constantinople and, with the support of Theophanes Monutes (Constantine's regent) and [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Anastasius of Constantinople|Anastasius]], was acclaimed and crowned emperor. Constantine received the support of the [[Anatolic Theme|Anatolic]] and [[Thracesian Theme|Thracesian]] themes; Artabasdos secured the support of the theme of [[Thrace (theme)|Thrace]] in addition to his own Opsikion and Armeniac soldiers.<ref>Bury, p. 10</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, pp. 165\u2013166</ref>\n\nThe rival emperors bided their time making military preparations. Artabasdos marched against Constantine at [[Sardis]] in May 743 but was defeated. Three months later Constantine defeated Artabasdos' son [[Niketas (son of Artabasdos)|Niketas]] and his Armeniac troops at [[Mudurnu|Modrina]] and headed for Constantinople. In early November Constantine entered the capital, following a siege and a further battle.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 159</ref>. He immediately targeted his opponents, having many [[Political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] or executed. Patriarch Anastasius was paraded on the back of an ass around the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|hippodrome]] to the jeers of the Constantinopolitan mob, though he was subsequently allowed to stay in office.<ref>Bury, p. 10</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 166</ref> Artabasdos, having fled the capital, was apprehended at  the fortress of Pouzanes in Anatolia, probably located to the south of [[Nicomedia]]. Artabasdos and his sons were then publicly blinded and secured in the [[Chora Monastery|monastery of Chora]] on the outskirts of Constantinople.<ref>Garland, p. 9</ref>\n\n==Constantine's support of iconoclasm==\n[[File:48-manasses-chronicle.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers deface or demolish an iconudule church on the orders of Constantine V (left), Manasses Chronicle, 14th-century manuscript]]\n[[File:Costantinopoli, solido di costantino v e leone iv, 751-775.jpg|thumb|right|Gold ''solidus'', Constantine V (left) and his son and co-emperor Leo IV (right)]]\n{{Further|Byzantine iconoclasm}}\nLike his father Leo III, Constantine supported [[iconoclasm]], which was a theological movement that rejected the veneration of religious images and sought to destroy those in existence. Iconoclasm was later definitively classed as [[heresy|heretical]]. Constantine's avowed enemies in what was a bitter and long-lived religious dispute were the [[iconodules]], who defended the veneration of images. Iconodule writers applied to Constantine the derogatory epithet ''Kopronymos'' (\"dung-named\", from ''kopros'', meaning \"[[faeces]]\" or \"animal dung\", and ''onoma'', \"name\"). Using this obscene name, they spread the rumour that as an infant he had defiled his own baptism by defaecating in the font, or on the imperial purple cloth with which he was swaddled.<ref>Bury, p. 9</ref>\n\nConstantine questioned the legitimacy of any representation of God or Christ. The [[church father]] [[John Damascene]] made use of the term 'uncircumscribable' in relation to the depiction of God. Constantine, relying on the linguistic connection between 'uncircumscribed' and 'incapable of being depicted', argued that the uncircumscribable cannot be legitimately depicted in an image. As Christian theology holds that [[Homoousion|Christ is God]], He also cannot be represented in an image.<ref>Barnard, p. 13</ref> The Emperor was personally active in the theological debate; evidence exists for him composing thirteen treatises, two of which survive in fragmentary form.<ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 171</ref> He also presented his religious views at meetings organised throughout the empire, sending representatives to argue his case.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 182</ref> In February 754, Constantine convened a [[Council of Hieria|synod at Hieria]], which was attended entirely by iconoclast bishops. The council agreed with Constantine's religious policy on images, declaring them [[anathema]], and it secured the election of a new iconoclast patriarch. However, it refused to endorse all of Constantine's policies, which were influenced by the more extremist iconoclasts and were critical of the veneration of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] and of the [[saint]]s. The council confirmed the status of Mary as ''[[Theotokos]]'' ({{Lang|grc|\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2}}), or 'Mother of God', upheld the use of the terms \"saint\" and \"holy\" as legitimate, and condemned the desecration, burning, or looting of churches in the quest to suppress icon veneration.<ref>Ostrogorsky, pp. 171\u2013173</ref><ref>Pelikan, pp. 111\u2013112</ref><ref>Loos, p. 32</ref>\n\nThe synod was followed by a campaign to remove images from the walls of churches and to purge the court and bureaucracy of iconodules. Since monasteries tended to be strongholds of iconophile sentiment and contributed little or nothing towards the secular needs of the state, Constantine specifically targeted these communities of monks. He also expropriated monastic property for the benefit of the state or the army. These acts of repression against the monks were largely led by the Emperor's general [[Michael Lachanodrakon]], who threatened resistant monks with blinding and exile. In the hippodrome he organised the pairing of numerous monks and nuns in forced marriage, publicly ridiculing their vows of chastity.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 156</ref> An iconodule abbot, [[Stephen the Younger|Stephen Neos]], was beaten to death by a mob at the behest of the authorities. As a result of persecution, many monks fled to southern Italy and [[Sicily]].<ref>Ostrogorsky, pp. 173\u2013175</ref> The implacable resistance of iconodule monks and their supporters led to their propaganda reaching those close to the Emperor. On becoming aware of an iconodule influenced conspiracy directed at himself, Constantine reacted uncompromisingly; in 765, eighteen high dignitaries were paraded in the hippodrome charged with treason, they were variously executed, blinded or exiled. The patriarch [[Constantine II of Constantinople|Constantine]] was implicated and deposed from office, the following year he was tortured and then beheaded.<ref>Bury, p. 14</ref>\n\nBy the end of Constantine's reign, iconoclasm had gone as far as to brand [[relic]]s and prayers to the saints as heretical, or at least highly questionable. However, the extent of coherent official campaigns to forcibly destroy or cover up religious images or the existence of widespread government-sanctioned destruction of relics has been questioned by more recent scholarship. There is no evidence, for example, that Constantine formally banned the cult of saints. Pre-iconoclastic religious images did survive, and various existing accounts record that icons were preserved by being hidden. In general, the culture of pictorial religious representation appears to have survived the iconoclast period largely intact. The extent and severity of iconoclastic destruction of images and relics was exaggerated in later iconodule writings.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, pp. 208\u2013211</ref><ref>Zuckerman pp. 203\u2013204</ref>\n\nIconodules considered Constantine's death a divine punishment. In the 9th century, following the ultimate triumph of the iconodules, Constantine's remains were removed from the imperial sepulchre in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].<ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 175</ref>\n\n==Domestic policies and administration==\n[[File:Asia Minor ca 780 AD.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of the themes of Byzantine Asia Minor and the Arab\u2013Byzantine frontier zone in the late 8th century, following the provincial reforms of Constantine V (the border of imperial Thrace does not reflect that [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] was a Byzantine city)]]\nAssiduous in courting popularity, Constantine consciously employed the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|hippodrome]], scene of the ever-popular [[chariot races]], to influence the populace of Constantinople. In this he made use of the 'circus factions', which controlled the competing teams of charioteers and their supporters, had widespread social influence, and could mobilise large numbers of the citizenry. The hippodrome became the setting of rituals of humiliation for war captives and political enemies, in which the mob took delight. Constantine's sources of support were the people and the army, and he used them against his iconodule opponents in the monasteries and in the bureaucracy of the capital. Iconoclasm was not purely an imperial religious conviction, it also had considerable popular support: some of Constantine's actions against the iconodules may have been motivated by a desire to retain the approval of the people and the army. The monasteries were exempt from taxation and monks from service in the army; the Emperor's antipathy towards them may have derived to a greater extent from secular, fiscal and manpower, considerations than from a reaction to their theology.<ref>Angold, Ch. 5, 'Constantine V', paragraph 7</ref><ref>Magdalino (2015), pp. 177\u2013178</ref><ref>Rochow, pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nConstantine carried forward the administrative and fiscal reforms initiated by his father Leo III. The military governors ({{Lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03af}}'', strategoi'') were powerful figures, whose access to the resources of their extensive provinces often provided the means of rebellion. The Opsikion theme had been the power-base that enabled the rebellion of Artabasdos, and was also the theme situated nearest to the capital within [[Asia Minor]]. Constantine reduced the size of this theme, dividing from it the [[Bucellarian Theme|Bucellarian]] and, perhaps, the [[Optimatoi|Optimaton]] themes. In those provinces closest to the seat of government this measure increased the number of ''strategoi'' and diminished the resources available to any single one, making rebellion less easy to accomplish.<ref>Bury, p. 3</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997),  p. 358</ref>\n\nConstantine was responsible for the creation of a small central army of fully professional soldiers, the imperial [[tagma (military)|''tagmata'']] (literally: 'the regiments'). He achieved this by training for serious warfare a corps of largely ceremonial guards units that were attached to the imperial palace, and expanding their numbers. This force was designed to form the core of field armies and was composed of better-drilled, better-paid, and better-equipped soldiers than were found in the provincial ''[[themata]]'' units, whose troops were part-time soldier-farmers. Before their expansion, the vestigial [[Scholae]] and the other guards units presumably contained few useful soldiers, therefore Constantine must have incorporated former thematic soldiers into his new formation.<ref>Treadgold (1995), pp. 71\u201372</ref> Being largely based at or near the capital, the ''tagmata'' were under the immediate control of the Emperor and were free of the regional loyalties that had been behind so many military rebellions.<ref>Haldon, p. 78</ref><ref>Magdalino (2015), p. 177</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 358\u2013359</ref>\n[[File:Hagia Irene, built in the 4th century at the place where the old church of the bishop of Byzantium stood before the refoundation of Constantine the Great, destroyed by fire in 532 AD and then rebuilt, Istanbul (40654254081).jpg|thumb|right|A mosaic cross in the apse of the [[Hagia Irene]] church in Istanbul. It is one of the few artistic remains of iconoclasm. Created during the reign of Constantine it occupies the semi-dome of the apse usually reserved for a devotional image, often a depiction of [[Christ Pantocrator]] or the [[Theotokos]]]]\nThe fiscal administration of Constantine was highly competent. This drew from his enemies accusations of being a merciless and rapacious extractor of taxes and an oppressor of the rural population. However, the empire was prosperous and Constantine left a very well-stocked treasury for his successor. The area of cultivated land within the Empire was extended and food became cheaper; between 718 and c. 800 the corn (wheat) production of Thrace trebled. Constantine's court was opulent, with splendid buildings, and he consciously promoted the patronage of secular art to replace the religious art that he removed.<ref>Bury, p. 11</ref><ref>Jenkins, p. 72</ref>\n\nConstantine constructed a number of notable buildings in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]], including the [[Church of the Virgin of the Pharos]] and the ''porphyra''. The ''porphyra'' was a chamber lined with [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], a stone of imperial purple colour. In it expectant empresses underwent the final stages of labour and it was the birthplace of the children of reigning emperors. Constantine's son Leo was the first child born here, and thereby obtained the title ''porphyrog\u00e9nn\u0113tos'' ([[born in the purple]]) the ultimate accolade of legitimacy for an imperial prince or princess. The concept of a 'purple birth' predated the construction of the chamber, but it gained a literal aspect from the chamber's existence.<ref>Herrin, p. 185</ref> The porphyry was reputed to have come from [[Rome]] and represented a direct link to the ancient origins of Byzantine imperial authority.<ref>Magdalino (1993), p. 424</ref> Constantine also rebuilt the prominent church of [[Hagia Eirene]] in Constantinople, which had been badly damaged by the [[740 Constantinople earthquake|earthquake that hit Constantinople in 740]]. The building preserves rare examples of iconoclastic church decoration.<ref>Freely and Cakmak, pp. 136\u2013143</ref>\n\nWith the impetus of having fathered numerous offspring, Constantine codified the court titles given to members of the imperial family. He associated only his eldest son, [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo]], with the throne as co-emperor, but gave his younger sons the titles of [[caesar (title)|caesar]] for the more senior in age and [[nobelissimos]] for the more junior.<ref>Jeffreys, Haldon and Cormack, p. 505</ref>\n\n==Campaigns against the Arabs==\n{{Further|Byzantine\u2013Arab wars (780\u20131180)|Arab\u2013Byzantine wars#Stabilization of the frontier, 718\u2013863}}\nIn 746, profiting by the [[Third Fitna|unstable conditions]] in the Umayyad Caliphate, which was falling apart under [[Marwan II]], Constantine invaded Syria and captured Germanikeia (modern [[Kahramanmara\u015f|Marash]], his father's birthplace), and he recaptured the island of [[Cyprus]]. He organised the resettlement of part of the local Christian population to imperial territory in [[Thrace]], strengthening the empire's control of this region. In 747 his fleet destroyed the Arab fleet off Cyprus. The same year saw a serious outbreak of plague in Constantinople, which caused a pause in Byzantine military operations. Constantine retired to [[Bithynia]] to avoid the disease and, after it had run its course, resettled people from mainland Greece and the Aegean islands in Constantinople to replace those who had perished.<ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 359\u2013360</ref>\n\nIn 751 he led an invasion into the new [[Abbasid Caliphate]] under [[As-Saffah]]. Constantine captured Theodosiopolis ([[Erzurum]]) and Melitene ([[Malatya]]), which he demolished, and again resettled some of the population in the [[Balkans]]. The eastern campaigns failed to secure concrete territorial gains, as there was no serious attempt to retain control of the captured cities, except [[Camachus|Camachum]] (modern [[Kemah, Erzincan]]), which was garrisoned. However, under Constantine the Empire had gone on the offensive against the Arabs after over a century of largely defensive warfare. Constantine's major goal in his eastern campaigns seems to have been to forcibly gather up local Christian populations from beyond his borders in order to resettle Thrace. Additionally, the deliberate depopulation of the region beyond the eastern borders created a no-man's land where the concentration and provisioning of Arab armies was made more difficult. This in turn increased the security of Byzantine Anatolia. His military reputation was such that, in 757, the mere rumour of his presence caused an Arab army to retreat. In the same year he agreed a truce and an exchange of prisoners with the Arabs, freeing his army for offensive campaigning in the Balkans.<ref>Bury, p. 10</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 167</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 360, 362</ref><ref>Bonner, p. 107</ref>\n\n==Events in Italy==\nWith Constantine militarily occupied elsewhere, and the continuance of imperial influence in the West being given a low priority, the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Aistulf]] captured [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Ravenna]] in 755, ending over two centuries of Byzantine rule in central Italy.<ref>Moffat, p. 55</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, pp. 169\u2013170</ref> The lack of interest Constantine showed in Italian affairs had profound and lasting consequences. [[Pope Stephen II]], seeking protection from the aggression of the Lombards, appealed in person to the [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Pepin the Short]]. Pepin cowed Aistulf and restored Stephen to Rome at the head of an army. This began the Frankish involvement in Italy that eventually established Pepin's son [[Charlemagne]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor in the West]], and also instigated papal temporal rule in Italy with the creation of the [[Papal States]].<ref>Jenkins, p. 71</ref>\n\nConstantine sent a number of unsuccessful embassies to the Lombards, Franks and the papacy to demand the restoration of Ravenna, but never attempted a military reconquest or intervention.<ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 360</ref>\n\n==Repeated campaigns against the Bulgarians==\n[[Image:Byzantine\u2013Bulgarian Wars (741-775).png|170px|thumb|right|Byzantine and Bulgarian campaigns during the reign of Constantine (741\u2013775)]]\nThe successes in the east made it possible to then pursue an aggressive policy in the Balkans. Constantine aimed to enhance the prosperity and defence of Thrace by the resettlement there of Christian populations transplanted from the east. This influx of settlers, allied to an active re-fortification of the border, caused concern to the Empire's northern neighbour, [[Bulgaria]], leading the two states to clash in 755. [[Kormisosh]] of Bulgaria raided as far as the [[Anastasian Wall]] (the outermost defence of the approaches to Constantinople) but was defeated in battle by Constantine, who inaugurated a series of nine successful campaigns against the Bulgarians in the next year, scoring a victory over Kormisosh's successor [[Vinekh]] at [[battle of Marcellae (756)|Marcellae]]. In 759, Constantine was defeated in the [[Battle of the Rishki Pass]], but the Bulgarians did not exploit their success.<ref>Bury, p. 11</ref><ref>Jenkins, pp. 71\u201372</ref>\n\nConstantine campaigned against the Slav tribes of Thrace and Macedonia in 762, deporting some tribes to the Opsician theme in Anatolia, though some voluntarily requested relocation away from the troubled Bulgarian border region. A contemporary Byzantine source reported that 208,000 Slavs emigrated from Bulgarian controlled areas into Byzantine territory and were settled in Anatolia.<ref>Bury, p. 10</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 168</ref><ref>Fine, pp. 76\u201377</ref>\n\nA year later he sailed to [[Pomorie|Anchialus]] with 800 ships carrying 9,600 cavalry and some infantry, gaining a [[Battle of Anchialus (763)|victory]] over Khan [[Telets of Bulgaria|Telets]]. Many Bulgar nobles were captured in the battle, and were later slaughtered outside the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]] of Constantinople by the circus factions. Telets was assassinated in the aftermath of his defeat. In 765 the Byzantines again successfully invaded Bulgaria, during this campaign both Constantine's candidate for the Bulgarian throne, [[Toktu of Bulgaria|Toktu]], and his opponent, [[Pagan of Bulgaria|Pagan]], were killed. Pagan was killed by his own slaves when he sought to evade his Bulgarian enemies by fleeing to [[Varna]], where he wished to defect to the emperor. The cumulative effect of Constantine's repeated offensive campaigns and numerous victories caused considerable instability in Bulgaria, where six monarchs lost their crowns due to their failures in war against Byzantium.<ref>Bury, p. 11</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 363</ref><ref>Curta, pp. 85\u201388</ref>\n\nIn 775, the Bulgarian ruler [[Telerig of Bulgaria|Telerig]] contacted Constantine to ask for sanctuary, saying that he feared that he would have to flee Bulgaria. Telerig enquired as to whom he could trust within Bulgaria, and Constantine foolishly revealed the identities of his agents in the country. The named Byzantine agents were then promptly eliminated.<ref>Fine, p. 77</ref> In response, Constantine set out on a new campaign against the Bulgarians, during which he developed [[carbuncle]]s on his legs. He died during his return journey to Constantinople, on 14 September 775. Though Constantine was unable to destroy the Bulgar state, or impose a lasting peace, he restored imperial prestige in the Balkans.<ref>Bury, p. 11</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 169</ref><ref>Curta, p. 88</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:SoldiersGuardIgnatios.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers at the tomb of Constantine V, Skylitzes Chronicle]]\nConstantine V was a highly capable ruler, continuing the reforms{{snd}}fiscal, administrative and military{{snd}}of his father. He was also a successful general, not only consolidating the empire's borders, but actively campaigning beyond those borders, both east and west. At the end of his reign the empire had strong finances, a capable army that was proud of its successes and a church that appeared to be subservient to the political establishment.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 248</ref>\n\nIn concentrating on the security of the empire's core territories he tacitly abandoned some peripheral regions, notably in Italy, which were lost. However, the hostile reaction of the Roman Church and the Italian people to iconoclasm had probably doomed imperial influence in central Italy, regardless of any possible military intervention. Due to his espousal of iconoclasm Constantine was damned in the eyes of contemporary iconodule writers and subsequent generations of Orthodox historians. Typical of this demonisation are the descriptions of Constantine in the writings of [[Theophanes the Confessor]]: \"a monster athirst for blood\", \"a ferocious beast\", \"unclean and bloodstained magician taking pleasure in envoking demons\", \"a precursor of [[Antichrist]]\". However, to his army and people he was \"the victorious and prophetic Emperor\". Following a disastrous defeat of the Byzantines by the Bulgarian Khan [[Krum]] in 811 at the [[Battle of Pliska]], troops of the ''tagmata'' broke into Constantine's tomb and implored the dead emperor to lead them once more.<ref>Garland, p. 95</ref> The life and actions of Constantine, if freed from the distortion caused by the adulation of his soldiers and the demonisation of iconodule writers, show that he was an effective administrator and gifted general, but he was also autocratic, uncompromising and sometimes needlessly harsh.<ref>Bury, pp. 9\u201310 (including quotations from contemporary sources)</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 167, 175</ref><ref>Fine, p. 78</ref>\n\nAll surviving contemporary and later Byzantine histories covering the reign of Constantine were written by iconodules. As a result of this, they are open to suspicion of bias and inaccuracy, particularly when attributing motives to the Emperor, his supporters and opponents. This makes any claims of absolute certainty regarding Constantine's policies and the extent of his repression of iconodules unreliable.<ref>Treadgold (2012), entire chapter</ref><ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 157</ref> In particular, a manuscript written in north-eastern Anatolia concerning miracles attributed to [[Theodore of Amasea|St. Theodore]] is one of few probably written during or just after the reign of Constantine to survive in its original form; it contains little of the extreme invective common to later iconodule writings. In contrast, the author indicates that iconodules had to make accommodations with imperial iconoclastic policies, and even bestows on Constantine V the conventional religious acclamations: 'Guarded by God' ({{Lang|grc|\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}) and 'Christ-loving emperor' ({{Lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2}}).<ref>Zuckerman pp. 193\u2013194</ref>\n\n==Family==\nBy his first wife, [[Tzitzak]] (\"Irene of Khazaria\"), Constantine V had one son:<ref>Dagron, p. 32 (for the wives and sons)</ref>\n* [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]], who succeeded as emperor.\n\nBy his second wife, [[Maria, wife of Constantine V|Maria]], Constantine V is not known to have had children.\n\nBy his third wife, [[Eudokia, wife of Constantine V|Eudokia]], Constantine V had five sons and a daughter:\n* Christopher, [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] (title)\n* [[Nikephoros (Caesar)|Nikephoros]], Caesar\n* Niketas, [[Nobelissimos]] (title)\n* Eudokimos, Nobelissimos\n* Anthimos, Nobelissimos\n* Anthousa (a nun and iconodule, she was later venerated as Saint Anthousa the Younger)<ref>Constas, pp. 21\u201324</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Byzantine Empire}}\n* [[List of Byzantine emperors]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Angold, M.

His reign saw a consolidation of Byzantine security from external threats. As an able military leader, Constantine took advantage of [[Third Fitna|civil war]] in the Muslim world to make limited offensives on the [[Al-'Awasim|Arab frontier]]. With this eastern frontier secure, he undertook repeated campaigns against the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in the [[Balkans]]. His military activity, and policy of settling Christian populations from the Arab frontier in [[Thrace]], made Byzantium's hold on its Balkan territories more secure. Religious strife and controversy was a prominent feature of his reign. His fervent support of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] and opposition to [[Christian monasticism|monasticism]] led to his vilification by later Byzantine historians and writers, who denigrated him as ''Kopronymos'' or ''Copronymus'' (\u039a\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), meaning ''the dung-named''.\n\n==Early life==\nConstantine was born in [[Constantinople]], the son and successor of Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and his wife [[Maria, wife of Leo III|Maria]]. In August 720, at two years of age, he was associated with his father on the throne, and appointed co-emperor. In Byzantine political theory more than one emperor could share the throne; however, although all were accorded the same ceremonial status, only one emperor wielded ultimate power. As the position of emperor was in theory, and sometimes in practise, elective rather than strictly hereditary, a ruling emperor would often associate a son or other chosen successor with himself as a co-emperor to ensure the eventual succession.<ref>Nicol, p. 72</ref> To celebrate the coronation of his son, Leo III introduced a new silver coin, the ''[[miliaresion]]''; worth a 12th of a gold ''[[Solidus (coin)|nomisma]]'', it soon became an integral part of the Byzantine economy. In 726, Constantine's father issued the ''[[Ecloga]]''; a revised [[legal code]], it was attributed to both father and son jointly. Constantine married [[Tzitzak]], daughter of the [[Khazars|Khazar]] khagan [[Bihar (Khazar)|Bihar]], an important Byzantine ally. His new bride was baptized Irene (''Eir\u0113n\u0113'', \"peace\") in 732. On his father's death, Constantine succeeded as sole emperor on 18 June 741.<ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 165</ref><ref>Finlay, p. 43</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 349</ref><ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 76</ref> \n\nConstantine suffered from a chronic medical condition, possibly [[epilepsy]] or [[leprosy]]; early in his reign this may have been employed by those rebelling against him to question his fitness to be emperor.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 157</ref>\n\n==Rebellion of Artabasdos==\nIn June 742, while Constantine was crossing [[Asia Minor]] to campaign on the eastern frontier against the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] under [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]], his brother-in-law [[Artabasdos]], husband of his older sister, [[Anna, wife of Artabasdos|Anna]], rebelled. Artabasdos was the [[strategos|strat\u0113gos]] (military governor) of the [[Opsikion]] [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] (province) and had effective control of the [[Armeniac Theme|Armeniac theme]]. Artabasdos struck against Constantine when their respective troops combined for the intended campaign; a trusted member of Constantine's retinue, called Beser, was killed in the attack. Constantine escaped and sought refuge in [[Amorium|Amorion]], where he was welcomed by the local soldiers, who had been commanded by Leo III before he became emperor.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, pp. 157\u2013158</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 156\u2013157</ref> Meanwhile, Artabasdos advanced on Constantinople and, with the support of Theophanes Monutes (Constantine's regent) and [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Anastasius of Constantinople|Anastasius]], was acclaimed and crowned emperor. Constantine received the support of the [[Anatolic Theme|Anatolic]] and [[Thracesian Theme|Thracesian]] themes; Artabasdos secured the support of the theme of [[Thrace (theme)|Thrace]] in addition to his own Opsikion and Armeniac soldiers.<ref>Bury, p. 10</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, pp. 165\u2013166</ref>\n\nThe rival emperors bided their time making military preparations. Artabasdos marched against Constantine at [[Sardis]] in May 743 but was defeated. Three months later Constantine defeated Artabasdos' son [[Niketas (son of Artabasdos)|Niketas]] and his Armeniac troops at [[Mudurnu|Modrina]] and headed for Constantinople. In early November Constantine entered the capital, following a siege and a further battle.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 159</ref>. He immediately targeted his opponents, having many [[Political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] or executed. Patriarch Anastasius was paraded on the back of an ass around the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|hippodrome]] to the jeers of the Constantinopolitan mob, though he was subsequently allowed to stay in office.<ref>Bury, p. 10</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 166</ref> Artabasdos, having fled the capital, was apprehended at  the fortress of Pouzanes in Anatolia, probably located to the south of [[Nicomedia]]. Artabasdos and his sons were then publicly blinded and secured in the [[Chora Monastery|monastery of Chora]] on the outskirts of Constantinople.<ref>Garland, p. 9</ref>\n\n==Constantine's support of iconoclasm==\n[[File:48-manasses-chronicle.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers deface or demolish an iconudule church on the orders of Constantine V (left), Manasses Chronicle, 14th-century manuscript]]\n[[File:Costantinopoli, solido di costantino v e leone iv, 751-775.jpg|thumb|right|Gold ''solidus'', Constantine V (left) and his son and co-emperor Leo IV (right)]]\n{{Further|Byzantine iconoclasm}}\nLike his father Leo III, Constantine supported [[iconoclasm]], which was a theological movement that rejected the veneration of religious images and sought to destroy those in existence. Iconoclasm was later definitively classed as [[heresy|heretical]]. Constantine's avowed enemies in what was a bitter and long-lived religious dispute were the [[iconodules]], who defended the veneration of images. Iconodule writers applied to Constantine the derogatory epithet ''Kopronymos'' (\"dung-named\", from ''kopros'', meaning \"[[faeces]]\" or \"animal dung\", and ''onoma'', \"name\"). Using this obscene name, they spread the rumour that as an infant he had defiled his own baptism by defaecating in the font, or on the imperial purple cloth with which he was swaddled.<ref>Bury, p. 9</ref>\n\nConstantine questioned the legitimacy of any representation of God or Christ. The [[church father]] [[John Damascene]] made use of the term 'uncircumscribable' in relation to the depiction of God. Constantine, relying on the linguistic connection between 'uncircumscribed' and 'incapable of being depicted', argued that the uncircumscribable cannot be legitimately depicted in an image. As Christian theology holds that [[Homoousion|Christ is God]], He also cannot be represented in an image.<ref>Barnard, p. 13</ref> The Emperor was personally active in the theological debate; evidence exists for him composing thirteen treatises, two of which survive in fragmentary form.<ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 171</ref> He also presented his religious views at meetings organised throughout the empire, sending representatives to argue his case.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 182</ref> In February 754, Constantine convened a [[Council of Hieria|synod at Hieria]], which was attended entirely by iconoclast bishops. The council agreed with Constantine's religious policy on images, declaring them [[anathema]], and it secured the election of a new iconoclast patriarch. However, it refused to endorse all of Constantine's policies, which were influenced by the more extremist iconoclasts and were critical of the veneration of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] and of the [[saint]]s. The council confirmed the status of Mary as ''[[Theotokos]]'' ({{Lang|grc|\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2}}), or 'Mother of God', upheld the use of the terms \"saint\" and \"holy\" as legitimate, and condemned the desecration, burning, or looting of churches in the quest to suppress icon veneration.<ref>Ostrogorsky, pp. 171\u2013173</ref><ref>Pelikan, pp. 111\u2013112</ref><ref>Loos, p. 32</ref>\n\nThe synod was followed by a campaign to remove images from the walls of churches and to purge the court and bureaucracy of iconodules. Since monasteries tended to be strongholds of iconophile sentiment and contributed little or nothing towards the secular needs of the state, Constantine specifically targeted these communities of monks. He also expropriated monastic property for the benefit of the state or the army. These acts of repression against the monks were largely led by the Emperor's general [[Michael Lachanodrakon]], who threatened resistant monks with blinding and exile. In the hippodrome he organised the pairing of numerous monks and nuns in forced marriage, publicly ridiculing their vows of chastity.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 156</ref> An iconodule abbot, [[Stephen the Younger|Stephen Neos]], was beaten to death by a mob at the behest of the authorities. As a result of persecution, many monks fled to southern Italy and [[Sicily]].<ref>Ostrogorsky, pp. 173\u2013175</ref> The implacable resistance of iconodule monks and their supporters led to their propaganda reaching those close to the Emperor. On becoming aware of an iconodule influenced conspiracy directed at himself, Constantine reacted uncompromisingly; in 765, eighteen high dignitaries were paraded in the hippodrome charged with treason, they were variously executed, blinded or exiled. The patriarch [[Constantine II of Constantinople|Constantine]] was implicated and deposed from office, the following year he was tortured and then beheaded.<ref>Bury, p. 14</ref>\n\nBy the end of Constantine's reign, iconoclasm had gone as far as to brand [[relic]]s and prayers to the saints as heretical, or at least highly questionable. However, the extent of coherent official campaigns to forcibly destroy or cover up religious images or the existence of widespread government-sanctioned destruction of relics has been questioned by more recent scholarship. There is no evidence, for example, that Constantine formally banned the cult of saints. Pre-iconoclastic religious images did survive, and various existing accounts record that icons were preserved by being hidden. In general, the culture of pictorial religious representation appears to have survived the iconoclast period largely intact. The extent and severity of iconoclastic destruction of images and relics was exaggerated in later iconodule writings.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, pp. 208\u2013211</ref><ref>Zuckerman pp. 203\u2013204</ref>\n\nIconodules considered Constantine's death a divine punishment. In the 9th century, following the ultimate triumph of the iconodules, Constantine's remains were removed from the imperial sepulchre in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].<ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 175</ref>\n\n==Domestic policies and administration==\n[[File:Asia Minor ca 780 AD.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of the themes of Byzantine Asia Minor and the Arab\u2013Byzantine frontier zone in the late 8th century, following the provincial reforms of Constantine V (the border of imperial Thrace does not reflect that [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] was a Byzantine city)]]\nAssiduous in courting popularity, Constantine consciously employed the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|hippodrome]], scene of the ever-popular [[chariot races]], to influence the populace of Constantinople. In this he made use of the 'circus factions', which controlled the competing teams of charioteers and their supporters, had widespread social influence, and could mobilise large numbers of the citizenry. The hippodrome became the setting of rituals of humiliation for war captives and political enemies, in which the mob took delight. Constantine's sources of support were the people and the army, and he used them against his iconodule opponents in the monasteries and in the bureaucracy of the capital. Iconoclasm was not purely an imperial religious conviction, it also had considerable popular support: some of Constantine's actions against the iconodules may have been motivated by a desire to retain the approval of the people and the army. The monasteries were exempt from taxation and monks from service in the army; the Emperor's antipathy towards them may have derived to a greater extent from secular, fiscal and manpower, considerations than from a reaction to their theology.<ref>Angold, Ch. 5, 'Constantine V', paragraph 7</ref><ref>Magdalino (2015), pp. 177\u2013178</ref><ref>Rochow, pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nConstantine carried forward the administrative and fiscal reforms initiated by his father Leo III. The military governors ({{Lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03af}}'', strategoi'') were powerful figures, whose access to the resources of their extensive provinces often provided the means of rebellion. The Opsikion theme had been the power-base that enabled the rebellion of Artabasdos, and was also the theme situated nearest to the capital within [[Asia Minor]]. Constantine reduced the size of this theme, dividing from it the [[Bucellarian Theme|Bucellarian]] and, perhaps, the [[Optimatoi|Optimaton]] themes. In those provinces closest to the seat of government this measure increased the number of ''strategoi'' and diminished the resources available to any single one, making rebellion less easy to accomplish.<ref>Bury, p. 3</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997),  p. 358</ref>\n\nConstantine was responsible for the creation of a small central army of fully professional soldiers, the imperial [[tagma (military)|''tagmata'']] (literally: 'the regiments'). He achieved this by training for serious warfare a corps of largely ceremonial guards units that were attached to the imperial palace, and expanding their numbers. This force was designed to form the core of field armies and was composed of better-drilled, better-paid, and better-equipped soldiers than were found in the provincial ''[[themata]]'' units, whose troops were part-time soldier-farmers. Before their expansion, the vestigial [[Scholae]] and the other guards units presumably contained few useful soldiers, therefore Constantine must have incorporated former thematic soldiers into his new formation.<ref>Treadgold (1995), pp. 71\u201372</ref> Being largely based at or near the capital, the ''tagmata'' were under the immediate control of the Emperor and were free of the regional loyalties that had been behind so many military rebellions.<ref>Haldon, p. 78</ref><ref>Magdalino (2015), p. 177</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 358\u2013359</ref>\n[[File:Hagia Irene, built in the 4th century at the place where the old church of the bishop of Byzantium stood before the refoundation of Constantine the Great, destroyed by fire in 532 AD and then rebuilt, Istanbul (40654254081).jpg|thumb|right|A mosaic cross in the apse of the [[Hagia Irene]] church in Istanbul. It is one of the few artistic remains of iconoclasm. Created during the reign of Constantine it occupies the semi-dome of the apse usually reserved for a devotional image, often a depiction of [[Christ Pantocrator]] or the [[Theotokos]]]]\nThe fiscal administration of Constantine was highly competent. This drew from his enemies accusations of being a merciless and rapacious extractor of taxes and an oppressor of the rural population. However, the empire was prosperous and Constantine left a very well-stocked treasury for his successor. The area of cultivated land within the Empire was extended and food became cheaper; between 718 and c. 800 the corn (wheat) production of Thrace trebled. Constantine's court was opulent, with splendid buildings, and he consciously promoted the patronage of secular art to replace the religious art that he removed.<ref>Bury, p. 11</ref><ref>Jenkins, p. 72</ref>\n\nConstantine constructed a number of notable buildings in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]], including the [[Church of the Virgin of the Pharos]] and the ''porphyra''. The ''porphyra'' was a chamber lined with [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], a stone of imperial purple colour. In it expectant empresses underwent the final stages of labour and it was the birthplace of the children of reigning emperors. Constantine's son Leo was the first child born here, and thereby obtained the title ''porphyrog\u00e9nn\u0113tos'' ([[born in the purple]]) the ultimate accolade of legitimacy for an imperial prince or princess. The concept of a 'purple birth' predated the construction of the chamber, but it gained a literal aspect from the chamber's existence.<ref>Herrin, p. 185</ref> The porphyry was reputed to have come from [[Rome]] and represented a direct link to the ancient origins of Byzantine imperial authority.<ref>Magdalino (1993), p. 424</ref> Constantine also rebuilt the prominent church of [[Hagia Eirene]] in Constantinople, which had been badly damaged by the [[740 Constantinople earthquake|earthquake that hit Constantinople in 740]]. The building preserves rare examples of iconoclastic church decoration.<ref>Freely and Cakmak, pp. 136\u2013143</ref>\n\nWith the impetus of having fathered numerous offspring, Constantine codified the court titles given to members of the imperial family. He associated only his eldest son, [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo]], with the throne as co-emperor, but gave his younger sons the titles of [[caesar (title)|caesar]] for the more senior in age and [[nobelissimos]] for the more junior.<ref>Jeffreys, Haldon and Cormack, p. 505</ref>\n\n==Campaigns against the Arabs==\n{{Further|Byzantine\u2013Arab wars (780\u20131180)|Arab\u2013Byzantine wars#Stabilization of the frontier, 718\u2013863}}\nIn 746, profiting by the [[Third Fitna|unstable conditions]] in the Umayyad Caliphate, which was falling apart under [[Marwan II]], Constantine invaded Syria and captured Germanikeia (modern [[Kahramanmara\u015f|Marash]], his father's birthplace), and he recaptured the island of [[Cyprus]]. He organised the resettlement of part of the local Christian population to imperial territory in [[Thrace]], strengthening the empire's control of this region. In 747 his fleet destroyed the Arab fleet off Cyprus. The same year saw a serious outbreak of plague in Constantinople, which caused a pause in Byzantine military operations. Constantine retired to [[Bithynia]] to avoid the disease and, after it had run its course, resettled people from mainland Greece and the Aegean islands in Constantinople to replace those who had perished.<ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 359\u2013360</ref>\n\nIn 751 he led an invasion into the new [[Abbasid Caliphate]] under [[As-Saffah]]. Constantine captured Theodosiopolis ([[Erzurum]]) and Melitene ([[Malatya]]), which he demolished, and again resettled some of the population in the [[Balkans]]. The eastern campaigns failed to secure concrete territorial gains, as there was no serious attempt to retain control of the captured cities, except [[Camachus|Camachum]] (modern [[Kemah, Erzincan]]), which was garrisoned. However, under Constantine the Empire had gone on the offensive against the Arabs after over a century of largely defensive warfare. Constantine's major goal in his eastern campaigns seems to have been to forcibly gather up local Christian populations from beyond his borders in order to resettle Thrace. Additionally, the deliberate depopulation of the region beyond the eastern borders created a no-man's land where the concentration and provisioning of Arab armies was made more difficult. This in turn increased the security of Byzantine Anatolia. His military reputation was such that, in 757, the mere rumour of his presence caused an Arab army to retreat. In the same year he agreed a truce and an exchange of prisoners with the Arabs, freeing his army for offensive campaigning in the Balkans.<ref>Bury, p. 10</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 167</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 360, 362</ref><ref>Bonner, p. 107</ref>\n\n==Events in Italy==\nWith Constantine militarily occupied elsewhere, and the continuance of imperial influence in the West being given a low priority, the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Aistulf]] captured [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Ravenna]] in 755, ending over two centuries of Byzantine rule in central Italy.<ref>Moffat, p. 55</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, pp. 169\u2013170</ref> The lack of interest Constantine showed in Italian affairs had profound and lasting consequences. [[Pope Stephen II]], seeking protection from the aggression of the Lombards, appealed in person to the [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Pepin the Short]]. Pepin cowed Aistulf and restored Stephen to Rome at the head of an army. This began the Frankish involvement in Italy that eventually established Pepin's son [[Charlemagne]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor in the West]], and also instigated papal temporal rule in Italy with the creation of the [[Papal States]].<ref>Jenkins, p. 71</ref>\n\nConstantine sent a number of unsuccessful embassies to the Lombards, Franks and the papacy to demand the restoration of Ravenna, but never attempted a military reconquest or intervention.<ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 360</ref>\n\n==Repeated campaigns against the Bulgarians==\n[[Image:Byzantine\u2013Bulgarian Wars (741-775).png|170px|thumb|right|Byzantine and Bulgarian campaigns during the reign of Constantine (741\u2013775)]]\nThe successes in the east made it possible to then pursue an aggressive policy in the Balkans. Constantine aimed to enhance the prosperity and defence of Thrace by the resettlement there of Christian populations transplanted from the east. This influx of settlers, allied to an active re-fortification of the border, caused concern to the Empire's northern neighbour, [[Bulgaria]], leading the two states to clash in 755. [[Kormisosh]] of Bulgaria raided as far as the [[Anastasian Wall]] (the outermost defence of the approaches to Constantinople) but was defeated in battle by Constantine, who inaugurated a series of nine successful campaigns against the Bulgarians in the next year, scoring a victory over Kormisosh's successor [[Vinekh]] at [[battle of Marcellae (756)|Marcellae]]. In 759, Constantine was defeated in the [[Battle of the Rishki Pass]], but the Bulgarians did not exploit their success.<ref>Bury, p. 11</ref><ref>Jenkins, pp. 71\u201372</ref>\n\nConstantine campaigned against the Slav tribes of Thrace and Macedonia in 762, deporting some tribes to the Opsician theme in Anatolia, though some voluntarily requested relocation away from the troubled Bulgarian border region. A contemporary Byzantine source reported that 208,000 Slavs emigrated from Bulgarian controlled areas into Byzantine territory and were settled in Anatolia.<ref>Bury, p. 10</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 168</ref><ref>Fine, pp. 76\u201377</ref>\n\nA year later he sailed to [[Pomorie|Anchialus]] with 800 ships carrying 9,600 cavalry and some infantry, gaining a [[Battle of Anchialus (763)|victory]] over Khan [[Telets of Bulgaria|Telets]]. Many Bulgar nobles were captured in the battle, and were later slaughtered outside the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]] of Constantinople by the circus factions. Telets was assassinated in the aftermath of his defeat. In 765 the Byzantines again successfully invaded Bulgaria, during this campaign both Constantine's candidate for the Bulgarian throne, [[Toktu of Bulgaria|Toktu]], and his opponent, [[Pagan of Bulgaria|Pagan]], were killed. Pagan was killed by his own slaves when he sought to evade his Bulgarian enemies by fleeing to [[Varna]], where he wished to defect to the emperor. The cumulative effect of Constantine's repeated offensive campaigns and numerous victories caused considerable instability in Bulgaria, where six monarchs lost their crowns due to their failures in war against Byzantium.<ref>Bury, p. 11</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 363</ref><ref>Curta, pp. 85\u201388</ref>\n\nIn 775, the Bulgarian ruler [[Telerig of Bulgaria|Telerig]] contacted Constantine to ask for sanctuary, saying that he feared that he would have to flee Bulgaria. Telerig enquired as to whom he could trust within Bulgaria, and Constantine foolishly revealed the identities of his agents in the country. The named Byzantine agents were then promptly eliminated.<ref>Fine, p. 77</ref> In response, Constantine set out on a new campaign against the Bulgarians, during which he developed [[carbuncle]]s on his legs. He died during his return journey to Constantinople, on 14 September 775. Though Constantine was unable to destroy the Bulgar state, or impose a lasting peace, he restored imperial prestige in the Balkans.<ref>Bury, p. 11</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 169</ref><ref>Curta, p. 88</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:SoldiersGuardIgnatios.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers at the tomb of Constantine V, Skylitzes Chronicle]]\nConstantine V was a highly capable ruler, continuing the reforms{{snd}}fiscal, administrative and military{{snd}}of his father. He was also a successful general, not only consolidating the empire's borders, but actively campaigning beyond those borders, both east and west. At the end of his reign the empire had strong finances, a capable army that was proud of its successes and a church that appeared to be subservient to the political establishment.<ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 248</ref>\n\nIn concentrating on the security of the empire's core territories he tacitly abandoned some peripheral regions, notably in Italy, which were lost. However, the hostile reaction of the Roman Church and the Italian people to iconoclasm had probably doomed imperial influence in central Italy, regardless of any possible military intervention. Due to his espousal of iconoclasm Constantine was damned in the eyes of contemporary iconodule writers and subsequent generations of Orthodox historians. Typical of this demonisation are the descriptions of Constantine in the writings of [[Theophanes the Confessor]]: \"a monster athirst for blood\", \"a ferocious beast\", \"unclean and bloodstained magician taking pleasure in envoking demons\", \"a precursor of [[Antichrist]]\". However, to his army and people he was \"the victorious and prophetic Emperor\". Following a disastrous defeat of the Byzantines by the Bulgarian Khan [[Krum]] in 811 at the [[Battle of Pliska]], troops of the ''tagmata'' broke into Constantine's tomb and implored the dead emperor to lead them once more.<ref>Garland, p. 95</ref> The life and actions of Constantine, if freed from the distortion caused by the adulation of his soldiers and the demonisation of iconodule writers, show that he was an effective administrator and gifted general, but he was also autocratic, uncompromising and sometimes needlessly harsh.<ref>Bury, pp. 9\u201310 (including quotations from contemporary sources)</ref><ref>Ostrogorsky, p. 167, 175</ref><ref>Fine, p. 78</ref>\n\nAll surviving contemporary and later Byzantine histories covering the reign of Constantine were written by iconodules. As a result of this, they are open to suspicion of bias and inaccuracy, particularly when attributing motives to the Emperor, his supporters and opponents. This makes any claims of absolute certainty regarding Constantine's policies and the extent of his repression of iconodules unreliable.<ref>Treadgold (2012), entire chapter</ref><ref>Brubaker and Haldon, p. 157</ref> In particular, a manuscript written in north-eastern Anatolia concerning miracles attributed to [[Theodore of Amasea|St. Theodore]] is one of few probably written during or just after the reign of Constantine to survive in its original form; it contains little of the extreme invective common to later iconodule writings. In contrast, the author indicates that iconodules had to make accommodations with imperial iconoclastic policies, and even bestows on Constantine V the conventional religious acclamations: 'Guarded by God' ({{Lang|grc|\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}) and 'Christ-loving emperor' ({{Lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2}}).<ref>Zuckerman pp. 193\u2013194</ref>\n\n==Family==\nBy his first wife, [[Tzitzak]] (\"Irene of Khazaria\"), Constantine V had one son:<ref>Dagron, p. 32 (for the wives and sons)</ref>\n* [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]], who succeeded as emperor.\n\nBy his second wife, [[Maria, wife of Constantine V|Maria]], Constantine V is not known to have had children.\n\nBy his third wife, [[Eudokia, wife of Constantine V|Eudokia]], Constantine V had five sons and a daughter:\n* Christopher, [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] (title)\n* [[Nikephoros (Caesar)|Nikephoros]], Caesar\n* Niketas, [[Nobelissimos]] (title)\n* Eudokimos, Nobelissimos\n* Anthimos, Nobelissimos\n* Anthousa (a nun and iconodule, she was later venerated as Saint Anthousa the Younger)<ref>Constas, pp. 21\u201324</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Byzantine Empire}}\n* [[List of Byzantine emperors]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Angold, M.

These [[Australia]]n [[wildflower]]s and popular [[Ornamental plant|garden plant]]s are easily recognised by their characteristic flower spikes and fruiting \"cones\" and heads. ''Banksias'' range in size from prostrate woody [[shrub]]s to trees up to 30 metres tall. They are found in a wide variety of landscapes; [[sclerophyll]] forest, (occasionally) rainforest, shrubland, and some more arid landscapes, though not in Australia's deserts.\n\nHeavy producers of [[nectar (plant)|nectar]], ''banksias'' are a vital part of the food chain in the Australian bush. They are an important food source for all sorts of nectarivorous animals, including birds, bats, rats, possums, stingless bees and a host of invertebrates. Furthermore, they are of economic importance to Australia's [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] and [[floristry|cut flower]] industries. However these plants are threatened by a number of processes including [[Land clearing in Australia|land clearing]], frequent burning and disease, and a number of species are [[rare species|rare]] and [[endangered species|endangered]].\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Banksia spinulosa 1.jpg|left|thumb|Young ''Banksia'' inflorescence showing flower buds developing in pairs]]\n''Banksias'' grow as [[tree]]s or woody [[shrubs]].  Trees of the largest species, ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B.&nbsp;integrifolia]]'' (coast banksia) and ''[[Banksia seminuda|B.&nbsp;seminuda]]'' (river banksia), often grow over 15 metres tall, some even grow to standing 30 metres tall.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Liber C | year = 2004 | title = Really Big Banksias | journal = Banksia Study Group Newsletter| volume = 6 | pages = 4\u20135}}</ref> ''Banksia'' species that grow as shrubs are usually erect, but there are several species that are prostrate, with branches that grow on or below the soil.\n\nThe leaves of ''Banksia'' vary greatly between species.  Sizes vary from the narrow, 1\u20131\u00bd centimetre long needle-like leaves of ''[[Banksia ericifolia|B.&nbsp;ericifolia]]'' (heath-leaved banksia), to the very large leaves of ''[[Banksia grandis|B.&nbsp;grandis]]'' (bull banksia), which may be up to 45 centimetres long.  The leaves of most species have serrated edges, but a few, such as ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'', do not.  Leaves are usually arranged along the branches in irregular spirals, but in some species they are crowded together in [[Whorl (botany)|whorls]]. Many species have differing juvenile and adult leaves (e.g., ''Banksia integrifolia'' has large serrated juvenile leaves).\n\nThe flowers are arranged in flower spikes or capitate flower heads.{{sfn|George|1999|p=175}} The character most commonly associated with ''Banksia'' is the flower spike, an elongated [[inflorescence]] consisting of a woody axis covered in tightly-packed pairs of flowers attached at right angles. A single flower spike generally contains hundreds or even thousands of flowers; the most recorded is around 6000 on inflorescences of ''[[Banksia grandis|B.&nbsp;grandis]]''. Not all ''Banksia'' have an elongate flower spike, however: the members of the small ''[[Banksia subg. Isostylis|Isostylis]]'' complex have long been recognised as ''Banksia''s in which the flower spike has been reduced to a head; and recently the large genus ''Dryandra'' has been found to have arisen from within the ranks of ''Banksia'', and sunk into it as [[Banksia ser. Dryandra|''B.''&nbsp;ser. ''Dryandra'']]. They similarly have capitate flower heads rather than spikes.\n\n[[File:Banksia marginata immature and mature.jpg|thumb|''[[Banksia marginata|B.&nbsp;marginata]]'' flower spike before and after [[anthesis]]]]\n''Banksia'' flowers are usually a shade of [[yellow]], but [[Orange (colour)|orange]], [[red]], [[pink]] and even [[violet (color)|violet]] flowers also occur.  The colour of the flowers is determined by the colour of the [[perianth]] parts and often the [[carpel|style]].  The style is much longer than the perianth, and is initially trapped by the upper perianth parts.  These are gradually released over a period of days, either from top to bottom or from bottom to top.  When the styles and perianth parts are different colours, the visual effect is of a colour change sweeping along the spike. This can be most spectacular in ''[[Banksia prionotes|B.&nbsp;prionotes]]'' (acorn banksia) and related species, as the white inflorescence in bud becomes a brilliant orange. In most cases, the individual flowers are tall, thin saccate (sack-shaped) in shape.\n\n[[File:Banksia Marginata Seed.jpg|thumb|left|[[Seed separator]] of a silver banksia (''[[Banksia marginata]]'') with winged seeds still cohering]]\nOccasionally, multiple flower spikes can form. This is most often seen in ''[[Banksia marginata]]'' and ''[[Banksia ericifolia|B. ericifolia]]''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=S |year=1992 |title=Multiple Flower Heads |journal=Banksia Study Report |volume=9 |page=58}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Blake |first=T |year=1988 |title=Multiple Heads |journal=Banksia Study Report |volume=8 |page=2}}</ref> ''(pictured right)''.\n\n[[File:Banksia integrifolia and marginata cones.jpg|thumb|Infructescence of ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B.&nbsp;integrifolia]]'', with non-persistent flowers; and ''[[Banksia marginata|B.&nbsp;marginata]]'', with persistent flowers]]\nAs the flower spikes or heads age, the flower parts dry up and may turn shades of orange, tan or dark brown colour, before fading to grey over a period of years.  In some species, old flower parts are lost, revealing the axis; in others, the old flower parts may persist for many years, giving the fruiting structure a hairy appearance.  Old flower spikes are commonly referred to as \"cones\", although they are not technically cones according to the botanical definition of the term: [[Conifer cone|cones]] only occur in [[conifer]]s and [[cycad]]s.\n\nDespite the large number of flowers per inflorescence, only a few of them ever develop fruit, and in some species a flower spike will set no fruit at all.  The fruit of ''Banksia'' is a woody [[Follicle (fruit)|follicle]] embedded in the axis of the inflorescence.  In many species, the resulting structure is a massive woody structure commonly called a cone.  Each follicle consists of two horizontal valves that tightly enclose the seeds.  The follicle opens to release the seed by splitting along the suture, and in some species each valve splits too.  In some species the follicles open as soon as the seed is mature, but in most species most follicles open only after stimulated to do so by [[bushfire]].  Each follicle usually contains one or two small seeds, each with a wedge-shaped papery wing that causes it to spin as it falls to the ground.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{main|Taxonomy of Banksia}}\nSpecimens of ''Banksia'' were first collected by [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander|Dr Daniel Solander]], naturalists on the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' during Lieutenant (later Captain) [[James Cook]]'s first voyage to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Cook landed on Australian soil for the first time on 29 April 1770, at a place that he later named [[Botany Bay]] in recognition of \"the great quantity of plants Mr Banks and Dr Solander found in this place\".<ref name=\"Wharton 1893\">{{cite book | author = Cook, James | year = 1893 | editor = William J.

Four species were present in this first collection: ''[[Banksia serrata|B.&nbsp;serrata]]'' (Saw Banksia), ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B.&nbsp;integrifolia]]'' (Coast Banksia), ''[[Banksia ericifolia|B.&nbsp;ericifolia]]'' (Heath-leaved Banksia) and ''[[Banksia robur|B.&nbsp;robur]]'' (Swamp Banksia). In June the ship was [[careening|careened]] at [[Endeavour River]], where specimens of ''[[Banksia dentata|B.&nbsp;dentata]]'' (Tropical Banksia) were collected.{{sfn|Wrigley|Fagg|1991|p=80}}\n\nThe genus ''Banksia'' was finally described and named by [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]] in his April 1782 publication ''[[Supplementum Plantarum]]''; hence the [[Binomial nomenclature#Authorship in scientific names|full name]] for the genus is \"''Banksia'' L.f.\".

The name ''Banksia'' had in fact already been published in 1775 as ''Banksia'' [[Johann Reinhold Forster|J.R.Forst]] & [[Georg Forster|G.Forst]], referring to some [[New Zealand]] species that the Forsters had collected during Cook's second voyage. However Linnaeus incorrectly attributed the Forsters' specimens to the genus ''[[Passerina (plant)|Passerina]]'', and therefore considered the name ''Banksia'' available for use. By the time [[Joseph Gaertner]] corrected Banks' error in 1788, ''Banksia'' L.f. was widely known and accepted, so Gaertner [[nomen novum|renamed]] ''Banksia'' J.R.Forst & G.Forst to ''[[Pimelea]]'', a name previously chosen for the genus by Banks and Solander.<ref name=\"Salkin 1981\">{{cite journal | author = Salkin, Abraham Isaac (Alf) | year = 1981 | title = A Short History of the Discovery and Naming of Banksias in Eastern Australia: Part I, Banks & Solander | journal = Victorian Naturalist | volume = 98 | issue = 2}}</ref>\n\nThe first specimens of a ''Dryandra'' were collected by [[Archibald Menzies]], surgeon and naturalist to the [[Vancouver Expedition]]. At the request of [[Joseph Banks]], Menzies collected natural history specimens wherever possible during the voyage. During September and October 1791, while the expedition were anchored at [[King George Sound]], he collected numerous plant specimens, including the first specimens of ''[[Banksia sessilis|Dryandra&nbsp;(''now'' Banksia)&nbsp;sessilis]]'' (Parrotbush) and ''[[Banksia pellaeifolia|D.&nbsp;(''now'' Banksia)&nbsp;pellaeifolia]]''.

The exception is ''[[Banksia dentata|B.&nbsp;dentata]]'' (tropical banksia), which occurs throughout northern Australia, and on islands to the north including [[New Guinea]] and the [[Aru Islands Regency|Aru Islands]]. An extinct species, ''[[Banksia novae-zelandiae|B.&nbsp;novae-zelandiae]]'', was found in [[New Zealand]]. The other species occur in two distinct geographical regions: [[Southwest Australia|southwest]] [[Western Australia]] and eastern Australia.  Southwest Western Australia is the main centre of [[biodiversity]]; over 90% of all ''Banksia'' species occur only there, from [[Exmouth, Western Australia|Exmouth]] in the north, south and east to beyond [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]] on the south coast.  Eastern Australia has far fewer species, but these include some of best known and most widely distributed species, including ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B.&nbsp;integrifolia]]'' (coast banksia) and ''[[Banksia spinulosa|B.&nbsp;spinulosa]]'' (hairpin banksia). Here they occur from the [[Eyre Peninsula]] in South Australia right around the east coast up to [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in [[Queensland]].\n\nThe vast majority of ''Banksia'' are found in sandy or gravelly soils, though some populations of ''[[Banksia marginata|B.&nbsp;marginata]]'' (silver banksia) and ''B.&nbsp;spinulosa'' do occur on heavier, more clay-like, soils.  ''B.&nbsp;seminuda'' is exceptional for its preference for rich loams along watercourses.\n\nMost occur in [[Heath (habitat)|heathlands]] or low [[woodland]]s; of the eastern species, ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' and ''B.&nbsp;marginata'' occur in forests; many south-western species such as ''[[Banksia grandis|B.&nbsp;grandis]]'', [[Banksia sphaerocarpa|''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'']], ''[[Banksia sessilis|B.&nbsp;sessilis]]'', ''[[Banksia nobilis|B.&nbsp;nobilis]]'' and ''[[Banksia dellanneyi|B.&nbsp;dallanneyi]]'' grow as understorey plants in [[jarrah]] (''Eucalyptus marginata''), wandoo (''E. wandoo'') and [[Eucalyptus diversicolor|karri]] (''E. diversicolor'') [[forest]]s, with ''B.&nbsp;seminuda'' being one of the forest trees in suitable habitat.\n\nMost species do not grow well near the [[coast]], notable exceptions being the southern [[Western Australia]]n species [[Banksia speciosa|''B.&nbsp;speciosa'']], [[Banksia praemorsa|''B.&nbsp;praemorsa'']] and [[Banksia repens|''B.&nbsp;repens'']].  Only a few species, such as [[Banksia rosserae|''B.&nbsp;rosserae'']] and ''[[Banksia elderiana|B.&nbsp;elderiana]]'' (swordfish banksia), occur in [[desert|arid]] areas.  Most of the eastern Australian species survive in [[upland (geology)|uplands]], but only a few of the [[Western Australia]]n species native to the [[Stirling Range]]s \u2013 [[Banksia solandri|''B.&nbsp;solandri'']], [[Banksia oreophila|''B.&nbsp;oreophila'']], [[Banksia brownii|''B.&nbsp;brownii'']] and [[Banksia montana|''B.&nbsp;montana'']] \u2013 survive at high altitudes.\n\nStudies of the south-western species have found the distribution of ''Banksia'' species to be primarily constrained by rainfall. With the exception of ''B.&nbsp;rosserae'', no species tolerates annual rainfall of less than 200 millimetres, despite many species surviving in areas that receive less than 400 millimetres. ''Banksia'' species are present throughout the region of suitable rainfall, with greatest speciation in cooler, wetter areas. Hotter, drier regions around the edges of its range tend to have fewer species with larger distributions.

Other associated fauna include the [[larva]]e of [[moth]]s (such as the [[Dryandra Moth]]) and [[weevil]]s, which burrow into the \"cones\" to eat the seeds and [[pupa]]te in the follicles; and [[bird]]s such as [[cockatoo]]s, who break off the \"cones\" to eat both the seeds and the [[insect]] larvae.\n\nA number of ''Banksia'' species are considered rare or endangered.  These include [[Banksia brownii|''B.&nbsp;brownii'']] (feather-leaved banksia), [[Banksia cuneata|''B.&nbsp;cuneata'']] (matchstick banksia), [[Banksia goodii|''B.&nbsp;goodii'']] (Good's banksia), [[Banksia oligantha|''B.&nbsp;oligantha'']] (Wagin banksia), [[Banksia tricuspis|''B.&nbsp;tricuspis'']] (pine banksia), and [[Banksia verticillata|''B.&nbsp;verticillata'']] (granite banksia).\n\n===Response to fire===\n[[Image:Banksia prionotes response to fire Burma Rd email.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Banksia prionotes]]'' seedlings after fire, [[Burma Road Nature Reserve]], WA]]\n[[Image:Banksiaserrataseedlings29872323593 014d92e255 o.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Banksia serrata]]'' seedlings and cone after fire, [[Beacon Hill, New South Wales|Beacon Hill]], NSW]]\n''Banksia'' plants are naturally adapted to the presence of regular [[bushfire]]s in the Australian landscape. About half of ''Banksia'' species are killed by bushfire, but these regenerate quickly from seed, as fire also stimulates the opening of seed-bearing follicles and the germination of seed in the ground.  The remaining species usually survive bushfire, either by resprouting from a woody base known as a [[lignotuber]] or, more rarely, [[Epicormic shoot|epicormic buds]] protected by thick bark. In [[Western Australia]], ''banksias'' of the first group are known as 'seeders' and the second group as 'sprouters'.<ref name=\"Lamont 1995\">{{cite journal |last1=Lamont |first1=Byron B. | authorlink1=Byron Lamont |last2=Markey |first2=Adrienne |year=1995 |title=Biogeography of Fire-killed and Resprouting ''Banksia'' Species in South-western Australia |journal=Australian Journal of Botany |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=283\u2013303 |doi=10.1071/BT9950283}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Banksia attenuata response to fire Burma Rd email.jpg|thumb|''[[Banksia attenuata]]'' resprouting after fire, Burma Road Nature Reserve, WA]]\nInfrequent bushfires at expected intervals pose no threat, and are in fact beneficial for regeneration of ''banksia'' populations. However, too frequent bushfires can seriously reduce or even eliminate populations from certain areas, by killing seedlings and young plants before they reach fruiting age.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wooller |first1=S. J. |last2=Wooller |first2=R. D. |last3=Brown |first3=K.

Furthermore, residents who live in areas near bushland may pressure local councils to burn areas near homes more frequently, to reduce fuel-load in the bush and thus reduce ferocity of future fires. Unfortunately there are often discrepancies in agreed frequency between these groups and conservation groups.\n\n===Dieback===\nAnother threat to ''Banksia'' is the [[water mould]] ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'', commonly known as \"dieback\". Dieback attacks the roots of plants, destroying the structure of the root tissues, \"rotting\" the root, and preventing the plant from absorbing water and nutrients. ''Banksia'''s [[proteoid root]]s, which help it to survive in low-nutrient soils, make it highly susceptible to this [[disease]]. All Western Australian species are vulnerable, although most eastern species are fairly resistant.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mccredie |first1=TA |last2=Dixon |first2=KW |last3=Sivasithamparam |first3=K |title=Variability in the Resistance of Banksia L.f.

In [[southwest Australia|southwest]] Western Australia, where dieback infestation is widespread, infested areas of ''Banksia'' forest typically have less than 30% of the cover of uninfested areas. Plant deaths in such large proportions can have a profound influence on the makeup of plant communities. For example, in southwestern Australia ''Banksia'' often occurs as an understorey to forests of [[Jarrah]] (''Eucalyptus marginata''), another species highly vulnerable to dieback. Infestation kills both the Jarrah overstorey and the original ''Banksia'' understorey, and over time these may be replaced by a more open woodland consisting of an overstorey of the resistant Marri (''[[Corymbia calophylla]]''), and an understorey of the somewhat resistant ''[[Banksia sessilis]]'' (Parrotbush).<ref name=\"Impact of Dieback\">{{cite web| title=Impacts in WA| work=Managing Dieback| url=http://www.naturebase.net/content/view/213/548/1/2/| publisher=[[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)]]| accessdate=2007-02-21| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903013916/http://www.naturebase.net/content/view/213/548/1/2/| archive-date=3 September 2007| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA number of species of ''Banksia'' are threatened by dieback.

Due to their size these species are popularly planted in parks, gardens and streets, the remaining species in this genus are only shrubs.\n\n''Banksia''s are popular garden plants in Australia because of their large, showy flower heads, and because the large amounts of [[nectar]] they produce attracts [[birds]] and small [[mammal]]s.  Popular garden species include ''B.&nbsp;spinulosa'', ''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'', [[Banksia aemula|''B.&nbsp;aemula'']] (Wallum Banksia ), [[Banksia serrata|''B.&nbsp;serrata'']] (Saw Banksia), ''[[Banksia media]]'' (Southern Plains Banksia) and the [[cultivar]] [[Banksia 'Giant Candles'|''Banksia'' 'Giant Candles']].  ''Banksia'' species are primarily propagated by seed in the home garden as cuttings can be difficult to strike. However commercial nurserymen extensively utilize the latter method (indeed, cultivars by nature must be vegetatively propagated by cuttings or grafting).\n\nOver time, dwarf cultivars and prostrate species are becoming more popular as urban gardens grow ever smaller. These include miniature forms under 50&nbsp;cm high of ''B.&nbsp;spinulosa'' and ''B.&nbsp;media'', as well as prostrate species such as ''[[Banksia petiolaris|B.&nbsp;petiolaris]]'' and ''[[Banksia blechnifolia|B.&nbsp;blechnifolia]]'' .\n\n''Banksia''s possibly require more maintenance than other Australian natives, though are fairly hardy if the right conditions are provided (sunny aspect and well drained sandy soil).\nThey may need extra water during dry spells until established, which can take up to two years.  If fertilised, only slow-release, low-[[phosphorus]] [[fertilizer]] should be used, as the [[proteoid roots]] may be damaged by high [[nutrient]] levels in the soil. All respond well to some form of pruning.\n\nWithin the Australian horticultural community there is an active subculture of ''Banksia'' enthusiasts who seek out interesting flower variants, breed and propagate cultivars, exchange materials and undertake research into cultivation problems and challenges. The main forum for exchange of information within this group is [[ASGAP]]'s ''Banksia Study Group''.{{sfn|Collins|Collins|2008|p=83}}\n\n===Cut flower industry===\nWith the exception of the [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] [[industry]], ''Banksia'' have limited commercial use.

The study mobilised over 400 volunteers, collecting over 25,000 field observations over a two-year period. Outcomes included the discovery of two new species, as well as new varieties and some rare colour variants, and discoveries of previously unknown populations of rare and threatened species.

These [[Australia]]n [[wildflower]]s and popular [[Ornamental plant|garden plant]]s are easily recognised by their characteristic flower spikes and fruiting \"cones\" and heads. ''Banksias'' range in size from prostrate woody [[shrub]]s to trees up to 30 metres tall. They are found in a wide variety of landscapes; [[sclerophyll]] forest, (occasionally) rainforest, shrubland, and some more arid landscapes, though not in Australia's deserts.\n\nHeavy producers of [[nectar (plant)|nectar]], ''banksias'' are a vital part of the food chain in the Australian bush. They are an important food source for all sorts of nectarivorous animals, including birds, bats, rats, possums, stingless bees and a host of invertebrates. Furthermore, they are of economic importance to Australia's [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] and [[floristry|cut flower]] industries. However these plants are threatened by a number of processes including [[Land clearing in Australia|land clearing]], frequent burning and disease, and a number of species are [[rare species|rare]] and [[endangered species|endangered]].\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Banksia spinulosa 1.jpg|left|thumb|Young ''Banksia'' inflorescence showing flower buds developing in pairs]]\n''Banksias'' grow as [[tree]]s or woody [[shrubs]].  Trees of the largest species, ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B.&nbsp;integrifolia]]'' (coast banksia) and ''[[Banksia seminuda|B.&nbsp;seminuda]]'' (river banksia), often grow over 15 metres tall, some even grow to standing 30 metres tall.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Liber C | year = 2004 | title = Really Big Banksias | journal = Banksia Study Group Newsletter| volume = 6 | pages = 4\u20135}}</ref> ''Banksia'' species that grow as shrubs are usually erect, but there are several species that are prostrate, with branches that grow on or below the soil.\n\nThe leaves of ''Banksia'' vary greatly between species.  Sizes vary from the narrow, 1\u20131\u00bd centimetre long needle-like leaves of ''[[Banksia ericifolia|B.&nbsp;ericifolia]]'' (heath-leaved banksia), to the very large leaves of ''[[Banksia grandis|B.&nbsp;grandis]]'' (bull banksia), which may be up to 45 centimetres long.  The leaves of most species have serrated edges, but a few, such as ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'', do not.  Leaves are usually arranged along the branches in irregular spirals, but in some species they are crowded together in [[Whorl (botany)|whorls]]. Many species have differing juvenile and adult leaves (e.g., ''Banksia integrifolia'' has large serrated juvenile leaves).\n\nThe flowers are arranged in flower spikes or capitate flower heads.{{sfn|George|1999|p=175}} The character most commonly associated with ''Banksia'' is the flower spike, an elongated [[inflorescence]] consisting of a woody axis covered in tightly-packed pairs of flowers attached at right angles. A single flower spike generally contains hundreds or even thousands of flowers; the most recorded is around 6000 on inflorescences of ''[[Banksia grandis|B.&nbsp;grandis]]''. Not all ''Banksia'' have an elongate flower spike, however: the members of the small ''[[Banksia subg. Isostylis|Isostylis]]'' complex have long been recognised as ''Banksia''s in which the flower spike has been reduced to a head; and recently the large genus ''Dryandra'' has been found to have arisen from within the ranks of ''Banksia'', and sunk into it as [[Banksia ser. Dryandra|''B.''&nbsp;ser. ''Dryandra'']]. They similarly have capitate flower heads rather than spikes.\n\n[[File:Banksia marginata immature and mature.jpg|thumb|''[[Banksia marginata|B.&nbsp;marginata]]'' flower spike before and after [[anthesis]]]]\n''Banksia'' flowers are usually a shade of [[yellow]], but [[Orange (colour)|orange]], [[red]], [[pink]] and even [[violet (color)|violet]] flowers also occur.  The colour of the flowers is determined by the colour of the [[perianth]] parts and often the [[carpel|style]].  The style is much longer than the perianth, and is initially trapped by the upper perianth parts.  These are gradually released over a period of days, either from top to bottom or from bottom to top.  When the styles and perianth parts are different colours, the visual effect is of a colour change sweeping along the spike. This can be most spectacular in ''[[Banksia prionotes|B.&nbsp;prionotes]]'' (acorn banksia) and related species, as the white inflorescence in bud becomes a brilliant orange. In most cases, the individual flowers are tall, thin saccate (sack-shaped) in shape.\n\n[[File:Banksia Marginata Seed.jpg|thumb|left|[[Seed separator]] of a silver banksia (''[[Banksia marginata]]'') with winged seeds still cohering]]\nOccasionally, multiple flower spikes can form. This is most often seen in ''[[Banksia marginata]]'' and ''[[Banksia ericifolia|B. ericifolia]]''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=S |year=1992 |title=Multiple Flower Heads |journal=Banksia Study Report |volume=9 |page=58}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Blake |first=T |year=1988 |title=Multiple Heads |journal=Banksia Study Report |volume=8 |page=2}}</ref> ''(pictured right)''.\n\n[[File:Banksia integrifolia and marginata cones.jpg|thumb|Infructescence of ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B.&nbsp;integrifolia]]'', with non-persistent flowers; and ''[[Banksia marginata|B.&nbsp;marginata]]'', with persistent flowers]]\nAs the flower spikes or heads age, the flower parts dry up and may turn shades of orange, tan or dark brown colour, before fading to grey over a period of years.  In some species, old flower parts are lost, revealing the axis; in others, the old flower parts may persist for many years, giving the fruiting structure a hairy appearance.  Old flower spikes are commonly referred to as \"cones\", although they are not technically cones according to the botanical definition of the term: [[Conifer cone|cones]] only occur in [[conifer]]s and [[cycad]]s.\n\nDespite the large number of flowers per inflorescence, only a few of them ever develop fruit, and in some species a flower spike will set no fruit at all.  The fruit of ''Banksia'' is a woody [[Follicle (fruit)|follicle]] embedded in the axis of the inflorescence.  In many species, the resulting structure is a massive woody structure commonly called a cone.  Each follicle consists of two horizontal valves that tightly enclose the seeds.  The follicle opens to release the seed by splitting along the suture, and in some species each valve splits too.  In some species the follicles open as soon as the seed is mature, but in most species most follicles open only after stimulated to do so by [[bushfire]].  Each follicle usually contains one or two small seeds, each with a wedge-shaped papery wing that causes it to spin as it falls to the ground.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{main|Taxonomy of Banksia}}\nSpecimens of ''Banksia'' were first collected by [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander|Dr Daniel Solander]], naturalists on the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' during Lieutenant (later Captain) [[James Cook]]'s first voyage to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Cook landed on Australian soil for the first time on 29 April 1770, at a place that he later named [[Botany Bay]] in recognition of \"the great quantity of plants Mr Banks and Dr Solander found in this place\".<ref name=\"Wharton 1893\">{{cite book | author = Cook, James | year = 1893 | editor = William J.

Four species were present in this first collection: ''[[Banksia serrata|B.&nbsp;serrata]]'' (Saw Banksia), ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B.&nbsp;integrifolia]]'' (Coast Banksia), ''[[Banksia ericifolia|B.&nbsp;ericifolia]]'' (Heath-leaved Banksia) and ''[[Banksia robur|B.&nbsp;robur]]'' (Swamp Banksia). In June the ship was [[careening|careened]] at [[Endeavour River]], where specimens of ''[[Banksia dentata|B.&nbsp;dentata]]'' (Tropical Banksia) were collected.{{sfn|Wrigley|Fagg|1991|p=80}}\n\nThe genus ''Banksia'' was finally described and named by [[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]] in his April 1782 publication ''[[Supplementum Plantarum]]''; hence the [[Binomial nomenclature#Authorship in scientific names|full name]] for the genus is \"''Banksia'' L.f.\".

The name ''Banksia'' had in fact already been published in 1775 as ''Banksia'' [[Johann Reinhold Forster|J.R.Forst]] & [[Georg Forster|G.Forst]], referring to some [[New Zealand]] species that the Forsters had collected during Cook's second voyage. However Linnaeus incorrectly attributed the Forsters' specimens to the genus ''[[Passerina (plant)|Passerina]]'', and therefore considered the name ''Banksia'' available for use. By the time [[Joseph Gaertner]] corrected Banks' error in 1788, ''Banksia'' L.f. was widely known and accepted, so Gaertner [[nomen novum|renamed]] ''Banksia'' J.R.Forst & G.Forst to ''[[Pimelea]]'', a name previously chosen for the genus by Banks and Solander.<ref name=\"Salkin 1981\">{{cite journal | author = Salkin, Abraham Isaac (Alf) | year = 1981 | title = A Short History of the Discovery and Naming of Banksias in Eastern Australia: Part I, Banks & Solander | journal = Victorian Naturalist | volume = 98 | issue = 2}}</ref>\n\nThe first specimens of a ''Dryandra'' were collected by [[Archibald Menzies]], surgeon and naturalist to the [[Vancouver Expedition]]. At the request of [[Joseph Banks]], Menzies collected natural history specimens wherever possible during the voyage. During September and October 1791, while the expedition were anchored at [[King George Sound]], he collected numerous plant specimens, including the first specimens of ''[[Banksia sessilis|Dryandra&nbsp;(''now'' Banksia)&nbsp;sessilis]]'' (Parrotbush) and ''[[Banksia pellaeifolia|D.&nbsp;(''now'' Banksia)&nbsp;pellaeifolia]]''.

The exception is ''[[Banksia dentata|B.&nbsp;dentata]]'' (tropical banksia), which occurs throughout northern Australia, and on islands to the north including [[New Guinea]] and the [[Aru Islands Regency|Aru Islands]]. An extinct species, ''[[Banksia novae-zelandiae|B.&nbsp;novae-zelandiae]]'', was found in [[New Zealand]]. The other species occur in two distinct geographical regions: [[Southwest Australia|southwest]] [[Western Australia]] and eastern Australia.  Southwest Western Australia is the main centre of [[biodiversity]]; over 90% of all ''Banksia'' species occur only there, from [[Exmouth, Western Australia|Exmouth]] in the north, south and east to beyond [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]] on the south coast.  Eastern Australia has far fewer species, but these include some of best known and most widely distributed species, including ''[[Banksia integrifolia|B.&nbsp;integrifolia]]'' (coast banksia) and ''[[Banksia spinulosa|B.&nbsp;spinulosa]]'' (hairpin banksia). Here they occur from the [[Eyre Peninsula]] in South Australia right around the east coast up to [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in [[Queensland]].\n\nThe vast majority of ''Banksia'' are found in sandy or gravelly soils, though some populations of ''[[Banksia marginata|B.&nbsp;marginata]]'' (silver banksia) and ''B.&nbsp;spinulosa'' do occur on heavier, more clay-like, soils.  ''B.&nbsp;seminuda'' is exceptional for its preference for rich loams along watercourses.\n\nMost occur in [[Heath (habitat)|heathlands]] or low [[woodland]]s; of the eastern species, ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' and ''B.&nbsp;marginata'' occur in forests; many south-western species such as ''[[Banksia grandis|B.&nbsp;grandis]]'', [[Banksia sphaerocarpa|''B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa'']], ''[[Banksia sessilis|B.&nbsp;sessilis]]'', ''[[Banksia nobilis|B.&nbsp;nobilis]]'' and ''[[Banksia dellanneyi|B.&nbsp;dallanneyi]]'' grow as understorey plants in [[jarrah]] (''Eucalyptus marginata''), wandoo (''E. wandoo'') and [[Eucalyptus diversicolor|karri]] (''E. diversicolor'') [[forest]]s, with ''B.&nbsp;seminuda'' being one of the forest trees in suitable habitat.\n\nMost species do not grow well near the [[coast]], notable exceptions being the southern [[Western Australia]]n species [[Banksia speciosa|''B.&nbsp;speciosa'']], [[Banksia praemorsa|''B.&nbsp;praemorsa'']] and [[Banksia repens|''B.&nbsp;repens'']].  Only a few species, such as [[Banksia rosserae|''B.&nbsp;rosserae'']] and ''[[Banksia elderiana|B.&nbsp;elderiana]]'' (swordfish banksia), occur in [[desert|arid]] areas.  Most of the eastern Australian species survive in [[upland (geology)|uplands]], but only a few of the [[Western Australia]]n species native to the [[Stirling Range]]s \u2013 [[Banksia solandri|''B.&nbsp;solandri'']], [[Banksia oreophila|''B.&nbsp;oreophila'']], [[Banksia brownii|''B.&nbsp;brownii'']] and [[Banksia montana|''B.&nbsp;montana'']] \u2013 survive at high altitudes.\n\nStudies of the south-western species have found the distribution of ''Banksia'' species to be primarily constrained by rainfall. With the exception of ''B.&nbsp;rosserae'', no species tolerates annual rainfall of less than 200 millimetres, despite many species surviving in areas that receive less than 400 millimetres. ''Banksia'' species are present throughout the region of suitable rainfall, with greatest speciation in cooler, wetter areas. Hotter, drier regions around the edges of its range tend to have fewer species with larger distributions. The greatest species richness occurs in association with uplands, especially the Stirling Range.<ref name=\"Lamont 1996\">{{cite journal |last1=Lamont |first1=Byron |last2=Connell |first2=S.W. |title=Biogeography of Banksia in southwestern Australia |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=23 |issue=3 |year=1996 |pages=295\u2013309 |jstor=2845847 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1996.00027.x}}</ref>\n\n== Evolution and fossil record ==\nThere are many fossils of ''Banksia''.

These include [[Banksia brownii|''B.&nbsp;brownii'']] (Feather-leaved Banksia), [[Banksia cuneata|''B.&nbsp;cuneata'']] (Matchstick Banksia), [[Banksia goodii|''B.&nbsp;goodii'']] (Good's Banksia), [[Banksia oligantha|''B.&nbsp;oligantha'']] (Wagin Banksia), [[Banksia tricuspis|''B.&nbsp;tricuspis'']] (Pine Banksia), and [[Banksia verticillata|''B.&nbsp;verticillata'']] (Granite Banksia).\n\n===Response to fire===\n[[Image:Banksia prionotes response to fire Burma Rd email.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Banksia prionotes]]'' seedlings after fire, [[Burma Road Nature Reserve]], WA]]\n[[Image:Banksiaserrataseedlings29872323593 014d92e255 o.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Banksia serrata]]'' seedlings and cone after fire, [[Beacon Hill, New South Wales|Beacon Hill]], NSW]]\n''Banksia'' plants are naturally adapted to the presence of regular [[bushfire]]s in the Australian landscape. About half of ''Banksia'' species are killed by bushfire, but these regenerate quickly from seed, as fire also stimulates the opening of seed-bearing follicles and the germination of seed in the ground.  The remaining species usually survive bushfire, either by resprouting from a woody base known as a [[lignotuber]] or, more rarely, [[Epicormic shoot|epicormic buds]] protected by thick bark. In [[Western Australia]], ''banksias'' of the first group are known as 'seeders' and the second group as 'sprouters'.<ref name=\"Lamont 1995\">{{cite journal |last1=Lamont |first1=Byron B. | authorlink1=Byron Lamont |last2=Markey |first2=Adrienne |year=1995 |title=Biogeography of Fire-killed and Resprouting ''Banksia'' Species in South-western Australia |journal=Australian Journal of Botany |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=283\u2013303 |doi=10.1071/BT9950283}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Banksia attenuata response to fire Burma Rd email.jpg|thumb|''[[Banksia attenuata]]'' resprouting after fire, Burma Road Nature Reserve, WA]]\nInfrequent bushfires at expected intervals pose no threat, and are in fact beneficial for regeneration of ''banksia'' populations. However, too frequent bushfires can seriously reduce or even eliminate populations from certain areas, by killing seedlings and young plants before they reach fruiting age.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wooller |first1=S.

Furthermore, residents who live in areas near bushland may pressure local councils to burn areas near homes more frequently, to reduce fuel-load in the bush and thus reduce ferocity of future fires. Unfortunately there are often discrepancies in agreed frequency between these groups and conservation groups.\n\n===Dieback===\nAnother threat to ''Banksia'' is the [[water mould]] ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'', commonly known as \"dieback\". Dieback attacks the roots of plants, destroying the structure of the root tissues, \"rotting\" the root, and preventing the plant from absorbing water and nutrients. ''Banksia'''s [[proteoid root]]s, which help it to survive in low-nutrient soils, make it highly susceptible to this [[disease]]. All Western Australian species are vulnerable, although most eastern species are fairly resistant.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mccredie |first1=TA |last2=Dixon |first2=KW |last3=Sivasithamparam |first3=K |title=Variability in the Resistance of Banksia L.f.

In [[southwest Australia|southwest]] Western Australia, where dieback infestation is widespread, infested areas of ''Banksia'' forest typically have less than 30% of the cover of uninfested areas. Plant deaths in such large proportions can have a profound influence on the makeup of plant communities. For example, in southwestern Australia ''Banksia'' often occurs as an understorey to forests of [[Jarrah]] (''Eucalyptus marginata''), another species highly vulnerable to dieback. Infestation kills both the Jarrah overstorey and the original ''Banksia'' understorey, and over time these may be replaced by a more open woodland consisting of an overstorey of the resistant Marri (''[[Corymbia calophylla]]''), and an understorey of the somewhat resistant ''[[Banksia sessilis]]'' (Parrotbush).<ref name=\"Impact of Dieback\">{{cite web| title=Impacts in WA| work=Managing Dieback| url=http://www.naturebase.net/content/view/213/548/1/2/| publisher=[[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)]]| accessdate=2007-02-21| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903013916/http://www.naturebase.net/content/view/213/548/1/2/| archive-date=3 September 2007| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA number of species of ''Banksia'' are threatened by dieback.

''monticola'']] notable for reaching the biggest banksias and it is the most frost tolerant in this genus, ''[[Banksia seminuda|B.&nbsp;seminuda]]'', ''[[Banksia littoralis|B.&nbsp;littoralis]]'', ''[[Banksia serrata|B.&nbsp;serrata]]''; species that can grow as small trees or big shrubs: ''[[Banksia grandis|B.&nbsp;grandis]]'', ''[[Banksia prionotes|B.&nbsp;prionotes]]'', ''[[Banksia marginata|B.&nbsp;marginata]]'', ''[[Banksia coccinea|B.&nbsp;coccinea]]'', ''[[Banksia speciosa|B.&nbsp;speciosa]]'' and ''[[Banksia menziesii|B.&nbsp;menziesii]]''. Due to their size these species are popularly planted in parks, gardens and streets, the remaining species in this genus are only shrubs.\n\n''Banksia''s are popular garden plants in Australia because of their large, showy flower heads, and because the large amounts of [[nectar]] they produce attracts [[birds]] and small [[mammal]]s.  Popular garden species include ''B.&nbsp;spinulosa'', ''B.&nbsp;ericifolia'', [[Banksia aemula|''B.&nbsp;aemula'']] (Wallum Banksia ), [[Banksia serrata|''B.&nbsp;serrata'']] (Saw Banksia), ''[[Banksia media]]'' (Southern Plains Banksia) and the [[cultivar]] [[Banksia 'Giant Candles'|''Banksia'' 'Giant Candles']].  ''Banksia'' species are primarily propagated by seed in the home garden as cuttings can be difficult to strike. However commercial nurserymen extensively utilize the latter method (indeed, cultivars by nature must be vegetatively propagated by cuttings or grafting).\n\nOver time, dwarf cultivars and prostrate species are becoming more popular as urban gardens grow ever smaller. These include miniature forms under 50&nbsp;cm high of ''B.&nbsp;spinulosa'' and ''B.&nbsp;media'', as well as prostrate species such as ''[[Banksia petiolaris|B.&nbsp;petiolaris]]'' and ''[[Banksia blechnifolia|B.&nbsp;blechnifolia]]'' .\n\n''Banksia''s possibly require more maintenance than other Australian natives, though are fairly hardy if the right conditions are provided (sunny aspect and well drained sandy soil).\nThey may need extra water during dry spells until established, which can take up to two years.  If fertilised, only slow-release, low-[[phosphorus]] [[fertilizer]] should be used, as the [[proteoid roots]] may be damaged by high [[nutrient]] levels in the soil. All respond well to some form of pruning.\n\nWithin the Australian horticultural community there is an active subculture of ''Banksia'' enthusiasts who seek out interesting flower variants, breed and propagate cultivars, exchange materials and undertake research into cultivation problems and challenges. The main forum for exchange of information within this group is [[ASGAP]]'s ''Banksia Study Group''.{{sfn|Collins|Collins|2008|p=83}}\n\n===Cut flower industry===\nWith the exception of the [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] [[industry]], ''Banksia'' have limited commercial use.

The study mobilised over 400 volunteers, collecting over 25,000 field observations over a two-year period. Outcomes included the discovery of two new species, as well as new varieties and some rare colour variants, and discoveries of previously unknown populations of rare and threatened species.
