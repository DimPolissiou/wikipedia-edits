The population was 10,310 at the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]]. It is one of three cities in the county.\n\n== History ==\nThis area is known to have been populated by the Hopewell Indians through the first century CE. They built large earthworks, including ancient burial mounds which are now preserved within Moundbuilders State Memorial on the north side of the city.\n\n[[File:A Mound in the Great Circle Earthworks, Heath.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A mound in the Great Circle Earthworks]]\n[[File:Newark Works Squier and Davis Plate XXV.jpg|thumb|left|150px|19th-century plan of the Works]]\n\nThis also has the Great Circle Earthwork, considered part of the [[Newark Earthworks]], which has two other sections within the boundaries of nearby [[Newark, Ohio]]. The complex originally covered more than 3,000 acres, and was surveyed before 1850 by a team for the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The {{convert|1054|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide Newark Great Circle is one of the largest circular earthwork in the [[Americas]], at least in construction effort. A {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} deep moat is encompassed by walls that are {{convert|8|ft|m}} high; at the entrance, the dimensions are even more grand.<ref name=OhioHistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/museum-and-site-locator/newark-earthworks|title=History|website=Ohio History Connection|date=2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Newark Earthworks is operated as a state park by the [[Ohio Historical Society|Ohio History Connection]].  Designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]], in 2006 the Newark Earthworks was also designated as the \"official prehistoric monument of the State of Ohio.\"<ref name=\"Ohio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2753 |title=Wright Earthworks \u2013 Ohio History Central \u2013 A product of the Ohio Historical Society |publisher=Ohio History Central |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===European-American settlement===\nEarly European-American settlement did not take place until the nineteenth century. Much of the county was originally devoted to agriculture. In the process of clearing and cultivating land, farmers destroyed some of the earthworks in the 19th and 20th centuries. Other development also encroached on the ancient works.\n\nAfter World War II, [[Newark Air Force Base]] was established here, and it operated for 35 years as the seat of [[United States Air Force]] Aerospace Guidance and [[Metrology]] Center. This function is now served by AFMETCAL and the contractor-operated Air Force Primary Standards Lab.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robins.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=8361 |title=562D |accessdate=2008-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107130215/http://www.robins.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=8361 |archive-date=2007-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHeath was incorporated as a village in 1952, with Richard Hoback being elected as the first mayor. Over the next decade Heath grew quickly, going from a population of 2,426 in 1960 to 6,066 in 1965, when it was chartered as the 196th city in Ohio. It is one of three in the county.\n\nIn 1986 [[Indian Mound Mall]] opened here, the first and only indoor shopping mall in Licking County. By 1990 the city had a population of 7,231.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heathohio.gov/Government/Community/History/HeathTimeLine.pdf |title=Heath Timeline |accessdate=2009-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721041339/http://www.heathohio.gov/Government/Community/History/HeathTimeLine.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> Despite the large population growth on the western edge of Licking County, Heath remains the third-largest municipality in the county, and one of only three cities. Other residential areas nearby include Newark, Granville, and Hebron.\n\n==Economy==\nBusinesses related to Air Force metrology continue to be important in Heath. Major employers include the following:\n\n\u2022American Electric Power, electric power services.\n\u2022Bayer Material Science, compounded plastics services. \n\u2022Bionetics, metrology calibration and measurement services.\n\u2022Boeing Guidance Repair Center, guidance and navigation system repair services. \n\u2022Central Ohio Aerospace and Technology Center (COATC) Base Campus.\n\u2022Englefield Oil Co., Inc. company headquarters.\n\u2022Gummer Wholesale, warehouse.\n\u2022Heath City School District, education. \n\u2022Heath Nursing Care Center, skilled nursing facility.\n\u2022Kaiser Aluminum, manufacturing service. \n\u2022Licco Inc., sheltered workshop. \n\u2022Lowe's Home Improvements.\n\n== Government ==\nThe City of Heath has an elected mayor and seven-member city council: four members are elected [[at-large]], and three from each of three designated wards of the city, operating as [[single-member district]]s. This means that most members must gain a majority of votes across the city.\n\nThe council members include Deb Cole, At-Large; Jeff Crabill, At-Large; Tim Kelley, President At-Large; Brian Johnson, Ward 1; Dick Morrow, Ward 2; Doug Heffley, Ward 3; and Cledys Henry, President Pro Tem.

David Haren serves as Chief of Heath Police Department. The police respond to around 16,000 calls annually.\n\nThe city has a municipal income tax of 2.0%.\n\n==Recreation==\nIn 2002 Heath celebrated 50 years since it was established. The city hosts an annual Oktoberfest celebration at the Davis-Shai House. An Independence Day celebration takes place at Geller Park on July 2, which includes food, games, live bands, and a fireworks show starting at dark.\n\nThe city has 10 parks and recreation areas that are maintained by the Parks and Recreation Department. These include Heath City Waterpark, Geller Park, Beryl Dean Penick Park, Canal Lock Park, Davis Shai House, Dorsey Mill Park, Forry Preserve, Hitchcock Park, and Hoback Park. It also has a Bike Trail System that extends throughout the city.\n\nFrom July 2011 to fall of 2012, the city had a major construction project on Route 79. The shoulders of the street were widened to accommodate the project. The city added medians to the middle of the road that included mulch with trees and flowers. Left turns and U-turns were added to southbound traffic at the intersection of Andover Road and Oberlin Drive, and Northbound and Southbound traffic at the intersection of Putnam Road and Radian Drive.\n\n==Civic activities==\nHeath offers numerous service clubs and organizations for those interested including: 211 Pathways, American Legion (Post 771), Boy Scouts troop (#9), Civil Air Patrol, Cub Scouts Pack (#9), Heath Girl Scouts, Heath Kiwanis, LaSertoma, Heath Lions, Marine Corps League, Mental Health America, Prevent Assault and Violence Education (P.A.V.E.), Newark-Heath Rotary, and Heath Sertoma.\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathohio.gov/|title=City of Heath Ohio}}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nHeath City Schools operates four schools in its public school district. \n* [[Heath High School (Ohio)|Heath High School]] (9-12)\n* Heath Middle School (6-8)\n* Stevenson Elementary School (3-5)\n* Garfield Elementary School (K-2)\n* Fulton Middle School (Closed, later demolished)\n\nHeath also has two private, independent schools. \n* Licking County Christian Academy (K-12)\n* Newark Seventh Day Adventist (K-7)\n\n==Geography==\nHeath is located at {{coord|40|1|55|N|82|26|8|W|type:city}} (40.032047, -82.435652).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.00|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|10.92|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.08|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archive-date=2012-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1960= 2426\n|1970= 6768\n|1980= 6969\n|1990= 7231\n|2000= 8527\n|2010= 10310\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=10861\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 10,310 people, 4,131 households, and 2,772 families residing in the city.

The population was 10,310 at the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]]. It is one of three cities in the county.\n\n== History ==\nThis area is known to have been populated by the Hopewell Indians through the first century CE. They built large earthworks, including ancient burial mounds which are now preserved within Moundbuilders State Memorial on the north side of the city.\n\n[[File:A Mound in the Great Circle Earthworks, Heath.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A mound in the Great Circle Earthworks]]\n[[File:Newark Works Squier and Davis Plate XXV.jpg|thumb|left|150px|19th-century plan of the Works]]\n\nThis also has the Great Circle Earthwork, considered part of the [[Newark Earthworks]], which has two other sections within the boundaries of nearby [[Newark, Ohio]]. The complex originally covered more than 3,000 acres, and was surveyed before 1850 by a team for the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The {{convert|1054|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide Newark Great Circle is one of the largest circular earthwork in the [[Americas]], at least in construction effort. A {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} deep moat is encompassed by walls that are {{convert|8|ft|m}} high; at the entrance, the dimensions are even more grand.<ref name=OhioHistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/museum-and-site-locator/newark-earthworks|title=History|website=Ohio History Connection|date=2016|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Newark Earthworks is operated as a state park by the [[Ohio Historical Society|Ohio History Connection]].  Designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]], in 2006 the Newark Earthworks was also designated as the \"official prehistoric monument of the State of Ohio.\"<ref name=\"Ohio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2753 |title=Wright Earthworks \u2013 Ohio History Central \u2013 A product of the Ohio Historical Society |publisher=Ohio History Central |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===European-American settlement===\nEarly European-American settlement did not take place until the nineteenth century. Much of the county was originally devoted to agriculture. In the process of clearing and cultivating land, farmers destroyed some of the earthworks in the 19th and 20th centuries. Other development also encroached on the ancient works.\n\nAfter World War II, [[Newark Air Force Base]] was established here, and it operated for 35 years as the seat of [[United States Air Force]] Aerospace Guidance and [[Metrology]] Center. This function is now served by AFMETCAL and the contractor-operated Air Force Primary Standards Lab.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robins.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=8361 |title=562D |accessdate=2008-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107130215/http://www.robins.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=8361 |archive-date=2007-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHeath was incorporated as a village in 1952, with Richard Hoback being elected as the first mayor. Over the next decade Heath grew quickly, going from a population of 2,426 in 1960 to 6,066 in 1965, when it was chartered as the 196th city in Ohio. It is one of three in the county.\n\nIn 1986 [[Indian Mound Mall]] opened here, the first and only indoor shopping mall in Licking County. By 1990 the city had a population of 7,231.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heathohio.gov/Government/Community/History/HeathTimeLine.pdf |title=Heath Timeline |accessdate=2009-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721041339/http://www.heathohio.gov/Government/Community/History/HeathTimeLine.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> Despite the large population growth on the western edge of Licking County, Heath remains the third-largest municipality in the county, and one of only three cities. Other residential areas nearby include Newark, Granville, and Hebron.\n\n==Economy==\nBusinesses related to Air Force metrology continue to be important in Heath. Major employers include the following:\n\n\u2022American Electric Power, electric power services.\n\u2022Bayer Material Science, compounded plastics services. \n\u2022Bionetics, metrology calibration and measurement services.\n\u2022Boeing Guidance Repair Center, guidance and navigation system repair services. \n\u2022Central Ohio Aerospace and Technology Center (COATC) Base Campus.\n\u2022Englefield Oil Co., Inc. company headquarters.\n\u2022Gummer Wholesale, warehouse.\n\u2022Heath City School District, education. \n\u2022Heath Nursing Care Center, skilled nursing facility.\n\u2022Kaiser Aluminum, manufacturing service. \n\u2022Licco Inc., sheltered workshop. \n\u2022Lowe\u2019s Home Improvements.\n\n== Government ==\nThe City of Heath has an elected mayor and seven-member city council: four members are elected [[at-large]], and three from each of three designated wards of the city, operating as [[single-member district]]s. This means that most members must gain a majority of votes across the city.\n\nThe council members include Deb Cole, At-Large; Jeff Crabill, At-Large; Tim Kelley, President At-Large; Brian Johnson, Ward 1; Dick Morrow, Ward 2; Doug Heffley, Ward 3; and Cledys Henry, President Pro Tem.

David Haren serves as Chief of Heath Police Department. The police respond to around 16,000 calls annually.\n\nThe city has a municipal income tax of 2.0%.\n\n==Recreation==\nIn 2002 Heath celebrated 50 years since it was established. The city hosts an annual Oktoberfest celebration at the Davis-Shai House. An Independence Day celebration takes place at Geller Park on July 2, which includes food, games, live bands, and a fireworks show starting at dark.\n\nThe city has 10 parks and recreation areas that are maintained by the Parks and Recreation Department. These include Heath City Waterpark, Geller Park, Beryl Dean Penick Park, Canal Lock Park, Davis Shai House, Dorsey Mill Park, Forry Preserve, Hitchcock Park, and Hoback Park. It also has a Bike Trail System that extends throughout the city.\n\nFrom July 2011 to fall of 2012, the city had a major construction project on Route 79. The shoulders of the street were widened to accommodate the project. The city added medians to the middle of the road that included mulch with trees and flowers. Left turns and U-turns were added to southbound traffic at the intersection of Andover Road and Oberlin Drive, and Northbound and Southbound traffic at the intersection of Putnam Road and Radian Drive.\n\n==Civic activities==\nHeath offers numerous service clubs and organizations for those interested including: 211 Pathways, American Legion (Post 771), Boy Scouts troop (#9), Civil Air Patrol, Cub Scouts Pack (#9), Heath Girl Scouts, Heath Kiwanis, LaSertoma, Heath Lions, Marine Corps League, Mental Health America, Prevent Assault and Violence Education (P.A.V.E.), Newark-Heath Rotary, and Heath Sertoma.\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathohio.gov/|title=City of Heath Ohio}}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nHeath City Schools operates four schools in its public school district. \n* [[Heath High School (Ohio)|Heath High School]] (9-12)\n* Heath Middle School (6-8)\n* Stevenson Elementary School (3-5)\n* Garfield Elementary School (K-2)\n* Fulton Middle School (Closed, later demolished)\n\nHeath also has two private, independent schools. \n* Licking County Christian Academy (K-12)\n* Newark Seventh Day Adventist (K-7)\n\n==Geography==\nHeath is located at {{coord|40|1|55|N|82|26|8|W|type:city}} (40.032047, -82.435652).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.00|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|10.92|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.08|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archive-date=2012-01-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1960= 2426\n|1970= 6768\n|1980= 6969\n|1990= 7231\n|2000= 8527\n|2010= 10310\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=10861\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 10,310 people, 4,131 households, and 2,772 families residing in the city.

He was one of five sons, the others being: [[Henry Lindsay, 13th Earl of Crawford|Sir Henry Lindsay of Kinfauns]], to be the thirteenth earl; Sir John of Ballinscho; [[Alexander Lindsay, 1st Lord Spynie]]; and James. The 10th earl had also a daughter, Helen, married to [[Sir David Lindsay, Lord Edzell]].{{sfn|Henderson|1893|p=295}}\n\nThe 11th earl had a reputation for extravagance, was francophile, and of uncertain religious views. On 17 March 1577\u20138 he became involved in an affray which resulted in the death of his hereditary enemy, the [[John Lyon, 8th Lord Glamis|Lord-chancellor Glamis]]. The two lords being in attendance on the king at [[Stirling]] happened, with their followers, to meet; they made way for each other, and ordered their followers to do the same, but the hindmost came to blows. In the fray the chancellor was shot dead, and the blame of the murder was assigned by many to Crawford. [[David Hume of Godscroft]] wrote that Crawford was a good shot and Glamis presented an easy target as he was so tall.<ref>David Reid, ed, ''History of the House of Angus'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 2005), pp. 242-3.</ref>\n\nCrawford was sent a prisoner to [[Edinburgh Castle]], but on 14 June was permitted to pass to his house at [[Cairnie]] in [[Fife]] on giving sureties again to enter into ward on fifteen days' notice. For his failure to act on this arrangement on 5 March 1579, his sureties, David Lindsay of Edzell and [[Patrick Lindsay, 6th Lord Lindsay]] were fined, and on 1 September they gave caution in \u00a320,000 for his appearance at the [[Old Tolbooth|Tolbooth of Edinburgh]] on 3 November. According to [[Sir James Balfour, 1st Baronet|Sir James Balfour]], he was found innocent; and on 5 November he signed a band, under pain of \u00a310,000, not to molest [[Thomas Lyon (of Auldbar)|Thomas Lyon of Balduckie]], Master of Glamis, and tutor or guardian of the young heir, [[Patrick Lyon, 1st Earl of Kinghorne|Patrick Lyon, 9th Lord Glamis]].{{sfn|Henderson|1893|p=295}}\n\nNot long afterwards the earl went over to France in company with [[George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly]], having on 7 December obtained a license to go abroad for three years. He returned to Scotland before the last day of February 1581, when he renewed the band for the non-molestation of the tutor of Glamis.{{sfn|Henderson|1893|pp=295&ndash;296}}\n\n==Ruthven==\nCrawford was one of those who, in 1582, assembled at [[St Andrews]] in support of the king after his [[raid of Ruthven|escape from Ruthven]]. Shortly afterwards he was chosen master stabler to the king, and, against the wishes of the inhabitants of [[Dundee]], was made provost of the town. On the [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|Earl of Arran]]'s return to power in August of this year he became one of his main supporters, and at the parliament held on the 22nd, he carried the sword. He was one of those who, on 14 November, convoyed the young [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]] from [[Leith]] where he had landed from France, to the king at [[Kinneil House#Early history|Kinneil]].

He was one of five sons, the others being: [[Henry Lindsay, 13th Earl of Crawford|Sir Henry Lindsay of Kinfauns]], to be the thirteenth earl; Sir John of Ballinscho; [[Alexander Lindsay, 1st Lord Spynie]]; and James. The 10th earl had also a daughter, Helen, married to [[Sir David Lindsay, Lord Edzell]].{{sfn|Henderson|1893|p=295}}\n\nThe 11th earl had a reputation for extravagance, was francophile, and of uncertain religious views. On 17 March 1577\u20138 he became involved in an affray which resulted in the death of his hereditary enemy, the [[John Lyon, 8th Lord Glamis|Lord-chancellor Glamis]]. The two lords being in attendance on the king at [[Stirling]] happened, with their followers, to meet; they made way for each other, and ordered their followers to do the same, but the hindmost came to blows. In the fray the chancellor was shot dead, and the blame of the murder was assigned by many to Crawford. [[David Hume of Godscroft]] wrote that Crawford was a good shot and Glamis presented an easy target as he was so tall.<ref>David Reid, ed, ''History of the House of Angus'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 2005), pp. 242-3.</ref>\n\nCrawford was sent a prisoner to [[Edinburgh Castle]], but on 14 June was permitted to pass to his house at [[Cairnie]] in [[Fife]] on giving sureties again to enter into ward on fifteen days' notice. For his failure to act on this arrangement on 5 March 1579, his sureties, David Lindsay of Edzell and [[Patrick Lindsay, 6th Lord Lindsay of the Byres]] were fined, and on 1 September they gave caution in \u00a320,000 for his appearance at the [[Old Tolbooth|Tolbooth of Edinburgh]] on 3 November. According to [[Sir James Balfour, 1st Baronet|Sir James Balfour]], he was found innocent; and on 5 November he signed a band, under pain of \u00a310,000, not to molest [[Thomas Lyon (of Auldbar)|Thomas Lyon of Balduckie]], Master of Glamis, and tutor or guardian of the young heir, [[Patrick Lyon, 1st Earl of Kinghorne|Patrick Lyon, 9th Lord Glamis]].{{sfn|Henderson|1893|p=295}}\n\nNot long afterwards the earl went over to France in company with [[George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly]], having on 7 December obtained a license to go abroad for three years. He returned to Scotland before the last day of February 1581, when he renewed the band for the non-molestation of the tutor of Glamis.{{sfn|Henderson|1893|pp=295&ndash;296}}\n\n==Ruthven==\nCrawford was one of those who, in 1582, assembled at [[St Andrews]] in support of the king after his [[raid of Ruthven|escape from Ruthven]]. Shortly afterwards he was chosen master stabler to the king, and, against the wishes of the inhabitants of [[Dundee]], was made provost of the town. On the [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|Earl of Arran]]'s return to power in August of this year he became one of his main supporters, and at the parliament held on the 22nd, he carried the sword. He was one of those who, on 14 November, convoyed the young [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]] from [[Leith]] where he had landed from France, to the king at [[Kinneil House#Early history|Kinneil]]. He took part in the trial of [[William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie]] in May 1584, and after the earl's forfeiture, received from the king the barony and regality of Scone and the church lands of [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]].
